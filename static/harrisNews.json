A second appeared shortly after the first was ushered out, and shouted for several minutes until he also was removed, crying out \"Free Palestine\" as he was led past the press cordon. In response, Harris said, \"I respect your voice, but right now, I am speaking,\" before moving on with the rest of her address over the interjector’s din. PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: ‘WHAT ABOUT HAMAS?' Harris had been introduced by Mary Grace, a local nurse who said she was a longtime Republican who could not support former President Trump. After thanking Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa., Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Wilkes-Barre Democratic mayor George Brown, all of whom preceded her remarks, she began the crux of her remarks by referencing the ABC News debate from earlier in the week. \"I take it many people here watched it,\" she said, as the reference drew applause. \"You’ll remember that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom. And keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page.\" Harris claimed Trump will give billionaires and large corporations \"massive\" tax cuts while also taking a scalpel to entitlements. She also said the Republican wants to impose a \"Trump sales tax,\" which some observers claim to be a reference to the former president’s foreign tariff plans. DE NIRO, DE BLASIO HEADLINE ‘PAISANS FOR KAMALA’ RED-SAUCE DINNER LIVESTREAM EVENT Harris also spoke about national division, saying \"we are not going back\" to past years, and instead called for a \"new way forward.\" \"We need a President of the United States who works for all the American people and that just stops with all the trying to divide us,\" she said. \"People are exhausted with that stuff.\" She also called herself the \"underdog\" in the race, predicting it will be tight in the crucial Commonwealth in which she spoke. \"So Pennsylvania, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom?\" Harris asked Making the trek north on I-81 from Harrisburg, Shapiro – who many believed was the proverbial runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Harris’ running mate consideration – offered a booming endorsement shortly before the candidate came onstage. \"We have proved … that we can ‘get sh—done’!\" Shapiro shouted, referencing his gubernatorial administration’s edgy slogan of sorts. \"[We’ve invested] a historic amount in our public schools… when those kids go to and from schools, they deserve to live in safe communities,\" he added. \"We want everyone to know that you are valued here, whether you choose to be a lawyer or a laborer, we want you to know you belong here [in Pennsylvania].\" \"Where you come from, who you love, and who you pray to – you belong and I got your back,\" Shapiro went on, adding Harris’ campaign offers a similar vision. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"She and I have both been prosecutors,\" said Shapiro, who served as the separately-elected attorney general during the governorship of predecessor Tom Wolf. \"Kamala Harris has always been for the people... She stood up for our union sisters and brothers. This time borrowing a line instead from Harris, Shapiro added of Trump’s tenure in the White House, \"we are not going back to that.\" \"When you go back and look at his record, it was … less jobs and a whole lot less freedom when Donald Trump was in charge,\" he said, invoking the abortion issue and claiming women lost \"basic freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.\" Shapiro went on to point to Philadelphia, just 100 miles on the other end of the Northeast Extension from where he spoke, saying that Americans \"declared our independence from a king [there, once] and we are not going back.\" In response to Harris visiting the Commonwealth, PA Trump Team spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital that Pennsylvanians are fed up with the rising costs of groceries, gas, and utilities thanks to the Harris-Biden administration’s disastrous inflationary, anti-energy agenda.\" \"The choice between another four years of retirees scraping by off ramen under Kamala or a return to the peace, prosperity, and stability of the Trump administration couldn’t be easier for Pennsylvanians.\" At the debate in Philadelphia, Harris made reference to the approximate 800,000 Polish-Americans who reside in Pennsylvania. Outside Port Richmond and the Philadelphia area, the counties in and around where Harris rallied Friday have a sizeable such population. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County, about one-sixth of the population is Polish American, and cities like Nanticoke, Hazleton and Shamokin – in nearby Northumberland County – also host sizable communities. In that regard, when asked, Desai said Trump is an \"especially easy choice\" for Pennsylvania's Polish-Americans, noting his \"blossoming friendship\" with Polish President Andrzej Duda and his work with Warsaw to build a stronger alliance, including within their shared NATO status. At the debate, Harris appeared to draw a connection between the Polish-American electorate and her criticisms of how Trump would end the war in Ukraine – which borders Poland: \"Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,\" Harris said, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.","summary":"At a rally at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about her debate performance, abortion, and other issues.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-interrupted-multiple-times-pro-palestinian-protesters-she-rallies-wilkes-barre-pennsylvania","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/0fbfea74-GettyImages-2170586246.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 00:46:43","author":"Charles Creitz","authors":["Charles Creitz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":256378886,"title":"Pope Francis on US election: 'Both Trump and Harris are against life, choose the lesser of two evils'","text":"Pope Francis waded into the US presidential election debate on Friday, offering a pointed critique of both candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, labeling them as \"against life.\" During a press conference aboard his plane returning to Rome after a 12-day tour of Asia, the pontiff criticized Trump's immigration policies and Harris's stance on abortion.\"Both are against life.

The report came after the daily and other outlets indicated last week the White House was set to take action to stymie the deal. The controversial takeover plan has drawn opposition from Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is his successor as the Democratic nominee, as well as from former President Donald Trump, her Republican rival in the race. Quoting unnamed sources, the newspaper in the U.S. capital said that after vocal opposition to the possible blockage of the business deal, White House officials have now indicated that \"such a decision is unlikely in the short term and may not be made\" until after the presidential election. Biden remains opposed to the buyout, but \"the pace of internal deliberations has slowed,\" the report said. Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-largest producer, and U.S. Steel, the 24th-largest, announced the $14.1 billion acquisition deal in December. U.S. Steel and its shareholders are in favor of the takeover, which would make it more competitive globally. But the powerful United Steelworkers union is strongly opposed to the deal, dragging the two companies into political controversy.

She answered five questions from Action News 6 ABC, a local affiliate of ABC News, in the interview that came just days after the moderators in the ABC debate with Donald Trump assisted her by providing fact checks on the former president but not her. One of the ABC moderators for the debate, Linsey Davis, is a member of Harris’ sorority and Dana Walden, a Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC, is one of the vice president’s close friends. Action News 6 ABC anchor Brian Taff asked Harris, 59, what she would specifically do to bring down prices as president. “Well, I’ll start with this. I grew up as a middle class kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard,” she began, before going on about her neighborhood where people “were proud of their lawn.” “We as Americans have beautiful character. We have ambitions and aspirations and dreams. But not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions,” Harris went on. She did not say how she would bring prices down but did highlight her proposed policy to give a $25,000 handout to new homeowners and giving tax breaks to new small businesses. Harris also said she is “obviously not Joe Biden” because she offers an “opportunity economy” and “a new generation of leadership.” “So, for example, thinking about developing and creating an opportunity economy where it’s about investing in areas that really need a lot of work,” she said, seemingly looking to find words. The veep said she was not going take “anyone’s guns away” and that she supports the Second Amendment, but will ban “assault weapons” and “universal background checks.” “They’re literally tools of war,” Harris said. On what she thinks Trump’s appeal is to voters, Harris again took a few sentences to get to the core of the question. “I, uh, based on experience and, uh, and, a lived experience know in my heart, I know in my soul, I know that the vast majority of Americans have in common so much more than what separates us,” she said. “And I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other,” she said of Trump, arguing voters want someone with “common sense.” “I think people are more willing now in light of the hate and division that we see coming out of Donald Trump to say, ‘Hey, let’s put country first.'” Taff finally asked Harris if there was anything she wanted voters to know about her. “I don’t know. I mean, probably it’s not very different from anybody watching right now. I love my family, um, one of my favorite things that I lately have not been able to do is Sunday family dinner. I love to cook. I have incredible friends,” Harris said. “I have a career that really, and I said it the other day, you know, as a career prosecutor, I never asked a victim of crime where they were a Republican or a Democrat. The only thing I ever asked them was, ‘Are you OK?'” she said, arguing she thinks most Americans want that approach. Harris has avoided the press for the majority of her time as the Democratic nominee. She did her first debate over a month after replacing President Biden, 81, in the race with CNN alongside her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. She then appeared on two local radio shows before debuting on the debate stage against Trump on Tuesday with ABC. Harris has been criticized for not allowing the press more access to her campaign as the race dwindles down to less than two months before Election Day.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with an ABC affiliate for her first solo interview Friday, choosing the same network that got her through this week's slanted presidential debate.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/13/us-news/kamala-harris-sticks-with-abc-for-first-solo-interview-since-slanted-debate-and-still-serves-up-word-salad/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/kamala-harris-sticks-abc-first-89615400.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 00:23:25","author":"Diana Glebova","authors":["Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.068},{"id":256378244,"title":"Allegations of eating cats increase hostility towards Haitian immigrants as Trump exacerbates tensions in peaceful Ohio community","text":"For more than two centuries, it’s a town that has stayed out of the spotlight as its largely law-abiding folk quietly carried on with their lives. It’s so unassuming, even its name was taken from another city. But now Springfield, Ohio, has suddenly found itself under worldwide scrutiny over its burgeoning Haitian population – and you can taste the tension on the streets. The latest inflammatory and unproven accusations that some new immigrants are eating household pets have only served to increase the rancor of many locals who cannot accept the new arrivals. Meanwhile, some of the 15,000 or so Haitians who have made the city their home since 2020 are now considering leaving because of the bitterness being generated, DailyMail.com can reveal. For a mid-western city previously known for farm machinery manufacturing, it’s not overstating to say that turmoil is in danger of taking over. One white local told us: ‘I fear bullets are going to fly.’ On the very day we visited to try to unpick fact from fiction, a bomb threat closed down the city hall and an elementary school. Mayor Rob Rue admitted the words contained ‘hateful language towards immigrants and Haitians’. Into that mix, of course, came Donald Trump, who propagated the pet-eating narrative during his combative presidential debate on Tuesday with Kamala Harris. He claimed: ‘In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country.’ After ABC news anchor and debate co-moderator David Muir interceded to say the city said there had been no credible reports of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community, Trump doubled down. Although the debunked claims have been on social media, he said: ‘I’ve seen people on television. The people on television saying my dog was taken and used for food.’ Even before the debate, Trump – the first president since McKinley not to have a dog in the White House – posted AI memes on his Truth Social account showing cats in MAGA hats. This was after his vice presidential pick JD Vance had seized on the accusations to build a narrative against migrants and illegal immigration. This drama all over a city of 60,000 that was founded in 1801, named after Springfield, Massachusetts, and had previously been in decline for decades as its blue-collar industries collapsed. The influx of Haitians has been credited with helping a resurgence, filling job gaps in places like the Amazon distribution center and a local metal working factory. But the pet-eating claims and others that immigrants have been slaughtering ducks in the park have left the city on edge. Unlike many American downtowns now, Springfield has an aura of regeneration with coffee shops and bistros in neat redbrick buildings. Large colorful murals celebrating the city adorn walls. Road signs proclaim ‘Springfield, find your unwind.’ Outwardly, the factor is definitely feelgood. But you barely need to scratch the surface to reveal the fractious underbelly. At the Haitian Community and Support Center, administrator Rose-Themar Joseph was composed yet clearly unsettled in her response to the ex-president’s incendiary remarks, viewed by 67million Americans who watched the debate live on TV. Between assisting new arrivals at the center’s building on the edge of the city, she told us: ‘Trump’s comment shocked me and frustrated me. ‘Haitians are being used as part of a political agenda by people with power and money. They should fact check the information before spreading it all over the world. It’s showing a lack of humanity. ‘We don’t know the exact number of Haitians now in Springfield. But they come here because there are jobs and it is a much more affordable part of the country that Florida or New York. ‘Many work in the local Amazon center. All types of people, doctors, lawyers, all types who had to flee Haiti because there is a complete breakdown of law and order on the streets.’ Joseph, a 40-year-old mother, fled Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince four years ago after an armed gang stopped her car and shot at it. Miraculously, the former American Red Cross worker survived, but her family implored her to leave fearing she would be targeted again. ‘There were three of us in the car and we were stuck in traffic. This gang came out and just started shooting. That kind of thing happens all the time there. Shootings, kidnappings, nobody can feel safe. Joseph entered the United States in Miami four years ago on a visitor visa and was granted Temporary Protected Status, available to people from war-torn countries or broken regimes. She moved to Springfield for its affordability. Her current organization helps newcomers apply for jobs, seek out school places for their children and investigate the possibility of certain qualifying benefits such as food stamps. The majority of Haitians in Springfield are legal immigrants, there through TPS, Green Cards, the Humanitarian Parole Program and also citizenship. Despite the current tensions, she insisted on leaving us with this message: ‘I just want to say to the American people, thank you.’ At the thriving Rose Goute Creole Restaurant situated in a busy strip of diners and stores, manager Romane Pierre, 41, sat at one of his tables and put on a brave face despite his rising concerns. His main worry was escalation. ‘Many people in our community are shocked by Donald Trump’s words and genuinely fear what could happen next. ‘Some are considering leaving Springfield, I know some others who have actually left. Because Haitians in this town don’t have guns. But Americans, they do have guns. ‘American people like their cats and dogs, so when it’s said Haitians are eating them we don’t know how they’re going to react. I know a lot of people who feel afraid right now. They don’t know what’s going to happen next. ‘This was the feeling just before the debate as well, when JD Vance started sharing these stories. ‘Let me tell you, Haitians don’t eat dogs, they don’t eat cats. My people, they like goat.’ And he emphasized: ‘Haitians come here looking for an opportunity, they’re looking for a job, a place to live that they can afford. And they work very hard.’ Pierre came to the United States in 2020 and headed to Springfield ‘because you could get a four-bedroom house for $700 a month. After I came, every day, every day, every month, more people followed.’ He accepts the massive influx has put terrific strain on schools, housing and health care. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine this week pledged $2.5 million to expand primary health care cover in Springfield. Pierre fled Port-au-Prince after his computer business was ransacked by an armed gang and he was told his life under threat. He entered the US on a visitor visa and claimed Temporary Protected Status. His spoken English is excellent. ‘It’s chaos in Haiti. Here we feel we have some security and with hard work and ambition we can make something or ourselves.’ Returning to the Trump comments, Pierre pointed to a large floral arrangement on the restaurant counter. ‘A lot of Americans come in here, they like Haitians,’ he said. ‘After the presidential debate, some of them brought us those flowers. There’s hope.’ However, the unifying sentiment was not in evidence just 100 yards away as Priscilla Marrs waited to pick up her daughter Courtney from her shift as Dunkin’ Donuts. The 53-year-old didn’t mince words. While she was not convinced Haitians were pet-eaters, she randomly insisted: ‘You just can’t go anywhere without them taking all the groceries.’ She also blamed Haitians for car accidents, saying: ‘There’s wrecks everywhere. I mean, you have to watch it when you drive around here. The crashes, it’s ‘cause of them. I mean everywhere you go. It’s really bad.’ Asked if she had witnessed any Haitians in car accidents, Marrs admitted: ‘Well, no. But they follow you all around in when you’re in Walmart.’ She cited on example of being followed but when asked how she knew they were Haitian, she replied: ‘I mean, I’m assuming they were. Because I mean, that’s all you see.’ Daughter Courtney was equally vocal, saying: ‘I don’t care for ’em. I used to work with them almost four years in a factory. ‘They’re rude, they’re disrespectful. You know, they pretty much had all of our jobs at the car parts place where I used to work. They got their way, with the hours they wanted.’ And in a general swipe – despite Haitians filling employment gaps as Springfield starts to climb out of economic torpor – she added: ‘It’s like, I feel like they’re taking all of our good stuff away from us Americans, like our cars, our housing, a lot of our jobs.’ Outside Springfield City Hall, while it remained shut due to the bomb threat, mom-of-three Jessica McNairtook an even more trenchant stance against the newcomers. Confusingly mixing up the protagonist in the bomb threat that also closed an elementary school, she said: ‘It’s out of control here. I mean, they come over here… I work hard, pay taxes and my child can’t even get an education because we have threats at schools. ‘And they can’t drive, they can’t drive at all. And my rent’s going up because of them, and my insurance is going up, everything’s going up.’ Wearing a t shirt with a picture of a defiant Trump with his fist raised after escaping the assassination bid, and the words ‘You Can’t Kill Freedom,’ the Amazon worker ramped up her attack. ‘My job is full of them, plum full. And I was even informed they’re (Amazon) are not even hiring Americans no more,’ she alleged. Asked if she had proof of such a hiring policy, she replied: ‘I’ve not got that, but I’ve heard. You go into my place of work and you don’t see no Americans in training. It’s all immigrants.’ And warming to the theme, she continued: ‘This is our country. Then they come here, get housing, they get a car, brand new cars, they get welfare. What about our homeless people being kicked out of their houses just so they can put Haitians in them? ‘They should just go back to their country. They won’t fight for their country? This ain’t Springfield, it’s Little Haiti.’ Military veteran Ken McGravy, 68, said he had no proof of missing pets, or ducks and geese from parks that have also featured in social media allegations against Haitians. But he did tell DailyMail.com there are ‘suspiciously’ fewer wild birds in the city’s Snyder Park where he walks regularly. He could not be sure why. Also strolling downtown, he gave his own chilling insight into his home city. ‘There’s a lot of hatred in Springfield,’ he told us. ‘A lot of rednecks who are really racist, and that’s such a sad thing. ‘This circus now has been whipped up through social media and seized upon. I was born in Springfield and I genuinely fear that, knowing the place as I do, bullets might start to fly unless things start to tone down. It’s dangerous.’ Haitian Sedieu Estache, 26, had come to the city hall to pay his water bill, not realizing it was closed. After parking his white Ford Explorer SUV, he smiled as he told us: ‘I’ve never had a problem with the people of Springfield. I feel they accept me.’ The Amazon employee fled Haiti because he supported one of the opposition parties and was constantly receiving death threats at his Port-au-Prince home. After receiving Temporary Protected Status, he headed straight to Springfield three years ago. ‘I was menaced in my own country,’ he said. ‘I feared for my life and felt I had no alternative but to leave. Here, I can make a good life, I can contribute.’ Half a mile away, at the Covenant Presbyterian Church, a group of pastors gathered in a bid to calm what they felt was an ugly situation that was rapidly escalating – an urgency highlighted by the bomb threat. Pastor Jodie Noble told DailyMail.com: ‘We are together today in a call for restraint, an appeal for calm, in response to the violence and the threats that are occurring here. ‘It’s always a surprise what humans can do based on emotion. And I pray that will not be our truth here. We are together knowing that could be a reality, of what anger could produce in people.’ Pastor Carl Ruby of the city’s Central Christian Church, said: ‘In Springfield we stand together and we stand side by side with our new Haitian neighbors. We stand together as conservatives, progressives, Democrats, Republicans, Protestants and Catholics… to remind everyone that God loves immigrants. ‘The real story is not the anger. The real story is for 80 years we were a shrinking city and now we are growing.’ The group was joined by Viles Dorsainvil, executive director of the Haitian help center, who said: ‘We are here to contribute to the wellbeing of Springfield.’ Of the MAGA attack line regarding pets, he said: ‘High ranking people in power should try to control their narrative.

He claimed, without evidence, that Haitian migrants in the city were eating cats and dogs. Speaking to reporters in California, Trump said, \"We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio,\" at a press conference at his golf resort near Los Angeles targeting what he described as \"barbaric criminals\" causing harm in US communities.The majority of the 15,000 Haitians in Springfield are there legally. Trump's longstanding pledge to conduct mass deportations usually refers to those in the country illegally.— RpsAgainstTrump (@RpsAgainstTrump) Trump did not repeat the assertion he made during Tuesday's presidential debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that immigrants were eating dogs and cats, remarks that have been widely mocked.Trump has cited the tensions in Springfield as another example of the need for hardline immigration polices. The influx of Haitians has boosted the economy but also has strained social services.— TaylorPopielarz (@TaylorPopielarz) Debunked claims of migrants eating petsDuring a recent debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump repeated the false allegation that migrants in Springfield were consuming household pets. \"They're eating the dogs — the people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating — they're eating the pets of the people that live there,\" he claimed, despite moderator David Muir pointing out that the city manager had refuted the claim. Trump insisted, \"I’ve seen people saying it on television.\"Following the debate, Trump shared AI-generated social media posts showing pets supporting his candidacy.Migrants in Springfield: Legal residents filling workforce gapsSpringfield, a city of 58,000, has seen a significant rise in its Haitian migrant population in recent years, largely due to legal immigration programs. The influx has helped the city meet rising labor demand after decades of industrial decline, reported CBS. Most of these migrants are in the US legally through Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and humanitarian parole programs, which allow them to live and work while their home countries experience crisis.Despite Trump's claims, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, along with Springfield’s mayor and police chief, confirmed that there have been no credible reports of migrants stealing or eating pets.Governor DeWine offers support for strained resourcesWhile acknowledging the strain on local healthcare systems, Governor DeWine announced a $2.5 million initiative to expand primary care access in Springfield, where many Haitian migrants have limited health services. \"We will continue to do everything we can to help the community deal with this surge of migrants,\" DeWine said, criticizing the federal government's lack of a clear plan.Biden condemns Trump’s rhetoricPresident Joe Biden denounced Trump’s remarks during a White House event celebrating Black excellence, calling the comments harmful to the Haitian community. \"This has to stop, what he’s doing. It has to stop,\" Biden said, referring to the inflammatory claims Trump and his allies have made about Springfield’s migrants.Despite Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, painting Springfield as a community in crisis, local leaders and experts have consistently rejected their claims, pointing to the important contributions of migrants in the region.'We need help, not hate'Haitian community leaders across the United States said the Republican candidate's remarks could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in Springfield. \"We need help, not hate,\" Springfield's mayor Rob Rue told ABC News.City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals. Karen Graves, a city spokesperson, said she was not aware of recent hate crimes targeting Haitian residents but that some had been victims of \"crimes of opportunity,\" such as property theft.","summary":"Donald Trump has promised mass deportations from Springfield, Ohio, if re-elected, alleging without evidence that Haitian migrants are consuming pets.

But nothing could have prepared fans for Prue Leith's latest look. The restaurateur, 84, made sure all eyes were on her as she opted for a striking all leather look. The broadcaster strutted down the catwalk during the Vin + Omi show at The Kensington Building during London Fashion Week on Friday. Beaming in snaps, the tight fitted PVC midi dress featured raunchy red lace up detailing and exaggerated wide shoulders. Prue Leith ditched the pastries for the PVC as she debuted a VERY bold all leather look during the Vin + Omi show at The Kensington Building during London Fashion Week on Friday The restaurateur, 84, made sure all eyes were on her as she opted for a striking all leather look She is normally known for her colourful ensembles, bold prints and the quirky glasses she styles each week on The Great British Bake Off The star accessorised the look with some black leather trainers and matching leather gloves as she switched the kitchen for the stage. Ditching her glasses, Prue opted for intense smoky eye makeup and a bold red lip. Prue will soon be back on screens with Paul Hollywood as the fifteenth series of The Great British Bake Off kicks off on September 24 at 8pm. Earlier this year Prue admitted that she almost didn't apply to replace Mary Berry on the much loved show as she feared she wouldn't tick the 'diversity boxes'. The star has been a judge on the cooking competition since she replaced Mary in 2016. However, this very nearly wasn't the case as Prue reveals she initially completely dismissed the idea. It was revealed that the women had known each other since the 1970s when a photo of them with broadcaster Jack de Manio (1914-1988) was unearthed. Prue told the Sliding Doors podcast with Jennie Becker: 'I just jumped at it. I had begun to think about it, once I knew Mary Berry was not going to go on. I thought: \"Oh, I’d love that job\", but I dismissed the thought. Pouting in snaps, the tight fitted PVC midi dress featured raunchy red lace up detailing and exaggerated wide shoulders Ditching her glasses, Prue opted for intense smoky eye makeup and a bold red lip The star accessorised the look with some black leather trainers and matching leather gloves as she switched the kitchen for the stage The star looked surprisingly at home on the catwalk Prue seemed to be embracing her inner Cruella DeVille in the ensemble Prue will soon be back on screens with Paul Hollywood as the fifteenth series of The Great British Bake Off kicks off on September 24 at 8pm She showcased her age defying looks once again Earlier this year Prue admitted that she almost didn't apply to replace Mary Berry on the much loved show as she feared she wouldn't tick the 'diversity boxes' 'I thought: \"They’ll get someone younger, someone more . . . probably a young Asian chef or something, that would tick all the diversity boxes and stuff’. But no, they chose me.\" 'If you think about my past career, I’d had 11 years sitting at the Great British Menu as a judge and every plate has about ten tastes on it - it makes Bake Off look really simple. Read More Prue Leith admits she almost didn't apply to replace Mary Berry on the Great British Bake Off 'With cake, with one spoonful, you can get the icing, the filling and the crumb. I knew all the top chefs, I had a Michelin restaurant of my own so I knew that level of cooking very well.' The connection to baking specialist Maty extends to Prue's own husband, fashion designer John Playfair, 77, who frequently uses it to his advantage while commenting on his wife's cooking. 'I won’t bake cakes since we are both too fat, so he taunts me with, \"I wish I’d married Mary Berry,\"' she said. At the time of Prue's arrival, fans, already disgruntled by the move from BBC to Channel 4 and the loss of Mary, Sue Perkins, and Mel Giedroyc, did not warm to her. Prue told The Times in February: 'Oh, I hate my voice. It’s too posh. When I replaced Mary Berry on Bake Off someone on Twitter said: \"Oh no, not that posh b**ch\", and I sort of agreed with her. But yes, Americans seem to like it.'

The man was joined by a female protester, whose own remarks preceded his, and about five other people. \"You are a bull---- spreader,\" the male pro-Palestinian protester shot back. \"You are the cowardly one here. Come show your muscle… Let the people live; that's what we want.\" The woman had been shouting at the crowd, trying to make the case that there is little daylight between Harris and former President Trump on the issue of the Israel-Gaza conflict and the Jerusalem government’s response to the October 7 terror attack. KAMALA HARRIS: WE NEED A ‘CEASE-FIRE’ AND CHART A COURSE FOR A ‘TWO-STATE SOLUTION’ Frank told Fox News Digital after the kerfuffle that he effectively had had enough of the protesters’ invective and had to say something. \"Everybody agrees that the war [in Gaza] is horrible… but they’re complaining about Kamala, who has called for a cease fire. \"[The protesters] are representing the Palestinians, which is fine, but they say nothing about Hamas and the horror that started this whole thing,\" Frank added. \"And they don't say anything about how Hamas uses the Palestinians as human shields. So, you know, United States has been trying to negotiate a cease fire here for months and months. And the problem is Netanyahu and the right wing of the Israeli government -- they don't even want a two-state solution.\" Frank criticize Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has and will continue engage in indiscriminate bombings of Gazan territory – while underlining additionally that the U.S. made a promise to Israel and should uphold it: \"[America] has a commitment, a long-standing commitment since the year I was born to defend Israel's right to exist. Hamas's stated purpose is to end Israel as a state,\" he said.

And virtually everybody wants peace.\" \"Kamala Harris is on record as advocating for a cease fire. So, you know, aim your anger where it might do some good.\" After speaking with Frank, Fox News Digital also caught up with Loai, the male protester who had been jawing with the Harris supporter. Loai said he was born in Palestinian territory but now lives locally in the Wyoming Valley. When asked why he and his group are protesting the Harris rally, Loai said the vice president supports \"Zionists [and is] supporting Israel.\" Loai added that both Harris and Trump are \"essentially\" the same on the matter. When asked who he prefers if he had to choose, Loai quipped, \"let's see who is less smelly.\" \"We want to see the genocide stop,\" he added. Loai said he also \"doesn’t care\" about Israel – and personally is not calling for its demise, as other protesters have shouted \"from the river to the sea\" – a phrase connected to calls for the destruction of Israel. \"We don't care about Israel; that they exist or not. That's not our business. We are American here. We want this genocide to be stopped. – Wherever they go, they just [need] to get the Hell out of [the Palestinian territory].\" Fox News Digital's Matteo Cina contributed to this report.","summary":"A pro-Palestinian protester and a supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris sparred with each other outside a rally in Wilkes-Barre.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-palestinian-protesters-taunt-harris-rallygoers-veep-supporter-hits-back-what-about-hamas","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/hamasprotester.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:57:37","author":"Charles Creitz","authors":["Charles Creitz"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":256377634,"title":"Why boosting the Child Tax Credit has become a key issue for Harris, Trump","text":"Norristown, Pennsylvania — If anyone knows how expensive it is to raise a child, it's Raegen Selden, an office manager in Norristown, Pennsylvania.

During the pandemic, the credit was boosted temporarily from $2,000 to $3,000 per child, and up to $3,600 for families with children under the age of 6. The move helped cut U.S. child poverty by 46%, according to a 2022 report from the U.S. Census Bureau.\"Bills still needed to be paid and things still needed to be bought,\" Selden said. \"And it was a comfort in knowing that you had this extra income.\"It costs an estimated $310,000 to raise a child from birth to age 18, the Brookings Institution found in a 2022 report. One of the few things both presidential candidates agree on is that the Child Tax Credit should get a big boost. Former President Donald Trump's campaign is proposing a $5,000 per child yearly tax credit. Vice President Kamala Harris is proposing a credit of up to $3,600 per child, with a bump to $6,000 for newborns. Trump wants the credit to go to all families regardless of income, while Harris would restrict the credit to low and middle-income families only. She would also make the credit \"refundable,\" meaning even parents who don't pay taxes would get the credit in cash. \"This is a really exciting moment,\" University of Maryland economics professor Melissa Kearney told CBS News. \"…We have tons of evidence that supplementing the income of low-income families with children really meaningfully improves those children's lives. We see they do better in school. Their health outcomes are improved in ways that persist into their adulthood.\"The cost has always been a sticking point. A bill to expand the credit failed in the Senate just last month.Selden believes parents should receive a Child Tax Credit because their children \"are taking care of our future.\"\"We want them to grow up to be great, productive citizens in this country,\" she added. \"And it's like you can't do that if they can't eat.\"","summary":"Government figures show it now costs more than $300,000 to raise a child from birth to age 18.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boosting-child-tax-credit-key-issue-harris-trump/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/13/a3e80fed-bbd2-4168-b6b2-e4ada3d5e23c/thumbnail/1200x630/d2917cc48dc2720a2fda4ec3754e5617/1726271638621.png?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3193324_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:56:48","author":"Nancy Cordes","authors":["Nancy Cordes"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":256377614,"title":"Trump Tries Hard to Attract Taylor Swift Fans with Tasteless Tour Merchandise","text":"Donald Trump has a well-documented history of saying weird things about Taylor Swift, but he reached a disturbing new low on August 18, 2024 when he shared AI images of the pop superstar endorsing him, which is obviously not the case. For the record, neither Trump nor his campaign made the images. According to The Guardian, the AI images were created by another user on Truth Social. However, the former president did blast them to his legion of followers on the platform that he also happens to own. Swift remained oddly silent about the AI imagery in the weeks after. That changed when she dropped her September 10th endorsement of Kamala Harris following the vice president’s first debate with Trump. Clearly, Swift saw the images and did not take the situation lightly. In fact, she cited Trump’s AI use as the main reason for publicly backing Harris. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift wrote on Instagram. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.” Of course, Swift also took a cheeky swipe at Trump’s running mate JD Vance by signing her post as “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady.” Vance has been under fire for his 2021 remarks to Tucker Carlson where he referred to Democratic women as “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” Swift clearly caught that scandal, too.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; Christina House/Getty Images After wrapping up a strange and wild-eyed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Tries Hard to Attract Taylor Swift Fans with Tasteless Tour Merchandise first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/trump-tries-hard-to-attract-taylor-swift-fans-with-tasteless-tour-merchandise/","image":"https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/trump-makes-desperate-attempt-to-keep-swifties-on-his-side-with-tacky-eras-tour-merch/intro-1726264180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:56:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":256377672,"title":"Donald Trump visits Bay Area for fundraising event ahead of November election","text":"SAN MATEO COUNTY, Calif.

It was one of three events on a busy Friday, including stops in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. In San Mateo County, dozens of his supporters lined El Camino Real to make their voices heard. In what's considered a blue state, there is still red. \"Californians are here to support Trump,\" Santa Cruz supporter Mike Lheureux said. \"There are a lot of people in California that do believe in Trump's values, do believe in his policies and that we are here to support him.\" MORE: Trump vs Harris Presidential Debate: Candidates go on attack in zinger-filled showdown There was support heard loud and proud after Trump arrived Friday afternoon.

After the latest debate here on ABC, polls across the country are tightening up between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Here in San Mateo County, it was obvious which way the group was voting. Woodside was once again home to an important campaign fundraiser.

The Keystone State’s natural-gas sector supports around 123,000 jobs and was responsible for more than $41 billion in 2022 economic activity, per the energy economists at FTI Consulting, Inc. Scott Ivey, 49, a service supervisor for Stingray Pressure Pumping who’s worked throughout Pennsylvania, said he and his fellow “roughnecks” are a vital part of western Pennsylvania’s economy. “it’s a tremendous surge of money,” Ivey told The Post. “You think about when I stay at a hotel. Three-quarters of people that are staying at the hotel at that time are working in the oil and gas industry. Sometimes it’s almost impossible to book hotels because they’re so full up.” Sarah Phillips, a Canonsburg, Pa., petroleum engineer and Gladiator Energy saleswoman, agreed the industry’s helped her town just outside Pittsburgh that used to be a coal district. “It was desolate just a decade ago. And now it’s this huge, thriving area with restaurants, hotels, bowling alleys — like anything that you can possibly think of.” Ryan Butya, the owner of Canonsburg’s All Star Sports Bar & Grill, said the vast majority of his customers are roughnecks spending their hard-earned money unwinding after a long day on the rigs. “Probably like 85%,” he told The Post. “It is a crazy number actually. We’re based around three hotels that are within walking distance of us.” Butya, whose father opened the bar in 2014 after an influx of business from fracking, gushed about how the industry has brought wealth and commerce to the community. “A lot of these people, they make a good living. They can raise a family, have fun on the weekends with the salary. Look at all the tax revenue that it generates.” But those who’ve built careers and families off the rise of fracking don’t trust Kamala Harris to hold true to her promise not to ban it. “I don’t believe anything Kamala Harris says,” said Ivey. “I don’t want to get too political, but I believe she’ll regulate it so hard that it’ll be impossible to frack once she gets in.” Ivey bases his opinion on what he’s seen first hand under three presidential administrations in his12-year career in the natural-gas industry. Since President “Biden won, all the jobs have seemed to slow down. They’ve all moved in a green direction, like electric fleets and whatnot, which only certain people have.” He’s grateful for the benefits a natural-gas career has brought him — and pessimistic about what regulation has wrought on the industry. “There’s not a lot of people working,” he said. “And that’s due to — I ain’t gonna blame it just on Joe Biden, but it is what it is. They don’t shut it down, they just regulate it and make it hard for everybody to work.” Sarah Phillips noted the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s construction lagged on for years, costing billions of dollars, after environmental groups including the Wilderness Society and Appalachian Voices sued seeking to block it. “And that was due to kickback from the Biden and Harris administration. We had federal leasing bans. We had [liquified-natural-gas] prohibitions, power-plant shutdowns, EV mandates,” she said.

In the three-minute clip, the woman claimed that she was selling tickets she had purchased for her 13-year-old daughter’s birthday after the Cruel Summer hitmaker took to Instagram to show her support for Kamala following the explosive presidential debate earlier this week. She confessed that she now had bad blood with the songstress as she alleged Taylor didn’t care about the economy because she was a ‘billionaire’ and was too focused on her ‘private planes.’ The mom also said she now refused to spend ‘another dollar’ supporting the star’s ‘non-Christian beliefs’ – giving the singer’s pro-choice abortion position as an example. At the beginning of the clip, the mom noted that while she knew it was a ‘long shot,’ she still wanted to post the video in hopes the pop sensation would see it. She also insinuated that the star had planned her endorsement with Kamala prior to the debate. The mom said: ‘One, I think it’s really interesting how you had that one long letter for all your fans already printed out two seconds after Kamala and Donald Trump had their debate, which only tells me you already had this written up before the debate, which also tells me that you did not have an open mind. ‘Kamala lied to everyone on that stage and those of us that know, know.’ The unnamed mother went on to unleash a furious rant about the singer’s alleged lack of concern for the economy. She added: ‘Taylor, you are a billionaire. The rest of us are not, the rest of us are struggling, people can’t afford homes and some of us are losing our businesses. ‘If Harris gets into office, our economy is screwed but I know that doesn’t effect you because you have all that money and private planes. You just don’t even live in that kind of world.’ The Canadian woman noted that it seemed like the issues at hand were ‘LGBTQ rights and aborting babies,’ claiming ‘neither one of those are affected under Donald Trump.’ ‘Donald Trump is the right guy for the job. If the economy of the United States suffers, the whole world suffers, Taylor. If the whole world suffers, there goes your job and your career because nobody is going to be able to afford going to your concerts,’ she added. The mom then threw in religious beliefs into her furious rant as she claimed that according to the bible, she is permitted to ‘judge other believers.’ ‘How can you call yourself a believer and be for killing babies? So with that, I have three tickets to the Toronto show that I was going to take my 13-year-old, she turns 13 that day and it was a special gift because she’s been a Taylor Swift fan forever and I was going to take her to this concert. ‘But my tickets are now up for sale because I don’t want to spend another dollar supporting you and your private planes and your non-Christian beliefs. ‘I also don’t want my daughter – my Christian daughter – to believe that it’s okay to do things that are against God’s work, like killing babies,’ she added. The enraged mother ended the clip by claiming that she was ‘done’ with the pop sensation. Her viral video comes days after Taylor dramatically endorsed the democratic nominee in an Instagram post following the presidential debate. The megastar made the bombshell announcement on Instagram after the ABC showdown in which Trump accused migrants of eating pets and said Democrats wanted to ‘execute babies’ in the ninth month of pregnancy. Her post read: ‘Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. ‘As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country. ‘Recently I was made aware that AI of “me” falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. ‘It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. ‘I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for Kamala because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. ‘I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades. ‘I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!

And in an interview in 2019 with The Guardian, Taylor said she supported Hilary Clinton over Trump in the 2016 election and accused Trump of treating the presidency like ‘an autocracy.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA mom has revealed that she is shaking off Taylor Swift by&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Angry Mother Decides to Sell Taylor Swift Concert Tickets After Singer Endorses Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/angry-mother-decides-to-sell-taylor-swift-concert-tickets-after-singer-endorses-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Furious-mom-reveals-she-is-SELLING-her.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:36:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":256377496,"title":"Trump appears to leave door open for second debate with Harris: 'Maybe if I got in the right mood'","text":"Former President Trump appears to be leaving the door open for a potential second debate with Vice President Kamala Harris after declaring another one-on-one with his Democratic rival was off the table.

Biden's disastrous debate performance resulted in his exit from the race and Harris quickly emerged as the Democratic nominee. Trump went on to participate in this week's ABC News Presidential Debate he initially agreed to with Biden. Harris attempted to change the rules that were agreed on between the Trump and Biden campaigns by fighting for unmuted mics, which she failed to get.

The problem? She couldn’t answer them.

Ya know?”pic.twitter.com/lhOdWoygy2— Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 13, 2024 TAFF: Talk about bringing down prices and making life more affordable for people. What are one or two specific things you have in mind for that?HARRIS: Well, I’ll start with this. I grew up a middle-class kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard. She was able to finally save up enough money to buy our first house when I was a teenager. I grew up in a community of hardworking people. You know, construction workers and nurses and teachers. I try to explain to some people who might not have had the same experience, but a lot of people will relate to this. You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of people who were really proud of their lawn, you know, and I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions. So, when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business. A presidential nominee is not going to get an easier question than that. It’s basically the equivalent of asking, “Tell me how amazing you are.” All Harris had to do was lay out a couple of specific steps she would take to lower prices. Instead, she spent a minute and a half filibustering, talking about pure irrelevancy. No person who can’t afford groceries cares that she “grew up middle class” or that the people in her neighborhood mowed their lawns. She just kept going too. Here’s her expounding on her so-called “opportunity economy.” Kamala: “For example, thinking about developing and creating an opportunity economy where it’s about investing in areas that really need a lot of work and maybe focusing on again the aspirations and the dreams but also just recognizing that at this moment in time some of this… pic.twitter.com/imSwSCbEHw— Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 13, 2024 Can anyone pick out an actual policy proposal in that word salad? She keeps talking about “investing” in things but doesn’t specify a single thing she’d invest in. “Dreams and aspirations” are not a tangible government policy nor does spending gobs of money do anything to help bring down costs for the middle-class. This is the same slop she served up at the debate. Yes, she was well rehearsed, but underneath the facade, there was nothing there. When Harris was asked about what makes her different from Joe Biden, she didn’t have an answer for that either. This is supposed to be a lay-up for her.

Here are a few more clips, and at this point, I’ve posted about half of what she said.

Her answers were generic tripe, but at least she delivered them well. This interview is a return to who Harris normally is, though. She’s a lazy, entitled politician, and no one should listen to these exchanges and believe she has what it takes to be the President of the United States. This is why her team doesn’t let her do interviews. It’s one thing to join in on a three-on-one bout at a debate in which the moderators were walking her through everything and constantly interrupting her opponent. When she’s got no one to deflect to, she can’t answer basic questions, and her campaign is nothing but “vibes.” Frankly, America is in bad enough shape that “vibes” aren’t going to cut it.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAfter nearly two months of procrastination, Kamala Harris finally did her first&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: VIDEO: Kamala Harris Performs Poorly in Her Initial Solo Interview first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/video-kamala-harris-performs-poorly-in-her-initial-solo-interview/","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/254/3d6cbcfb-b76a-4a90-a4d2-269a65da837d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:33:37","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.091},{"id":256377296,"title":"Trump defends relationship with 9/11 conspiracy theorist","text":"Trump defends relationship with 9/11 conspiracy theorist Former President Donald Trump is defending his relationship with 9/11 conspiracy theorist and self-avowed white nationalist Laura Loomer and doubling down on false claims about pets being eaten in Springfield, Ohio.

Walz’ stop in Portland came after appearances earlier in the day in Bangor and is part of a blitz by the Harris-Walz campaign in states around the country, particularly battleground areas, on the heels of the presidential debate this week between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. “Tim and Kamala, with your help, will build an opportunity economy for everyone where if you work hard you can get ahead and you don’t have to scrape by,” Walz told a crowd of around 500 supporters during a rally at the Brick South event space. She encouraged people to make calls, volunteer and “do whatever you can,” to help elect Harris and Tim Walz. “We can choose to move forward but we’re going to have to fight, and we’re going to have to fight for it every day,” Walz said. Walz is the latest national surrogate to come to Maine on behalf of the Harris campaign, which has also sent Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, here twice, along with other surrogates, though neither Harris or Tim Walz have visited yet. Maine as a whole is seen as reliably Democratic, but the 2nd Congressional District has leaned more conservative in recent years. The state is one of two that split their electoral votes, and in 2016 and 2020 Trump carried the 2nd District to secure one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Neither Trump, his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, nor their family members have been to Maine yet this election cycle. Trump has spent less time here this year than in past campaigns – in 2016 he had already visited Maine three times before Labor Day and in 2020 he visited Bangor and Guilford during a trip in June. That could be a sign that the Trump campaign no longer sees the 2nd District as a toss-up, though political observers say Trump has also traveled less in general this election cycle. And while polling on Maine is limited, the latest results from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, released in late August, had Harris up by 5 percentage points in the 2nd District and leading Trump 55% to 38% statewide. The poll surveyed nearly 1,000 people between Aug. 15 and 19 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Walz, the first lady of Minnesota, where her husband is governor, also visited the Briar Patch bookstore and a campaign office in Bangor earlier in the day. In Portland, she spoke about her husband, their careers as teachers and educators, and some of the campaign’s priorities, choosing to highlight gun safety and reproductive rights. Speaking of Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Walz brought up a comment made by Vance recently in the wake of a school shooting in Georgia in which Vance said school shootings are a “fact of life” and argued that security should be bolstered at schools. “Their advice is we have to just get over it,” Walz said as the crowd booed. “I don’t buy it. I am not accepting that.” She said Trump and Vance are also “coming for our reproductive freedoms,” and spoke about how she and her husband struggled to start a family and had to use fertility treatments. “Everyone should have the freedom to build our families as we choose,” Walz said. “Just as important, we should be able to decide not to have children at all if that is our choice. The point is it should be our choice.” Walz was welcomed to the stage Friday by Mollie Barnathan, a Portland mother of three who talked about how she twice needed an abortion after pregnancies in which her babies had severe health conditions. “Both times I was able to access the health care I needed with dignity and respect,” said Barnathan, who said that many women across the country don’t have that same access because of Trump. Trump has boasted of his role in the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and place decisions on abortion law in the hands of states, many of which have moved to restrict access. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills also appeared at Friday’s rally and credited the Biden-Harris administration with many successful initiatives in Maine, including infrastructure investments, an expansion of high-speed internet and increased access to child care. “Kamala Harris lives by the values she was brought up with, the kind of values we (in Maine) were brought up with,” Mills said. “And who else better embodies the kindness, respect and compassion than her running mate, my friend Tim Walz?” The rally Friday drew a long line of people that waited outside before the doors opened. Chris Pesek of Cumberland Center came to the rally because he believes Harris is the best choice for president and wanted to get more involved in her campaign. A registered Republican, Pesek said he also signed up to call voters on behalf of the Harris campaign. “I have sons and daughters and I care about what’s going to happen to the future of our country,” said Pesek, 60. “I see what (Trump) has done to the Supreme Court. I see and listen to Biden-Harris and I think they’ve gotten a lot accomplished, whereas I think Trump was taking us backwards. So I wanted to get involved and see what I can do to spread the word.” Jackie Clark of Portland said she was excited to show her support for Harris. Clark, 37, said she is originally from Minneapolis, so Tim Walz “is a huge deal in my family and we were very excited he was selected.” Clark, a Democrat, said she had planned to vote for Joe Biden but has enjoyed seeing enthusiasm build around Harris-Walz. “The entire vibe change that has happened in the last few weeks has been really exciting, and I feel more emboldened to support it wholeheartedly,” she said.","summary":"Walz spoke at a rally at Thompson's Point Friday night after stops in Bangor as part of a blitz by the Harris-Walz campaign on the heels of the presidential debate.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/13/gwen-walz-tells-supporters-in-portland-to-choose-a-new-way-forward-with-harris-walz/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/39674716_20240913_walz_10.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:26:30","author":"Rachel Ohm","authors":["Rachel Ohm"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.032},{"id":256376920,"title":"Surprised Kamala Harris owns a gun? You shouldn't be, fellow black women firearm owners say","text":"The internet lit up after Vice President Kamala Harris announced to the country that she is a gun owner during last week’s presidential debate. It came as a surprise to some supporters and detractors alike, even though she also noted that fact when she ran for the White House in 2020. But for some Chicago women of color, it would have been surprise if she wasn’t. “Any woman that may be in a compromising situation should be a gun owner,” said Bronzeville resident Joanne Glenn, who is 74 and has owned a gun for years. Javondlyn Dunagan, a retired federal parole officer, agrees. She has been teaching fellow Black women how to use and store guns for the last eight years after founding JMD Defense in 2016. “I don’t think it was a big deal, but it was a surprise to some people,” said Dunagan, noting that Harris used to be the district attorney in San Francisco. “She was in a position like [Cook County State’s Attorney] Kim Foxx and there’s a risk that comes with that job.” For Dunagan and her students, most of whom live in Chicago, having a gun for protection is just common sense. Glenn has two adult daughters and four grandchildren. “Because I’m a single woman alone in Chicago, I wanted to have the safety of ‘[just] in case,’” she said. Glenn, a nurse who owns a home healthcare agency, took a concealed carry class at JMD three years ago and regularly attends practice sessions as part of Dunagan’s Ladies of Steel Gun Club, held twice a month at a gun range in Mount Greenwood. Gun ownership spiked during the pandemic, especially among people of color. According to the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, 69% of new gun owners between the years of 2020 and 2022 were people of color. JMD saw a spike in business in 2020 that paralleled the spike in carjackings, Dunagan said. She said today much of her current business is due to the normalization of hateful rhetoric and the feeling that the police cannot prevent all the crime, especially in Black neighborhoods. “I think we all know that there are not enough officers on the police force,” Dunagan said. “People are afraid to go out at night and that’s caused some of the spike as well.” JMD offers classes on concealed carry and how to clean and properly store a weapon. While they are open to anyone, they are mostly attended by women, who range in age from 29 to 85, she said. Regardless of class demographic, Dunagan said her message is the same, that one should use a gun as a last resort and only use it if one’s life is in danger. Dunagan said unlike some instructors who focus on different, often extremely rare scenarios, she focuses on teaching students “how to use their brains.” “I want people to ... assess what’s going on in every situation. No one should know you have a gun and if you can get out of the situation without pulling your gun, that’s the best thing.” Dunagan also teaches a situational awareness class for people without firearms, like the home healthcare employees who work for Glenn and cannot bring a gun into a patient’s home. “She’s taught safety classes for my 297 employees because they go into homes of strangers in the community,” Glenn said. “To have an expert tell you things that you don’t think about like making sure the door is locked, making sure there’s no barrier blocking your exit. She’s saving a whole lot of lives.” Dunagan said she’s probably taught more than 3,000 students about gun safety over the last 8 years and to date, is not aware of one of them having to shoot anyone. She also doesn’t dispute research that shows carrying a gun may actually increase a victim’s risk of injury — and knows that research has also found that people successfully defend themselves with guns in less than 1% of crimes. But she chalks that up to people who have no training or bad training. “There are times when people are negligent,” she said. “I use the word negligent because nothing is accidental, a gun doesn’t just go off. Owner operator errors and negligence cause a lot of gun shooting situations.” Whether or not the recent attention on Harris being a gun owner causes a spike in business is yet to be seen, but regardless, Dunagan said she will continue to teach students to try their avoid situations where they have to pull a gun and if that cannot be avoided, it’s essential to know how use it correctly. “When you learn the proper way, you can’t unlearn it,” she said.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2024/09/13/kamala-harris-gun-owner-debate-weapon-firearms-women-back-color","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0da54db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/540x308+0+77/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F04%2Fe7%2F189f41364e03b4d559097282685c%2Fscreens","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:26:06","author":"Bob Chiarito | For the Sun-Times","authors":["Bob Chiarito | For the Sun-Times"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.165},{"id":256376870,"title":"Pope Francis slams Trump & Harris over what he calls ‘anti-life’ policies","text":"Rome, Sep 14 (IANS) Pope Francis has slammed both US presidential candidates — Donald Trump and Kamala Harris — for what he called “anti-life policies” on abortion and migration, and advised American Catholics to choose the “lesser evil” in the upcoming US elections. “Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants or the one who (supports) killing babies,” Francis said on Friday. “Both are against life,” Francis told reporters aboard his plane returning to Rome after a 12-day tour of Asia. Francis stressed that he is not an American and would not be voting. Neither the Republican candidate Donald Trump nor the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris was mentioned by name. But Francis nevertheless expressed himself in stark terms when asked to weigh in on their positions on two hot-button issues in the US election — abortion and migration — that are also of major concern to the Catholic Church. Francis has made the plight of migrants a priority of his pontificate and speaks out emphatically and frequently about it. While strongly upholding church teaching forbidding abortion, Francis hasn’t emphasised church doctrine as much as his predecessors. He said that migration is a right described in scripture, and that anyone who doesn’t follow the Biblical call to welcome the stranger is committing a “grave sin”. He was also blunt in speaking about abortion. “To have an abortion is to kill a human being. You may like the word or not, but it’s killing,” he said. “We have to see this clearly.” Asked though what to do at the polls, Francis recalled the civic duty to vote. “One should vote, and choose the lesser evil,” he said. “Who is the lesser evil, the woman or man? I don’t know.” “Everyone in their conscience should think and do it,” he said. It’s not the first time Francis has weighed in on a US election. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Francis was asked about Trump’s plan to build a wall at the US-Mexican border. Francis declared then that anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants “is not Christian”. In responding on Friday, Francis recalled that he celebrated Mass at the US-Mexico border and “there were so many shoes of the migrants who ended up badly there”. The US bishops conference, for its part, has called abortion the “preeminent priority” for American Catholics in its published voter advice. Harris has strongly defended abortion rights. US President Joe Biden, an observant Catholic, shares Harris’ strong support for abortion rights, a stance that prompted some Catholic bishops and other conservatives to call for him to be denied access to Communion. After meeting Francis in person at the Vatican in October 2021, Biden came away saying the pope told him he was a “good Catholic” and should continue receiving Communion. Francis, asked on previous occasions about some US bishops who want to deny Communion to Biden over his support for abortion rights, has said bishops should be pastors, not politicians. –IANS khz","summary":"Rome, Sep 14 (IANS) Pope Francis has slammed both US presidential candidates &#8212; Donald Trump and Kamala Harris &#8212; for what he called &#8220;anti-life policies&#8221; on abortion and migration, and advised American Catholics to choose the &#8220;lesser evil&#8221; in the upcoming US elections. &#8220;Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants [&#8230;]","url":"https://bhaskarlive.in/pope-francis-slams-trump-harris-over-what-he-calls-anti-life-policies/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202409143222430.jfif?ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:22:52","author":"IANS","authors":["IANS"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":256376974,"title":"Pope Francis urges Catholic voters to 'choose the lesser evil' between Trump and Harris","text":"Pope Francis on Friday urged Catholic voters to \"choose the lesser evil\" between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants are eating domestic pets and birds in the city’s public parks. Trump mentioned the claims during a debate Tuesday with his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, prompting her to laugh and call the GOP presidential nominee “extreme.” READ MORE: ﻿Hunter discovers remains of missing 3-year-old US boy After city agencies were targeted in a bomb threat, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue on Thursday called on politicians to tamp down the rhetoric. “All these federal politicians that have negatively spun our city, they need to know they’re hurting our city, and it was their words that did it,” Rue said in an interview with WSYX. A city spokesperson said an emailed threat claimed that bombs had been planted in the homes of Springfield’s mayor and other city officials. A second email claimed that bombs had been placed at locations including Springfield City Hall, a high school, a middle school, two elementary schools and the local office of the state motor vehicles bureau. The buildings were evacuated, and authorities with explosive-detection dogs swept and cleared them, officials said. On Friday, President Joe Biden said the Haitian community is “under attack” right now, and called for an end to Republicans’ comments.

While he stated the “real threat” of immigration is happening at the Southern border, he said, \"The people of Ohio are scared.” In a post on X on Friday Vance stated, without evidence, that Springfield has experienced “a massive rise in communicable diseases, rent prices, car insurance rates, and crime.” “Don’t let biased media shame you into not discussing this slow-moving humanitarian crisis in a small Ohio town,” he said. Trump and his supporters have used the furor over migrants in the Ohio community to draw further attention to Trump's signature campaign issue of immigration reform and blame Harris for an influx of migrants into the U.S. It's a theme that Trump has used throughout his bids for public office.

Vance amplified the posts from his own X account. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country,\" Vance posted Monday on X. “Where is our border czar?” Vance asked, referring to a label that some used to reference Harris, whom Biden tapped to deal with some issues related to immigration in 2021. In a later post, Vance said his office “has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants,” adding, “It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.” Springfield has seen its Haitian population grow in recent years. It’s impossible to give an exact number, according to the city, but it estimates that Springfield’s entire county has an overall immigrant population of 15,000. The city also says that Haitian immigrants are in the country legally under a federal program that allows them to remain in the country temporarily. Last month the Biden administration granted eligibility for temporary legal status to about 300,000 Haitians already in the United States because conditions in Haiti are considered unsafe for them to return. Haiti’s government has extended a state of emergency to the entire country due to endemic gang violence.

Trump repeated the claim during Tuesday's debate. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said Tuesday. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country. And it’s a shame.” Debate moderators pointed out that city officials have said the claims are not true. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine — whose family operates a charity in Haiti in honor of their late daughter, Becky, who died in a car accident — said this week he would add more law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state has already provided to Springfield. DeWine said the Haitians who have moved to Ohio are generally hard-working people who love their families and who are seeking to escape the violence in their home country for good jobs in the state. On Wednesday, DeWine said that he believed the Springfield mayor’s assessment that the claims were unfounded, telling CBS News that the internet “can be quite crazy sometimes.” There have been other responses, including from the father of an 11-year-old Ohio boy killed last year when a Haitian immigrant driver hit a school bus. At a Springfield City Council hearing on Tuesday, Nathan Clark implored Trump and other politicians to stop invoking his son’s name in the immigration debate. Democrats have addressed the situation, with the Democratic National Committee pushing out a fundraising email on Wednesday with the subject line, “Chaos, cats, and conspiracy.”","summary":"Donald Trump and his running mate on Friday continued to disparage Haitian migrants in an Ohio community, further fueling false claims.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/trump-and-vance-are-still-stoking-fears-of-haitian-migrants-as-ohio-community-faces-bomb-threats/6862acfe-b7f6-4303-9a45-ee0e2bc44fad","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/sJDtSlD80-8YtiZwPyH7QFa-drs=/698x2:4277x2014/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F697f4734-3e9e-4d02-9c14-15bfe52d1d5b","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:18:43","author":"9News,Associated Press","authors":["9News","Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":256376318,"title":"Trump Promises Mass Deportations Will Begin in Springfield and Aurora","text":"Former president Donald Trump promised his mass deportation plan would begin in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado—two cities at the center of anti-immigration talk this week.Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles, the Republican nominee in the 2024 election repeated claims of a Venezuelan gang takeover of Aurora, as well as unfounded accusations that Haitian migrants in Springfield have been eating residents' pets.\"We're going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country,\" Trump said Friday afternoon. \"And we're going to start with Springfield and Aurora.\"Trump has promised mass deportations as part of his election campaign for months, promising to bring in the army and local law enforcement to remove millions of illegal immigrants.At Friday's press conference, Trump promised to send them \"back to Venezuela\", after saying he would begin in Springfield where much of the migrant population is from Haiti.\"The people of Ohio are scared,\" Trump said Friday. \"The people of Colorado... you have a Governor there who is very weak, he doesn't know what to do.\"Trump and his running mate JD Vance have pushed the idea that Haitians in the Ohio city have been eating and stealing pets and livestock, squatting and spreading communicable diseases.Local officials and community leaders have sought to dispel these claims, but tensions have run high and bomb threats were made on Thursday and Friday, leading to the closures of schools and municipal buildings.Many of those who have moved to Springfield are there legally under Temporary Protected Status for Haitian migrants.In Aurora, Colorado, apartment complexes did see problems with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, with members of the notorious group moving in and causing issues for Venezuelan residents and others.The city's mayor, Mike Coffman, told Newsweek last Friday that the story had gotten out of hand and that the gang was not in charge of apartment buildings.

Back in the last century, I thought Joe Namath was a great football player, but I couldn’t care less what brand of toothpaste he used. Now Democrats exploit popular advertising methodology on Harris’ behalf as she conflates food with politics. Harris is very successful at diverting attention from issues of her predecessor’s administration into a debate on character. Did McDonald’s and Doritos get money or have to pay to help endow her with character? Her sharing of her collard greens recipe might backfire. It exacerbates my contempt of popular democracy as Harris stakes election chances on popular opinion, otherwise known as collective stupidity. Fred Gutmann Cupertino Standing up to Trump will benefit nation Donald Trump’s poor debate performance against Kamala Harris was illuminating. As a malignant narcissist and abuser, Trump expects to have his ego inflated and receive praise for mediocrity while being protected from the consequences of his own actions. The threats for not feeding his ego are both express and implied, such that our elections are under constant threat if they do not placate him. Those who enable him and minimize his failings represent millions of voters and far too many journalists and politicians who are conditioned to kowtow to narcissists and abusers, against all our best interests. Whether these people be presidents, CEOs, members of Congress or middle managers, America would be far healthier if it stood up to them instead of appeasing them. Voting for Harris and a Democratic Congress would be a big step in the right direction. Mathew Clark Campbell Swift endorsement came with civics lesson This election will be so close that a small number of votes might determine the winner. So every vote is crucial. At 82, I am not a devotee of Taylor Swift, although I admire her popularity and her ability to influence her fans. But I was quite impressed by her Instagram statement endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Why? Because her endorsement was accompanied by a model lesson in civic responsibility. She emphasized not only the importance of voting but also explained the need to register in order to vote. Her post redirected her followers to vote.gov, the official U.S. voter registration website. Harris is having a difficult time with younger voters. Perhaps Swift’s endorsement can influence some of her followers who might not have planned to vote. And even if that reaches just a few prospective Swifties, it might be just enough to affect the outcome. Thank you, Taylor.

Back in 2021, they were portrayed as victims of “racist” Border Patrol agents who were photographed “whipping” them while on horseback. The media ran with that story and had a line of politicians and pundits ready to add fuel to the fire by evoking our national history of slavery. For the left, this was another story confirming its claims about anti-black racism. A report came out the following year that stated agents didn’t whip anyone during the confrontation at the border. One agent who was investigated at the time won an award for his service earlier this year. The same people who are quick to generalize and stigmatize when mocking a foe can’t start squealing like stuck pigs when the same standard is applied to them. The latest political scandal involving Haitians is unfolding far from the southern border. Their role in the public imagination this time around is that of pet-eating savages terrorizing a small Midwestern town, not impoverished strivers victimized by racist law enforcement agents. Social media has been flooded with accusations that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, have been stealing and eating pets. Conservatives on X (formerly Twitter) have amplified the rumors, and President Trump brought them up at his debate with Kamala Harris on Tuesday. And just like the fake “whipping” controversy at the border, the current controversy obscures real issues in that community and important questions we should be asking about broader issues related to immigration and assimilation. These issues are complex, and they are made even more challenging when there is a higher demand for explosive — and at times, unsubstantiated — claims than sober policy analysis. Residents in Springfield have accused Haitians of causing accidents on the roads, while a PBS profile on the city featured an employer complimenting his Haitian employees on their work ethic and a church where Haitian families keep the pews from being completely empty. These firsthand accounts certainly paint a much more nuanced picture of life in Springfield than memes of pet theft and consumption. Make no mistake, there are real issues here, especially when close to 20,000 people move in a short time to a small city of 60,000. Any municipality that grows that quickly will have its resources, including public services and infrastructure, stressed and stretched. That type of rapid growth would be complicated even more if the new arrivals were people from another country who speak a different language and have unfamiliar — or even backward, by local standards — cultural practices. The people who have lived there have the right to ask questions and demand answers from their elected representatives. Change is never easy, especially when people feel they are being “replaced” by a new favored group. You can see this dynamic at play in cities where “gentrification” is frequently derided as an intentional attempt to displace poor and working-class black residents with wealthy white newcomers. You can also see it in small towns when immigrants from Central America or the Caribbean move into poor and working-class white neighborhoods. The challenges facing the people in Springfield are one issue. How they are discussed in the media, by politicians, and by social commentators is another. And right now, one question we should all be asking ourselves is how common a particular behavior must be among a group of people to describe the entire population generally. For example, let’s say five people — all black Haitians — in Springfield actually have eaten cats this year. Let’s imagine another five — all white Ohioans — have performed sex acts on dogs. Would the same people claiming Haitians are devouring pets approve of corporate media outlets and political commentators running stories about the threat people from Ohio pose to puppies? Perhaps they would. But given the sensitivities of most Americans — regardless of color or political party — I doubt it. I certainly suspect the “based” conservatives who have been gleefully sharing cat memes would have a very different reaction if Ohioans were being stereotyped on CNN with explosive claims based on shaky — if any — evidence. As a Christian who engages in social commentary, I always try to practice the biblical principle of impartial judgment. Matthew 7:2 says: For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. This is not always easy, but I think it’s a good way to guard against the worst aspects of collectivism — both unwarranted pride in my “tribe” as well as unwarranted contempt for “outsiders.” Most Americans, regardless of their background, are incredibly sensitive. People like Laura Loomer, one of President Trump’s most vocal surrogates, have no problem with stereotypes and inflammatory rhetoric as long as they are not aimed at their identity group. I understand the impulse. People who want to be judged as individuals often indulge in group guilt with those they don’t know, understand, or like. But this type of hypocrisy is unsustainable. The same people who are quick to generalize and stigmatize when mocking a foe can’t start squealing like stuck pigs when the same standard is applied to them. If there is one political animal that needs to meet a quick death, it’s anyone who has the tongue of a lion and the ears of a lamb.","summary":"Haitian migrants have officially been cemented as one of the preferred political props in America’s culture wars.\n\n\n\n\tBack in 2021, they were portrayed as victims of “racist” Border Patrol agents who were photographed “whipping” them while on horseback.

The DOJ’s survey from the Bureau of Justice statistics is self-reported instances of violent crime over the last six months — meaning that it includes crimes that may not have been reported to police. The annual National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) showed total instances of reported violent crime — including rape, robbery and aggravated assault — is up from 5.6 per 1,000 in 2020 to 8.7 per 1,000 in 2023. The highest recent rate of violent crime was in 2022, when the survey tracked 9.8 instances per 1,000 people over the age of 12. The rate of rape increased from 1.2 per 1,000 in 2020 to 1.7 in 2023, while robbery went from 1.6 per 1,000 in 2020 to 2.6 per 1,000 in 2023, and aggravated assault rose from 2.9 per 1,000 in 2020 to 4.5 per 1,000 in 2023. The question of whether crime has increased in the Harris-Biden administration compared to Trump’s was a major point of contention in Philadelphia Tuesday night, when the 45th president charged that “crime in this country is through the roof.” “President Trump,” Muir stepped in to say, “as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country.” The 2024 quarterly FBI report that Muir was likely referencing does not account for crimes that go unreported to police, but does show that violent crime decreased by 15.2% when comparing the first three months of 2023 to the same period this year. The FBI statistics included murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault under violent crimes — but was far from a complete picture, as only 72% of the law enforcement population participated in the report. Trump took a victory lap on Friday after the report was released, citing the Bureau of Statistics report during a press conference in southern California. “You remember where David Muir tried to correct me that crime is rampant like never before?” Trump told reporters. “I guess [the DOJ] probably watched the debate and they heard this foolish man, this foolish fool make that statement to me,” the 78-year-old added. The NCVS also showed other forms of crime were up from 2019, including stranger violence (8.1 per 1,000 compared to 11.4 per 1,000 in 2023) and violent crime with a weapon (4.0 per 1,000 vs 5.3 per 1,000 in 2023.) Motor car theft has also increased from 3.9 per 1,000 in 2019 to 6.1 per 1,000 in 2023. John Lott, former Justice Department senior adviser for research and statistics, told The Post that there are multiple reasons the discrepancy between the FBI and DOJ numbers. “There’s reasons why you could argue the number of crimes reported to police in the FBI data has gone down,” Lott said, pointing out that the number of law enforcement officers in cities like New York has “plummeted” over the past few years. He added that the NCVS was set up decades ago to account for crimes that don’t get reported to the police. “About 40% of violent crimes are reported to the police and about 30% of property crime are reported to police,” Lott went on, adding that the controversy boils down to a question of whether people care merely about reported crime, or “total crime.” “My guess is people care more about total crime,” he said.

ONLY President Trump will restore law and order. If Americans want to be safe, VOTE TRUMP.” ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post.","summary":"The annual National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) showed total instances of reported violent crime -- including rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- is up from 5.6 per 1,000 in 2020 to 8.7 per 1,000 in 2023.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/13/us-news/violent-crime-has-increased-doj-report-says-after-david-muir-disputed-trumps-claim-that-crime-is-through-the-roof/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89611512.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/2oOzfVRr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:59:29","author":"Diana Glebova","authors":["Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.456},{"id":256376178,"title":"Who is Laura Loomer? Conspiracy theorist blamed for Trump’s eating pets remark","text":"Right-wing conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer traveled with ex-President Donald Trump before and after the debate in which he repeated the baseless claim that Haitian immigrants are eating the dogs and cats of Springfield, Ohio, residents (Picture: AP) A conspiracy theorist close to ex-President Donald Trump has sparked concerns among allies that she has influenced him to make extreme remarks like immigrants eating pets. Laura Loomer, 31, a right-wing theorist and social media influencer, flew with the Republican nominee in his private jet to Tuesday night’s debate where he repeated a baseless claim about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. ‘They’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,’ Trump said in his showdown with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. ‘They’re eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.’ Trump reinforced his belief in the claim even when a moderator told him it had been debunked, saying he saw it ‘on television’. Who influenced Trump’s eating dogs and cats remark? The rumor had been circulating right-wing channels on the Internet, but many have suspected that Loomer, who had been posting about it, directly inspired Trump to utter it during the critical debate. Loomer on the day before the debate had aired the eating pets claim on X (formerly Twitter), where she has 1.2million followers. ‘Disturbing reports came out this weekend about Haitian immigrants eating people’s pets in Ohio where Democrats like @SenSherrodBrown and the Biden-Harris regime imported over 20,000 cannibalistic Haitians who are now killing people’s pets and hunting domestic animals on the streets of Ohio,’ she posted on Monday. https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1833137398093431131 ‘Vote for @berniemoreno. Bernie will help secure our border and he won’t allow Haitian invaders to eat your dogs and cats for dinner.’ A source close to the Trump campaign expressed ‘100%’ concern around Loomer’s closeness to Trump to the news outlet Semafor ‘Regardless of any guardrails the Trump campaign has put on her, I don’t think it’s working,’ said the source, but also added that Loomer did not participate in his debate preparations and that she was a ‘positive person to be around’. Who is Laura Loomer? Loomer, born in Arizona, describes herself as an ‘Investigative Journalist’ and ‘Feisty Jewess’ on her X profile. She has worked as a commentator for the far-right activist group Project Veritas, and for Alex Jones’ far-right conspiracy theory and fake news site, Infowars. Loomer ran unsuccessfully as a Florida congressional candidate twice – for House districts in Palm Beach County in 2020 with Trump’s backing, and in Central Florida in 2022. Besides flying with Trump the debate that many said he lost, Loomer accompanied him to an event the day after commemorating the 9/11 attacks. Loomer has also attended numerous events at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home. What has Trump said about Loomer? Trump addressed Loomer on Friday amid rising backlash against her from his base. ‘I don’t know. Laura is a supporter. She’s a strong person,’ he said during a press conference in California. ‘I don’t control Laura. I can’t tell Laura what to do.’ Trump distanced himself from Loomer a day after doubling down on the eating pets claim and dragging yet another animal into the mix. ‘They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park, in the lake,’ he said during a rally in Tucson, Arizona. ‘And even walking away with their pets. “My dog’s been taken.”‘ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Tim Walz, could be working for the Chinese. Walz has a long history with the country, dating back to 1989 when he taught English at a Chinese high school. However, he has spent his political career criticizing the Chinese government, especially its human rights record. \"We all know that Kamala Harris wanted to outsource our factories and jobs to China, but I didn't expect her to outsource the selection of her running mate to China, too,\" Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, said during a campaign stop in Asheboro, North Carolina, in August. In September, during their presidential debate, Harris argued that Trump \"sold us out\" to China by \"selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military,\" and she noted her rival's praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping. During the Biden administration, the U.S. implemented export controls to help try to keep American technology out of China. Restrictions on advanced semiconductors and chip-manufacturing equipment were tightened a year later. But during her campaign, Harris has offered scant details about how her China policy would differ from President Biden's. The president has portrayed China as an authoritarian rival seeking to surpass the U.S. as the leading global power. Trump has emphasized trade relations, accusing China of taking advantage of the U.S. through its economic policies. Here's a look at the two candidates' records and what they've said about China. U.S.-China relations In her Democratic National Convention speech in August, Harris said the U.S., not China, \"wins the competition for the 21st century.\" It was a line she repeated at the debate. She met briefly with Xi in 2022 in Bangkok amid friction between the two countries. Harris said she stressed the need to \"maintain open lines of communication to responsibly manage the competition between our countries.\" In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" in 2023, Harris attributed \"tension\" in the relationship to the competition between the two nations. \"But that does not mean that we are seeking conflict,\" she said, adding that the U.S.-China economic relationship is \"not about decoupling — it is about de-risking.\" \"It's not about pulling out, but it is about ensuring that we are protecting American interests and that we are a leader in terms of the rules of the road, as opposed to following others' rules,\" Harris said. Trump has sought to portray himself as a staunch critic of China, while also professing his admiration for its leader. In a recent interview with Fox News host Mark Levin, Trump said he \"respected\" China and Xi, adding that he'd \"rather have a good relationship with China.\" He previously called Xi a \"brilliant guy\" who \"runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist.\" But Trump has threatened to escalate his trade war with China, floating a tariff of 60% or more on Chinese goods. He has also proposed revoking China's Most Favored Nation trade status, phasing out all imports of essential goods from China and banning China from buying U.S. farmland. During Trump's first term in the White House, the Justice Department launched the controversial China Initiative, which sought to crack down on Chinese economic espionage.He has vowed to ramp up efforts to stop China from spying on the U.S., saying last year that \"a reformed FBI and Justice Department will be hunting down Chinese spies\" and new visa and travel restrictions will \"shut off Chinese access to American secrets.\" TaiwanHarris has reaffirmed U.S. support for Taiwan, a self-governing island that China views as its territory. The U.S. has a longstanding \"One China\" policy that does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation, nor does it recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. While visiting the Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan in September 2022, Harris said the U.S. opposes \"any unilateral change to the status quo.\" \"We will continue to support Taiwan's self-defense, consistent with our longstanding policy,\" she said. She also condemned China's aggression in the South China Sea, accusing it of \"undermining key elements of the international rules-based order\" and coercing and intimidating its neighbors. Trump, however, told Bloomberg Businessweek in July that Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection, accusing it of stealing business from the U.S. chip industry. Human rights abusesIn the Senate, Harris co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which put conditions on the U.S.-Hong Kong trade relationship. The bill was introduced amid a Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy protests in the former British colony. Harris also co-sponsored the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. The bill authorized sanctions against those responsible for human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Trump signed both into law.","summary":"A look at the records and statements of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on China in the final weeks before the 2024 presidential election.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-harris-china-2024/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/13/dfe354f2-ac65-4500-b241-21ae33788122/thumbnail/1200x630/a8644e773d4c45f9bc5706cb4ff629b7/gettyimages-2170486375.jpg?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3185439_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:48:00","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.011},{"id":256376256,"title":"Kamala Harris discusses gun control and the economy in a one-on-one interview with 6abc Philadelphia’s Brian Taff.","text":"JOHNSTOWN, Pennsylvania — Vice President Kamala Harris sat down one-on-one for an exclusive interview on Friday with anchor Brian Taff of sister station 6abc in Philadelphia. It’s the first solo interview since she was selected as the Democratic nominee for president. Brian traveled to western Pennsylvania to meet up with the vice president as she was campaigning in Johnstown. She visited ‘Classic Elements,’ a small cafe and bookstore as part of a campaign swing through the Keystone State. Harris’ rise to the top of the ticket has been anything but ordinary. She has had a very shortened window to convey her biography and her priorities to the voters she’s going to need to win in November. So if the first phase of her shortened candidacy was her biography phase, you might see this closing chapter is the policy one: telling people what she’s going to do on topics like crime and public safety, two major issues for the country. On guns in America Brian asked Harris where she draws the line in America on gun ownership and gun use. “I am a gun owner and Tim Walz, my running mate, is also a gun owner. We’re not taking anyone’s guns away. I support the Second Amendment and I support reasonable gun safety laws,” Harris said. “I feel very strongly that it is consistent with the Second Amendment and your right to own a gun to also say we need an assault weapons ban. They’re literally tools of war,” Harris continued. “I say we need universal background checks. The majority of NRA members support that. Why? It’s just reasonable. You just might want to know.” On the economy Brian pointed out that Harris talks about bringing down prices and making life more affordable for people. “What are one or two specific things you have in mind for that?” Brian asked. “When I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people, and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business,” she said. “So my opportunity economy plan includes giving startups a $50,000 tax deduction to start their small business. It used to be $5,000. Nobody can start a small business with $5,000,” Harris continued. “Opportunity economy means, look, we don’t have enough housing in America. We have a housing supply shortage, and what that means, in particular, for so many younger Americans, the American Dream is elusive, it’s just actually not attainable,” said Harris. “To help people who just want to get their foot in the door, literally, and so giving first-time homebuyers a $25,000 down payment assistance,” she said. On reaching undecided voters Brian also asked the vice president how she plans to reach voters who are on the fence heading into the November election. “On the appeal of the man you’re running against: as you drove here today, you likely saw a lot of Trump signs. He has a historic appeal in this country, and as someone running against him and trying to understand that, I wonder how you distill it? What do you understand his appeal to be? And how do you speak to his voters, and maybe people who share his values, but are open to something else?” Brian asked. “I, based on experience, and a lived experience, know in my heart, I know in my soul, I know, that the vast majority of us as Americans have so much more in common than what separates us. And I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader that brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other,” Harris said. Brian also asked Harris about any policies she has that are different from President Joe Biden and what she wishes Americans knew about her.

This type of behavior should never be tolerated.” Loomer subsequently claimed Graham had been “disloyal” to Trump. and called Taylor Greene a “raging anti semite.” She fired back similarly at Tillis—whose name she consistently misspelled—in a lengthy post two and a half hours after his own, labeling her latest critic a “RINO who attacked President Trump after January 6 and called for all of the January 6 political prisoners to remain in jail.

It was not any specific concerning event or threats to national security that alarmed her, but what she believed was ‘gender-biased’ language in the report. The intelligence officer briefing Harris was a woman, but Harris requested a system wide assessment of the intelligence community to ensure it would not happen again, according to Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, citing anonymous sources in the national security intelligence community. Harris urged intelligence agencies to provide training for their analysts so that the use of gender-bias would not happen again. The episode reveals Harris as an executive who continues wrestling with frustrations over how the world treats women in politics. As the first female vice president, Harris has tried to adjust elements of the job to fit her gender. Some of the changes are easy physical adjustments to change the basic infrastructure of the job. After Harris took office, her team realized that the desk chairs in her office needed to be replaced so she could fit in them, the New York Times reported, as the vice president is 5 foot 2 inches. She also made sure her office included significantly more women on her staff than previous vice presidents, signaling her commitment to gender diversity. Harris has also felt the need to speak out as the first female vice president, leaning into her promotion of gender issues. In July 2021, Harris delivered a speech in France at a forum hosted by French President Emanuel Macron about gender equality. ‘If we want to strengthen democracy, we must fight for gender equality. Because here is the truth: Democracy is strongest when everyone participates and it is weaker when people are left out,’ the vice president said. In May 2023, Harris spoke at a EMILY’s List gala and condemned Republicans for trying to eliminate ‘gender ideology’ from publicly funded classrooms. ‘Well, so what are we talking about here? Classes that teach women’s history, women’s equality?’ she asked as the mostly female audience applauded. ‘The study of the fact that there are still only 25 women in the United States Senate in a body of 100?’ Her awareness of the idea of government executives as male prompted her to speak about the presidency using female pronouns, as she did during her failed presidential campaign. ‘It’s important for people to understand that they have to really check how they’re thinking about these things. But we have to help along the way, and part of it is about how we use language,’ she told Buzzfeed in October 2019. Harris grew more despondent as voters increasingly lost interest in her campaign, prompting her to blame voters’ perspectives about her gender. ‘Is America ready for a woman, and a woman of color to be president of the United States?’ she wondered during an interview with Axios, pointing out that she was burdened by her gender and questions of ‘electability.’ ‘There is a lack of ability or a difficulty in imagining that someone who we have never seen can do a job that has been done, you know, forty-five times by someone who is not that person,’ she concluded. As Harris is running for president in 2024, however, she and her political team has shifted away from an emphasis on her gender. The Washington Post reported Friday that Harris has specifically turned to former aides for President Barack Obama to help her steer away from conversations about her race and gender, which they consider to be a distraction. Other former staffers for Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign expressed regret for focusing too much on her gender, as she experienced a chance to make history as the first female president of the United States. Some have joined the Harris team with the intent on avoiding past mistakes. “I feel like I learned really valuable lessons during the Clinton campaign and then in working through a lot of research in the eight years since about the kind of questions we have for women candidates and how you best support them,’ former Clinton strategist Jennifer Palmeri said to the Post.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n When Vice President Kamala Harris got her first personal intelligence briefings in office,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris to Investigate &#8216;Gender-Bias&#8217; Language in Classified Reports first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/kamala-harris-to-investigate-gender-bias-language-in-classified-reports/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-moved-to-probe-gender-bias-language.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:34:17","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.237},{"id":256374906,"title":"Pennsylvania Supreme Court rules mail ballots with incorrect dates won't be counted","text":"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Friday that mail ballots that are improperly dated won't be counted in November, a move that could have major implications in the closely divided battleground state. The decision reverses a lower court ruling from last month that found it was unconstitutional to reject mail ballots that had a missing or incorrect date. The bureaucratic requirements of ballots in Pennsylvania have long been the subject of litigation, with opponents of the date requirements arguing that they unnecessarily disenfranchise eligible voters. A group of voting rights advocates went to court in May seeking to block the provision, which required election officials to reject ballots that were incorrectly dated, even if the ballot reached them by the statutory deadline of 8 p.m. on Election Day. The Republican National Committee and Pennsylvania Republican Party stepped in to support of the date provision, arguing it was important to protect elections. Their appeal of the Commonwealth Court's ruling from two weeks ago was successful on Friday. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley praised the ruling as a \"HUGE election integrity win\" in a post on X. \"This makes mail voting in the Keystone State less susceptible to fraud,\" he said. \"We will keep fighting and winning!\" Attorneys with the voting rights groups involved in the lawsuit, including the ACLU and the Public Interest Law Center, said because the state Supreme Court ruled the lower court lacked jurisdiction, more action on the case was possible. \"Today’s procedural ruling is a setback for Pennsylvania voters, but we will keep fighting for them. These eligible voters who got their ballots in on time should have their votes counted and voices heard,\" Steve Loney, an attorney for the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said in a statement. \"The fundamental right to vote is among the most precious rights we enjoy as Pennsylvanians, and it should take more than a trivial paperwork error to take it away.\" Pennsylvania has yet to start sending mail ballot to voters, as a handful of third-party challenges are still being litigated in the courts. Even a small number of mail ballots getting thrown out due to incorrect or missing dates could have significant ramifications in Pennsylvania, a state President Joe Biden won over former President Donald Trump by less than 82,000 votes in 2020. According to Votebeat, a nonpartisan outlet that focuses on election reporting, more than 4,400 mail ballots were rejected in Pennsylvania's most recent primary due to date issues. Democrats have utilized mail voting more heavily than Republicans in recent elections in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. The state, with 19 electoral votes up for grabs, is once again a critical battleground in the presidential race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. It is also hosting a contest between Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick that could be crucial to determining which party controls the Senate.","summary":"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that mail ballots that are improperly dated won't be counted in November, a move that could have major implications in the battleground state.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/pennsylvania-supreme-court-mail-ballots-incorrect-dates-rcna170819","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240912-mail-in-ballots-ch-1113-6553d5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:33:23","author":"Jane C.

The incident took place in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Biden was there for a 9/11 memorial service and had visited the local fire station. That's where things got interesting. POTUS met a Trump supporter at the station and in a nice gesture, gave the man a hat with the presidential seal and autograph. In return, the MAGA supporter handed Biden his 'Trump 2024' cap. Soon the crowd urged Biden to try on the cap. Biden, however, replied, \"I ain't going that far!\" What happened next surprised everyone gathered! The senior Democrat put the apparel on and was caught on video. Viral clips of the same showed Biden smiling and chatting with the group, briefly wearing the hat before taking it off. Trump's campaign was quick to highlight the incident on social media. \"Thanks for the support, Joe!\" they wrote. MAGA fans, thrilled, chimed in. An X user exclaimed, \"Shit, even Sleepy Joe knows the world needs Trump to win.\" Another remarked, \"Sleepy Joe is endorsing [Trump] now after Comrade Kamala's ultra-catastrophic debate under-performance last night!\" Others brought up Trump's earlier claim that Biden can't stand his vice president. \"See, Trump was right. Joe Biden does hate Kamala Harris,\" one commented. Trump in the presidential debate claimed that President Biden hates Harris. \"I will give you a little secret, [Biden] hates her. He can't stand her.\" He added, \"But he got 14 million votes. They threw him out. She got zero votes. And when she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed. And now she’s running,\" Trump stated, referring to Harris' failed 2020 presidential candidacy. The White House had to step in to explain to Democrats across the nation. Andrew Bates, a spokesperson, clarified, \"At the Shanksville Fire Station, @POTUS spoke about the country's bipartisan unity after 9/11 and said we needed to get back to that. As a gesture, he gave a hat to a Trump supporter who then said that in the same spirit, POTUS should put on his Trump cap. He briefly wore it,\" as reported by Newsweek. The explanation did not silence the conversation, however. Trump supporters continued to celebrate while Biden's team tried to control the narrative. Biden's Shanksville event followed a heated presidential debate. Trump and Kamala Harris clashed on many issues during the ABC-moderated event. Trump even joked about sending a MAGA hat to Harris. He claimed, \"She's going to my philosophy now. In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat,\" as per The Independent. The timing of Biden's incident hence couldn't be better for Trump.","summary":"The senior Democrat, much to the excitement of Republicans, put the hat on and was caught on video smiling.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/biden-sends-maga-fans-into-frenzy-by-putting-on-a-trump-2024-hat-but-white-claims-bipartisan-unity","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/715427/uploads/82df6610-70f2-11ef-aa2e-8ba5cfd90390_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:30:21","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":256374880,"title":"Investigating the Reality of Trump’s Claims in Springfield, Ohio: Neo-Nazis, Desperate Residents, and Reports of Gun Battles","text":"For better or – more likely – worse, it was vintage Trump. ‘In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,’ the 78-year-old presidential nominee declared in his debate with Kamala Harris. ‘The people that came in – they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country.’ To a stunned audience of 67 million Americans – and countless more around the world – Trump was inflaming explosive social media rumours that -Haitian immigrants had descended on a small -Midwestern city and were stealing pets for food. The debate’s moderator, ABC’s David Muir, slapped down the ex-president, saying: ‘The city manager told us there were no credible reports of pets being harmed… by the immigrant community.’ Trump shot back: ‘I’ve seen people on television… saying, ‘My dog was taken and used for food.’ ‘So maybe he said that and maybe that’s a good thing to say for a city manager.’ The local police department later announced that it had ‘no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community’. ‘Trump Repeats False Claim About Immigrants,’ sniffed The New York Times. ‘Racist smear,’ declared The Washington Post. ‘Baseless claim,’ insisted the BBC. Case closed? Perhaps so. Yet the extraordinary allegations have drawn unwelcome attention to a small city that, as the Mail discovered this week, has been left reeling by a dramatic recent surge in mass migration. When we visited Springfield this week, the mood was febrile. On the day we arrived, soon after Trump’s claims, a bomb threat ‘using hateful -language towards immigrants and Haitians’, according to the mayor, had closed down both the City Hall and an elementary school. In downtown Springfield, military veteran Ken McGravy, 68, stressed that he had no proof that pets were being stolen, though he did claim there were ‘suspiciously’ fewer wild birds in the city’s -Snyder Park. He added: ‘There’s a lot of hatred in Springfield – a lot of rednecks who are really racist. ‘I was born in Springfield and I genuinely fear that, knowing the place as I do, bullets might start to fly.’ Indeed, Springfield has become a case study for America’s increasingly toxic immigration debate. Overall, some 11 million illegal migrants are believed to be living in the US – a significant proportion of whom entered under Joe Biden’s presidency. Alongside abortion rights, the issue is among the most crucial in November’s election. Since 2020, about 15,000 Haitians have -settled in Springfield – meaning that about one in five people in the small city now hails from an impoverished Caribbean country 1,600 miles away. Haiti is a failed state, racked by lawlessness and violence inflicted by bloodthirsty gangs who control 90 per cent of its territory. Thousands of Haitians have been killed or injured in gang warfare this year alone; 180,000 children are currently displaced; the vast majority of the country is at risk of starvation and earlier this year corpses littered the streets of the capital Port-au-Prince amid a total breakdown of law and order. Though many Haitians are in Springfield legally and have work permits, the speed of the influx and the extent of the cultural differences have led to tensions between the new arrivals and some of those who have always called the city home. During a city commission meeting last month, one long-term Springfield resident alleged: ‘These Haitians are [driving] into trash cans, running into buildings, they’re flipping cars in the middle of the streets. ‘They’re in the park, grabbing up ducks by their neck and cutting their head off and walking off with them. They’re eating them.’ This week, The New York Post reported claims that a Springfield resident called 911 to report seeing four Haitian migrants snatching geese near a city park, according to an audio recording and police report obtained by the conservative Federalist news outlet. Police have not disputed the story’s legitimacy. Another Springfield woman went viral online recently after pleading with city officials: ‘It is so unsafe… I have men that cannot speak English in my front yard screaming at me, throwing mattresses… [and] throwing trash. ‘Look at me, I weigh 95 pounds. I couldn’t defend myself if I had to.’ She added that she and her elderly husband had decided they will leave their home of 45 years. Unlike many Midwestern cities, Springfield is visibly regenerating after half a century of economic decline. Amazon runs a large distribution centre and is planning to build a 100,000 sq ft $30million warehouse outside the town. Neat redbrick buildings house coffee shops and bistros. Colourful murals celebrating the city adorn walls. Road signs proclaim: ‘Springfield, find your unwind.’ But, when we spoke to Priscilla Marrs, 53, as she waited to pick up her daughter Courtney from her job at Dunkin’ Donuts, she didn’t mince her words. ‘There’s wrecks everywhere. You have to watch it when you drive around here. The crashes, it’s cos of them [the -Haitians].’ She added: ‘They follow you around when you’re in Walmart. You just can’t go anywhere without them taking all the groceries [stealing from you].’ Courtney was equally vocal, saying: ‘I don’t care for ’em. I used to work with them almost four years in a factory. They’re rude, they’re disrespectful. I feel like they’re taking all of our good stuff away from us Americans, like our cars, our housing, our jobs.’ Outside City Hall, shuttered due to the bomb threat, Amazon worker and mother-of-three -Jessica McNair was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with a famous photograph of Trump raising his fist after surviving an assassination attempt in July. ‘This is our country,’ she told us. ‘Then they come here, get housing, they get a car, they get welfare. What about our homeless people being kicked out of their houses just so they can put Haitians in them? They should just go back to their country. This ain’t Springfield, it’s Little Haiti.’ Despite these concerns, none of the Springfield residents we spoke to told us they had seen Haitians stealing or eating pets. So where did the bizarre rumours start? On August 16, police in the Ohio city of Canton – 170 miles from Springfield – arrested a woman who had reportedly stamped on a cat’s head then eaten the animal in front of horrified witnesses. In shocking bodycam footage, officers order the suspect to put her hands behind her back, one saying: ‘Someone got rubber gloves? She’s covered in blood.’ An officer orders the woman: ‘Smile for me. Did you eat that cat? Did you eat it?’ The woman bares her teeth and shakes her head. ‘Why’d you kill it?’ he demands. Allexis Ferrell, 27, was arrested on charges of ‘prohibitions concerning companion -animals, cruelty to animals and disorderly conduct’. A police report claimed she was found ‘squatting on a cat which appeared to have its head smashed in and the female with her hands on it… with fur on her lips and blood on her hands’. The report added: ‘Officers were able to determine that Allexis had smashed the cat’s head with her foot then began to eat the cat.’ Ms Ferrell, who is black, is a US national – not Haitian – and Canton police confirmed: ‘She is a lifelong Canton resident.’ Yet that did not stop malicious individuals from circulating the revolting footage online for their own purposes. One YouTube video, since removed, was falsely titled: Haitian Woman Eats Neighbour’s Cat in Springfield. The same footage has likely been viewed millions of times across X/Twitter and other social media sites, and remains in frequent circulation today, often wrongly claiming Ms Ferrell is Haitian. It appears that this disturbed woman’s case was weaponised to drum up hatred against migrants in Springfield and, by extension, across America – with the election less than two months away. In Springfield, tensions have been running especially high amid a raft of driving accidents allegedly caused by Haitian migrants. Last August, a minivan driven by a 36-year-old Haitian immigrant without a licence collided head-on with a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy and hospitalising 20 other children. The victim’s father urged: ‘Don’t spin this towards hate.’ But it may be too late for that. Last month Blood Tribe, an armed neo-Nazi group led by a former US marine, marched in Springfield waving swastika flags and yelling racist slogans. ‘I’ve come to bring a word of warning,’ one of the group’s leaders, another former marine, told a town forum this month. ‘Stop what you’re doing before it’s too late. Crime and savagery will only increase with every Haitian you bring in.’ Another neo-Nazi outfit in Ohio, Active Club, wrote on its Telegram social media channel recently: ‘The thousands of Haitian and West African invaders currently being housed in Ohio all have a tribe. Here’s ours.’ In this context, it is surely incumbent on the Trump campaign to avoid escalating tensions further. But even before the debate, the ex-president had posted AI-generated ‘memes’ on his Truth Social account showing cats wearing red Make America Great Again hats. Two days ago, at a campaign stop in Arizona, Trump doubled down on his claims: ‘A recording of 911 calls show that [Springfield] residents are reporting that the migrants are walking off with the town’s geese. ‘They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park, in the lake. And even walking off with their pets. ‘My dog’s been taken! My dog’s been stolen!’ Meanwhile, Trump’s running mate JD Vance – Ohio’s junior senator – has also done his best to inflame the rumours. Vance, who attracted accusations of misogyny after a 2021 interview in which he had called his Democrat opponents ‘childless cat ladies’, wrote online this week: ‘My office has [recently] received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbours’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants. ‘It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumours will turn out to be false. Do you know what’s confirmed? ‘That a child was murdered by a Haitian migrant who had no right to be here [apparently a reference to the deadly school bus crash]… that communicable diseases – like TB and HIV – have been on the rise. ‘That local schools have struggled to keep up with newcomers who don’t know English. That rents have risen so fast.’ Similarly, Ted Cruz, a Texas senator and former Republican presidential candidate, gleefully posted a picture of kittens alongside a caption urging Americans to vote for Trump ‘so Haitian immigrants don’t eat us’. At Springfield’s bustling Rose Goute Creole Restaurant, manager Romane Pierre, 41, told the Mail he feared for the consequences of all this. ‘Many people in our community are shocked by Donald Trump’s words and genuinely fear what could happen next,’ he said. ‘Some are considering leaving Springfield. Haitians in this town don’t have guns – but Americans do. Let me tell you, Haitians don’t eat dogs, they don’t eat cats. My people, they like goat.’ Pierre fled Port-au-Prince in 2020 after his computer business was ransacked by an armed gang and he was told his life was under threat. ‘It’s chaos in Haiti,’ he said. ‘I feared for my life and felt I had no alternative but to leave. Here we feel we have some security and with hard work and ambition we can make something of ourselves.’ He pointed to a large floral arrangement on the restaurant counter. ‘A lot of Americans come in here. They like Haitians. After the presidential debate, some of them brought us those flowers. There’s hope.’ At Springfield’s Haitian Community Help And Support Center, Rose-Thamar Joseph, 40, told us she fled Port-au-Prince four years ago after a gang stopped her car and shot at it, apparently in a targeted attack. ‘We were stuck in traffic. This gang came out and just started shooting. ‘That kind of thing happens all the time there. Shootings, kidnappings – nobody can feel safe.’ Despite the escalating tensions in her adopted country, she said: ‘I just want to say to the American people: thank you.’ There is no doubt that the surge of migrants arriving in America – and across the West – brings with it concerns about assimilation and access to shared resources. But this troubling story also tells us much about the power of information in the social media age – and the willingness of some people to bend the facts to suit themselves.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFor better or – more likely – worse, it was vintage Trump.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Investigating the Reality of Trump&#8217;s Claims in Springfield, Ohio: Neo-Nazis, Desperate Residents, and Reports of Gun Battles first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/investigating-the-reality-of-trumps-claims-in-springfield-ohio-neo-nazis-desperate-residents-and-reports-of-gun-battles/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/13/22/89655723-13848669-During_a_debate_with_Kamala_Harris_former_President_Donald_Trump-a-44_1726262159831.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:29:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.177},{"id":256378584,"title":"Trump: Kamala Harris Is the 'Godmother of Sanctuary Cities'","text":"Former President Donald Trump called Vice President Kamala Harris the “Godmother of sanctuary cities” on Friday in California as he highlighted her record of lenience toward violent criminals as San Francisco district attorney. As Breitbart News has noted, Harris was often soft on major crime but tough on minor and non-violent offenders, pursuing thousands of people for marijuana possession, and even prosecuting parents of truant schoolchildren. She was district attorney from 2004 to 2011, a period that many locals associate with the start of the city’s decline. As Trump noted, she was a champion of “sanctuary city” policies, which — as a statement of defiance against immigration law — prevent local authorities from assisting federal immigration law enforcement. In practice, the policy has attracted more illegal aliens to sanctuary cities — including criminals, who know they will not be deported. As California Attorney General, Harris threatened to take legal action against local law enforcement agencies that cooperated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and she once backed a national “sanctuary” policy. During a news conference at his golf course in Rancho Palos Verdes, near Los Angeles, Trump presented a list of violent criminals that, he said, she had been lenient towards during her eight years as San Francisco D.A.: One was Edwin Ramos, whose case was described by the New York Post: Ramos’ gruesome killings of three members of the Bologna family — Tony Bologna, 48, and his sons Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16 — rocked national headlines and led then-Mayor Gavin Newsom to change the city’s policies on juvenile crimes. Before the triple shooting, Ramos had been arrested several times as a juvenile for being involved in a gang-related assault on a bus passenger and an attempted robbery of a pregnant woman, per the San Francisco Chronicle. In both cases, he was not referred to federal authorities because it was a city policy not to question the immigration status of juveniles. Harris did not seek Ramos’s deportation, nor did she seek the death penalty for Ramos, the Post noted. Another was was Rony Aguilera, an illegal alien whom the San Francisco Chronicle noted had been arrested for assault, but was not deported, and who then went on to murder a 14-year-old boy using a sword. Trump also noted that Harris had launched what critics called a “fire sale for plea deals” for criminals in the city. Among these, Trump said, were David Taylor, whose case was described by the Washington Free Beacon: A San Francisco homicide investigator blasted Harris over her handling of the murder case of David Taylor, who confessed to beating and stabbing his 65-year-old mother to death in a drug-induced haze. Harris’s office took over the case, and agreed to a voluntary manslaughter charge against Taylor, which carried a 12-year prison sentence. Trump also noted the fact that Harris refused to seek the death penalty for the murder of San Francisco Police Department officer Isaac Espinoza, provoking outrage even from Democrats, such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). And he emphasized that Harris had backed fellow radical prosecutors likeGeorge Gascón — her successor in San Francisco, before he was elected in Los Angeles County — whom many residents blame for an ongoing crime wave.

They're eating — they're eating the pets of the people that live there.\" Although ABC moderator David Muir said the city manager disputed this claim, which was also made by Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, Trump insisted he had seen people saying so on television. After the debate, Trump also shared AI-generated posts that showed pets supporting his presidential candidacy.Speaking at his golf course at a vista above the Pacific Ocean, the Republican presidential nominee said he's going to bring those migrants \"back to Venezuela,\" although most of the migrants in Springfield are Haitian. Thousands of Haitians have moved to the 58,000-person town of Springfield in the last few years, which Ohio's Republican governor says has burdened the local health care infrastructure. But the vast majority of Haitian migrants are in the U.S. legally and are authorized to work. In the last two fiscal years, the U.S. has processed 156,000 Haitian migrants at the southern border, according to Customs and Border Protection figures. Of those, about 98% of them have been processed at legal entry points, mostly after securing appointments through a U.S. government app to enter the country legally.Thousands of Haitians are in the U.S. legally under two programs: Temporary protected status, or TPS, provides deportation protections and work permits to immigrants from countries experiencing armed conflict, environmental disasters and other humanitarian emergencies. The program does not offer permanent legal status. During the Biden administration, the U.S. also began a new humanitarian parole program for Haitians, Nicaraguans, Cubans and Venezuelans that would allow people from these countries to live and work in the U.S. for two years without fear of deportation if they have a sponsor here who would provide them with financial support.The Associated Press notes that after the pandemic, many Haitians moved to Springfield, which suffered a heavy decline in manufacturing in the 1990s, resulting in a shrinking population. But in recent years, the city has seen an uptick in labor demand, and Haitians have helped fill the jobs. Springfield's mayor, police chief and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, all say there have been no credible reports that pets are being stolen and eaten by migrants. Some Springfield government and school buildings were closed Thursday due to bomb threats, according to a city statement. Vance is still casting Springfield as an example of poor immigration policy.\"In Springfield, Ohio, there has been a massive rise in communicable diseases, rent prices, car insurance rates, and crime,\" Vance posted to \"X\" on Friday. \"This is what happens when you drop 20,000 people into a small community. Kamala Harris's immigration policy aims to do this to every town in our country.\"Gov. DeWine announced new state support for Springfield as it deals with large numbers of Haitian migrants. DeWine's office said the migrants from Haiti have generally had little or no health care services, including vaccinations. The state is dedicating $2.5 million to expanding primary care access for Springfield residents. \"I want the people of Springfield and Clark County to know that as we move forward, we will continue to do everything we can to help the community deal with this surge of migrants,\" DeWine said. \"The federal government has not demonstrated that they have any kind of plan to deal with the issue. We will not walk away.\"Mr. Biden on Friday blasted the rhetoric from Trump and other Republicans about Haitians in the U.S. during an event honoring Black excellence at the White House. He referred to Haitians in Springfield as \"a community that's under attack in our country right now. It's simply wrong.\" Mr. Biden said of Trump, \"This has to stop, what he's doing.

Trump seemingly retaliated to Swift’s endorsement by dropping a knock-off version of her color-blocked top on Friday. The original design features a black-and-white image of the pop star surrounded by photos from each of her studio albums, differentiated by varying colors. Underneath the pictures, the text reads, “Taylor Swift The Eras Tour.” In Trump’s version, he kept the colors and formatting identical to the original but substituted pictures of Swift for photos of himself. “Donald J. Trump,” the T-shirts read, alongside his slogan, “Make America Great Again.” The former president, 78, also used the same font as the “Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince” singer, 34. Reps for Swift and Trump did not immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment. The images quickly spread on X Friday, with many Swifties urging the 14-time Grammy winner to take legal action against the Republican presidential nominee. “Taylor should sue him for copyright,” one person wrote, to which another agreed, “taylor needs to take strict action because he is literally giving over obsessed.” “So a 78 year old man who is currently in the running for the role of the president is taking a petty dig at a young woman for having an opinion?” another asked. Trump’s latest merch drop came just a few days after Swift voiced her support for the vice president, 59, following the candidates’ first debate. “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election,” Swift wrote on Instagram. “I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.” Swift praised the Democratic nominee for being “a steady-handed, gifted leader” who she believes will lead the country by “calm and not chaos.” Although Swift centered her post around Harris’ strengths, she also slammed Trump for falsely claiming she endorsed him last month by sharing AI-generated images of her online. Swift revealed his social media activity was part of why she decided to speak out. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site,” she wrote. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation.” “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” she continued. “The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.” The following day, Trump brushed off the pop star’s endorsement, calling Swift “a very liberal person” whom he was never a “fan” of. Although he warned she might “pay a price for it in the marketplace” for going against him, he clearly thinks she still has some selling power.","summary":"The 14-time Grammy winner announced earlier this week that she would be voting for Kamala Harris in the upcoming 2024 presidential election.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/09/13/celebrity-news/donald-trump-releases-knock-off-eras-tour-shirts-as-campaign-merch-after-taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/89612512.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bFxtE3oX-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:19:01","author":"Nicki Cox","authors":["Nicki Cox"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.173},{"id":256374912,"title":"The AI Taylor Swift endorsement Trump shared was originally a pro-Biden Facebook meme","text":"The artificial intelligence-generated image of Taylor Swift endorsing Donald Trump, which the singer said inspired her to endorse Kamala Harris for president this week, came from an unlikely place. The image, which caused controversy in August after being shared by the former president on Truth Social, originally circulated with text reading, “Taylor wants you to vote for Joe Biden,” and was posted in a pro-Biden Facebook group with just 8,000 members in December 2023. That post was viewed by NBC News. A reverse-image search conducted by NBC News did not find any earlier incidences of the image being posted online. After the pro-Biden image featuring the AI-generated Swift was first posted on Facebook, it began to travel around the pro-Biden internet, particularly among Gen X and baby boomer supporters of the then-candidate. The Facebook group it was initially posted in is largely a place for Democrats to share memes and information in support of Biden and against Trump. The image also traveled to X and Instagram’s messaging platform, Threads. S. E. Hinton, author of “The Outsiders,” shared it on X in December. It was posted in a liberal subreddit the same month. “I am a Boomer for Biden,” one X post of the image was captioned in January. The image’s creator, a Democrat, asked NBC News to keep his identity private, wanting to avoid backlash. Inspired by Swift’s 2020 endorsement of Biden, he said he used a generative AI platform to create an image from the text prompt “Taylor Swift as Uncle Sam,” then used Photoshop to add text over it. On Aug. 17, around nine months after it was posted with the pro-Biden text, a pro-Trump X account with over 340,000 followers posted an edited version that read, “Taylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.” The X account did not respond to a request for comment about whether it edited the image itself or where it came from. The next day, Trump posted a screenshot of the X post on his Truth Social account with the caption, “I accept!” “I woke up one morning and I got a text message from somebody who sent me a picture of the altered version and said, ‘Was this you?’ I was like, ‘Yeah that’s an altered version of my original,’” the person who created the AI image of Swift endorsing Biden told NBC News in a phone interview. “I didn’t think much of it until I sat down and started looking at the news. It started blowing up from there, with people saying Taylor might sue him and I thought, ‘Holy crap, what did I do?’” On Tuesday, after the presidential debate between Trump and Harris, Swift posted an endorsement for Harris on Instagram. In the caption, she cited the AI-generated image Trump posted as one of the reasons why she wanted to make her stance known publicly. “Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift wrote. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.” Swift included a link to the official voter registration website in the Instagram Story announcing her endorsement. In the 24 hours that followed, more than 400,000 people clicked the link from her account. “I agree with Taylor that AI, when used by bad actors, can be a danger to democracy,” the AI image creator said. “If this leads to stronger regulation, I’m not only happy to comply, but I’ll be happy that it makes the world a safer place.” The AI image creator, an artist, said he initially started experimenting with AI to stay in step with technological advancement he perceived as a threat to his career. He said he realized it could be a useful way to create political satire. His public Facebook group is where he posts content in support of Democrats, starting with Biden’s presidential campaign in 2020 and now in support of Harris’ presidential campaign. “I didn’t think it would go down this way,” he said. “The intent of it was to boost support for Joe Biden because his communication was poor and his polls were low and Trump was a looming threat and I just couldn’t stand idly by.”","summary":"Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris after Trump shared an AI-generated picture of her endorsing him.

Harris said she plans to expand the child tax credit to $6,000 for young families for the first year of their child's life.This election cycle, the winner will need to carry some or all of the following seven states: Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.If there is a single prize for either party in November, it's the Keystone State and its 19 electoral votes. An Axios analysis of ad spending suggested a combined $211 million in ads from both sides of the aisle are set to flood the airwaves.Former President Donald Trump and his running mate Senator JD Vance made several visits to the state the past few months after Trump was the target of an attempted assassination in the state at a rally on July 13 in Butler.In a sign of how critical Pennsylvania is, Harris unveiled her running mate in Philadelphia, its biggest city, featuring an opening speech from the state's popular governor, Josh Shapiro, that had the crowd on its feet.Harris' first Pennsylvania post-debate rally will be in the Scranton and Wilkes-Barre area this Friday, a crucial stopping place in the battleground state.Polling averages from FiveThirtyEight show Harris consistently—though narrowly—beating Trump in Pennsylvania. The most recent polling, from September 12, shows Harris receiving 44 percent of the vote and Trump getting 42 percent.The interview with ABC was Harris' first appearance with reporters since Tuesday's debate. About two-thirds of voters say Harris won the debate, according to a flash poll by CNN.A Reuters/Ipsos survey released Thursday suggested Harris improved her standing in the polls after the debate, though it remains to be seen whether it will move the needle in other national and swing state surveys in the neck-and-neck race.Harris and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, talked with CNN for their first joint interview on August 29.The First Interview: Harris & Walz A CNN Exclusive, which was watched by over six million viewers, sparked a lot of jokes from Trump supporters like conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.\"She needs emotional support to face the media and defend her indefensible record,\" Kirk posted to X, formerly known as Twitter. \"Is this a joke?\"Political commentator Chuck Callesto responded to Kirk's post saying Harris has \"zero competence\" because her campaign \"won't even allow her on CNN by herself.\"The interview was taped on Thursday afternoon with CNN's Dana Bash before it was aired that evening. This also raised complaints from Harris critics.Bash interviewed Republican vice presidential nominee Vance earlier. She asked the Senator about Walz branding him as \"weird,\" while Vance claimed Harris and Walz \"aren't comfortable in their own skin.\"Along with Jake Tapper, Bash moderated the Biden-Trump debate in Atlanta in June. CNN had previously made it clear the moderators would act as facilitators, and the microphones were muted.Trump's campaign had been keeping a count of the number of days since Harris talked with the media.

The high-profile surrogates all felt “energized” by their roles in the Democratic National Convention last month and have offered to help the Harris team in any way that would be most helpful, these people said. Barack Obama is expected to headline a fundraiser for Harris in Los Angeles next Friday and then hold larger campaign events next month, while Michelle Obama will focus on encouraging voter registration and turnout for Harris, the people familiar with the Obamas’ plans said. In addition to traveling for Harris, the former president will also sign his name to fundraising materials and will record candidate-specific ads and robocalls for Democrats running in down-ballot races, as he has done in past cycles, according to a person familiar with the effort. “His strategy this fall will be driven by where he can move the needle with Democrats and persuadable voters, especially in states with key races,” senior Obama adviser Eric Schultz said. Obama will also “engage in traditional and creative tactics” to reach voters digitally by working with content creators and influencers to push young people to IWillVote.com, Schultz said. While she is likely to hold fewer campaign events than her husband, Michelle Obama is even more energized to help this election cycle now that it’s Harris, not President Joe Biden, on the Democratic ticket, people familiar with her plans said. The overall strategy and schedule are still being finalized for the Obamas, the people familiar with their plans said, and they will take their direction from the Harris campaign about what’s needed on the campaign trail. During Michelle Obama’s speech at the DNC in Chicago, she implored Democrats to not just support Harris this November but “do something” to help her win. The Obamas \"are both extremely energized by Harris’ candidacy, enjoyed their time at the convention and they’re looking forward to being helpful in any way they can in the course of her campaign,” a former senior adviser to Obama said. The Obamas and Clintons would have had some role in the home stretch of the Biden campaign had it continued. One person close to the planning said now they can help with different constituencies Harris needs to win over in November. For instance, Bill Clinton will likely target more rural areas, with possible events in places like the Rust Belt and Georgia, two people familiar with his plans said. He’s eager to get out on the trail and was described as a “Dalmatian at a firehouse” by one person close to him. Former President Clinton may also make an appeal to Latino voters specifically since he did better with that key demographic when he was in office than his successors, an additional source said. He will also likely be tapped to speak about economic issues, given his role as the “explainer-in-chief” on that topic in 2012, this person said, with his travel for Harris likely beginning sometime in October. Hillary Clinton, for her part, is expected to focus on women and LGBTQ voters during her campaign events, two people familiar with her schedule said, with dates still being discussed. She will also likely be a key messenger on reproductive freedom which could be an effective way of reaching suburban women, whom the campaign also views as critical. She plans to help with fundraising efforts, these sources said, in between stops on her latest book tour, which kicks off next week. Hillary Clinton has at least one luncheon with donors scheduled for next Friday, separate from Barack Obama’s event. Both the Obamas and the Clintons have been in frequent touch with Harris since she took over the top of the ticket, with Hillary Clinton offering debate strategy and perspective ahead of the vice president’s showdown with former President Donald Trump in Philadelphia this week. For his part, Biden will continue to travel to battleground states to tout what the White House views as the top Biden-Harris accomplishments of their term in office. The president will travel to Philadelphia on Monday in his official capacity but is expected to continue stumping for Harris wherever he goes and will do more joint events with the vice president in the final sprint to Election Day as well, according to officials in both of their offices. Biden in particular can help shore up older white voters, who are not at the heart of the Harris coalition, these people said. First lady Jill Biden has also pledged to campaign for Harris in the fall, with a possible focus on education. Beyond the Bidens, Obamas and Clintons, Democratic governors like Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and California’s Gavin Newsom will serve as key surrogates in the next seven weeks, along with Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Laphonza Butler, D-Calif., according to a source familiar with their plans. The Harris team has had a steady stream of celebrity backers out on the trail on the vice president’s behalf as well, which is only expected to ramp up in the coming weeks, but the campaign is also working to engage digital surrogates more directly than in past cycles. It hopes to leverage the massive followings of online content creators to its benefit, without necessarily having to plan in-person events for them, the source said.","summary":"Former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, and Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, will campaign for Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/obamas-clintons-campaign-trial-kamala-harris-election-2024-rcna171091","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240821-chicago-dnc-barack-obama-michelle-obama-ac-106a-518a2c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:05:18","author":"Kristen Welker,Monica Alba","authors":["Kristen Welker","Monica Alba"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.169},{"id":256376670,"title":"Trump vows mass deportations from town rocked by 'pet-eating' lies","text":"\"This has to stop, what he’s doing.

Before entering politics, Tim Walz was known as a high school teacher and football coach in Mankato, Minnesota — an outsider who embraced a humble, folksy image. However, his true political foundation began in January 2005 when he attended Camp Wellstone, a training ground for grassroots progressives founded and named in honor of the late Sen. Paul Wellstone to carry on his legacy and train people in his methods. The boot camp was designed to teach community organizing, large-scale grassroots campaigning, as well as progressive leadership and electoral tactics. Under the guidance of radical socialist activists, Walz would polish his political skills and master the fundamentals of running effective campaigns, culminating in his 2006 upset victory in Minnesota’s staunchly conservative 1st Congressional District. The win followed an insurgent campaign aided by fellow Camp Wellstone alumni, including future Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. Paul Wellstone: From Radical Professor to Political Icon Prior to his political career, Paul Wellstone, the inspiration for the camp, was a political science professor at Carleton College who earned his Ph.D. with a dissertation on black militants. He was an ardent advocate of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals and the belief in confrontation and acts of civil disobedience as a means of achieving political power. Wellstone would teach such methods in his classes and even invited Alinsky — the father of modern community organizing — to his campus, once remarking: “I am an old Alinsky organizer.” He also had prominent figures such as noted welfare activist Frances Fox Piven and 1960s radical George Wiley, widely regarded as the father of the “welfare rights” movement, speak in his classes. Wellstone’s political rise was supported heavily by the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which played a key role in his electoral success. He served as an adviser to the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and, throughout his career, maintained close ties to the DSA, which recognized Wellstone as “explicitly democratic socialist in orientation.” In 1990, with the help of the DSA, who dubbed it a “watershed campaign,” he stunned the political establishment by defeating two-term Republican incumbent Rudy Boschwitz in a Senate race, despite being outspent sevenfold. In 1996, DSA leader Christine Riddiough was dispatched to Minnesota to aid Wellstone’s reelection, helping to organize volunteers in key constituencies, which undoubtedly contributed to his nine-point victory. Following his win, the Washington Post described Wellstone as “not really a [conventional] liberal at all.” “He is a radical and, yes, a 1960s radical at that,” the paper explained. Similarly, progressive Mother Jones magazine held him up as “the first 1960s radical elected to the US Senate.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) called Wellstone a politician of “extraordinary vision,” while then-Sen. Al Franken (D-MN), in his final speech on the Senate floor, described Wellstone as a “tireless, passionate champion for working families.” Wellstone would later die in a plane crash along with his wife, daughter, and staff members while campaigning for reelection just days before the 2002 election. Remarkably, both Wellstone and Walz share striking parallels in their political paths. Walz’s 2006 upset mirrored that of Wellstone, his role model, as both transitioned from educators to politicians, achieving surprising victories in Minnesota over better-funded incumbents. Like Wellstone, Walz embraced a grassroots, big-hearted, small-town persona, often presenting himself as a relatable, flannel-wearing progressive. Camp Wellstone: Birthplace of Walz’s Political Career Once I decided to run for Congress, I went to Camp Wellstone in January of 2005 to learn how to do it. I had no idea; I’d never given a stump speech before. — Tim Walz Camp Wellstone was more than just a training program — it served as the incubator for a new generation of progressive leaders, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, and Flanagan, all of whom were trainers the year Walz attended and are now in positions of power in Minnesota. Founded in January 2003, roughly two months after Wellstone’s death, the camp cultivated a new generation of leaders, using community organizing methods inspired by radical activist Saul Alinsky to shape prominent figures in American politics. The stated mission of Wellstone Action, which operates the camp, is to honor Wellstone’s legacy by continuing his work through training, educating, mobilizing, and organizing “a vast network of progressive individuals and organizations.” According to its website, the camp trains candidates, campaign workers, and organizers in “practical skills in progressive political action,” while offering role-specific training in progressive organizing, led by “the nation’s leading experts in grassroots politics and organizing.” According to Jeff Blodgett, Wellstone’s former campaign manager who would later become Obama’s state director, the camp would turn out “to be a place [for] people who felt like they needed to step up now and kind of follow in Wellstone’s footsteps.” Blodgett himself is a product of radical activism, having trained at the Rockwood Leadership Institute, a hub for progressive activists, many of whom have gone on to work in far-left organizations such as MoveOn.org. The advisory committee that guided the Wellstone camp featured a slew of radical socialist leaders, including Frances Fox Piven, co-author of the the anti-capitalist Cloward-Piven Strategy aimed at destabilizing capitalism, and Heather Booth, a notorious lifelong radical community activist, founder of Midwest Academy, and self-described dedicated disciple of Saul Alinsky. Booth also had an active role in teaching sessions, where she was known for engaging participants. Also included were influential union leaders Andy Stern (SEIU), Gerald McEntee (AFSCME), and Richard Trumka (AFL-CIO), along with civil rights activist Julian Bond, who was closely associated with the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). “Wellstone Action is hands down the ‘go to’ training center in the progressive movement,” once remarked SEIU Chief of Staff Jon Youngdahl. “No one does it better.” The camp is bolstered by a vast network of far-left organizations and influential funders. Groups like the radical Midwest Academy and far left-wing advocacy organizations such as Moveon.org partnered with the camp to train their members. Additionally, “generous” financial support came from the Tides Foundation and far-left donors, including left-wing billionaire George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Family Foundation, and the Bauman Family Foundation, among many others. This broad base of support amplified the camp’s reach in promoting progressive political action. Camp Wellstone’s radical influence is also evident from the reading materials recommended for attendees on the Wellstone Action site, which includes titles such as Rules for Radicals, hailed as a “must-read for all progressive activists,” and Poor People’s Movements by DSA Honorary Chairwoman Barbara Ehrenreich, who famously celebrated the re-release of the Communist Manifesto on its 150th anniversary. In January 2005, Walz, a newcomer with no political experience, joined the camp — arriving at the training as a “paunchy 40-year-old in jeans and a T-shirt” with an “extreme long-shot political goal.” Despite his lack of political background, Walz would quickly absorb the values of progressive activism at the camp, honing his skills and political organizing knowledge. Wellstone’s son, David, noted that Walz immediately stood out. “You could tell he was a leader,” he said, adding that he believes the camp “helped shape the way that he politicked.” Longtime progressive activist Pam Costain, who served as Wellstone Action’s education and training director at the time, recalled Walz as “so impressive” that Wellstone Action used him as an example in future trainings. Walz is featured in Winning Your Election the Wellstone Way, a guidebook by Wellstone Action which showcases his political journey — that falsely claims that he served in Afghanistan — as a case study on how grassroots, community-driven candidates can unseat established incumbents. This endorsement of Walz further aligns him with Wellstone’s political philosophy and the broader progressive movement. Furthermore, long-time progressive activist and then camp trainer Marcia Avner noted Walz’s growth from the 2005 camp. “What you see is what we saw back then, but it has been strengthened with extraordinary experience,” Avner said. “He has been so seasoned by the work here.” When elected to Congress the year after completing the program, Walz became Camp Wellstone’s first successful alumnus at the federal level. He has repeatedly credited the camp (now rebranded as re:power) — which continues to produce leaders who push the boundaries of progressive politics in the U.S. — for shaping his political skills, particularly in grassroots mobilization and message development. Flanagan’s Rise: From Camp Wellstone to Minnesota’s Second-in-Command Walz’s partnership with Flanagan, his lieutenant governor and former Camp Wellstone trainer, underscores his deep ties to the far left. Flanagan, who credits Wellstone with her own political rise, stated that “walking by the Wellstone for Senate office my senior year of college changed the entire trajectory of my life.” She once recalled her father, long-time Native American land rights and sovereignty activist Marvin Manypenny, telling her, “I want to burn down the system, and you want to get into the system and change it from the inside out,” echoing Alinsky and Piven’s approach of working within institutions to dismantle them. Flanagan has criticized her state for only being ideal for white residents only, supported the removal of a Christopher Columbus statue during the George Floyd riots, and described the state’s government as a tool of genocide against people of color and Indigenous communities. As Walz’s top adviser, Flanagan has been instrumental in shaping his progressive agenda behind the scenes, often speaking before him at public events, with one news outlet reporting “she has a big say in policies and positions.” After helping him secure his first congressional win following Camp Wellstone, she has continued to play a key role throughout his career. She once proudly remarked about Walz, “He was my camper; I taught him everything he knows!” Flanagan would later be described by state Democrats as his “progressive whisperer,” with Walz admitting, “[For] every major decision she is there from the beginning.” When Walz left Congress to run for governor, he chose Flanagan as his running mate, elevating her to lieutenant governor. Together, they pushed through some of Minnesota’s most progressive legislation, including sweeping environmental reforms and radical social justice initiatives, in what became known as the “Minnesota Miracle.” Both Walz and Flanagan — whose influence reflects the broader Wellstone strategy of pushing far-left policies through grassroots mobilization and political pressure — frequently invoke Wellstone’s legacy, with Flanagan stating, “We all do better when we all do better,” a mantra of Wellstone’s populist vision. Melvin Carter, the mayor of St. Paul and another trainer at the 2005 camp, called Flanagan a “strong influencer” on Walz’s progressive policies, adding that she “embodies” the state of Paul Wellstone. Flanagan herself credits Wellstone’s vision for Minnesota for shaping her political path, stating, “I would not be where I am today if not for Senator Paul Wellstone and his vision for Minnesota.” Watch: Like Flanagan, Walz has also regularly paid tribute to Paul Wellstone, especially on the anniversary of his death, in posts reflecting a continued dedication to Wellstone’s principles. Wellstone’s Radical Legacy Endures Walz’s political career has been significantly influenced by the vision of Paul Wellstone — the radical Alinskyite professor-turned-politician who he credits as the man who “inspired me to run for congress.” In fact, Walz’s deep personal connection to Wellstone is exemplified by the fact that he carried a piece of the wreckage from the plane crash that killed the senator, using it as a personal keepsake throughout his journey to office. His connections through Camp Wellstone — along with its advisory board of prominent progressives, partnerships, and collaborations with figures such as Minnesota AG Keith Allison — underscore the strong far-left influences that have shaped his political approach. The matter comes amid growing concerns that the Walz-Harris ticket may be far more radical than it appears, with deep connections to far-left progressive and socialist movements hinting at a potential shift toward more extreme policy positions if the Democrats are elected. On Sunday, Bernie Sanders posited that Vice President Kamala Harris adjusted her positions to be “pragmatic” in order to “win the election” during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, maintaining that she has not abandoned her progressive ideals. Walz’s career has also been marked by controversies surrounding his ties to China. His involvement in a student exchange program following the Tiananmen Square massacre, along with multiple subsidized trips to China — Walz and the Chinese government jointly sponsored scholarships for American students to visit China. Between 1989 and 2003, Walz traveled with hundreds of students to China — raising serious questions about his relationship with the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, the House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the matter, focusing on his numerous visits and connections to CCP-linked entities. Last month, following Vice President Kamala Harris’s announcement of her selection of Walz, the radical pro-Palestinian Uncommitted National Movement — which urged Democratic voters to protest President Joe Biden’s support for Israel by casting non-Biden votes in state primaries — celebrated the vice-presidential candidate pick, who has referred to uncommitted voters as “civically engaged.” Citing senior adviser Elianne Farhat, the group suggested that Walz “has demonstrated a remarkable ability to evolve as a public leader, uniting Democrats’ diverse coalition to achieve significant milestones for Minnesota families of all backgrounds.” In addition, the DSA praised the selection of Walz as Harris’s running mate, insisting it showed “the world” that the DSA and its allies on the left “are a force that cannot be ignored.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDemocrat vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz’s political journey is rooted in his involvement&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unveiling Tim Walz&#8217;s Progressive Roots: Tracing His Journey from Radical Boot Camp to Congress first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/unveiling-tim-walzs-progressive-roots-tracing-his-journey-from-radical-boot-camp-to-congress/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-From-Radical-Boot-Camp-to-Congress-Tim.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:04:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.623},{"id":256377000,"title":"Trump talks ABC News Presidential Debate, what's happening in Springfield, Ohio, in FOX News interview","text":"Former President Trump said ABC News’ David Muir, one of the co-moderators of Tuesday’s presidential debate, should have fact-checked Vice President Kamala Harris after she claimed the GOP nominee said there would be a \"bloodbath\" if he doesn’t win the election. Trump sat down with Fox News host Trace Gallagher for an interview on \"Fox News @ Night\" that is set to air at 11 p.m. ET. \"Donald Trump, the candidate, has said, in this election, there will be a bloodbath if this and the outcome of this election is not to his liking. Let’s turn the page on this. Let’s not go back. Let’s chart a course for the future and not go backwards to the past,\" Harris said onstage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS Trump tried to explain his comments on \"Fox News @ Night.\" \"They say anything they can say bad. You know, when she went over those points, all of those points, like the bloodshed-- that was referring to the car industry, it's going to, you know, it's a bloodbath,\" Trump said. He maintains that the \"bloodbath\" comment he made at a rally in Ohio earlier this year was about what would happen to the auto industry if he isn’t elected in November. \"If you’re listening, President Xi — and you and I are friends — but he understands the way I deal. Those big monster car manufacturing plants that you’re building in Mexico right now … you’re going to not hire Americans and you’re going to sell the cars to us, no. We’re going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you’re not going to be able to sell those cars if I get elected,\" Trump said in March. \"Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a bloodbath for the whole — that’s gonna be the least of it. It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country. That will be the least of it. But they’re not going to sell those cars. They’re building massive factories.\" Trump told Gallagher that he believed Harris should have been fact-checked for her claims about his comments on the auto industry and the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. \"Every one of them should have been questioned by David Muir, who I've lost a lot of respect for. Everyone's lost respect for him because it was so... Such a one sided... It was one against three. And I had a great debate because my poll numbers are all up very substantially after the debates. The people... So... but look, these are lying people. These are very bad people,\" he said. Gallagher also asked Trump in the \"Fox News @ Night\" exclusive about the remarks he made about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. SPRINGFIELD RESIDENT SAYS ROADS ARE LIKE ‘ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK’ AFTER HAITIAN MIGRANTS OVERRUN RURAL TOWN Trump falsely claimed Haitian immigrants were eating the dogs, cats and pets of local residents. Officials said there have been no credible or detailed reports about the claims. A Springfield police spokesperson addressed Trump’s remarks, saying in a statement to Reuters: \"In response to recent rumors alleging criminal activity by the immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.\" Trump spoke about the impact tens of thousands of Haitian immigrants have on the population of Springfield, a city of roughly 59,000 people. \"If you go to Ohio, you know, there they're talking about 25 to 30,000 people coming in from Haiti. And this is a town that is small, beautiful, no problems, no crime, no nothing. And I heard this morning there was 31,000 people coming in. Nobody can do that,\" Trump said. \"And it's a bad criminal element, too. A bad criminal element. This is a town with no crime at all, Springfield. It's got no crime. It's got no problems. And now they have 31,000 people just came down on them. This is not survivable. We're going to have the largest deportation effort in the history of our country.\" The Associated Press reported some 15,000 Haitian immigrants have arrived in Springfield since 2020 under the Temporary Protected Status program.

Supporters of Donald Trump — whose insecurities transparently ooze out of them every time a competent Black woman with a resume they could never hope to achieve comes into prominence — have already tried to discredit Vice President Kamala Harris’ debate domination by baselessly claiming her earrings were actually earpieces that she was being coached through. The woman is a former district attorney, former attorney general and former U.S. senator who has wiped the floor with Republican white men during nationally televised Senate hearings — but, please, tell us more about how Harris couldn’t have possibly handled the guy who argued she “wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.” MORE: Kamala Harris Is Every Overqualified Black Woman Who Has Had To Confront White Mediocrity Anyway, now that the desperate lie about Harris earrings has fallen flat — just as the misogynistic narrative that she, an elected official, “slept her way to the top” did — the MAGAts are reaching even further by crying foul because one of the debate’s moderators, Linsey Davis, happened to pledge the same sorority as Harris. This absurd excuse for why Trump got handed his own rust-tinted hind parts during the most important debate of his campaign isn’t worth taking the time to argue against — but we’re here now, so whatever. The Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority has more than 360,000 initiated members spread across more than a thousand chapters and a dozen different countries. Kamala Harris and Linsey Davis went to two different colleges (Howard University and the University of Virginia respectively) in two different states and graduated nearly a decade and a half apart from each other. AKAs are not Illuminati members with secret handshakes, decoder rings and bookcases with hidden passages. Also, I’m just going to say it — this is racism. This is the same white tears-ridden energy Megyn Kelly came with when she went off a some whiney “all colleges matter” Xitter rant over Sen. Laphonza Butler‘s DNC speech, which she began by noting that she and Harris “both graduated from historically Black colleges.” These people aren’t ignorant of the fact that millions of people have pledged the same sororities and fraternities. They know that white men in politics of various ages can pledge the same frat and it wouldn’t even register as a fact of note let alone a conflict of interest, just as it doesn’t when all of the good ol’ boys in GOP politics are fellow alums from the same handful of prestigious ivy league schools. MAGA Republicans are trying to stretch Davis and Harris being sorority sisters into a controversy because they know they can trust their fellow MAGAts to read something this mundane as a Black power political coup. And, again, maybe Harris did a better job during the debate because — she was just better. Trump supporters have been running with the narrative that the ABC News moderators were biased because they fact-checked Trump in real-time, unlike Harris. In reality, Trump told dozens of verifiable lies on that debate stage, only a small handful of which were fact-checked on the spot, and only because the claims Trump was making were so outrageous no self-respecting journalist could let it slide. To be sure, Harris said things during the debate that weren’t true as well, but she didn’t claim babies were being aborted after they were born or parroting factless and potentially dangerous rumors about Haitian immigrants abducting and eating pets. The supposedly biased moderators also afforded Trump more speaking time than they did Harris, and they let him talk out of turn, muted mics rule be damned. Trump lost because he was a rambling, unprepared buffoon, and Harris won because she was not. It’s that simple.
