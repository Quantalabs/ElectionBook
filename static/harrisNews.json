She was fired by her boss,President Donald J. Trump, even though for some reason she refuses to accept this. In the termination letter to Cook, Mr. Trump noted a criminal referral against Cook filed by the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte. In his letter, Mr. Trump said \"there is sufficient reason to believe you may have made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements. For example, as detailed in the Criminal Referral, you signed one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be your primary residence for the next year. Two weeks later, you signed another document for a property in Georgia stating that it would be your primary residence for the next year. It is inconceivable that you were not aware of your first commitment when making the second. It is impossible that you intended to honor both.\" Mr. Trump in his letter continued, \"In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity. At a minimum, the conduct at issue exhibits the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question your competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.\" In my judgement, the evidence behind the allegations of mortgage fraud in Michigan, Atlanta, GA and Cambridge, MA are overwhelming. One of the listings has been circulating online for several weeks. We&apos;ve all seen it. That is why I believe Ms. Cook is wasting everybody&apos;s time by throwing up legal smoke screens in court. She is pleading that President Trump has not shown sufficient \"cause\" to fire her (hat tip to Byron York). But since the Federal Reserve Act has never defined \"cause\", to me it&apos;s President Trump who defines what constitutes \"cause\". I&apos;d hold the same view, even if the 1913 legislation was perhaps clear. But really it should be up to Chief Executive. Actually, we&apos;ve learned that she knew all about the so-called mortgage fraud way in advance and told it to the Biden people when she was nominated, vetted and then confirmed to the Fed in 2022. But the Bidens chose to overlook it and jam through her Senate confirmation with, get this, a 49-49 tie that had to be broken by Vice President Kamala Harris. Because Ms. Cook lied about her primary residence and these other matters, she was able to get preferential treatment on interest rates that were not available to ordinary Americans who play by the rules and do not lie on their mortgage applications. Ms. Cook is doing enormous damage right now to the Federal Reserve by her public revolt against the mounting allegations. Indeed, Jay Powell should have suspended her several weeks ago, as he has in several other cases. But of course, Powell always lacks backbone. Cook&apos;s latest defense is that these mortgage lies were committed before shewent to the Fed. This is utter nonsense. Normally, the vetting process covers many prior years of various income, job, and contract histories. Her lies that were apparently accepted by the Bidens speak volumes about their lack of integrity. She should have been disqualified right from the start. Now look, I can go on about her lack of monetary credentials. Or the fact that she was very woke. But the reality here, the important point here, she has been fired from her job by the nation&apos;s Chief Executive. She should certainly not be permitted back into the Fed building. And she should certainly not be permitted to attend the next FOMC meeting in two weeks. Nor, of course, should she be allowed to vote at that meeting.","summary":"When the jobs report comes out on Friday, let&apos;s hope the BLS subtracts one government job","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/larry-kudlow-lisa-cook-has-been-fired","image":"https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2022/10/Video-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 21:59:38","author":"Larry Kudlow","authors":["Larry Kudlow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":357181260,"title":"Is Sen. Alex Padilla running for California governor? Why Democrats are speculating about a 2026 bid","text":"For now, the rumors about a potential Sen. Alex Padilla for California governor run are just that, rumors.\n\nBut they’ve certainly got Democratic operatives and consultants talking — even as Padilla and his camp remain loudly mum on the possibility.\n\nRelated: These are the candidates for California governor in 2026\n\nThe focus for California’s senior senator, said Padilla spokesperson Edgar Rodriguez when asked about the gubernatorial rumors on Wednesday, remains on California’s upcoming special election on redistricting. That’s been the party line in the past few weeks, since the rumor mill really started churning, and what Padilla himself has said in recent interviews.\n\nThat’s not a confirmation of a 2026 candidacy — but it’s certainly not a firm no either.\n\nThat’s part because a strong, clear frontrunner has yet to emerge in the governor’s race, particularly since former Vice President Kamala Harris said she would not run for governor.\n\nAnd that’s also part because of Padilla’s political resume and temperament, experts said.\n\n“Padilla would be a formidable candidate. … I’m sure folks are worried about the current state of the race, potentially having a governor who is harder to work with,” said Ajay Mohan, a Democratic political consultant in California. “Padilla would have a field-clearing effect, second to none.”\n\nPadilla “brings a level of visibility and recognition that would make him the candidate to beat,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political messaging at USC and UC Berkeley.\n\nPolitical parallels for Padilla\n\nPadilla, 52, was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 when the seat was vacated by Harris to become the country’s vice president. He ran for, and won, a full six-year term in 2022, becoming California’s first Latino to hold a full-term seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRaised in Pacoima, the son of Mexican immigrants, Padilla’s entry into politics in the early 1990s was fueled by the politics of the late 1980s and early 1990s San Fernando Valley and L.A., amid the city’s growing Latino base.\n\nThose politics were defined much in part by another intense era of anti-immigrant sentiment. Proposition 187, a 1994 California ballot initiative approved by voters, aimed to deny undocumented immigrants access to public services, including education, health care and social services. It also required reporting of suspected undocumented immigrants to authorities.\n\nThe courts ultimately struck it down, but the fervor propelled Padilla and many in his generation into public service. He would join protests against Prop. 187 in the early ’90s, ultimately finding a path into politics and government, managing political campaigns for several legislative candidates and serving as a field representative for then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nTom Hogen-Esch, a professor of political science at Cal State Northridge, sees political parallels in the current moment, a time when the Trump administration’s mass immigration dragnet has swept the nation, hitting California — indeed, Padilla’s own hometown of Pacoima — hard.\n\nCut to the image of Padilla on June 12, at the Department of Homeland Security press office, amid the initial ramp-up of the immigration crackdown in Los Angeles.\n\nThere, Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials when he tried to ask questions. Video showed Padilla kneeling on the ground after being removed from the room, before officers pushed him to the ground and handcuffed him with his arms behind his back.\n\nHogen-Esch said it was unclear whether that could be a “motivating factor” for many voters next year.\n\nBut “to see a U.S. senator body-slammed, kind of embodies some of the political dynamics,” he said.\n\n“I’m not sure others in the race so far can make that kind of argument,” Hogen-Esch said, referencing Padilla’s journey from a working-class San Fernando Valley town to high-profile Trump critic in the U.S. Senate to that day when he was handcuffed on national TV.\n\nPadilla vs. the rest of the crowded field\n\nWith Democratic candidates relatively indistinguishable on policy, “it’s a matter of who’s the best messenger. But I think Padilla can speak to the moment in a way that some of the other contenders won’t be able to,” said Hogen-Esch, an expert on L.A. and California politics.\n\n“I think what the voters are going to look at is not only the experience and the capacity to lead, but also the ‘warriorness’ that is needed,” Richard Polanco, a former state Senate majority leader, who has led efforts to increase the statewide number of Democratic legislators.\n\nName recognition and a long list of party connections could make Padilla an instant frontrunner in the race, generate big campaign dollars and perhaps cause some lesser-known potential candidates to back down from running, pundits said.\n\n“He becomes a tier 1 candidate immediately,” said Michael Trujillo, a Democratic strategist.\n\nTrujillo speculated a Padilla entrance in the race would impact former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra the most, among declared candidates. He noted the two boast similar portfolios — both have worked in Washington, both have served in the state legislature and both would benefit from D.C.-based relationships and donors.\n\n“Becerra isn’t in office anywhere,” Trujillo noted. “If you’re a lobbyist in D.C., if Padilla runs, he’s still going to be a U.S. senator and still going to be critical on bills in the Senate or in committee right now. A better insurance policy is to bet on Padilla rather than Becerra, because if he does come up short, he’s going to remember everyone who supported him for governor.”\n\n“If you’re in D.C., you want to make sure he has a happy memory of you.”\n\nThe current field of candidates, said Schnur, the political analyst who has worked on multiple California gubernatorial campaigns, is not lacking messages. “It just lacks the recognizable messengers,” he said.\n\nPadilla is particularly interesting because while he is temperamentally more moderate, he tracks more progressive on issues, said Schnur, and that could leave a pathway for a more centrist candidate, such as former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, to compete with him.\n\nBut on the progressive front, a Padilla candidacy would hurt Becerra and former Rep. Katie Porter the most, Schnur speculated.\n\nAnd then there’s also another potential candidate: Billionaire developer Rick Caruso, the recent, unsuccessful candidate for L.A. mayor, said Wednesday he is “seriously looking” into running for California governor.\n\nTrujillo believes a Padilla candidacy would disrupt Caruso’s chances the most. Without Harris in the race, Caruso had more of a lane, he said, but Padilla narrows that substantially.\n\n“This absolutely disrupts Rick Caruso’s decision-making process once again,” he said.\n\nStill, Polanco, who supports Villaraigosa in the governor’s race, also pointed to parallels between the moment and the early 1990s era of intense anti-immigrant fervor in California.\n\nHe said the political price that Republicans paid for those years has resulted in a state where Democrats dominate, and where a Latino has a shot at the governor’s seat.\n\nThe current moment, like back when former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was campaigning for Prop. 187, will propel an increase in new voters, coming of age in 2026.\n\nThat could catalyze a Latino into office.\n\nPeople “will be able to look and say yes, the time is now, irrespective of ethnicity,” said Polanco.","summary":"California's senior senator hasn't ruled out a campaign.

Twenty years ago, he led the Democrats’ takeover of the House, and he is widely rumored to be considering a run for his party’s nomination for president in 2028.\n\nMany smart Republicans will tell you privately that of all of the folks throwing their name around as possible contenders, it is Emanuel, a brilliant political animal and tactician, whom they fear the most. Why?\n\nWell, there is likely an entire generation of Democrats and journalists who might not know this, but his 2006 midterm election strategy of picking centrist candidates to run for the House in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Tennessee in Republican-leaning districts gave his party the gavel for the first time in a dozen years.\n\nEmanuel said in our interview that the survey numbers from the Wall Street Journal told him a few important things, but one above all: that Democrats really need to start addressing that it is unacceptable for the American dream to be inaccessible to so many.\n\n“I think that the core and the reason people are disappointed in the Democratic Party is because when their backs [are] against the wall, they expect us to show up, and we are nowhere on this,” he said.\n\nEmanuel said some of the things Democrats did over the years, such as universal healthcare, helped with affordability.\n\n“Other things we did, like allowing college costs to get out of control and allowing it to become less about a meritocracy and more about an exclusive club,” he explained.\n\nHis second lesson for his party: lifting people up so they could attain a middle-class life.\n\n“Today is a struggle, and you want a shot,” he said. “You want a shot for your children, and you’re getting the shaft now. You’re struggling to barely hold on, and it used to be you could work hard and get there and stay there. Now you’ve gotten there, you’re fearful, and you’re also pessimistic about your kids ever getting there either.”\n\nAnother thing Democrats need to address is that the system is rigged.\n\n“I’ll say it, it’s rigged in favor of me and my children,” he said. “And so I used to spend a lot of time unrigging, trying to unrig it. My attitude now is, ‘No, I want to keep it rigged. I’m just going to rig it for you against the powerful interests. It’s going to stay rigged, but we’re going to rig it on behalf of the working class, the middle class of America that struggle every day against great odds and great headwinds.'”\n\nWhile Emanuel admitted that putting it that way is sort of tongue-in-cheek, he is clearly frustrated that things have gotten so out of control for the middle class.\n\nThe former ambassador to Japan said he saw firsthand “the great lure of America” when he witnessed the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier depart Yokosuka for the last time in May 2024 and when his son graduated from the Navy’s Officer Candidate School among a “cross section of every background.”\n\n“And not just the diversity, but it was a diversity with a single purpose,” he said. “That’s the strength.”\n\nWhat led to the working class breaking off from his party, which many argue began with former President Barack Obama’s second campaign, when “hope and change” turned toward more divisive rhetoric?\n\n“We’ve lost touch with the uniqueness of what [Presidents Franklin] Roosevelt, [Lyndon] Johnson, and [Harry] Truman built,” he said.\n\nThe end result was not necessarily working-class Democrats voting for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. They just stayed home, making Obama the first incumbent president in modern politics to earn fewer votes than he did in his first run.\n\nEmanuel is well aware of the demographic shifts among voters, in particular among working-class Hispanic, black, and male voters under 50. Hispanic voters gave Joe Biden an advantage of 25 percentage points in 2020, but his vice president, Kamala Harris, drew even with this group in 2024, according to Pew Research Center analysis of the election results. Black voters also moved toward President Donald Trump, doubling their support for him over 2020, while men under 50 backed Trump, a group that favored Biden by 10 points four years earlier.\n\nEmanuel said Democrats need to talk more about appreciating those groups’ plight and stress, relating to it, understanding it, communicating on it, and detailing a plan to restore and uphold that.\n\nHe leans into an approach that is aspirational — think President Bill Clinton talking about his vision of building a bridge to the 21st century in 1996.\n\n“People knew he had a plan for America, and they were part of it,” Emmanuel said.\n\nEmanuel believes there is value in Democrats being the party of “let anybody be what they want to be.” But there is also value in respecting a set of values that are binding and a shared consensus.\n\n“As an example, in 2016, I dealt with bathroom access. I just didn’t make it my focus. I did it. Now, can we get back to working on reading, math, and graduation?” he said of the ordinance he introduced as mayor that prohibited public places from denying restroom access based on a person’s gender identity.\n\nBESSENT PREDICTS ‘BIG ECONOMIC PICKUP IN 2026’ AND POSSIBLE NATIONAL HOUSING EMERGENCY DECLARATION THIS FALL\n\nWhile he is not saying whether he is going to run, he is spending his time letting people get to know him and trying to help Democrats win races both at the top of the ballot in statewide elections and downballot.\n\n“Just this month alone, I’ll be back for my second trip to Virginia.

By creating a permanent structure for coordination—including a new emergency operations center—she’s signaling that she’s willing to work with Trump’s task force rather than try to push it out.\n\nTrump wasted no time applauding the decision, calling Bowser “very helpful” during a press conference and praising the city’s falling crime rate. And a senior White House official told The Washington Post that Trump was “delighted” by the order.\n\nBowser framed the directive as a “pathway forward” beyond Trump’s 30-day emergency declaration. And while it asks that federal agents avoid wearing masks and identify themselves to maintain public trust, its overall tone is conciliatory.\n\nCritics say it’s capitulation. Nearly 80% of Washington residents oppose Trump’s takeover, according to a recent Schar School poll for the Post. Progressive groups, meanwhile, blasted the mayor in a letter last week, warning that “appeasement” only encourages future federal overreach. \n\n“History is calling upon you to lead our people, not to cower in the face of an authoritarian who does not have our best interests in mind,” the letter read.\n\nBut instead of pushing back, Bowser has positioned herself as a willing collaborator in Trump’s takeover effort. \n\nRelated | ICE official says Chicago's next on Trump’s military takeover list\n\nShe shared draft language of the order with senior White House officials, signed off on extra police cooperation with ICE, and even credited Trump with driving down crime—even though violent crime had already been falling before his invasion. \n\nAccording to the Post, Bowser’s aides believe that working with Trump is the best way to protect Washington’s fragile “home rule,” which allows the city limited self-governance but leaves Congress with ultimate authority.\n\nBehind the scenes, Bowser has kept in regular contact with Attorney General Pam Bondi, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. One senior official said that she speaks with Bondi “at times daily.”\n\nHer approach is at odds with other Democratic mayors and elected officials, who have loudly resisted Trump’s federal deployments. Over the weekend, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told city departments not to cooperate if Trump sends in the National Guard. But Bowser is betting that building trust with the White House could secure key wins for Washington—including a deal to redevelop RFK Stadium.\n\nStill, her stance is politically risky in a city where more than 92% of voters backed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris last year. And several city council members have started to break with Bowser, accusing her of legitimizing Trump’s intervention. \n\n“Most Washingtonians want decisions guided by our community values, not federal overreach,” council member Zachary Parker told the Post.\n\nEven as she touts falling crime, Bowser has criticized ICE’s presence, saying that masked agents are “terrorizing communities” and calling the use of the National Guard unnecessary. Her order does not explicitly extend cooperation with ICE, but it does welcome federal agencies on other fronts.\n\nFor Bowser, the question now is how to eventually wind down Trump’s emergency powers without triggering a standoff. \n\n“We didn’t ask for any federal officers; we’re driving crime down,” she said last week. “But while they’re here, how can we most strategically use them to accelerate the work that MPD has done? … The next point is, how do we exit from this emergency the president declared?”\n\nTrump, for his part, appears happy to keep the partnership going. \n\n“We don’t have a crime problem in Washington anymore,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “And the mayor has been very helpful.”\n\nBowser’s order may reduce the risk of a showdown in Washington, but the city remains in a delicate spot—between a mayor betting that cooperation will protect local control and a president eager to show that federal muscle gets results. \n\nMeanwhile, tensions in Chicago are already rising. Trump said Tuesday that he plans to send federal troops in despite local opposition, signaling that the standoff isn’t over—it’s just moving to the next city.","summary":"With just days left before President Donald Trump’s federalization of Washington’s police force was set to expire, Mayor Muriel Bowser effectively removed the clock.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Bowser signed an order directing city officials to work with federal law enforcement “to the maximum extent allowable by law within the District.” The order doesn’t contain a sunset clause—essentially giving Trump’s expanded federal presence a green light to continue past the 30-day legal limit, which was supposed to expire next week.\n\n\n\n\nArmed National Guard members walk through Washington.\n\n\nThe move marks a dramatic departure from Bowser’s early pushback against Trump’s occupation of the city.

Let us count the ways.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker (D-IL)\n\nThe Fred Flintstone doppelgänger has been in the news quite often lately as legacy media seemingly drool over every attack on President Donald Trump when they aren’t in awe that the overweight governor is actually shedding a few pounds.\n\nPolitico: JB Pritzker is losing weight. Even President Donald Trump is taking notice.\n\nAlso Politico: “In a powerful passage, Pritzker said, ‘After we’ve discriminated against, deported or disparaged all the immigrants and the gay and lesbian and transgender people, the developmentally disabled, the women and the minorities — once we’ve ostracized our neighbors and betrayed our friends — After that, when the problems we started with are still there staring us in the face — what comes next?”\n\nJERRY NADLER SAYS HE WILL NOT RUN FOR REELECTION\n\nHow utterly dishonest. And Politico calls such ridiculous claims “powerful.” So, how many gay, lesbian, and transgender people are being disparaged and deported? It must be nice to say whatever you like and not be held accountable, but that’s a benefit many Democrats appear to have.\n\nBut here’s why Pritzker will never be president: Before Labor Day Weekend, he claimed that there is no crime emergency in Chicago that warrants the federal boots on the ground that Trump is providing. Priitzker is also claiming that crime in the Windy City is down 50%. But instead of embracing the help from Trump, Pritzker is opting to portray Chicago as a utopian city.\n\nBut reality says otherwise: Over Labor Day weekend alone, 58 people were shot in Chicago. Nine are dead. Yet Pritzker still doesn’t want Trump’s help in seemingly being pro-crime to the average voter.\n\nHe can lose all the weight he likes. He can do all the softball interviews in the world. The crime numbers are the numbers, and being soft on crime and illegal immigration is a one-way ticket to defeat on a national level.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris\n\nShe received more than 75 million votes last November after 107 days spent as the Democratic presidential nominee. But Trump received nearly 78 million, won every swing state, and turned 89% of counties more red than blue overall.\n\nThe Harris campaign also burned through more than $1.5 billion in funds in 3 1/2 months and actually ended up in debt. This was by far the most inept campaign run in modern political history. It also featured an inauthentic, awkward, unlikable ticket with Harris clearly showing why she had to drop out of the 2020 presidential race before Iowa, and her vice presidential choice, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), he of stolen valor and a weird affinity for communist China, being a drag on the ticket to the point that Trump won Walz’s old congressional district in deep-blue Minnesota.\n\nThis ain’t Ronald Reagan in 1980 coming back from a stinging defeat to President Gerald Ford in 1976. Poll after poll shows there is no appetite for another Harris sequel to her runs in 2019, when she didn’t receive one vote in the primaries, and 2024, when she didn’t receive one vote in the primaries.\n\nHarris would have to actually earn the nomination this time. Would she try to run to the center as she hilariously attempted in 2024? Or would she go back to the left wing, as she did in 2019, in being opposed to border security and supporting taxpayer-funded sex changes for illegal immigrants in prison?\n\nShe can’t win. Even she probably knows this. So the prediction here is that she won’t even run.\n\nGov. Wes Moore (D-MD)\n\nSpeaking of stolen valor, Moore is being touted by the so-called experts as the second coming of Barack Obama. The Maryland governor has some built-in advantages that can help him win the nomination: The first Democratic primary is no longer in Iowa, but in South Carolina, which has a large black population. It’s hard to see how, say, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) could top Moore in South Carolina if the matchup came down to that.\n\nBut Moore has the same problems Pritzker has from this perspective: He’s rejecting Trump’s proposal to send National Guard troops to Baltimore while also claiming crime in the city isn’t as bad as Trump says it is.\n\n“We are seeing a resurgence that it would be great if the president would actually come and spend time and learn about what we are doing, instead of just throwing jabs at me and jabs at the city of Baltimore from the Oval Office,” Moore said in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nBut according to U.S. News and World Report, Baltimore still ranks as the fourth-most dangerous city to live in in the country, with 91 homicides and 218 nonfatal shootings thus far through the first eight months of the year. That’s lower than past years, yes, but how is being on pace for more than 150 homicides acceptable? Why wouldn’t Moore accept more help and partner with Trump after seeing the kind of results having National Guard troops patrolling Washington, which has seen a 40% drop in violent crime compared to the same time period in 2024?\n\nMoore also has another big problem: Stolen valor. The former Army captain claimed for years to have been awarded a Bronze Star for his service ending in 2006, but no such award was ever bestowed until it was done so retroactively in 2024. Moore was even introduced as a “Bronze Star recipient” in several interviews prior to 2024, including by Stephen Colbert, but he never corrected the record.\n\nAn August 2024 New York Times report found that “[Moore] made the claim on an application for a prestigious White House fellowship in 2006, when he was 27 years old.”\n\nMoore called the lie “an honest mistake.” And Democrats, fully aware that this could be the same kind of headache for Moore as it was for Walz, who claimed to fight in war zones when he never did, so he was awarded a Bronze Star in December 2024, as if that would somehow right a serious wrong.\n\nMoore was photographed over Labor Day weekend off the coast of Lake Como, Italy, on George Clooney’s luxury yacht, which isn’t elitist or anything.\n\nSeven people were shot in Baltimore between Friday and Sunday morning, including a 12-year-old boy outside of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School.\n\nPresident Wes Moore? Nope. Never happening.\n\nAs for those who can contend on the Democratic side, Newsom, despite having a horrific record in California that includes the highest taxes in the country and the highest homeless rate and is seeing residents and businesses leave the state for red states such as Texas and Florida, is surging among Democrats. Inept wildfire management and response? Doesn’t matter. Newsom is trolling Trump on social media by imitating him, and that appears to be a good enough reason for more people to vote for him. At least for now.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) is also a strong contender on paper, but some Democratic voters may be reluctant to support a staunch pro-Israel member of the Jewish community. On the flipside, there’s the possibility of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a darling of the energized extreme Left, doing well with female primary voters to the point she somehow captures the nomination in 2028 despite insane positions such as opposing Israel’s life-saving Iron Dome and spending trillions to fight climate change to avoid the world ending in 2031 — her predictions.\n\nMoore, Harris, Pritzker. Get ready for some serious hype next year. But they’re all foam and no beer.\n\nFor now, this appears to be Newsom’s race to lose for the nomination, creating a likely showdown with Vice President JD Vance. It would be the ultimate matchup of steak versus sizzle.\n\nBut then again, the same things were said about the likes of Rudy Giuliani, Hillary Clinton, Scott Walker, and Jeb Bush as well.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Kennedy, is considering running for Congress next year to replace longtime Democratic stalwart Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who announced his retirement plans earlier this week. \n\nSchlossberg, 32, has never held public office, but told The New York Times on Tuesday that it was “certainly a possibility” he would run to fill Nadler’s seat, a highly prized New York City district spanning the center of Manhattan. \n\nThe 32-year-old Yale and Harvard graduate, the son of former diplomat Caroline Kennedy, has risen to fame in recent years, mixing political commentary and social media influencing, including serving as a political correspondent for Vogue during the 2024 election. He currently hosts a political commentary show on YouTube, recording episodes from inside his van. \n\nSchlossberg is also a regular, scathing critic of family member Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the Trump administration’s Health and Human Services secretary and the 32-year-old’s cousin. \n\nNadler announced his retirement plans in an interview with The New York Times published Monday, describing a need to pass his seat to the next generation of leaders after watching Democrats lose as an ailing Joe Biden ceded his 2024 campaign to Kamala Harris. \n\n“Watching the Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I think I want to respect that,” Nadler said, adding that he hoped a successor “can maybe help us more.”\n\nThe retirement has set off a flurry of political maneuvering and speculation about who might replace Nadler and what that might say about the future of the party in New York and beyond.\n\nOther famous names have been rumored to be considering the race — progressive star and former Federal Trade Commission boss Lisa Khan; Sex and the City actor and former gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon; and Chelsea Clinton, daughter of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; plus a gaggle of New York lawmakers — but only non-profit founder Liam Elkind has formally entered the primary.\n\nThe race to replace Nadler will take place next June, and it is expected to be a high-visibility contest awash in cash, given that it’s taking place in the heart of U.S.’s media and finance capital. \n\n“It’s the most coveted and arguably important congressional seat in New York because of the history of political influence from that seat, and also the fundraising base that comes with it,” Evan Thies, a Democratic strategist, told Politico of the race. “That allows you to be a national player and leader in the party, and you’re also representing one of the highest voting blocs for Democrats of any Congressional district in the country.”\n\nNadler’s unexpected exit plans, just a year after he speculated he might serve for another decade, is the latest shake-up in an already especially topsy-turvy season of New York politics, following the surprise victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the city’s Democratic primary.","summary":"Longtime New York Rep.

Even before his election win in 2024, Trump claimed his opponents’ economic policies were at the extremes of leftism. Kamala Harris, he said, had gone “full communist.” With Trump setting the tone — and now ensconced in the White House — his minions have amplified that rhetoric as a way of justifying their repressive onslaught. For example, Homeland Security Director, and anti-immigrant stormtrooper, Kristi Noem told the press in July that liberals “are actually turning out to be a bunch of communists and Marxists.” In like fashion, Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Steven Miller — speaking in Washington’s Union Station after the military was dispatched to that city, proclaimed, “We’re not going to let the communists destroy a great American city.” The tenor and tone of all this show no signs of abating, as the fascistic moves and raw assertion of power continues.\n\nThat the trope of anti-communism is being invoked and retains such power, is in no small measure a testament to the legacy of the anti-communist initiatives of the 20th century. This writer’s forthcoming book, Menace of Our Time: The Long War Against American Communism, takes a deeper dive into that history. Given the moment we find ourselves in, it is worth exploring some.\n\nIn 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. What followed was a wave of repression in which his assassin, an erstwhile anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, was tried and executed, all within two months of the shooting. In the aftermath, New York State passed a law proscribing what it called “criminal anarchy,” making it a felony to advocate — not plan for, let alone move to carry out — revolution. The law would serve as a major weapon against organized leftists, specifically communists, who emerged in the early years of the 20th century.\n\nFast-forward 18 years, and an anarchist bombing at the home of U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer triggered the Palmer Raids, a key chapter of what would come to be called the First Red Scare — a government roundup of thousands of anarchists and communists, hundreds of whom would be deported. Arrested in this period and prosecuted under the criminal anarchy law was the then-communist Benjamin Gitlow, convicted and imprisoned for publishing a document called The Left-Wing Manifesto. The conviction, appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, was upheld. As the court wrote in its opinion, “It cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably when, in the exercise of its judgment as to the measures necessary to protect the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark without waiting until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration.” This principle of anti-advocacy — a fundamental negation of the First Amendment — would remain the law of the land for decades. It would also be a major instrument leveled against domestic communists.\n\nThis period also saw the rise of a young up-and-comer in the U.S. Justice Department: J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover, who was modernizing the Bureau of Investigation (later the Federal Bureau of Investigation), created a filing system of anarchists and communists that would be a cornerstone of the FBI’s work going forward. The bureau also deployed government informants who gathered intelligence, facilitated raids, and spread insidious rumors about the loyalty of dedicated comrades. It was a methodological template that would come to serve the FBI well.\n\nWhile the fallout from the Palmer Raids subsided by the mid-1920s, the communists, who would cohere into the Communist Party USA (CPUSA or CP), would become the preeminent target of the FBI and other anti-communist forces. In doing so, it confronted the repressive bite of not only the bureau, but also the anti-syndicalism and criminal anarchy laws that had been passed in nearly every state in the U.S. — to say nothing of the routine harassment by right-wing forces and local police.\n\nDepression and World War\n\nSuch was the situation as the country entered the Great Depression. It was during this time that rank-and-file communists and their supporters fought for unions, the unemployed, and opposed lynchings and the larger Jim Crow system. In doing so, they confronted unceasing pushback — firings, violent attacks on their meetings, arrests on the picket lines, beatings by police, and even killings. All of this was facilitated by a media sounding a hyperbolic alarm against a communist menace.\n\nThat alarm would grow shriller as the country approached World War II. The communists, whose initial anti-war position was at cross purposes with the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, were targeted by early predecessors of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. They also saw their leader, Earl Browder, imprisoned for traveling under a false passport. At the same time, new anti-communist laws were enacted: the Voorhis Act, requiring the registration of agents of a foreign power (i.e., the CP); the Hatch Act, proscribing communists in government; and the Smith Act against teaching the principles of revolution. It was also during this time that Roosevelt bestowed extraordinary powers on the FBI to target domestic communism. That led to measures such as the creation of a custodial detention list — essentially a concentration camp scheme to round up communists if an emergency order was given. When the communists abandoned their anti-war position with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the repression abated — though hardly ended. It was a circumstance that would not last.\n\nDangerous Public Opinion\n\nWith the onset of the Cold War, the government undertook its most aggressive wave of anti-communist repression ever, imprisoning or holding under indictment dozens of the party’s top leaders by way of the Smith Act. This formal repression also fostered a social climate where communists became pariahs of the first order.\n\nAn indication of how deeply anti-communist sentiment penetrated the public consciousness could be seen in a 1954 poll by the Opinion Research Corporation. When asked if congressional committees hurt innocent people, 49 percent of the respondents said yes. Then, when asked if innocent people could be hurt in the process, 58 percent said, hurt or not, it was more important to uncover communists. The vast majority of Americans also said that communists should be stripped of citizenship, that the government should be allowed to tap their phones, and that it was a good idea “for people to report to the FBI any neighbors or acquaintances whom they suspected of being communists.” That this repression garnered such support — despite the modest actual influence of U.S. communists — was an example of how a negative consensus could be built through unrelenting demagoguery. In the fifties and to a lesser degree in the sixties, it was communism; in the eighties and nineties, it was terrorism, in the wake of 9/11 it was Islam, first Al Qaeda, then ISIS, and now again it is “the communists” and “the woke left.” The names may have changed, but the methodology has not.\n\nA Vicious COINTELPRO\n\nWhile the fever pitch of the Second Red Scare would lessen as the fifties gave way to the sixties, the pursuit of the CP did not. This era witnessed the initiation of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO), the first and possibly the most extensive of all their notorious surveillance and infiltration efforts.\n\nOne example can offer insight into the program’s myriad operations: the case of Aaron Libson, a closeted gay man and communist activist living in Philadelphia. In 1966, Libson was arrested by undercover police in a “tearoom” — a restroom in a public park used for gay encounters — on a sodomy charge. When the FBI, who knew Libson was a communist, learned of the arrest, they snapped into action with a COINTELPRO operation. As an FBI memorialized, the point was to “neutralize Libson with the party and embarrass the party generally.” To achieve this, they anonymously called James Dolsen, the head of the Philadelphia CP, as well as one of their press contacts “who has been used quite successfully in the Counterintelligence Program and has always protected the Bureau’s interests.”\n\nLibson describes what followed:\n\n“When I had the arrest, I pleaded nolo contendere — I do not wish to contend — on a Friday. The next day, Saturday, I woke up and got ready for work, and as I looked at the paper that morning, there was a small article saying, ‘Local Red arrested.’ I had a suicide plan ready just in case it came out, so I thought, OK, this is it and I carried out the plan. … I wasn’t going to do anything at my house where my family would find me, so I rented a room at the Arch Street YMCA. I’d packed some of the crystal stuff you clean toilets in some tin foil, and I swallowed that and laid down and waited for something to happen. Nothing happened. In the interim, I’d called a friend of mine. While I was waiting for something to happen with the poison, I got up and sat on the window ledge — the room was on the fifth floor. As I realized the poison wasn’t working.”\n\nFortunately, the friend stopped things from going further. For its part, the Bureau counted this as a victory. As the noted in a memo detailing various COINTELPRO operations, “After Libson entered a guilty plea in February 1967, the fact was published in a newspaper, Daniel Rubin, National Organizational Secretary, stated Libson was dropped from the CP.”\n\nWhile COINTELPRO officially came to an end after being exposed in the early 1970s, the surveillance and attention to the CP did not. In 1978 Congress established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court which allowed for the legal wiretapping of those the US considered foreign agents, which included the pro-Soviet, CPUSA. The Bureau also kept in place its informant Morris Childs, who was acting as CP General Secretary Gus Hall’s liaison with the Soviets — a paradoxical circumstance of the Bureau both facilitating the funding of the CP, something Child’s was responsible for, while also garnering precious intelligence — and then there was the FBI’s investigation of the Committee in Support of the People of El Salvador (CISPES) because of perceived communist infiltration. With the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the extraordinary attention to the CPUSA ended, if not the legal and extralegal measures against other perceived enemies.\n\nWere all this a matter of the past, it would be bad enough, but this history has thrust itself into the present. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, used against communists and anarchists during the Palmer Raids of 1920, was leveled in 2025 against Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Mahmoud Khalil. Trump has talked about stripping immigrant citizens of naturalization; meanwhile, the MAGA shock troops have set their sights on the political opposition. Elise Stefanik, the MAGA congresswoman from New York, has called New York City’s mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a “raging antisemite communist.” The methodology behind this is hardly concealed. Trump, while running for president in the summer of 2024, made this clear: “All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody who is going to destroy our country.”\n\nWhile this effort has not been wholly successful, it is a significant problem that no small number of people are swayed by this. In that sense, knowing a little history can serve as a weapon.","summary":"This trope has long been used to justify repression of anarchists, communists, liberals, immigrants, and unions.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/how-a-century-of-anti-communism-cleared-the-way-for-trumps-authoritarianism/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2232255618.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 17:16:25","author":"Aaron J.

Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.\n\nInitially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.\n\nBut after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.\n\nIn blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.\n\nThe divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.\n\nIn an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”\n\nThe money in question wasn’t spent solely on COVID-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.\n\n“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nThe Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.\n\nAfter its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.\n\nColorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.\n\nIn Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.\n\n“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.\n\nAt one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.\n\nMarsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.\n\n“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”\n\nSasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.\n\nRadabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.\n\nAston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFederal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the cCDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.\n\nThe Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.\n\nShe also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.\n\n“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”\n\nColumbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.\n\nColumbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.\n\nAs of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.\n\nJoe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.\n\n“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent COVID money coming back.”\n\nKen Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.\n\nSome of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.\n\nBrent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.\n\nThe association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.\n\n“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.\n\nMethodology\n\nKFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.\n\nOur primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.\n\nTo classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.\n\nThis analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.\n\n©2025 KFF Health News.

Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.\n\nInitially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.\n\nBut after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.\n\nIn blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.\n\nThe divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.\n\nIn an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”\n\nThe money in question wasn’t spent solely on COVID-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.\n\n“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nThe Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.\n\nAfter its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.\n\nColorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.\n\nIn Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.\n\n“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.\n\nAt one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.\n\nMarsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.\n\n“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”\n\nSasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.\n\nRadabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.\n\nAston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFederal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the cCDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.\n\nThe Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.\n\nShe also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.\n\n“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”\n\nColumbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.\n\nColumbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.\n\nAs of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds.

A Republican with a strong approval rating in a state that went for Joe Biden in 2024, Youngkin is popular, competent and photogenic. But the Old Dominion, thanks to a quirk in its 1776 constitution, is the only state where a governor cannot serve two consecutive terms. So instead of getting the chance to re-elect Youngkin, Virginia voters face a choice in November between Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears and former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. ‘DON’T MARYLAND MY VIRGINIA’: YOUNGKIN, 2025 GOP TICKET RALLIES TOGETHER FOR FIRST TIME AHEAD OF KEY ELECTION There is no way to sugarcoat that this is a real disadvantage for the GOP. Had Youngkin been allowed to run, it is not even clear that Spanberger would have entered the race. Now she's a heavy favorite to win. Youngkin has been above 50% in approval rating for almost his entire time in Richmond, no mean feat in a commonwealth that handed Kamala Harris a six-point win over Donald Trump, last year. The question is whether there is any way for Republicans to harness the potent power of incumbency and transfer it from Youngkin to Earle-Sears. And though it might seem unconventional, the answer really should be, yes. Youngkin’s accomplishments in under four years are impressive. He delivered $4 billion in tax cuts. In 2024, CNBC ranked Virginia the \"top state for business\" in the country. His overhaul of the education system has raised standards for students. This is what Youngkin would be running on if Virginia law wasn’t so weird, but why can’t Earle-Sears also run on this very record? After all, she was right by his side the whole time. In fact, why can’t they run on it together? Earle-Sears finds herself in almost the exact opposite position that Kamala Harris was in a year ago, replacing the top dog on the ticket. In Harris’s case, it was because Joe Biden was not fit to serve, while in Youngkin’s case, it is because of a decision made by some guys in powdered wigs 250 years ago. But, while Harris was doomed by her inability to differentiate herself from the wildly unpopular and bungling Biden, Earle-Sears has no reason to distance herself from Youngkin. Instead, she should be celebrating what they have achieved together. We should see Youngkin and Earle-Sears hip to hip at rallies and on TV ads, him defending his successful single term, and her promising to continue and expand on it. This arrangement, if not quite a co-campaign then at least a quasi-incumbency, wouldn’t just help Earle-Sears, it could help Youngkin with potential future political ambitions. Let’s not forget that in the days before the Republican National Convention, he was a serious dark horse for the VP slot. In Milwaukee, at that RNC, you could see Youngkin’s political chops at work. People would flock to him, in part because he’s approximately 8 feet tall and easily recognized, but also because they just like the guy. None of this is a knock on Earle-Sears, who has much to recommend her on her own merits, but to leave Youngkin, and all he brings to the table, on the sidelines, would be political malpractice. Thus far, Earle-Sears campaign has seemed focused on culture war issues, especially the battle over Northern Virginia counties flouting the Trump administration’s rules on trans policies like boys in women’s sports and restrooms. This is an important and powerful issue, but it isn’t enough on its own. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The economy, on the other hand, is not a sexy issue, but it sure does win elections. Earle-Sears is in the unique position to not only say that she can bring about a strong state economy, but that she is already part of the team that has delivered on that promise. When the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was debated, some wanted what Andrew Jackson wanted over a century earlier: a single six-year term for president that would remove the burden (and temptations) of running for re-election. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Back in 1951, Congress landed on two four-year terms, instead. But what nobody ever seriously proposed was a single four-year term, because it's not enough time to see through major projects and endeavors. Not for the U.S., and not for any state. Maybe more so than any other political office in America, the Virginia governorship truly is custodial than it is powerful. Youngkin is a short-term caretaker, but what will matter most to his legacy is who gets the keys to commonwealth next.

Susan Collins, the lone remaining Senate Republican in New England.\n\nMills, 77, said recently that while she was “seriously considering” a run against Collins, she was unlikely to make any announcement until mid-November. “I’m not in any rush to make a decision,” she told reporters.\n\nBut Kleban, 48, is not waiting for Mills to decide, hoping his personal story — a college dropout from a middle-class family who went on to found a successful brewery — will appeal to voters.

She would be 79 when taking office, the oldest first-term senator in history.\n\nOther Democratic candidates who might still join the race include Cathy Breen, a former state senator, and Ryan Fecteau, the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.\n\n“I’m exploring the opportunity and thinking about what a run would look like,” Fecteau said, adding that he would most likely not run if Mills does. “I have a lot of respect for her,” he said.\n\nPlatner entered the race last month and has excited progressive activists, raising $1 million in under 10 days. He also earned the endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who held a rally with him in Portland, Maine, over Labor Day weekend that drew thousands of people.\n\n“Our taxpayer dollars can build schools and hospitals in America, not bombs to destroy them in Gaza,” Platner said from the stage, earning a raucous ovation.\n\nWood, who worked in Democratic politics before his run, had raised nearly $1.4 million as of June 30, and lent his campaign $250,000 more.\n\nDespite the crop of candidates, Mills is being wooed by national Democrats, in particular Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. The Maine seat is seen as one of the Democratic Party’s strongest pickup opportunities in 2026.\n\nCollins is the only Republican senator up for election in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, and some polls have shown her with a low approval rating. But Collins, 72, has defied the odds before, winning in 2020 when virtually no polls showed her ahead leading up to the election.\n\nDemocrats would need to flip four seats in 2026 to take control of the Senate — a tall task.\n\nWearing a camouflage hat with his beer company’s logo on it, Kleban was blunt in a Zoom interview about his party’s struggles to find a compelling economic message as prices spiral upward.\n\n“They’re feeling that no matter how hard they work, even if they play by the rules, the system’s rigged against them,” he said. “They don’t have a chance to succeed. And I think that’s wrong, and I think that needs to change.”\n\nHe said he could relate to the struggles of Mainers, having lost his own job during the Great Recession and once counted a loaf of bread and Tabasco sauce as dinner. “Those things you don’t forget,” he said.\n\nEventually Kleban and his wife tapped their family’s retirement savings to help start the Maine Beer Company with his brother. The brewery’s beers are now distributed in more than 30 states, according to the company, and Kleban said the company grew while providing health insurance to workers and giving away 1% of gross sales to environmental and other community organizations.\n\nKleban, a father of 14-year-old twins, said high prices would be his first issue to focus on as a senator.\n\n“It’s clear the cost of living is too damn high and Mainers are feeling squeezed — and Susan Collins isn’t doing enough to bring them relief,” he said.\n\nHe was more circumspect about some of the other issues he would face as a senator.\n\nHe would not say, for instance, whether he would vote to keep Schumer as the party’s leader, dismissing it as “inside the Beltway” chatter that “is just not what I’m focused on.”\n\nAnd Kleban did not take a position on whether it is time to do away with the filibuster, which forces the majority party in the Senate to get 60 votes to pass many types of legislation. “I come into it open-minded, I’ll leave it at that,” he said.\n\nHe pushed back on the idea that he was running as a backup to Mills even as he suggested he was open to stepping aside.\n\n“Anybody who puts their hat in the ring, especially in a race like this, needs to be 100% committed,” he said, before later adding, “I can’t predict the future.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"National party leaders are anxiously waiting to hear whether Gov.

He recalled directing Trump in his 1998 film Celebrity. When the 69-year-old talk show host asked the Academy Awards-winner if he is a “Trumper,” Woody Allen quipped:“No, I'm not a Trumper. I'm one of the few people who can say he directed Trump. I directed Trump in a movie. In Celebrity. And he was, you know, he was a pleasure to work with and a very good act. He was very polite and hit his mark and did everything correctly, and had a real flair for show business.”Woody Allen further complemented Donald Trump, saying that he is very “easy to work with” and that he could do “wonders” if the politician would let the filmmaker direct him now that the latter is the president.“I can only judge, you know, what I know from directing him in film. And he was pleasant to work with and very professional very polite to everyone… I would like to direct him now that he's president and have him let me make the decisions.”However, while applauding the politician, the Annie Hall director noted that he voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Woody Allen admitted to being a “Democrat” and taking issue with Trump on 95% to 99% of the things.Woody Allen says he is “surprised” that Trump stepped into politicsDuring his Monday appearance on the Club Random podcast, Woody Allen shared his views on Donald Trump’s career in politics. While the director shared kind words for Trump’s acting skills, he noted that he disagrees with the 79-year-old American politician’s politics and policies.“He has charismatic quality as an actor, and I'm surprised he wanted to go into politics… Politics is nothing but headaches and critical decisions, and agony. And this was a guy I used to see at the Knick games, and he liked to play golf, and he liked to judge beauty contests, and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing.\"The director further quipped:\"Why anyone would want to suddenly have to deal with the issues of politics is beyond me. But apparently, he doesn't mind.”Press conference at White House - Source: GettyNotably, while discussing acting and politics with Woody Allen, Bill Maher likened politics to an “ultimate acting job.” The podcast host also seemingly took a jab at Trump and commented that the politician takes his acting chops to the “nth degree” in politics.However, Woody corrected Bill Maher on his views. The director countered that it “doesn't bother” him, as all politicians have to put on a certain “patina for the public.”For the unversed, Donald Trump, who was a real estate developer at the time, made a brief appearance in the Allen-directed 1998 film Celebrity. According to the New York Post, he played a member of the City’s glitterati eating at a power lunch uptown.Meanwhile, Donald Trump also made cameos in other prominent movies such as the 1996 film Eddie, the 1994 film The Little Rascals, and the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.","summary":"On September 1, 2025, Woody Allen, 89, appeared on Bill Maher’s Club Random podcast and praised U.S. President Donald Trump’s acting skills.

One of those decisions concerns its relationship with organized labor. Joe Biden and members of his administration—and, indeed, much of the party’s leadership—believed that forming a historically tight partnership with organized labor would help arrest the party’s decline with the working class. They turned out to be wrong. Working-class voters, even the small and shrinking share of them who belong to private-sector unions, continued drifting away, seemingly unimpressed by Union Joe’s long list of policy concessions.\n\nHaving seen their labor strategy collapse, Democrats are weighing two choices. One school of thought, favored on the progressive left, is that if Biden didn’t win back working-class voters, it’s because he wasn’t pro-union enough. For example, a recent newsletter by Dan Pfeiffer, a former Obama-administration official turned podcaster, argues that the path to winning back blue-collar voters requires (among other things) that Democrats “become even more pro-union.” Pfeiffer doesn’t explain why a more ardent alliance with organized labor would succeed for future Democratic candidates when it failed for Biden, or even how exceeding Biden on this score would be possible. The necessity and utility of the maneuver is simply taken as axiomatic.\n\nA wiser strategy, one that a handful of Democrats have gingerly broached, would be to revert to the party’s traditional, pre-Biden stance toward labor. This approach would recognize that the political cost of trying to satisfy the labor movement’s every demand is rising, and the number of votes that the movement delivers in return for such fealty is shrinking. The experience of the Biden administration, and of some Democratic-run localities, suggests that automatic deference to unions can undermine what ought to be politicians’ top priority right now: lowering the cost of living. Which means it is making the goal of winning back working-class voters harder, not easier.\n\nThe Democrats have been the pro-labor party since the New Deal. But, before Biden, their alliance with labor was never unqualified. Democrats broadly supported laws that protected the right to organize, as well as the generous minimum-wage and social-insurance laws that unions favored. However, they made exceptions when they believed that union demands ran contrary to the public interest. Franklin D. Roosevelt himself sometimes intervened against striking unions, and even opposed public-sector unionization on principle. Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy had episodic fights with labor even as they usually took its side. Bill Clinton broke with labor to enact the North American Free Trade Agreement. Barack Obama offended teachers’ unions by supporting education reform, and defied some industrial unions by capping the tax break on expensive health-insurance plans.\n\nBiden chose a different approach. He vowed to be “the most pro-union president leading the most pro-union administration in American history.” In practice, this meant not merely giving unions their customary seat at the table and vigorously enforcing labor law, as previous Democratic administrations had done, but exceeding that support in both symbolic and substantive ways. Biden called himself “a union man,” joined an auto-worker picket line and, with rare exceptions, gave labor nearly absolute deference on any issue in which it held a direct stake. His administration directed $36 billion in federal spending to bail out the Teamsters’ pension fund.\n\nYet even before he abandoned his reelection bid, Biden’s standing among working-class voters was dismal. Once Kamala Harris replaced him as the nominee, she failed to garner an endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters, the International Longshoremen’s Association, or the United Mine Workers of America—or even the Teamsters. Harris won a majority of union households, but according to Pew data, these voters swung toward Donald Trump by six points compared with 2016, in terms of two-party vote share.\n\nWhy did the administration’s approach to unions fail to reap electoral rewards? One reason is that, as some union leaders have acknowledged, their members have begun basing their votes more on cultural issues, such as guns, immigration, and trans rights, than on economic ones. But there is another factor at play, one much less widely recognized: Uncritical fealty to union demands can cause Democrats to adopt policies that actually threaten working-class voters’ material well-being.\n\nBiden’s long list of concessions to unions were not free. He kept in place tariffs Trump had imposed during his first term, raised them on Canadian lumber and solar panels from Southeast Asia, and made no effort to revive the Trans-Pacific Partnership or any free-trade agreement. He imposed more stringent rules favored by labor on domestic shipping and federal construction projects. None of these measures had a large effect individually. Collectively, they and others like them impeded Biden’s goal of reopening the economy and then bringing down the inflation that followed.\n\nThe potential for conflict between labor-backed positions and the broader public good can sometimes sit in plain sight, unnoticed by unions or even third-party observers. A recent New York Times story quotes a labor official in Nevada complaining that the Democratic Party alienated union members by failing to focus on affordability. The same article cites the union’s complaints that Democratic legislators in the state voted in 2023 to end a requirement for daily hotel-room cleanings.\n\nThat requirement, adopted in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, was expensive and became obsolete once scientists realized that the virus did not, in fact, spread through surface contact. Amazingly, the union that backed the daily-cleaning measure—and withheld support from Democrats who finally rescinded it three years later—is permitted in the article to pose as a champion of affordability, when it was fighting for a make-work requirement that pushed up hotel costs.\n\nLabor’s preferences were easier to align with Democratic policy goals in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Unemployment was high, the economy needed more stimulus, and policies that created more jobs were helpful in generating economic growth. (John Maynard Keynes famously argued during the Great Depression that hiring workers to dig holes and fill them again would still stimulate the economy.) But under the current conditions of low unemployment and elevated inflation, make-work policies and excessive government spending are much more harmful.\n\nThe rise of the abundance agenda, which focuses on removing barriers to providing Americans with a higher standard of living, especially by increasing the housing supply, has made the tension between these goals a subject of contentious debate on the left. This doesn’t make the abundance agenda anti-union. As Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein point out in Abundance, a book that otherwise mostly skirts the labor issue, countries with much higher union density than the United States have managed to build transportation infrastructure far more cheaply. Indeed, the paradigmatic case of abundance-agenda liberalism in action, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s rapid rebuild of a collapsed I-95 bridge, was undertaken cooperatively with unions.\n\nThe abundance agenda does, however, create more than occasional friction with union demands. Public-employee unions support strict rules on compensation and firing that make it harder for the government to work as nimbly as the private sector. In California, where the housing shortage is especially dire, unions have used laws that hold up housing construction as leverage to extract concessions from developers. The California high-speed-rail authority, which is closing in on two decades of work without any usable track, continues to boast of the high-paying jobs it has created. This reflects one side of a philosophical divide within the party over whether to treat high labor costs as a core goal of public-infrastructure projects—or as, well, a cost.\n\nThe abundance agenda thus implies that Democrats need to return to their pre-Biden relationship with organized labor. This has generated intense backlash. At a high-profile conference in April, the moderate commentator Josh Barro said, “When I look at policies in New York that stand in the way of abundance, very often if you look under the hood, you eventually find a labor union at the end that’s the driver.”\n\nThis comment, a video clip of which was promptly shared on X, was treated like an act of war by the online left. “Bashing unions and calling for cutting wages and benefits will only lose us even more working class voters and elections,” Greg Casar, a progressive Democratic House member from Texas, posted in response. Left-wing magazines such as Jacobin, The Nation, and Current Affairs seized on Barro’s comment as having exposed a barely concealed desire to crush labor.\n\nThe divide revealed by this episode is not about the general merit of unions, or about specific policy questions related to unions, but whether policy specifics need to be taken into account at all. The labor movement and its progressive allies treat support for labor as a binary question. To oppose any discrete union policy is to join the ranks of enemies of labor and therefore the progressive movement itself.\n\nThat might sound like an unfairly broad characterization. But the polemics attacking the abundance agenda as anti-labor are notable for their lack of substantive engagement. They treat even the most indefensible union demands as implicitly sacrosanct. One example is a requirement in New York City that subway trains employ two operators. In a column published first in Common Dreams, republished by In These Times, and republished yet again by Jacobin, Dylan Gyauch-Lewis describes opposition to the two-operator rule as prima facie evidence of abundance liberals’ “skepticism of labor.” She does not bother to argue, or even assert, that this rule has any public-safety (or other) value.\n\nRunning through this line of argument is the idea that unions can do no wrong. Ro Khanna, a progressive representative from California who has praised aspects of the abundance agenda, recently told a meeting of the Teamsters,“The problem is not with the Teamsters. The problem is with the Democratic Party. We can’t expect people to vote if we don’t stand for working-class issues.”\n\nRecall that the Teamsters declined to endorse Harris in 2024 even after the Biden administration bailed out its pension fund. If that doesn’t count as standing up for working people, Biden must be wondering if he can have the $36 billion back to spend on something else.\n\nCampaigning and governing both involve trade-offs. Democrats can and should defend the right to organize and support positions held by unions that don’t impose a major drag on the public good. Winning the support of working-class voters requires compromising with their views on social policy, which risks alienating other progressive groups. Making policy decisions sometimes presents a choice between the financial well-being of an interest group, including unions, and the broader public.\n\nThe Biden administration tried to inhabit a reality in which none of these choices existed. They could appeal to social liberals and compensate for their shortcomings with the working class by giving the unions a virtual veto over policy. The formula is so seductive that many Democrats still refuse to notice that it doesn’t actually work.","summary":"Automatic deference to labor unions has not paid off for Democratic politicians.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/democrats-unions-working-class/684085/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/WaAlmmXK2Aw_9MaZcxVMm0N5gzQ=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/09/DemUnions/original.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 11:00:00","author":"Jonathan Chait","authors":["Jonathan Chait"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":357123342,"title":"The 65-year-old theory that helps explain why the Democrats keep losing","text":"Democratic strategists think the party has a messaging problem. Post-election autopsies overflowed with countless cross-tabs of how Democrats “underperformed” with demographic after demographic. There are endless debates about which words poll better (should Democrats stop using “microaggression”?) — as if anybody were even listening.\nThird Way’s “Signal Project” exemplifies this paralysis. The center-left think tank launched an 18-month project to identify which Trump actions are “most relevant to key voters.” Their profound discovery? “Shuttering USAID, using government power to attack political opponents, firing indiscriminately, degrading the civil service, releasing J6ers, or blaming Ukraine for the Russian invasion all are a combination of unwise, unethical, illegal, or unconstitutional,” according to Axios. “But none resonate much with key voters.” Who knew? \nShould we say “working families” or “working people”? Frame ourselves as “Team Normal” versus “Team Extreme”? Who notices? House Democrats test “America is too expensive” versus “People Over Politics.” Say “poor,” or say “economically disadvantaged”? “Addiction” or “substance use disorder”? Who cares?\nYet, leading Democrats seem to think that if only they spend another $50 million to identify the right message for lost working-class voters, they can “win them back” (tellingly, the “them” in the “Win Them Back Fund” gives away the flawed premise of the project).\nCertainly, polling and focus-group testing have their place. Polling, when done well, offers a snapshot of public opinion to see what is resonating (though even polling results are highly sensitive to question wording). Focus groups, when done well, can better capture the complex and often contradictory ways in which citizens think through politics, and can pick up on concerns that poll writers might miss or struggle to distill into simple questions (though moderators can very easily direct the results, often without realizing it). \nBut both are reactive to current news, almost by definition. They can never shape the dominant conflict. Only political leaders taking decisive actions can do that.\nThe Democrats don’t have a messaging problem. They have a much bigger problem: They have accepted a losing political battle they never chose without even realizing it.\nMessaging is how you talk about the fight once the battle has been chosen. It’s the tactics, slogans, and talking points deployed within an accepted frame. The conflict defines the possible frames. The frames — the greater story — shape the specific messages.\nDemocrats have a framing problem — once you’ve accepted a losing political gambit, it’s hard to regain your position with language alone, no matter how many focus groups and polls you commission. The lines are not always clear, but if politics were a pop song, think of conflict as the mood, instrumentation, and beat; frame as the melody, chords, and bubble-gum lyrics; and messaging as the vocal flourishes. \nAs the opposition party in Congress, Democrats’ ability to shift the conflict in Washington is depressingly limited. But America is a big country, with many Democratic governors and even more Democratic mayors. Consider the gerrymandering wars. Democratic governors have responded to Texas’s new gerrymander by promising to redraw their own lines, thus accepting the brutal reality. But why not use this focusing moment to instead call for proportional representation as an end to single-member districts that enable gerrymandering altogether and an end to the two-party system that single-member districts create, thus reshaping the conflict entirely? \nA theory of conflict\nConsider this: What was Kamala Harris’s 2024 slogan?\nMost people can’t even remember, because the campaign never settled on one. The closest thing — “We’re Not Going Back” — defined the party in purely defensive terms. Campaign slogans may be silly. But they are the one opportunity to distill a campaign and define a conflict. And all successful political movements understand, whether by design or accident, that the side that defines what the dominant fight is about usually wins. \n Take the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill: After some message testing, Democrats settled on calling it “One Big, Ugly Bill.” (How much did that message-testing cost?) Democrats tried to emphasize the cuts to Medicaid, which were generally unpopular, as were most pieces of the bill. But this is hard to message: In many states, Medicaid operates under a different name, and its funding flows through different programs, so it’s hard to see it as a direct benefit. Plus, these cuts will go into effect after the 2026 midterm elections. \nBy contrast, Vice President JD Vance telegraphed Republicans’ strategy clearly on X: “Everything else—the CBO score, the proper baseline, the minutiae of the Medicaid policy—is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions.” \nCome the midterms, which conflict — Medicaid policy or border security — will resonate more? Which conflict has been more central to American politics for a decade? If you are not sure, you may not understand how conflict works in politics; the more emotional, high-intensity conflict dominates. \nConflict defines politics. And if you don’t have a theory of conflict, it doesn’t matter what your theory of messaging or mobilization or issue-speak looks like.\nSo what does a theory of conflict look like? The best guide remains E.E. Schattschneider’s 1960 classic The Semi-Sovereign People. He writes:\n> What happens in politics depends on the way in which people are divided into factions, parties, groups, classes. The outcome of the game of politics depends on which of a multitude of possible conflicts gains the dominant position. \nHis insights are deceptively simple: Conflict organizes politics because conflict is interesting, and the most important political battle is always the battle over which battle matters most. Coalitions and majorities follow from the battle lines. \n“The definition of the alternatives is the supreme instrument of power,” Schattschneider argues. “He who determines what politics is about runs the country, because the definition of the alternatives is the choice of conflicts.”\nAnother example is President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Trump has framed tariffs as a recipe for American greatness and strength. Trump defines the conflict as between those who see the long-term benefit of an American manufacturing renaissance (a promise about the future), against those who might complain about having to pay a little more. \nBy focusing on prices, Democrats are accepting this frame, and thus, the conflict about American greatness. They are ignoring that the larger story is about the status and might of America. Even calling it a “tax” accepts this premise. People may grumble about taxes, but they can be willing to pay higher taxes if they think they are getting something in return. \nSo why not name the tax more directly to make its unpopularity stick a little more? ? Naming things gives them a specificity that makes them more memorable. \nCould Democrats define the conflict around tariffs not as a generic tax, but as an “isolation tax” — a premium we are paying to isolate ourselves from the world? This substitutes a different conflict: whether America wants to cut itself off from the world. Or: a “nostalgia tax” — a premium we are paying to recreate the past. This substitutes in a new conflict — past vs. future. \nSuch conflicts only work, however, if they fit with a larger set of policy fights that reinforce the conflict. They can’t just be floating messages. The important thing here is to understand how conflicts define the alternatives. And most importantly how consistent actions reinforce the conflicts, even if they are stunts; as long as they are interesting stunts. Trump showing up to work at McDonald’s or dressing up as a garbage collector during the campaign was an obvious stunt. But it was interesting and memorable. \nThis works in mundane contexts too. When I want my kids to clean up, I don’t ask whether they want to clean or not — I ask whether they want to clean now or in five minutes. They always choose five minutes, having failed to recognize my displacement of the real conflict by my strategic definition of alternatives. They would make excellent Democratic campaign managers.\nHow conflict definition works\nFor a master class in political conflict definition, consider how Franklin D. Roosevelt framed the 1936 election. Rather than defending New Deal policies on technical merits, he redefined the entire battle as a struggle between ordinary Americans and corrupt elites. His October 31 speech at Madison Square Garden demonstrated this strategy perfectly:\n> We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace—business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. ... Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.\nThe MAGA-infused Republican Party’s frame has in many ways echoed the broad strokes of the FDR-led Democratic Party. Mitt Romney’s Republicans fought on traditional conservative terrain: “job creators vs. job takers,” with immigration as a technocratic problem requiring “self-deportation.” Trump torched this framework entirely. His conflict: Corrupt elites betrayed ordinary Americans. Immigration became invasion. Republicans transformed from the party of capital gains tax cuts and H-1B visas into the party of working-class rage against globalist elites who shipped jobs overseas.\nAt times, Democrats have steered the conflict. Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign defined a brighter future against the failed politics of the Bush administration, particularly around the Iraq War. But Obama’s “hope and change” offensive became eight years of governing reality. By 2016, Democrats had transformed from insurgents into incumbents, with Hillary Clinton running explicitly as Obama’s third term — defender of Obamacare, guardian of norms, and seller of the narrative that America already was great.\nJoe Biden doubled down on the defensive, campaigning as democracy’s bodyguard who would restore “normalcy” and “decency.” When Trump redefined politics as “the people vs. corrupt institutions,” Democrats defended those very institutions against populist insurgency. Democrats have been struggling on this battlefield ever since. They never recognized how they got trapped there. In casting themselves as the stewards of democracy in 2024, they offered only a meager defense of the unpopular status quo.\nHow to create a new conflict\nAs Schattschneider understood, “Strategy is the heart of politics, as it is of war.” When frontal assault produces stalemate, you don’t need better tactics — you need a different battlefield. \nNew conflicts can emerge from identifying real contradictions that current politics can’t resolve and starting new fights. These are hard to find, and even harder to commit to, because to succeed they often require picking fights with your own side (as Trump did in 2016).\nOne leading contender on the Democratic side comes from the Abundance movement. The movement identified a genuine problem: America struggles to build. Housing, clean energy, transit — all blocked by regulations, lawsuits. Their solution: Make it easier to build.\nSounds nice. But where’s the conflict? It’s too polite, too technocratic. Who exactly is doing the blocking? The movement gestures vaguely at “NIMBYs” and “regulations,” but it doesn’t name names. \nReal conflict transformation requires what FDR understood: You need villains. (As he famously put it: “They are unanimous in their hate for me — and I welcome their hatred.”)\nWhat if you take the Abundance insight, but name the enemy? Call them the Extractors. These are the people who hoard their existing wealth, be they private equity firms, the oligarchs, NIMBY homeowners, monopolists, or Trump and his cronies.\nThey extract your rent through housing monopolies. They extract your data through tech monopolies. They extract your repair rights through hardware monopolies. Trump extracts your wealth through tariffs (a Trump Extraction Tax) — creating artificial scarcity at the border, then selling exemptions to the highest bidder. Extraction without building. \nThis also inverts Romney’s old frame about “makers” and “takers.” The nurse in the understaffed private equity hospital? She’s a maker. She’s making people healthier. The firm that cut staff to extract fees? They’re the takers. The farmer growing food? A maker, producing sustenance for the country. John Deere blocking their right to repair their own tractors? Taker.\nNew conflicts create excitement — they bring in people who were sitting out the old fight. They create new enemies and new allies. They scramble existing coalitions. When you redefine the conflict from “liberal elites vs. the real Americans” to “builders vs. extractors,” the farmer who voted Trump because of cultural grievances might join with the young progressive who can’t afford rent along with the entrepreneur who can’t start a business and the social media content creator who finds all her data is now being used against her. All are makers and builders, oppressed by current extractors. And the extractor-in-chief, Trump, is getting rich while creating the ultimate scarcity through executive graft and tariffs. \nMaybe “builders vs. extractors” isn’t the right conflict. Maybe it’s something else entirely. But the point is this: You can’t message your way out of fighting on unfavorable terrain. You need new terrain. You need a new conflict if you are losing the old one. \nSchattschneider called the people “semi-sovereign” because they can only choose between conflicting alternatives, developed by the major parties. The implication: Popular sovereignty depends on leaders willing to open up new conflicts and create new choices. As he understood: “The people are powerless if the political enterprise is not competitive. It is the competition of political organizations that provides the people with the opportunity to make a choice. Without this opportunity popular sovereignty amounts to nothing.”\nThe people are waiting to be sovereign. They just need somebody to give them a fight worth joining.","summary":"Democratic strategists think the party has a messaging problem.

HINT: His Father Is...","text":"Chloe Grace Moretz and model Kate Harrison have taken the next step in their relationship, as the two are now officially married. While the pair has always kept their romance away from the spotlight, reports suggest they have been together for nearly seven years. Fans have always admired their bond, and news of their marriage has made fans happy. Chloe first caught attention in 2024 when she openly spoke about supporting LGBTQ+ rights while explaining her vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. During the time, many also got to know about her sexuality. Now that her marriage with Kate has been confirmed, let’s revisit her past relationships.\nBrooklyn Beckham\nChloe Grace Moretz’s most public relationship was with Brooklyn Beckham, which began in August 2014 after they first crossed paths during Paris Fashion Week. The two were often seen together in Los Angeles and became a young Hollywood couple that everyone was talking about. Their first official red carpet appearance as a couple was for the movie Bad Neighbours 2. But in 2016, the two went their separate ways and weren’t spotted together for a year. In 2017, Chloe and Brooklyn gave their relationship another chance. Unfortunately, in April 2018, when Brooklyn was seen getting close with a model, it led to the final breakup between the couple.\n\nBack in 2015, Chloe Grace Moretz was linked to actor Alex Roe. They were spotted together several times, which made people believe they were dating. Although neither Chloe nor Alex ever confirmed their relationship, their regular outings kept fans curious. However, whatever was going on between them didn’t go on for too long. Soon, their rumoured romance faded away and the two went their separate ways.\nCameron Fuller\nChloe Grace Moretz was also rumoured to be dating her longtime friend Cameron Fuller in 2013. The pair, who have known each other since childhood, were often seen spending time together and sharing sweet moments on social media. However, the stars never confirmed a romantic relationship and simply claimed that they were just close friends. Despite the rumours, their friendship has stayed strong over the years.\nJansen Panettiere\nChloe Grace Moretz’s first major relationship was with actor Jansen Panettiere, which started in 2009 when they were both teenagers. The two met while working together on the film The Poker House and were often seen attending events as a pair. Their romance, however, didn’t last long and they went separate ways. Unfortunately, Jansen Panettiere passed away in 2023 due to heart related issues.\n\nIn 2011, Chloe Grace Moretz was linked to actor Colin Ford after the two were spotted together several times. They first met while working on the movie Hick and their off set interactions led fans to wonder if they were dating. However, the rumoured romance was short and there were no reports of them being together after that year. Since then, both actors have moved on, and Chloë has been involved with other high profile partners.","summary":"Now that Chloe Grace Moretz’s marriage to Kate Harrison has been confirmed, let's revisit her past relationships.","url":"https://www.news18.com/movies/hollywood/who-did-chloe-grace-moretz-date-before-marrying-kate-harrison-hint-his-father-is-aa-9546690.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/image-by-nvnbhanwala-naveen-bhanwala-2025-09-cedb1d6ec85c2cfbf2bd925c1fe00fe5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 10:18:10","author":"Lubna Khan,News18,Sahas","authors":["Lubna Khan","News18","Sahas"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.063},{"id":356969294,"title":"Maine brewery owner joins race to take on GOP Sen. Susan Collins","text":"Dan Kleban is betting that something is brewing in Maine, and he’s not talking about his company’s latest pale ale. Kleban, a Democrat who is a co-founder of Maine Beer Co., says Mainers have lost confidence in Republican Sen. Susan Collins ahead of her re-election race next year, so he’s jumping into the race to defeat her. “The cost of living up here is too damn high. People are being squeezed, and Susan Collins isn’t doing enough to help families out up here,” Kleban said in an interview Tuesday ahead of his campaign launch Wednesday. Kleban said Collins “went Washington, and she stopped looking out for Mainers.” \"People up here are struggling,” Kleban added later. “We’re a bunch of hard workers up here. We don’t ask for a lot. We don’t ask for handouts. All we ask is we get a fair shake.” The race is central to any path to a Democratic Senate majority next year, when the party needs to net four seats to take control of the chamber. And the growing primary may send broader signals about the state of the Democratic Party beyond Maine. Collins is the only Republican senator in a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won last year, making her Democrats’ top target. Collins, who has yet to officially announce that she is running for re-election, has been tough to beat. First elected in 1996, she has fostered personal relationships with voters and has proven she has bipartisan appeal. She won her fifth term in 2020 by 9 points even as President Donald Trump lost Maine by the same margin. Last year, Trump lost Maine by 7 points. Kleban and other Democrats believe Collins may be more vulnerable this year, even though she broke with Trump by opposing his signature tax cut and spending law, known as the “big, beautiful bill.” Kleban noted that Collins voted to advance that legislation before she ultimately opposed it and called her actions “the typical inside D.C. bulls--- politics that people are just fed up with.” Democrats have already started to try to paint Collins as a Washington insider. Majority Forward, the nonprofit arm of the main super PAC backing Senate Democrats, launched a $700,000 ad campaign against Collins on Tuesday, knocking her on congressional stock trading. But Democrats will first have to contend with a growing primary field that now includes Kleban as well as oyster farmer Graham Platner, an Army and Marine veteran; Jordan Wood, who was chief of staff to Katie Porter, D-Calif., when she was in the House; and David Costello, a former official with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Maryland state government. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who can’t run for re-election because of term limits, is also considering running against Collins. She recently told local reporters that she would decide by mid-November. Platner and Wood have both pledged to stay in the race if Mills jumps in. Kleban declined to say whether he would do the same, saying, \"We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.” Meanwhile, the Democratic primary is already heating up. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., endorsed Platner over the weekend and appeared with him at one of his “Fight the Oligarchy” rallies Monday. Asked about Sanders’ involvement, Kleban said that he doesn’t know Platner and that he would stay focused on his own campaign. A self-described “pragmatist,” Kleban plans to stress his work as a small-business owner. Pressed to cite someone in his party he sees as a strong leader, he pointed to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. Kleban said he empathizes with Mainers who struggle to make ends meet, noting that he and his brother launched Maine Beer Co. after he was laid off from his job during the Great Recession. With the slogan “Do what’s right,” which he highlighted in his campaign launch video, Kleban said, his company has grown while also contributing funds to environmental groups, paying its employees a \"living wage\" and covering their health insurance costs. Kleban did praise Collins back in 2015 for her work on tax relief for small businesses, which he likened in the interview to a broken clock’s still being “right twice a day.” He acknowledged Collins has done some good, but he accused her of having lost touch with Mainers, pointing to her votes to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2020 and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health and human services secretary this year. If Kleban prevails in his primary, he would be running against Collins as a Democrat amid record-low ratings for his party, but he sees a path forward for Democrats. “What I’m going to do is offer voters a vision of the future that’s inspirational. How are we going to make their lives better and not get bogged down in social issues?” he said, saying he plans to focus on improving access to affordable housing and quality health care. “We need to prove that we can be the party that makes people’s lives better,” he said.","summary":"Dan Kleban is betting that something is brewing in Maine, and he’s not talking about his company’s latest pale ale.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/maine-brewery-owner-joins-race-take-gop-sen-susan-collins-rcna228108","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250829-DAN-KLEBAN-aa-444-11e47f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 09:00:00","author":"Bridget Bowman","authors":["Bridget Bowman"],"language":"en","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":357096974,"title":"Are Trump’s gains among Latino voters fading? New Jersey is the first big test.","text":"At a nondescript Exxon gas station in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood just over the river from Manhattan, something unusual is going on.\n\nThe place is a local gathering spot for café con leche or espresso from Ramirez & Sons, the Cuban coffee shop tucked inside. But on this weekday afternoon, it’s serving as something besides the normal café y chisme (gossip): A backdrop for Spanish-language campaign videos for the Republican Party.\n\nJuan Barbadillo, a retired salesman who was born in Cuba and has lived in New Jersey for a half-century, goes on camera to lament his skyrocketing utility bills, which he blames squarely on Democrats. Shooting the video is Kennith Gonzalez, who leads Hispanic outreach efforts as executive director of the New Jersey Republican State Committee.\n\nTheir political views once made them outliers bordering on curiosities in this community, where serious Republican candidates didn’t even bother to campaign. But that’s changing.\n\nHispanic and Latino voters of all stripes swung hard to Donald Trump across the nation last fall, helping him secure the White House. The president lost Latino voters by just three percentage points in 2024, after losing them by a 25-point margin in 2020 and by an even wider margin in 2016.\n\nThat big swing was especially evident in the Garden State. Mr. Trump lost New Jersey by just 5.9 percentage points, the closest a GOP presidential candidate has come to winning there since 1992, helped in large part by double-digit gains in many Latino-heavy communities.\n\nNow, New Jersey Republicans are hoping they can capitalize on those shifts to win the governorship this fall, in a state whose population is one-fifth Hispanic and is viewed as a key bellwether for the mood of the national electorate heading into the 2026 midterm elections. Former state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli is running again, after losing the governor’s race four years ago. He’s facing Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who has held a tough swing district since 2018.\n\nMr. Gonzalez worked for Mr. Ciattarelli’s campaign in 2021 while still in college, when “a lot of Republicans seemed to just write off” the Hispanic community. In the wake of Mr. Trump’s surprising performance with Latinos last fall, Mr. Gonzalez says the party is working much harder to win them this time around.\n\nMr. Trump “didn’t invest any resources in this area, it was an organic thing,” he says. “So with a little bit of work, or a lot of work that we’re going to be seeing this year from the Republican Party… we are due for a big, big, big shift.”\n\nBut while Republicans believe they can build on Mr. Trump’s gains among Hispanic voters – potentially giving the GOP an edge in states from Arizona to Pennsylvania – there are some indications that those gains might instead be slipping away. Many Latinos who backed the president last fall because of frustration over the cost of living say they’ve seen no improvement. At the same time, Mr. Trump’s nationwide deportation push has struck some Hispanic voters, even those concerned about illegal immigration, as overly aggressive.\n\nJose Arango, the chair of the Hudson County Republican Party, says his party has a golden opportunity with Latinos that could effectively lock in a GOP majority for years to come. “If we turn the Hispanics with us in a solid way, we’re going to have a majority in Congress no matter what,” he says.\n\nBut he worries that the Trump administration’s deportation policies are undercutting that momentum, especially as the administration rounds up unauthorized immigrants who have lived and worked here for decades without breaking other laws.\n\n“I hear from families that agree with the president, people who voted for the president, but they worry now that he’s not only getting rid of criminals, he’s going to get rid of labor,” he says. “We’re not against the president’s policy. But we have to be careful we don’t overdo it.”\n\nBacksliding in polls\n\nNationally, polls show that Mr. Trump is backsliding with Latinos.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in mid-August found the president’s job approval rating had dropped to 32% among Hispanic voters, the lowest in that survey since he returned to office. The Pew Research Center pegged Mr. Trump’s approval rating among Hispanic voters at 27%; it was 28% in a recent Economist/YouGov poll.\n\nEquis Research, a Democratic polling group that focuses on Latino voters, recently found that a quarter who say they voted for Mr. Trump in November now are disappointed (19%) or regret their vote (8%). Democrats led among Hispanic voters by 53% to 29%, a margin much closer to 2020 than 2024; 11% of Latino Trump voters now say they plan to vote for a Democrat in the 2026 midterms.\n\nDozens of conversations with Latino residents in northern New Jersey reveal unhappiness with Mr. Trump’s handling of the cost of living, along with concerns about his interior immigration enforcement policies.\n\nBergenline Avenue, the main drag of a handful of Hispanic-majority cities across the river from New York City, was once nicknamed “Havana on the Hudson.” Today, the artery isn’t just Cuban: Its busy blocks are packed with restaurants, barbershops, and bodegas flying flags from every corner of Latin America.\n\nMr. Trump won 42% of the vote in the town of West New York last fall, a big increase from his 30% showing in 2020 and 23% in 2016. He topped 40% of the vote and more than doubled his vote share from 2016 to 2024 in Union City, the next town south, as well as in Elizabeth, another heavily Hispanic town further south down the New Jersey Turnpike.\n\nMr. Barbadillo was the local GOP nominee for state Senate in 2021, and won just over a quarter of the vote in the heavily Democratic district. By 2024, however, he says neighbors in the town, which is more than three-quarters Hispanic, started quietly telling him that they planned to vote for Mr. Trump. The biggest reason? Spiraling costs.\n\nBut now, Mr. Barbadillo worries that support might be slipping – as prices under the Trump administration have continued to rise – and he’s worried that the president’s tariffs will push costs even higher. A former salesman for Goya Foods, he says that local stores used to sell four cans of the company’s tomato sauce for a dollar as recently as a year ago. Now, they’re 74 cents apiece. The Hershey kisses his wife likes have nearly doubled in price. “You’re gonna get a nice steak? When you touch it, you burn,” he said, jerking his hand back theatrically with a laugh.\n\nThe impact of immigration raids has also unquestionably been felt in the community. When asked about President Trump, it’s the first thing most people bring up, including those who had voted for him.\n\nMany also seem afraid to talk. Most in this community primarily speak Spanish, and among those willing to speak to a reporter, roughly half say they can’t vote because they’re residents, not citizens. But the American citizens in the community are feeling the effects of the raids as well.\n\nThe owner of a laundromat in Elizabeth says that her heavily Latino clientele has thinned significantly in recent months. She thinks many are avoiding public places where they could be the target of raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The clerk at Ramirez & Sons Coffee says the shop’s business has recently dropped off, and speculates that immigrants are staying home out of fear.\n\nEven some enthusiastic Trump supporters express unease with the deportation push.\n\nWalter Baloco, a barber born and raised in Elizabeth, voted for Mr. Trump three times – to the consternation of his Colombian family and many friends. He defends the president’s economic policies, blaming high prices on lingering problems from President Joe Biden's time in office. But he is conflicted about the current deportation push: He believes something “had to be done” about illegal immigration but says it’s wrong for the administration to arrest people who’ve been “living here for so many years.”\n\nIf “they’re working and paying taxes and doing whatever they have to do to stay – I feel like those people should stay,” he says.\n\nCampaign outreach ramping up\n\nBoth gubernatorial campaigns know they have serious work to do with Hispanics.\n\nMr. Ciattarelli himself acknowledged he should have done more to try to win over Hispanic and Black voters in his last election, which he lost by just three points.\n\n“There’s no better way to put it: My team was too white,” he said during a 2022 speech. “I did well in the Black and brown community, but I could have done even better.” He’s recently popped up at Dominican restaurants in Paterson and an Ecuadorian parade in Newark.\n\nAs the calendar turns to September, both sides are now launching TV advertising. But before that, there were few signs of active campaigning here – from either candidate.\n\nAt a Dominican barbershop on Bergenline, the owners say they backed Mr. Trump in every election since 2016 and displayed Trump campaign signs. But they weren’t aware of the looming governor’s race, a common reaction among Latino voters here.\n\nThe only campaign signs for governor the Monitor spotted in two days in town were in a shuttered storefront – for a candidate who’d lost the June Democratic primary to Representative Sherrill.\n\nMost public polls have found Ms. Sherrill with a lead in the mid-to-high single digits, a range that sources say matches internal polling on both the Democratic and Republican side. While there hasn’t been any public polling specifically focused on Hispanic voters, some poll crosstabs indicate that Ms. Sherrill has some work to do to shore up the Latino vote. A Fairleigh Dickinson poll in July found her leading Mr. Ciattarelli by 41% to 27% among Hispanic voters, a closer margin than most Democrats would want to see.\n\nOff-year elections always have lower turnout than presidential years, and the Hispanic vote tends to drop even more. It’s unclear which candidate that would benefit: Many Latino Trump voters in New Jersey didn’t vote down-ballot last fall, but low Latino turnout overall will likely still hurt Democrats.\n\nDemocrats promise that their Hispanic outreach efforts this fall will ramp up significantly.\n\n“After November, the Democrats have really heard a wake up call. … People are really going to be heavily working towards getting out that Latino vote,” says Laura Matos, who represents New Jersey at the Democratic National Committee and is a board member of Latina Civic Action, which backs Ms. Sherrill. “It’s going to be a very, very clear indicator of where things are potentially headed for the midterms.”\n\nStill, some Democrats privately say Ms. Sherrill needs to pick up the pace with Hispanic outreach.\n\nMs. Sherrill has held a swing district that is predominantly white (though it is 16% Latino) since 2019. She won her crowded gubernatorial primary with 34% of the vote, but didn’t perform quite as strongly in Hispanic areas. She’s recently attended a Peruvian parade in Paterson, a Puerto Rican festival in Hudson County, and done a number of interviews on Hispanic-focused TV and radio programs.\n\n“Throughout the campaign, Mikie has been in close communication with the Hispanic and Latino community – meeting communities where they are, listening to the issues facing them,” Sherrill campaign spokesman Sean Higgins tells the Monitor.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Andy Kim, a former House colleague of Ms. Sherrill’s, won New Jersey’s open Senate seat last year. He says Ms. Sherrill faces some of the same “growing pains” he went through, moving from a mostly white, politically competitive district to running statewide “in an exceedingly diverse state.” Ms. Sherrill has picked his brain on the race, he says, commending her laser-like focus on cost-of-living issues.\n\nThe rightward trend of New Jersey’s Hispanic vote is “something that definitely is concerning,” he says. But “putting that focus in pays off. So, it’s not something that’s insurmountable.”\n\nThe Democratic National Committee recently gave $1.5 million to New Jersey Democrats for the race, in part to “expand our reach to key constituencies that we lost ground with in the November 2024 elections.”\n\nBut while many Latino voters express frustration with President Trump, that doesn’t mean they’re ready to flock back to Democrats. Cost-of-living issues cut both ways in New Jersey, where Democrats have held the governorship since 2018, and federal immigration issues aren’t as directly relevant in a governor’s race.\n\nAnd some former Democratic voters might just stay home.\n\nWorking her shift at the children’s clothing store Kid City on Bergenline Avenue, Maria Zapeda says she voted for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. But in 2024, the Guatemala native, U.S. citizen, and longtime New Jerseyan didn’t like either candidate – and sat out the election.\n\nShe has friends and family who “wanted a change” and backed Mr. Trump, and says many are now having second thoughts.\n\n“Everybody’s frustrated. They reject him now. They say, ‘Why [did] I vote for the guy?’ I hear it a lot,” she says.\n\nBut Ms. Zapeda still stands by her decision not to vote for Kamala Harris. For now, she says she’ll probably vote in this fall’s governor’s race. She just hasn’t made up her mind about which candidate she’ll vote for.","summary":"Were Donald Trump’s gains among Hispanic voters an anomaly – or the beginning of a more permanent realignment?

They were there to learn about a proposal to allow deep-sea mining across more than 18 million acres of their surrounding waters in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had issued an executive order to jump-start the nascent deep-sea mining industry three months earlier. Within weeks, the U.S. Department of the Interior began asking for public input on leasing the seabed surrounding American Samoa, and the territorial government organized a series of meetings to help educate the public on what to expect. \n\nDuring the meeting, Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive officer of a mining company called Impossible Metals, appeared on Zoom from San Jose, California, to give a presentation about how his company’s proposal to mine the seafloor about 130 miles offshore would benefit the American Samoan community. \n\n“We have committed to provide 1 percent of our profits from the American Samoa EEZ to the community of American Samoa,” said Gunasekara, using the acronym for Exclusive Economic Zone, which refers to the waters surrounding American Samoa up to 200 miles from shore. Gunasekara said his company expects to generate up to $1 billion of annual revenue from mining; 1 percent would translate into $10 million for American Samoa per year. \n\nAbout half an hour later, a local woman stood and commented on Gunasekara’s proposal. “I think it’s an insult that it’s 1 percent,” she said. “This is our ocean.” \n\n“Many millions of dollars a year is not an insubstantial amount of money,” Gunasekara replied. “There’s no legal requirement for us to do this. This is something that we have voluntarily done. To my knowledge, no other mining company has.”\n\nTo Sabrina Suluai-Mahuka, who leads American Samoa’s climate resilience office and helped organize the meeting, Gunasekara’s response did not go over well. Neither did references by other industry officials to how it is preferable to mine “remote” parts of the Pacific than on land. \n\n“Our waters are not isolated,” Suluai-Mahuka told Grist. “We live here.”\n\nA year ago, American Samoa’s then-governor issued a moratorium on deep-sea mining around the central Pacific archipelago. Yet when Trump issued his executive order on seabed mining in April, local leaders did not immediately reject it. Just a week earlier, the territory’s current governor, Pula Nikolao Pula, had publicly lauded Trump’s effort to open up Pacific conservation areas to commercial fishing, the islands’ leading industry. \n\nBut after discussing and researching the proposal, every major political leader in American Samoa came to agree: Their answer is no. “There is strong opposition to any exploration or extraction of minerals from the ocean floor in waters near American Samoa,” wrote Representative Amata Coleman Radewagen, American Samoa’s only U.S. congressional representative, in her official comments to the Interior Department. She described how Samoan culture, known as fa’a samoa, includes the story of a mother and a daughter who transformed into a turtle and a shark and swam to Tutuila. \n\n“This is where the people stand, and I stand with the people — to preserve the shark and the turtle and fa’a samoa,” she said. \n\nYet whether or where the mining happens may not be up to the local Indigenous people. Unlike the independent country of Samoa, just a day’s sail away, American Samoa is a U.S. territory, subject to the whims of the American flag. Radewagen has a seat in the House of Representatives, but she is not allowed to vote, and U.S. territories have no voice at all in the U.S. Senate. \n\nResidents of American Samoa, like residents of other U.S. territories, had no choice in whether Trump or Kamala Harris became president. Under international law, Indigenous peoples have the right to consent to projects on their lands, and in previous disputes with the federal government, American Samoa has pointed out that when it was established, the U.S. promised to respect the rights of its people. But while the Department of the Interior has elicited American Samoansʻ opinions on seabed mining, the agency’s current process could allow mining to proceed over the community’s objections.\n\nAngelo Villagomez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress specializing in Indigenous-led conservation, is among more than 2,000 current and former residents of U.S. territories who signed a petition opposing the mining proposal. He said the situation in American Samoa reflects a broader assault on public lands and waters by the Trump administration, and highlights the political disparity facing residents of U.S. territories.\n\n“No place is safe under this administration,” Villagomez said. “They’re not just trying to drill for oil in the Gulf of Mexico and off the East Coast — they’re going to the farthest reaches of the American empire to look to extract natural resources,” he said, adding: “We should only be doing these things if the people who have to live with the outcomes are supportive of it.”\n\nDeep-sea mining is the process of removing minerals like manganese, cobalt, nickel, and copper from the bottom of the sea at depths greater than 650 feet (or 200 meters). In recent years, companies have spent millions of dollars investing in technology and testing it in the hopes that the fledgling industry will get the green light from national and international regulators to begin mining commercially. The problem, said Andrew Thaler, a Maryland-based deep sea ecologist and environmental consultant, is that less than half a percent of the deep-sea floor has been studied. Recently, scientists discovered a deep-sea coral reef almost as big as the Great Barrier Reef that lies perilously close to a seabed-mining test site from the 1970s. “They came within 20 kilometers of basically strip-mining the largest deep-sea coral reef on the planet 50 years before we even knew it existed,” Thaler said. \n\nHundreds of scientists have raised alarm about the industry’s potential to destroy sensitive habitats of animals that have evolved undisturbed for millions of years.\n\nGunasekara says his company is different. While other mining companies want to rip metals off of sea crusts or drill into hydrothermal vents to pull out metals, Gunasekara’s company is committed to only one type of extraction method: removing potato-sized globs of minerals, known as polymetallic nodules, from the ocean floor. \n\nTo do that, Impossible Metals invented robots that descend into the ocean and hover above the seabed. When the machines identify a polymetallic nodule, a robot arm reaches down and grabs it, similar to a claw machine grabbing a stuffed animal in an arcade. Gunasekara said the robots are smart enough to avoid living creatures, and he expects to program the machines to pick up 40 percent of the nodules they see, leaving most of the habitat behind undisturbed.\n\nThat’s far different from the house-size tractors that other mining companies intend to drive over the seafloor that would necessarily crush the creatures beneath them. In addition to pursuing his own mining operations, Gunasekara wants Impossible Metals’ technology to be adopted by other companies. \n\n“We would like our tech to be the preferred moving forward because it’s much less environmentally invasive, no sediment plumes, no biodiversity loss,” Gunasekara told Grist. “I want to be crystal clear: I’m not saying we’ll have zero impact; I’m just saying we will have by far the lowest impact of any form of mining anywhere on the planet.”\n\nGunasekara said Impossible Metals’ robots would also avoid releasing plumes of sediment that other mining companies expect to release when lifting minerals up to the surface. Avoiding or minimizing that plume is important because scientists fear that mineral-rich sediment plumes could contaminate fisheries. Such pollution could be disastrous for American Samoa, where tuna makes up 99.5 percent of the territory’s exports. \n\nJeffrey Drazen, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaiʻi who has studied the environmental effects of deep-sea mining, said he likes the idea of Gunasekara’s technology, but has no idea if it’s going to work. “It’s hard to evaluate any of these claims because it needs to be trialed,” Drazen said. \n\nThere aren’t any peer-reviewed studies validating Gunasekara’s claims, and a federal environmental analysis hasn’t yet been completed. The company has tested its technology off the coast of Florida, but it still needs more analysis. “If it all works, then it will reduce environmental risk,” Drazen said of Gunasekara’s technology. At the same time, “It’s still mining. It’s still removing a substrate from the bottom of the ocean that takes millions of years to form and is habitat for the animals who live there.” \n\nGunasekara thinks that the environmental cost is worth it, because the minerals that are contained in the polymetallic nodules could help create batteries for electric vehicles and other green technologies, reducing energy dependency on fossil fuels.\n\n“We all want to protect the ocean. But the biggest threat to the ocean, especially the deep ocean, is climate change,” Gunasekara said. “And so the question is, Where do we get the metal from to displace fossil fuels?”\n\nGunasekara is far from the only entrepreneur who sees opportunity in the demand for minerals and potential for profit. Companies have for years been building support among other Pacific islands like the Cook Islands, funding numerous local causes like medical equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic and the construction of traditional canoes in the hopes that they’ll be able to tap into what’s been called a “$20 trillion opportunity.” Those efforts seem to be paying off: The Cook Islands’ prime minister has been supportive of seabed mining, and just a few weeks ago, the country signed a new agreement with the Trump administration for seabed mining exploration. \n\nAmerican Samoa hasn’t seen that same level of community investment; Gunasekara from Impossible Metals hasn’t yet visited. “We’re not a massive company, and so we have not been on the ground, although we’ve had multiple calls with the governor’s office and with other people,” Gunasekara said. Currently, the Delaware-based startup employs 15 full-time workers.\n\nPart of the reason mining companies are not flocking to Tutuila is that, ultimately, Gunasekara expects the decision on mining leases will be made 7,000 miles away in Washington, D.C. “These waters are not within the jurisdiction of American Samoa,” Gunasekara told Grist. “They may not like this, but under federal law, 3 miles off the coast belong to the territory or the state; from 3 miles to 200 belong to the federal government, and it is purely their jurisdiction.”\n\nThat’s also why Gunasekara is not discouraged by local opposition to his plan. He thinks there’s a less than 1 percent chance the Trump administration will stop the process given how enthusiastically the president has embraced mining. “They are required to be consulted, but it’s not their decision,” he said of local officials. He noted the territory also doesn’t have the right to any federal lease revenue for seabed mining the same way states like Texas and Louisiana get a cut of offshore oil and gas lease revenue, although Gunasekara said he’s in favor of changing that.\n\nThe Department of the Interior is still at the beginning of the process of issuing any seabed mining leases. The agency plans to review the public comments, identify specific areas for mining, and conduct an environmental assessment before making any leases available. \n\nSuluai-Mahuka, the climate change resilience director in American Samoa, said the community’s lack of decision-making power comes up frequently in conversations about potential mining. “It’s within our EEZ, but it’s not within our call or our voice to say whether or not we can auction off our seabed,” she said. \n\n“But at the end of the day,” she continued, “the question is, Whose livelihoods are going to be affected? It’s American Samoa. Whose economy might be affected with our reliance on the fishing industry? American Samoa. And whose historical ties and identities are tied to these waters? It’s American Samoa. It would make sense for our consent to be given if there was deep-sea mining,” she said. “And if the process continues, and our consent is not given, that’s very telling.”","summary":"The CEO of a seabed mining startup says the decision about mining leases will be made in Washington, D.C.","url":"https://grist.org/indigenous/american-samoa-says-no-to-deep-sea-mining-trump-administration/","image":"https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/american-samoa.jpg?quality=75&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 08:30:00","author":"Anita Hofschneide,Anita Hofschneider","authors":["Anita Hofschneide","Anita Hofschneider"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":357029676,"title":"Trump's Deputies Win 93% Drop in 'Unaccompanied Alien Children' Border Smuggling","text":"ICE officers have slashed the cross-border smuggling of migrant children and youths by arresting the U.S.-based illegal migrants who fund the smuggling, often with wages from U.S. jobs.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) reported on September 2 that the illegal migrant parents of smuggled children have been arrested when they try to pick up children from government shelters:\n\nNeha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a “built-in opportunity” to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.\n\nThe arrests are deterring migrants from using the government-run “Unaccompanied Alien Children” (UAC) smuggling route, which ferried more than 500,000 migrant youth and children northwards during President Joe Biden’s term.\n\nThe AP reported:\n\nMary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. “As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,” Miller Flowers said.\n\nIn July 2025, border officials picked up just 515 children and youths at the border, down from 7,501 in July 2024. The arrival numbers show a 93 percent drop in the inflow.\n\nThe decline will help children in schools, many of which are still overcrowded by the massive smuggling levels encouraged by Joe Biden and his pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nThe pro-migration policies pushed by Mayorkas may have killed thousands of migrants and damaged many poor countries.\n\nThe child-smuggling shutdown came after President Donald Trump’s deputies adopted a series of anti-smuggling measures that clearly identify the people who choose to sponsor the children as they are being settled in the United States. The government now requires sponsors to provide fingerprints, DNA tests, and income-related submissions.\n\nTrump’s deputies are also trying to prevent the youths from getting green cards after they turn 18, via the “Special Immigrant Juvenile” court hearings.\n\nThe “Unaccompanied Alien Children” smuggling route was created in 2008 by a unanimous vote in the Senate and a voice vote in the House. It was sold to legislators as a way to protect kids and teens who were being smuggled for prostitution, but it was quickly converted into a lucrative smuggling scam by coyotes who moved more than 500,000 young people into the United States by early 2025.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, officials helped to triple the northward flow of children to labor traffickers and to families in the United States.\n\nA majority of the youths were delivered by coyotes to labor traffickers in the United States. Most were assigned to tough jobs where much of their pay was taken by coyotes and cartels. Some girls were transferred from Biden’s deputies to pimps operating prostitution rings.\n\nMany of the younger children were the left-behind children of illegal migrants. Typically, the migrant paid coyotes to smuggle their children past the cartels and into the safe arms of the U.S. government for subsequent handover to parents or labor traffickers.\n\nThe coyotes would accompany the children and youths to the border, then hand them over to the U.S. Border Patrol. In turn, the children would be accompanied by U.S. government officials to shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services, where they would be accompanied for several months by social workers until they were transferred to their traffickers or to their illegal migrant parents.\n\nDemocrats and progressives have consistently supported the multinational exploitative scam, even as they also used it to portray themselves as noble protectors of children.\n\nFor example, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) won passage of an amendment in 2019 that made it difficult for ICE officials to arrest migrants who smuggled their children through the UAC route.\n\nThe Associated Press article lists several elite-funded, pro-migration groups that object to Trump’s anti-smuggling policies. For example, it cited Jennifer Podkul, the “chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, [saying] some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.”\n\nThe AP article hides the corruption, scale, and damage caused by the smuggling strategy.","summary":"ICE officers have slashed the cross-border smuggling of migrant children and youths by arresting the U.S.-based illegal migrants who fund the smuggling, often with wages from U.S. jobs.\n\n\nThe post Trump&#8217;s Deputies Win 93% Drop in &#8216;Unaccompanied Alien Children&#8217; Border Smuggling appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/09/02/trumps-deputies-shrink-unaccompanied-alien-children-border-loophole/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/09/filephoto-families-youths-us-mexico-border-patrol-file2023-getty-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 06:12:25","author":"Neil Munro","authors":["Neil Munro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":356907796,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel Recaps the ‘Non-Stop Crap Factory’ of Trump News While He Was Gone, Jokes God ‘Abandoned Us on Jan. 20’ | Video","text":"In his first “Jimmy Kimmel Live” since going on his annual vacation a few months ago, Jimmy Kimmel told his audience “I had a great summer.”\n\nExcept for the fact he was completely unable to ignore the “non-stop crap factory” of bad news created by Donald Trump.

Wes Moore is attempting to escape accountability for the out-of-control crime in his state by fleeing to Italy for a luxury getaway with Democrat elites.”\n\n“Gov. Moore needs to get his priorities straight — instead of taking yacht vacations or fantasizing about his 2028 presidential bid, he needs to make Maryland safe again,” the statement continued.\n\nThe release of the vacation photos sparked immediate outrage on social media, with critics slamming Moore for indulging in a luxury getaway while Maryland, and particularly Baltimore, grapples with rampant crime and economic struggles.\n\nOne viral post read: “HANGING OUT WITH GEORGE ON VACAY: @GovWesMoore traded Annapolis for Lake Como, sipping wine with Clooney while his tax and fee hikes crush Marylanders.

Wes Moore and his wife are seeking refuge in the comforts of a Hollywood actor’s famous Lake Como villa. Catching rays on George Clooney’s yacht…while Baltimore is a hell hole riddled with crime.”\n\nThe backlash comes as Moore continues a very public feud with President Donald Trump over crime in Baltimore. Just last month, Trump criticized Moore for inviting him to “walk the streets of Maryland,” calling it a “provocative” move and labeling Baltimore “crime-ridden.”\n\nOver the past few months, Trump has repeatedly threatened to send the National Guard into Baltimore, calling the city “out of control” and accusing Moore of ignoring public safety concerns.\n\nIn a July post on Truth Social, Trump blasted the governor, saying: “Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I ‘walk the streets of Maryland’ with him. I assume he is talking about out-of-control, crime-ridden Baltimore?”\n\nTrump’s comments came after Moore publicly rejected the idea of federal intervention, calling the president’s rhetoric divisive and counterproductive. Moore has argued that local leaders, not Washington, should be trusted to fix Baltimore’s deep-rooted issues.\n\n“The idea that the solution to Baltimore’s challenges is military occupation is as offensive as it is unserious,” Moore said during a press conference in August. “We need investment, not intimidation.”\n\nClooney, a prominent Democratic megadonor, has been vocal in his praise of Moore as a rising political star. In an interview with CNN earlier this year, the Oscar-winning actor said Moore was “levitating above” other potential Democratic presidential contenders and called him a “proper leader.”\n\n“He’s a proper leader.” George Clooney reveals his choice for the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee: Maryland Governor Wes Moore. pic.twitter.com/j8yiNw0b3V— Mike Sington (@MikeSington) April 17, 2025\n\nThe Hollywood icon’s political influence is well established — and recent. In 2024, Clooney made national headlines when he penned a bombshell New York Times op-ed calling President Joe Biden to step aside from the presidential race. The public plea sent shockwaves through the Democratic establishment and was widely credited with pressuring Biden to withdraw from his reelection campaign.\n\nClooney’s intervention helped pave the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic front-runner, a shift that dramatically reshaped the party’s strategy just months before the Democratic National Convention.\n\nCRIME IN US CITIES AS TRUMP AIMS TO EXPAND CRACKDOWN: LATEST COVERAGE\n\nClooney’s Lake Como estate — purchased in 2002 — has long served as a private gathering space for celebrities, diplomats, and political influencers.\n\nMoore has repeatedly denied having any intention of running for president in 2028, but his high-profile appearances — including attendance at the Sun Valley Conference in Idaho, often dubbed “billionaire summer camp” — have only fueled speculation.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Moore’s office for comment.","summary":"Gov.

In 2024, The Washington Post ran an opinion piece titled “A Trump dictatorship is inevitable.” The ubiquitous Democratic strategist James Carville said the 2024 election would decide whether we are “going to have a Constitution or not.”\n\nThroughout his White House years, it was impossible for Mr. Biden to open his yap without warning, in the most lurid terms, that his predecessor was “an existential threat to our system of government.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Vice President Kamala Harris agreed. If she didn’t win the presidency, she said, 2024 “genuinely could be” the last democratic election. It’s me or the abyss.\n\nThe Democratic Party is the little boy who cried wolf because the wolf is all he has.\n\nIt’s also a classic case of projection. For the real threats to our system of government, look leftward. Voters did not elect an autopen in 2020. They elected a man who was mentally and physically incapable of governing.\n\nA White House cabal governed in his name while repeatedly assuring us that the man who had to be led away from one event by the Easter Bunny was at the top of his game and sharp as a tack. This conspiracy was the ultimate betrayal of popular sovereignty.\n\nThe Democratic Party did everything it could to rig the 2024 election. Democratic secretaries of state tried to keep Mr. Trump’s name off the ballot. A unanimous U.S. Supreme Court rejected this unprecedented overreach.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Democratic officials bent the law in novel ways to prosecute the once and future president. New York Attorney General Letitia James ran for office on an I’ll-get-Trump platform. She decided crimes had been committed before producing any evidence. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis rounded out the George Soros lawfare trio.\n\nAll this was intended to prejudice voters against Mr. Trump. It was an attempt to sabotage the democratic process in the midst of a presidential election.\n\nThe Democratic Party is hardly a model of democracy. Ms. Harris didn’t win its presidential nomination; it was bestowed on her.\n\nSo, according to the left, democracy is allowing 2 million illegal aliens (including hardened criminals, drug dealers and gang members) to cross our borders; interfering with law enforcement because they don’t like a law; letting illegals who can’t read road signs drive big rigs; opposing voter ID laws because they make it harder to steal elections; using public office to enrich their families; inciting violence that results in months of urban riots; gun confiscation; so-called gender transitioning for minors; indoctrination in public schools; slow-walking presidential nominations to an unprecedented degree; statehood for the District of Columbia (assuring the Democratic Party two votes in the Senate in perpetuity); abolishing the Electoral College; and packing the Supreme Court.\n\nGod save democracy from its defenders.\n\nThe argument about what constitutes a democracy goes back to Thomas Jefferson, founder of the Democratic Party. Jefferson’s ideal was a small government of strictly limited powers, the very opposite of what his party has advocated since the New Deal. If Jefferson were president today, most Democratic officeholders would say the author of the Declaration of Independence was a threat to democracy.\n\nDemocratic hysteria isn’t working. Polls show voters think the real threat to democracy is a party that incites lawlessness, not a president who stands for public safety.\n\nYet Democrats are addicted to Chicken Little tactics (“Help, help, our democracy is falling!”), so their smear campaign against the president and his allies will continue.\n\nThis column was first published at the Washington Times.","summary":"'The Democratic Party is the little boy who cried wolf because the wolf is all he has'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/09/god-save-democracy-its-so-called-defenders/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/chuck-schumer-20250318-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 23:03:05","author":"Don Feder","authors":["Don Feder"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.178},{"id":356843920,"title":"Trump Faces Fresh Criticism in Handling of Jeffrey Epstein Scandal, According to CNN Poll","text":"CNN’s resident data expert revealed that Donald Trump may be in deep trouble with voters due to his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\nA recent poll carried out by the political research firm SSRS and highlighted by CNN’s chief data analyst, Harry Enten, revealed that half of Americans are dissatisfied with the information released by the government regarding the Epstein case.\n\nA full 43 percent of Republican-leaning respondents said they were dissatisfied with case, Enten said, with just 4 percent saying they’re satisfied.\n\n‘Wow, it’s amazing! Only 4 percent aligning with Donald Trump on this issue is incredibly low,’ Enten remarked during a segment on CNN’s News Central.\n\n‘I’ve never seen anything quite like it.’ \n\nFor left-leaning respondents, 60 percent said they were dissatisfied with the case as well and 3 percent said they were satisfied.\n\nEnten pointed out that Trump had relied on the backing of conspiracy theorists to secure his reelection and had frequently vowed to fully disclose Epstein’s case file.\n\nLast week, the Justice Department released findings stating that Epstein never even kept a ‘client list’ and that he killed himself in jail.\n\nThe announcement sparked strong criticism from prominent MAGA supporters and fringe theorists, whom Enten noted were instrumental in reviving Trump’s political standing after his 2020 election defeat.\n\n‘Donald Trump, from the very beginning, has been pushing conspiracy theories over and over and over again, and he has benefited from them historically,’ the data expert said.\n\n ‘And now, finally, it’s coming back to actually bite him.’\n\nWhen asked by host Sara Sidner what the poll indicated overall, Enten replied: ‘I would say that the word is dissatisfied. \n\n‘That is how Americans feel in terms of the releases so far in the Epstein case.’\n\nHe highlighted how QAnon’s support for Trump in last year’s election proved crucial to his win over Kamala Harris, when the Republican repeatedly suggested there was more to the case than meets the eye. \n\nSuch claims stoked the interests of many, especially on the right. \n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are now calling on Trump to make good on his promise. \n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday said that the files should be released.\n\nThe Justice Department’s announcement on the findings earned harsh criticism from leading MAGA figures, including Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Laura Loomer.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had insisted in February that the Epstein list was ‘sitting on my desk right now to review.’ She subsequently released Epstein documents to right-wing influencers that turned out to contain no new information.\n\nSome critics have called for Bondi to be fired while pointing to the announcement as proof of a conspiracy surrounding Epstein and his associates.\n\nEpstein and Trump have were pictured together several times in the ’90s and 2000s. Both carved out presences in Manhattan and Palm Beach.\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump blamed Barack Obama, Hilly Clinton, former FBI boss James Comey and ‘the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration’ for the Epstein files, painting it as unreliable.\n\nHe also reiterated the Justice Department’s stance that a list of Epstein’s old clients did not exist, angering many who voted for him in the process. \n\nEnten hit this home with data from a series of older polls, including one of registered voters who believed in conspiracy theories peddled by QAnon.\n\nThe poll, conducted by nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute two months before the election, showed Trump beating Harris by a margin of +61.\n\nThe same poll found registered voters who rejected such conspiracies preferred Harris over Trump by a margin of +16.\n\nAnother poll showed how registered GOP voters and right-leaning independents who picked Trump in 2024 and 2016 have repeatedly sided with conspiracy theories the president has pushed for years. \n\n‘Trump swam in the conspiracy theorist waters for years, and now, finally, the sharks in those waters are coming to try and get him,’ Enten said in response. \n\nOn Saturday, Trump tried to wave off disgruntled voters clamoring for the full case file with a widely ridiculed post to Truth Social.\n\n‘What’s going on with my “boys” and, in some cases, “gals”?’ asked the president. ‘We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and “selfish people’ are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.’\n\nA report from Wired last week found the surveillance footage released to back up the Justice Department’s claim that Epstein killed himself in a New York City prison cell in 2019 was likely edited.\n\nFurther analysis from the publication revealed a full three minutes of the footage was cut out. \n\nDaily Mail contacted the Federal Bureau of Prisons for comment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCNN&#8217;s resident data expert revealed that Donald Trump may be in deep trouble with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Faces Fresh Criticism in Handling of Jeffrey Epstein Scandal, According to CNN Poll first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/trump-faces-fresh-criticism-in-handling-of-jeffrey-epstein-scandal-according-to-cnn-poll/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rewrite-this-title-Poll-How-Americans-feel-about-info-released.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 22:37:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":356847380,"title":"ICE director accuses CBS of trying to 'stop Secretary Noem from telling the truth'","text":"Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Todd Lyons said Tuesday it was a \"shame\" that CBS News allegedly edited Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem’s comments on \"Face the Nation.\" Noem claimed on X that CBS cut half her answer about Kilmar Abrego Garcia and \"the threat he poses to American public safety\" to \"whitewash the truth\" about him.

I think it’s a shame they would go ahead and edit that because this person isn’t a ‘Maryland man.’ He is a criminal alien from El Salvador that’s living in Maryland that we need to take off the streets.\" In the clip that aired, Noem was asked why the Trump administration was working to deport Garcia instead of forcing him to face charges in the United States. \"Prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and Pam Bondi’s department, so we will let them do that, although this individual does have criminal charges pending. He has charges pending against him civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn’t walk free in the United States of America,\" Noem said.

There’s a not-insignificant likelihood Democrats could take the House in the 2026 midterms. It’s not out of the question that he could win the presidency in 2028, as well. It will only take one term to turn back most of President Donald Trump’s executive agenda. \n\nIN FOCUS: CALIFORNIA’S MARIJUANA MARKET: FROM HIGH HOPES TO ‘COMPLETE FAILURE’\n\nRepublicans scoff at the prospects of an oily politician like Gavin Newsom winning the presidency. But it’s not exactly far-fetched. The California governor is more shrewd and effective than Kamala Harris, who lost the race by a relatively narrow margin considering her situation and abilities. \n\nNewsom has already situated himself as the leader of the opposition. His appeal to Democrats is predicated on the notion that the national party isn’t fighting and is being emasculated by the opposition, which is pretty much the same grievance Trump ran on in 2015. Newsom “fights” by employing aggressive, often juvenile, Trumpian tactics. Sure, mimicking the president online is transparently cringy to many of us. But this brand also works with a lot of voters. Let’s not forget that a large chunk of the Republican Party also mimics Trump. Most of them, not very well. \n\nNewsom isn’t a good governor, you say. Does it matter? Was former President Joe Biden a good senator? He could barely cobble together coherent sentences when he ran in 2020. What were former President Barack Obama’s accomplishments? Trump had no record, either. So perhaps not doing anything but tweeting a lot is the best model for campaign success. We’re in age of the influencer. If the most vital aspect of a candidacy were accomplishments, few of these people would be in power. \n\nTrump first began “exploring” a 2016 presidential run in 2013, letting the press know he was dropping a million dollars to investigate his odds. I don’t for a second believe that Trump cared what some pinhead statistician told him about his presidential chances. Legend has it that Trump decided to run for the White House back in 2011, after Barack Obama mocked him for his reversal on “birtherism” at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. That was five years out. \n\nAt the time, the Republican Party’s favorability had fallen to historic lows in Gallup polling. Republicans agonized over “autopsies” while Democrats were concern-trolling over the prospects of a nation without two functioning major political parties. \n\nAt that time, Democrats believed Obama, with the help of demographic fate, had created a permanent political realignment in the country. And they comported themselves accordingly, with hubris and abuses of executive and bureaucratic power. A few years earlier, George W. Bush’s inner circle had convinced themselves of the same. Without fail, political parties see their election as special and enduring. It never works out that way. Voters aren’t automatons. Coalitions break up. History happens. \n\nAnd in many ways, the Trump coalition is even more rickety than most, as it relies on the will and personality of a single man. \n\nTrump is a generational political whirlwind, whose celebrity uniquely appeals to many non-traditional Republican voters. Latinos almost certainly are one group more comfortable supporting him than they would an average Republican. And the personal loyalty Trump engenders from around 30% of Republicans is also quite rare. To this group, anything the man says or does is championed as truth. “Let him cook” is the kind of inane ode we hear to this alleged genius, irrespective of the topic. \n\nVery few politicians can lean on such adulation, even if voters are predisposed to agreeing with them. This Trumpian contingent isn’t the majority, but it’s enough to sink any Republican who challenges Trump.\n\nCan this loyalty be transposed onto a successor? It’s unlikely. Will the mantle holder be Vice-President JD Vance, the favorite of anti-market ideologues on the “new right” who backfill Trump’s messy, instinctive politics with antiquated mercantilist and isolationist ideas? Most voters don’t really understand how antagonistic the “new right” is towards economic dynamism. What happens if Trump‘s watered-down protectionist policies catch up with the economy? Even if they don’t, would Vance generate a similar devotion from voters? Right now, even in good times, he is as unpopular as Kamala Harris. \n\nOr will the successor be Marco Rubio, who’s really found his calling as an effective Secretary of State? As a politician, “Little Marco” is one of the great trend chasers in recent American political history, from Tea Party libertarian to establishment dealmaker to economic statist. Or will it be Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was not only overwhelmingly rejected by Republican primary voters in 2024 but now tainted because he came at the king too early and missed? \n\nWhoever ends up the nominee will have to face the reality of the GOP losing ground among the fastest growing and most vital demographic, the suburban voter. A populist Republican candidate will have to recreate Trump’s success among the fastest shrinking demo in the country, the “working class” white voter, in places like Michigan and Pennsylvania. \n\nNone of this is to say that Trump-obsessed Democrats are in a great spot, either. Perhaps they’ll be able to detach a national campaign from the weird extremist planks of the activist class. Perhaps they will turn to someone like Josh Shapiro. The popular governor of Pennsylvania’s biggest problem, of course, is that he is both Jewish and relatively moderate in an era in which antisemitism and radicalism have been normalized among many progressives. It is almost surely Shapiro’s support of Israel — though the governor cowardly walked it back — that derailed his veep chances in 2024. Then again, perhaps the Gaza war wraps up by 2027, and progressives will have moved onto a new cause de jour. \n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about Trump’s success is that his appeal centers on “far-right” positions, when the president can barely even be considered a political conservative. Many voters believe the nation, and major parties, lost the plot. Trump’s positions would have been familiar to most liberals 20 years ago.\n\nThe question is whether or not Democrats come back to the middle, and whether the post-Trump Republican Party will be able to sell the president’s populist message. It would only take one downturn to turn American elections upside down again. Because nothing is a sure thing in politics. Which is always worth remembering.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

In his announcement video, he said it was time for a younger voice in Congress. \n\nOther strong potential candidates include Assembly Member Micah Lasher, Assembly Member Alex Bores, and New York City Council Member Erik Bottcher, according to City and State New York.\n\nJacob Rubashkin, deputy editor at Inside Elections, anticipated that more than 20 people could realistically run for Nadler’s vacant seat, which is expected to remain in Democratic hands. He also noted that a familiar face and fellow colleague of Nadler’s could shake things up.\n\n“This is going to battle royale — and don’t sleep on the possibility Dan Goldman switches districts since NY-12 fits him better, and lets more progressive candidates fight over NY-10,” Rubashkin said.\n\nLasher, 43, served as an aide to Nadler, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY), and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He defeated his more progressive challenger to win the seat representing the Upper West Side and West Harlem.\n\nBottcher, 46, represents much of Manhattan’s neighborhoods, including Greenwich Village, Chelsea, and Hell’s Kitchen. Prior to serving on the city council, he worked in former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration, handling marriage equality issues.\n\nHe celebrated Nadler’s years of service in a statement to X on Monday evening.\n\n“Let us honor Jerry’s extraordinary legacy not only with gratitude, but by carrying his fight forward with the urgency this moment demands,” Bottcher said. “From protecting democracy to advancing equality to defeating fascism, we must take his work further.”\n\nBores, who is around a decade younger than either Lasher or Bottcher, represents the east side of Manhattan and is in his second term in the state legislature. He gained a reputation for introducing numerous bills to regulate artificial intelligence technology.\n\nHe also praised Nadler’s years in politics in a statement.\n\n“From the NY Assembly to the US Congress, Congressman Nadler has always led with the conviction of his beliefs and a deep commitment to his constituents,” Bores said. “The people of the 12th Congressional District deserve that kind of [representation].\n\nCity and State New York reported that Lasher is likely to be the top target to beat for Democrats, given his young age and connection to Nadler. He gained credibility with the party’s grassroots base after endorsing New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, whom Nadler also endorsed. As a staunch supporter of Israel, Lasher has become a bridge for pro-Israel New Yorkers who are concerned about Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist and Muslim, winning the election this fall.\n\nNadler’s retirement is one of four from the House Democratic caucus this cycle, opting to vacate their seats instead of face progressive challengers and competitive primary races in 2026. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) announced her retirement in April after gaining a primary challenger in Kat Abughazaleh, 26.\n\nOther retirees include Reps. Dwight Evans (D-PA) and Danny Davis (D-IL). \n\nHowever, many older and establishment Democrats are facing primary challengers next year and, for now, are not retiring. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), a 15-term incumbent, is facing a challenge from a 37-year-old former staffer. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is facing a primary competitor who is a former aide to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-CA).\n\nYounger Democrats have been eager for generational change within the congressional delegations in the wake of the 2024 election. Former President Joe Biden was insistent on running for reelection, but eventually, due to mounting pressure from Democratic colleagues and polling, he stepped aside for former Vice President Kamala Harris to secure the nomination.\n\nNadler said the fervor surrounding Biden and the growing stubbornness of elderly members in politics clinging to power pushed him to the decision to retire.\n\nHOUSE RETURNS TO PACKED SCHEDULE, LONG TO-DO LIST, AND EPSTEIN DRAMA\n\n“Watching the Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I think I want to respect that,” the congressman told the New York Times, adding that a younger successor “can maybe do better, can maybe help us more.”\n\n“I’m not saying we should change over the entire party,” he continued. “But I think a certain amount of change is very helpful, especially when we face the challenge of Trump and his incipient fascism.”","summary":"Longtime Rep.

But how competitive the race becomes will ultimately depend on who secures the Democratic and Republican nominations, he added.Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kauffman wrote in a statement that the party is \"confident the next generation of Republican leaders will continue building on her incredible legacy.\"Newsweek reached out to the Iowa Democratic Party for comment via email.Why It MattersIowa has shifted rightward over the past decade and backed President Donald Trump by double digits in November, but Democrats are eyeing it as a potential opportunity in the 2026 midterms. Historically, the party of the president performs poorly in the midterms, fueling Democratic optimism about competing in more conservative states.They'll need to win in some double-digit Trump states to win a Senate majority, currently held by Republicans, 53-47. Maine, which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 points, and North Carolina, which supported Trump by about 3 points, are Democrats' top targets. But no other GOP-held seat in a single-digit Trump or Harris-won state is up for grabs—meaning they have to turn to states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio or Texas to compete for control of the upper chamber.What To KnowErnst confirmed she will not seek reelection in a video posted to X, saying, \"After a tremendous amount of prayer and reflection, I will not be seeking reelection in 2026. This was no easy decision.\"Her announcement leaves the race with a sense of uncertainty, as it's unclear who will run to replace her on the Republican side. Before her decision to exit the race, she was viewed as the favorite, though forecasters did view the contest as potentially competitive. The Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball classify the race as \"Likely Republican,\" and it's unclear whether that would change by Ernst no longer being the candidate.There has been no polling on how other Republicans would fare against Democratic candidates. Betting odds, however, still gave Republicans an advantage. The GOP held a 68 percent chance of victory in Kalshi's betting market, down from a 75 percent chance August 26.Hagle said the party that is not in the White House typically performs better in the midterms but noted that Democrats have also been seeing lackluster polling numbers.\"It's kind of a headwind that they're running into,\" he said. \"So it's hard to say whether Ernst not being in the race is going to give Democrats much more of a chance. We'll have to see, of course, it also depends on who the Republicans end up picking as their nominee, as well as who the Democrats pick as theirs in terms of the quality of the candidates and so forth.\"David Peterson, professor of political science at Iowa State University, told Newsweek that Ernst's decision \"is likely to shake this race up a fair amount.\"\"First, this is likely to be a competitive Republican primary. I know that people often work behind the scenes to clear the field, but there are a few high profile Republicans who avoid the gubernatorial race who would be well positioned to challenge for this race. A tough primary fight could weaken the nominee more than the clear field that Ernst would have,\" he said.Whoever emerges from that primary will also lack the same incumbency advantage Ernst would have had, Peterson added.He said he believes the election will likely be \"a more competitive race than people might think.\"\"Iowa has trended to the right since 2016, but the Democrats are better positioned than they have been in the last several cycles. They will have a top tier candidate for the open Governor's race in likely nominee Rob Sand. He has already raised a lot of money and is well respected. Two of the four House seats will likely be close again with the Democrats also having strong candidates in those races. If [Ashley] Hinson runs for Senate, her seat will also be close. This is also just likely to be a very good year for Democrats,\" he said.Republican Candidates in Iowa US Senate RaceAt the moment, former state Senator Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, former vice chair of the Libertarian National Committee, are running on the Republican side. But others are likely to jump into the race now that Ernst has made official her plans to retire.Representative Ashley Hinson, who represents the northeastern region of the state, wrote on X she will \"have an announcement soon about how we believe we can best serve Iowa, and how we can help President Trump make America great again.\"NATO Ambassador Matt Whitaker or Attorney General Brenna Bird have also been floated as potential candidates.A hopeful like Hinson or Bird, who are well known among Iowa voters, may be stronger candidates in terms of name recognition and experience, Hagle said.\"But of course. It's dependent on the personality and how well those candidates are able to articulate their message and whether they're talking about the right things for the race as it develops over the next 14 months,\" he added.Democratic Candidates in Iowa US Senate RaceSeveral Democrats are already in the race, including Des Moines school board member Jackie Norris, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage, state Representative Josh Turek and state Senator Zach Wahls. Former state Representative Bob Krause, who was running for Iowa's 1st Congressional District, also announced he will instead run for Senate after Ernst's call to exit.Iowa Democrats are running stronger candidates across the board than in recent elections, likely because they see 2026 as a stronger opportunity for victory than 2022, viewed as a less Democratic year. But Senate candidates are not necessarily as prolific at this point, Hagle said.\"It's going to be tougher for somebody who had only been a state legislator to then make that jump up to the U.S. Senate as opposed to maybe taking as a first step U.S. Congress,\" he added.What People Are SayingKauffman wrote in a statement: \"Senator Joni Ernst is a dedicated public servant, and Iowans have been proud to have her representing our state in the U.S. Senate for the past decade. From the start, Joni set out to make Washington squeal, and she delivered. Her work to cut government waste, stop the abuse of taxpayer dollars, protect Iowa's farms and small businesses, and pass Sarah's Law has left a lasting impact. Iowa is better off because of Senator Ernst's leadership, and we are confident the next generation of Republican leaders will continue building on her incredible legacy.\"Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote in a statement: \"A few months ago, Joni Ernst said the quiet part out loud: Republicans don't give a s*** about whether their own constituents live or die, as long as the richest few get richer.

J.B. Pritzker’s resistance to the National Guard deploying in Chicago.\n\nChicago, a city that has a third of the population New York City does, had 54 shootings over Labor Day weekend (“Chi-town hell,” Sept. 2).\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have both made clear their intent to sue the Trump administration if the National Guard is deployed to their city to restore order.\n\nTheir intentions are solely to protect the illegal occupation of Chicago. They fear that the presence of the National Guard would somehow be an ICE operation.\n\nJupiter, Fla.\n\nGov. Pritzker stated he “will not stand idly by” if the National Guard is sent to Chicago.\n\nIn other words, the governor would rather have criminals harming Chicagoans than admit help is needed.\n\nEileen Corr\n\nBrewster, Mass.\n\nI just don’t get why these Democrats are fighting President Trump on crime issues. Are they in favor of more crime?\n\nIf Democrats were smart — which I know is asking a lot — they would let Trump try to fix the issues. If he fails, then they have ammunition, and if he succeeds, even better.\n\nDems have fought Trump on everything, and have nothing to show for it. It’s time they got back to protecting their citizens, and got off Trump’s back.\n\nCharlie Honadel\n\nVenice, Fla.\n\nThe only people who would be intimidated by ICE and the National Guard are illegal aliens and other criminals.\n\nWhen Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom — two presumptive 2028 Democratic presidential candidates — are all but admitting their electoral prospects are tied directly to immigrants and criminals voting in our elections, you know that sanity is completely lost.\n\nIt’s time for Democrats to find new leaders who American citizens will vote for, instead of trying to import the hordes of the Third World to become permanent Democrats and lifelong welfare recipients.\n\nNick McNulty\n\nWindham, NH\n\nPresident Trump has been making great strides to reduce violent crime in America. All politicians should give a thousand cheers to this — yet many don’t.\n\nWhy do we permit so much criminality, lawlessness and violence to be so commonplace in America?\n\nCome on, lawmakers; put your big pants on, then collaborate. No more pampering criminals.\n\nJack Ridolph\n\nThe Villages, Fla.\n\nThe Issue: President Trump revoking former Vice President Kamala Harris’ Secret Service detail.\n\nPresident Trump truly should not cancel Secret Service Protection for Kamala Harris or any other person who heretofore has warranted it (“Don cuts off Kam’s security detail,” Aug. 30).\n\nThere are people who have displeased the president, but are nevertheless vulnerable to harm —and should one of them become a victim, it would reflect badly on Trump.\n\nHe must remember that he is the “peace president” who wants to protect all Americans from crime.\n\nGracie Desiato\n\nOne wonders what goes on in the mind of a person like Trump when he withdraws former President Joe Biden’s extension of protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump must be fully aware of the danger he is inflicting upon Harris, granted our extraordinary and dismal record of gun violence and the enthusiastic loyalty of his MAGA followers, who don’t seem capable of any moral judgment.\n\nIn effect, Trump is throwing her to the wolves for disposal.\n\nNicholas Molinari\n\nWant to weigh in on today’s stories?

Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker blamed the delay partly on the “shitshow” merger between Skydane and Comedy Central’s parent company Paramount, which was finally approved last month.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nFirst Look at ‘28 Years Later: The Bone Temple’ Promises ‘Bonkers, Off-the-Wall Energy’\n\nFour Best Friends Made an Album as Kids. 25 Years Later, It's a Cult Classic\n\nSee Cyndi Lauper Bring Out Joni Mitchell, Cher, SZA at Final Show of Farewell Tour\n\nBurning Man Homicide: Police Seek Help Identifying Victim\n\nSince returning, South Park has relentlessly attacked Trump and his administration. In the first episode, for instance, they satirized part of Paramount’s pre-merger lawsuit settlement with Trump after the president accused CBS News’ 60 Minutes of election interference for how it edited an interview with Kamala Harris. Trump has said that the deal includes a $16 million settlement, plus $20 million “from the new Owners, in Advertising, PSAs, or similar Programming.” South Park skewered the PSA arrangement with a phony spot showing a fully nude Trump wandering the desert with a “teeny tiny” penis.\n\nSubsequent episodes, meanwhile, have focused on ICE raids and conservative “debate” culture, as well as Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Washington D.C.\n\nSamuel L.

He says I’m a pessimist. Whatever, I’m too anti-Trump,” he said.\n\nHe added that, when he broadcast his “War Room” program last Thursday, he felt like he had a “babysitter” that was “looking over my shoulder,” which prompted his exit. \n\nJones initially described Shroyer’s exit from Infowars as a family emergency, but Shroyer clarified that “there was no family emergency. I walked off the show.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Jones lashed out at his former employee, directly addressing the content of Shroyer’s stream.\n\n“You couched each statement—perfectly thought out and looking down at your notes—to be able to lie about us and try to hurt this organization for your benefit so you can be a hero,” Jones said. “You are a snake. You are a rat. You are a fraud. You are a backstabber. You are a hand biter. You are a disgrace.”\n\nShroyer has been a long-time presence on Infowars and an apparent true believer in the outlet’s extreme right-wing politics. In fact, Shroyer served time in prison after he was convicted for helping to lead the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Though he didn’t enter the Capitol, he pleaded guilty to entering a restricted area.\n\n“Shroyer helped create January 6,” federal prosecutors said in their filing at the time. \n\nAlong with pushing conspiracies and election violence on Infowars, Shroyer also used racial epithets about Vice President Kamala Harris, who is Black.\n\nJones has been backing Trump since he first ran for president in 2016. But in covering up the Epstein scandal instead of offering the full transparency he once championed, Trump has been making a departure from the beliefs Jones touts on Infowars.\n\nSimilarly, after years of Jones falsely accusing Democratic presidents like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden of hoping to deploy military assets against Americans, it is Trump who has done so.\n\nJones faces more pressure from a mess of his own making. He is on the hook for millions owed to the families of Sandy Hook survivors that he smeared, and the assets of Infowars are still set to be auctioned off as payment.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Jones hasn’t been having a great year, even as he watches his favorite politician retake the presidency.","summary":"Pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Alex Jones lashed out against former Infowars host Owen Shroyer Monday, describing him as a “backstabber” and “snake.” Shroyer recently left Jones’ Infowars network, alleging that he felt pressure to soft-pedal criticism of President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nJones, Shroyer, and other Infowars contributors specialize in promoting baseless, debunked conspiracy theories.

Another image shows him on one knee presenting Lewis with the studded band engagement ring, a surprised but gleeful look plastered on her face. \n\nBooker, 56, and Lewis’ relationship was confirmed by the senator just last month. The senator was explaining to the Washington Examiner that on one of their first dates, Lewis asked him to open his TikTok app to the “For You” page.\n\n“I sort of held my breath as I opened it up, and she could see that I’m a nerd who loves food videos, animal videos,” Booker said. \n\n“It was just a funny moment, because I never thought of it through the dating lens, but here it is, you know, a year and a half later, and we’re still together.\"\n\nThe two are believed to have been dating for about a year and a half and reside together in Washington, D.C.\n\nBooker’s previous relationship with Dawson ended in February 2022.

His performance was later clipped up and turned into a pop remix.\n\nDuring the speech, Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor, sparking even more reaction online.\n\nMany also posted congratulations online following the conclusion of his remarks, including former Vice President Kamala Harris. “The true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down but on who you lift up,” she wrote on X.","summary":"Booker was previously in a relationship with actor Rosario Dawson","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/cory-booker-engaged-alexis-lewis-b2818847.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/02/21/08/GettyImages-2207539404.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UDeJc4Vm-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-02 21:16:15","author":"Caitlin Hornik","authors":["Caitlin Hornik"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.069},{"id":356862390,"title":"NewsBusters Podcast: Did CBS News Think We Wouldn’t Notice Their New Hatchet Job?","text":"NewsBusters Associate Editor Nick Fondacaro and I were stunned by Sunday’s Face the Nation in which the show made a baffling decision to deceptively remove a key portion of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s answer about the alleged criminal record of illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nAs our Bill D’Agostino wrote, this was part of a pattern of behavior from CBS News, stretching far beyond last year’s 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that led to a lawsuit from now-President Trump and a settlement of at least $16 million.\n\nWe also dove into CBS’s attempt to save face before diving into some delicious hypocrisy from The Atlantic’s Ashley Parker, who wrote a story over the Labor Day weekend mocking the increased law enforcement presence and National Guardsmen in Washington D.C. to combat crime.

He was very polite and hit his mark and did everything correctly and had a real flair for show business.\"\n\n To that, Maher referenced Allen's controversial reputation, quipping, \"If you think you were cancelled before…\"\n\n But Allen didn't back down. \"I only wish I could direct him now,\" he continued, prompting Maher to burst out laughing. \"If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders. He was very easy to work with.\"\n\n Trump cameoed briefly as himself in Allen's 1998 dramedy Celebrity, an ensemble film revolving around a divorcing couple played by Kenneth Branagh and Judy Davis. Trump's singular scene sees Davis' Robin Simon hosting an interview show at a New York City restaurant where she spots the then-real estate mogul in the crowd and asks what he's working on. Trump then describes his plans to tear down Manhattan’s iconic St. Patrick's Cathedral to build a \"a very tall and beautiful\" office block in its place.\n\n Allen clarified that despite his interest in working with Trump again, he is registered as a democrat and voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n \"I take issue with him on 95 percent of the things, maybe 99 percent. But as an actor, he was very good,\" Allen said. \"He was very convincing. He had a charismatic quality.\"\n\n The director then expressed surprise over Trump's decision to go into politics, adding, \"Politics is nothing but headaches and critical decisions and agony. This was a guy I used to see at the Knicks games, and he liked to play golf, and he liked to judge beauty contests and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing. Why anyone would want to suddenly have to deal with the issues of politics is beyond me.\"\n\n When Maher argued that Trump's public persona as president is \"the ultimate acting job,\" Allen said he couldn't speak to that.\n\n \"I can only judge what I know from directing him in film and he was pleasant to work,\" he replied. \"Very professional, very polite to everyone. I would like to direct him now that he's president and have him let me make the decisions, but that's not gonna happen.\"\n\n Maher joked, \"I'll make a call.\"\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n Trump's second term as president, much like his first, has been fraught with controversy and scandal, regarding both his policies and public remarks. Allen himself earned a polarizing reputation after years as a venerated director: the 89-year-old filmmaker has long been accused of sexual abuse by his daughter, Dylan Farrow, when she was a child. Allen has consistently denied the allegations against him and has never been charged with a crime (though a Connecticut prosecutor said there was probable cause for a criminal case). The continuing controversy gained renewed attention in the wake of the Me Too movement.\n\n Watch Allen's full conversation with Maher above.","summary":"\"If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders.\"","url":"https://ew.com/woody-allen-praises-donald-trump-acting-skills-a-pleasure-to-work-with-11802074","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/oGxlgetooD6c2gqUbh9UyWkAXRo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/woody-allen-donald-trump-090225-f1de9ab47a5f44d49e2e724eed7b4438.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-02 20:38:30","author":"Shania Russell","authors":["Shania Russell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.248},{"id":356828148,"title":"Trump, Karoline Leavitt bash CBS News’ Margaret Brennan: ‘She’s stupid.

What do you think of her?” Trump asked the White House press secretary.\n\nLeavitt replied: “She’s stupid. You can put that on the record.”\n\nTrump jabbed: “She’s nasty.”\n\nThe president added that he’s surprised that Secretary of State Marco Rubio continues to appear on Brennan’s show as a guest.\n\n“The level of hatred, I’m surprised he goes on there, the level of hatred when they’re asking the question,” Trump said.\n\nEarlier in the interview, Trump blasted CBS News over its controversially-edited “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris – which ultimately won Trump a $20 billion settlement over claims of election interference. \n\nNora O’Donnell – who was recently ousted from “CBS Evening News” after five years in the anchor seat – also caught flak from the president.\n\n“It’s like if they had Nora O’Donnell, anybody could do this. You could take 50% of the women off the street, they’d do just as good,” Trump said.\n\n“Pay her 12 million a year, and she’s not going to be there very long. But if she’s not already out, I mean, she’s pretty close, I would say she’s pretty close.”\n\nAfter delivering her last evening news sign-off earlier this year, O’Donnell has stayed on at the network to deliver long-form reporting and interviews for CBS’ “Sunday Morning” and “60 Minutes” programs.\n\nThe news anchor’s $8 million salary was slashed by more than half to $3.8 million when she re-signed a deal with the network in 2022, The Post previously reported.\n\nTrump praised the audience at the Daily Caller – a right-wing news site founded in 2010 by Tucker Carlson and former Dick Cheney aide Neil Patel. Patel bought out Calson’s stake in 2020.\n\n“People don’t realize how big our market is,” Trump said, referencing people who voted for him.","summary":"During an interview in the Oval Office on Friday with another reporter, Trump took aim at the CBS News anchor.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/02/media/trump-karoline-leavitt-bash-cbs-news-margaret-brennan-shes-stupid/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/110560313.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jPwH0kz2-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-02 20:25:10","author":"Taylor Herzlich","authors":["Taylor Herzlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":356831200,"title":"Who’s Eligible For No Tax On Tips? Trump’s New Policy Set To Include Influencers, Uber Drivers And More","text":"Influencers, rideshare drivers, performers, baristas and more will be covered under the “No Tax on Tips” policy passed as part of President Donald Trump’s recent spending bill, multiple reports suggest, as the Trump administration is poised to roll out more details about one of the president’s signature economic policies, which could impact millions of taxpayers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to speak on his policy to end tax on tips in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 25.\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nThe “No Tax on Tips” provision passed as part of the megabill that Trump signed into law in July, allowing workers in service professions to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes, starting with their 2025 tax return and continuing through 2028.\n\nThe $25,000 can be taken on top of the standard deduction, which is $15,750 for single filers in 2025, meaning single filers taking the standard deduction and reporting the full $25,000 in tipped income can shave a little over $40,000 off their income for tax purposes.\n\nThat amount is lower for people who earn more than $150,000 annually: For each $1,000 that a worker makes over $150,000, the amount of their deduction is reduced by $100.\n\nThe legislation says only that the law applies to workers “in an occupation which customarily and regularly received tips on or before December 31, 2024,” but did not specify professions, and the Trump administration has been expected to issue further guidance on who will be eligible for the exemption.\n\nAccording to a draft occupation list that was first reported by Axios and confirmed by multiple other outlets, the list includes 68 jobs, ranging from typical tip-based service professions like wait staff to more novel professions, like influencers, online streamers and other digital content creators.\n\nThe Trump administration has still not confirmed the exact list, and the Treasury Department has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nWhich Occupations Are Eligible For ‘no Tax On Tips’?\n\nAccording to the draft list first published by Axios, the list of eligible professions includes the following jobs, which the Treasury Department has divided into eight categories:\n\nBeverage & Food Service: Bartenders, Wait Staff, Food Servers (non-restaurant), Dining Room Attendants, Cafeteria Attendants, Bartender Helpers, Chefs, Cooks, Food Preparation Workers, Fast Food and Counter Workers, Dishwashers, Host Staff (Restaurant, Lounge, and Coffee Shop), Bakers\n\nEntertainment & Events: Gambling Dealers, Gambling Change Persons, Booth Cashiers, Gambling Cage Workers, Gambling and Sports Book Writers and Runners, Dancers, Musicians, Singers, Disc Jockeys (except radio), Entertainers, Performers, Digital Content Creators, Ushers, Lobby Attendants, Ticket Takers, Locker Room, Coatroom and Dressing Room Attendants\n\nHospitality & Guest Services: Baggage Porters, Bellhops, Concierges, Desk Clerks (Hotel, Motel and Resort), Maids, Housekeeping Cleaners\n\nHome Services: Home Maintenance and Repair Workers, Home Landscaping and Groundskeeping Workers, Home Electricians, Home Plumbers, Home Heating/Air Conditioning Mechanics and Installers, Home Appliance Installers and Repairers, Home Cleaning Service Workers, Locksmiths, Roadside Assistance Workers\n\nPersonal Services: Personal Care and Service Workers, Private Event Planners, Private Event and Portrait Photographers, Private Event Videographers, Event Officiants, Pet Caretakers, Tutors, Nannies, Babysitters\n\nPersonal Appearance & Wellness: Skincare Specialists, Massage Therapists, Barbers, Hairdressers, Hairstylists, Cosmetologists, Shampooers, Manicurists/Pedicurists, Eyebrow Threading and Waxing Technicians, Makeup Artists, Exercise Trainers, Group Fitness Instructors, Tattoo Artists, Piercers, Tailors, Shoe and Leather Workers and Repairers\n\nRecreation & Instruction: Golf Caddies, Self-Enrichment Teachers, Recreational and Tour Pilots, Tour Guides and Escorts, Travel Guides, Sports and Recreation Instructors\n\nTransportation & Delivery: Parking and Valet Attendants, Taxi and Rideshare Drivers, Chauffeurs, Shuttle Drivers, Goods Delivery People, Personal Vehicle and Equipment Cleaners, Private and Charter Bus Drivers, Water Taxi Operators, Charter Boat Workers, Home Movers, Rickshaw, Pedicab, and Carriage Drivers\n\nApproximately 4 million. That’s the approximate number of Americans who worked in tipped occupations as of 2023, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University, making up approximately 2.5% of all U.S. employment. It’s unclear how that estimate may be affected by the specific occupations the policy is set to cover. Many of those workers would not benefit from the “No Tax on Tips” policy, however, as the Budget Lab notes approximately 37% of tipped workers in 2022 had incomes that were low enough that they didn’t owe any federal taxes.\n\nHow Much Will No Tax On Tips Cost The Government?\n\nApproximately $40 billion through 2028, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nWhat We Don’t Know\n\nThere are still some outstanding questions when it comes to how the policy will play out in practice. The law specifies that the tips eligible for deductions only include ones that are “paid voluntarily without any consequence in the event of nonpayment” and are “determined by the payor,” which means it’s unclear if tips like gratuities that are automatically added on for large restaurant parties could be deducted. It’s also still unclear how tipped income will be reported so it can be eligible for the deduction, CNBC notes. While the deduction will apply for workers’ federal returns, they will also still likely have to pay state taxes on their tips in states with income tax.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump first introduced his “No Tax on Tips” policy on the campaign trail ahead of his election, making the policy one of his key economic proposals along with other policies like sweeping tariffs and eliminating taxes on Social Security payments. The policy proved to be one of Trump’s less controversial proposals, with former Vice President Kamala Harris also endorsing the policy ahead of the election. The Senate then passed a “No Tax on Tips” measure in a unanimous vote in May, which was ultimately integrated into the larger spending bill.\n\nFurther Reading:\nForbesNo Taxes On Tips, Overtime, And Social Security?

Here’s a suggestion for the Trump administration. Try to legislate. And maybe we can find common ground in order to get something done on behalf of the American people. The notion that Donald Trump and the administration would use emergency powers to address a housing crisis that has existed in this country since day one of his administration, and he’s done nothing about is a joke.”\n\nREAD MORE: Judge Rules LA Troop Use Illegal as Trump Rants Chicago Is ‘Murder Capital of the World’\n\nLeader Jeffries went on to warn that, “like many of the other efforts at utilizing emergency power, including most recently, the effort to use a so called emergency to justify the Trump tariffs, which are hurting everyday Americans, it will ultimately be struck down in court.”\n\nWall Street investment banker Evaristus Odinikaeze responded, saying that “Trump’s ‘day one’ promise on housing turned into a day-one disaster. He hasn’t introduced a single serious housing bill. No rent relief. No expansion of affordable housing. No mortgage protection. Just empty tweets, tariff tantrums, and more crony giveaways. Leader Jeffries is right that he should try legislating instead of litigating, retaliating, and dominating. That’s how we fix housing, not by blaming cities while inflating real estate bubbles with failed policies.”\n\nIndeed, some say Trump has no power to unilaterally declare housing standards.\n\nGeorgetown University Professor of Law Victoria Nourse, one of the nation’s leading scholars of Congress, the separation of powers, and statutory interpretation, according to her bio, remarked: “POTUS has no constitutional authority to impose uniform building codes on the states.”\n\nSome critics say the current housing crisis is actually being made worse by Trump’s own actions.\n\nThe Atlantic’s James Surowiecki, author of “The Wisdom of Crowds,” remarked, “Trump jacked up tariffs on lumber and steel, raising the cost of home construction. Now he’s thinking about declaring a national emergency to remedy a problem he’s exacerbated.”\n\nMedia Matters’ Matthew Gertz framed it this way:\n\n“1. Increase cost of materials through tariffs on steel and lumber. 2. Increase cost of labor through immigration enforcement. 3. ‘Declare a national housing emergency.'”\n\nDean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, asked, “Is ‘national emergency’ some sort of magical incantation that negates all laws and the Constitution?”\n\nWatch the video below or at this link.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Crazy’: RFK Jr. Is a Top Global Public Health ‘Expert’ Claims Miller, Sparking Mockery","summary":"Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent says President Donald Trump may declare a National Housing Emergency this fall, amid a challenging environment for homebuyers.\n\n“Bessent said housing affordability would be a critical leg of Republicans’ 2026 midterm election platform,” Bloomberg News reports. “Bessent declined to list any specific actions the president may take, but he suggested that administration officials are directly studying ways to standardize local building and zoning codes and decrease closing costs.”\n\nBloomberg also notes, “Housing affordability was a top issue in former Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign against Trump in 2024.
