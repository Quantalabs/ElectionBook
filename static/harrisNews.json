Shapiro. But you have to ask. I mean, I was asked many questions by our security team before I got the security clearance as President Obama’s chief of staff.”\n\nShapiro revealed the questioning from Harris’s team in his forthcoming memoir, Where We Keep the Light. According to Shapiro, Dana Remus, a former White House counsel, asked him: “Have you ever communicated with an undercover agent of Israel?”\n\n“Was she kidding?” Shapiro wrote. “I told her how offensive the question was.”\n\nWalz was also reportedly questioned over the trips he took to China before he ran for office and whether he was an agent for the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nHarris ultimately chose Walz as her running mate over Shapiro, who is widely seen as a possible 2028 contender. But the anecdote brings to light the tensions the Democratic Party faces over support for Israel amid rising antisemitism.\n\n“I’m probably not right to answer this question, because I kind of understand ‘vetting’ and security background. If the question was, have you ever talked to a senior agent of [former Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad, in this case, how would you know?” Emanuel said. “But I understand the impetus of a vetting question to understand any political or otherwise liabilities.”\n\nEmanuel added that anti-semitism has long persisted irrespective of party affiliation. “It’s not like anti-semitism showed up two years ago. Anti-semitism has been around for a really long time,” he said.\n\nAlthough Emanuel insists he has not decided on whether he will run for president in 2028, he told reporters he will travel to Michigan, an important battleground state, in the upcoming weeks.\n\nHe claimed he was impressed by what Michigan has done on the vocational level because education is “the ticket to how we fix this country, piece by piece.” \n\nSeizing on the populist fervor that has swept both parties, Emanuel chastized the “elite” for not apologizing for being held accountable for several disastrous moments for the American people, a sign that he may be laying down the groundwork to run for the presidency in 2028.\n\n“The war in Iraq, the financial meltdown, China’s decision to change from competition to adversary, and COVID.

Operation Metro Surge, an immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, has been underway for weeks.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi praised the appeals court on X, saying the Justice Department “will protect federal law enforcement agents from criminals in the streets AND activist judges in the courtroom.”\n\nMinnesota is a major focus of immigration sweeps by agencies under the Department of Homeland Security. State and local officials who oppose the effort were served with federal grand jury subpoenas Tuesday for records that might suggest they were trying to stifle enforcement.\n\nA political action committee founded by former Vice President Kamala Harris is urging donors to contribute to a defense fund in aid of Gov. Tim Walz, her 2024 running mate.\n\n“The Justice Department is going after Trump’s enemies,” Harris’ email said, referring to President Donald Trump.\n\nFeds turn to Maine as next target\n\nIn Maine, the Department of Homeland Security named the enforcement operation Catch of the Day in an apparent play on the state’s seafood industry. Maine has relatively few residents who are in the United States illegally but has a notable presence of refugees in its largest cities, particularly from Africa.\n\nSecretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat, said she won’t grant a request for confidential license plates sought by Customs and Border Protection, a decision that reflects her disgust over “abuses of power” by immigration enforcers. Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.\n\n“We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” Bellows said.\n\nA message seeking comment from CBP was not immediately returned.\n\nPortland City Council member Pious Ali, a native of Ghana, said there’s much anxiety about ICE’s presence in Maine’s largest city.\n\n“There are immigrants who live here who work in our hospitals, they work in our schools, they work in our hotels, they are part of the economic engine of our community,” Ali said.\n\nConflicts emerge in shooting incident\n\nGreg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the Trump administration’s big-city immigration crackdown, said more than 10,000 people in the U.S. illegally have been arrested in Minnesota in the past year, including 3,000 “of some of the most dangerous offenders” in the last six weeks during Operation Metro Surge.\n\nBovino defended his “troops” and said their actions are “legal, ethical and moral.”\n\nJulia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.\n\nSeparately, a federal judge said he’s prepared to grant bond and release two men after hearing conflicting testimony about an alleged assault on an immigration officer. Prosecutors are appealing. One of the men was shot in the thigh by the officer during the encounter last week.\n\nThe officer said he was repeatedly struck with a broom and with snow shovels while trying to subdue and arrest Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna following a car crash and foot chase.\n\nAljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis denied assaulting the officer. Neither video evidence nor three eyewitnesses supported the officer’s account about the broom and shovels or that there had been a third person involved.\n\nAljorna and Sosa-Celis do not have violent criminal records, their attorneys said, and both had been working as DoorDash drivers at night to avoid encounters with federal agents.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko said they still could be detained by ICE even if released from custody in the assault case.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

Between the ability to shape public policy and the trappings that come with inhabiting high office, political power is almost always an addictive drug that’s hard to kick. That said, it’s also one of the hallmarks and great strengths of American democracy that, for most of the last 250 years, politicians of all parties have accepted — usually honorably — the will of voters.\n\nTragically, however, this great tradition of honor and discipline was egregiously abandoned by Donald Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election — an action that led directly to the infamous January 6, 2021, insurrection. And now, five years later, it’s clear that this new practice of, when necessary, taking every conceivable step to evade the will of the citizenry in order to cling to power, has become the new modus operandi of Trump’s party in North Carolina.\n\nWe, of course, should have seen this coming. That the fear of voter decisions and the willingness to subvert them had become a new Republican tactic of choice was first made blatantly obvious in 2013 when the GOP-dominated General Assembly began enacting election law changes (like the infamous Monster Voting Law) that went to extreme lengths to both suppress the vote of disfavored groups — most notably voters of color — and rig electoral outcomes through the use of extreme partisan gerrymandering.\n\nThe practice continued in the weeks immediately following the 2016 election. That was the period during which the lame duck GOP-dominated General Assembly hastily convened to enact laws stripping the newly elected Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, of an array of basic powers long and logically attached to the office.\n\nNever mind that voters chose Cooper with the eminently reasonable expectation that he would wield authority — like numerous important appointment powers — long and naturally associated with the role of a state’s chief executive. Ignoring the obvious will of voters, GOP legislators moved quickly to remove them, and in most instances, seize them for themselves.\n\nAnd in recent years, sadly, this trend has only continued to metastasize and become even more ingrained.\n\nSee, for example, the ongoing effort to take gerrymandering to ever greater depths by, quite literally, rendering the results of almost all legislative elections foreordained and rigged to elect large Republican majorities. Late last year, the GOP took this practice to a new and truly preposterous level when, heeding the dictates of Dear Leader Trump, it further rigged the state’s congressional elections so that our deeply purple state will almost assuredly be represented by a U.S. House delegation of 11 Republicans and three Democrats.\n\nAnd then of course, there was the almost laughably bizarre move to, in the aftermath of Democrat Josh Stein’s landslide victory in the 2024 election, seize even more gubernatorial power — like appointing the state Board of Elections — and hand it to, of all people, the state’s accountant (i.e. the auditor). It was a move so blatant and utterly contemptuous of the will of voters that it left many observers to conclude that Republicans would have gladly handed the seized power over to whatever GOP office holder happened to be handy — the Labor Commissioner? Agriculture Commissioner? — if the new GOP auditor, Dave Boliek, hadn’t been so cynically ready and willing to play along.\n\nBut wait, there’s more. As NC Newsline’s Brandon Kingdollar reported on Jan. 19, the governor’s office isn’t the only one from which Republicans have shown themselves more than willing to seize powers in contravention of the voters’ judgment. Newly elected Democratic Attorney General Jeff Jackson is also a target.\n\nDespite ample evidence that Jackson has worked hard to approach the task in a nonpartisan manner guided by the letter of the law and the likelihood of demonstrable harm to our state, Republican legislators advanced legislation last year that would strip the AG’s office of one of its central and most important constitutional duties — to challenge unlawful presidential executive orders that harm the state. \n\nOne GOP lawmaker even promised he and his colleagues would wreak vengeance and render Jackson’s office “a feckless, empty shell of a position that has no authority to do anything,” if he dared to contest their action. Try to imagine that such a move could have occurred if Dan Bishop were AG and Kamala Harris in the White House.\n\nAll these moves come on top of many years of repeated legislative micro-aggressions toward Democrats elected to Council of State offices like the Superintendent of Public Instruction and Secretary of State via budget cuts and other power grabs.\n\nWill this trend continue in the New Year? It’s hard to imagine that it won’t. While gerrymandering and political power jockeying has always been a feature of American politics, the modern, Trumpified Republican Party has taken both phenomena to new and extreme levels never seen before in American history. The only question that remains at this point is how much longer voters will stand for the fear and contempt directed their way by politicians supposedly sworn to serve them.\n\nSenior contributor and award-winning journalist Rob Schofield authors regular commentaries and hosts the 'News & Views' weekly radio show/podcast. A part of NC Newsline since 2006, he served as editor from 2017 to 2025 and, prior to that, worked for many years as an attorney championing the rights of low-income people and civil liberties.","summary":"One supposes that it’s not an especially unusual phenomenon for politicians who ascend to power to do everything they can to cling to it.

Because they think ‘Oh, they’re going to raise the [interest] rate. They’re going to kill it.’”\n\n“Which truly stops you from having any great runs, and we want to have a great run,” the president continued.\n\nTrump’s sustained criticism of Powell and threats to fire the chair of the Federal Reserve have caused fears on Wall Street and Capitol Hill both in the past. Most recently, senators including members of Trump’s own party expressed alarm after the Department of Justice, which is on a run of prosecutions targeting the president’s personal enemies, opened a criminal investigation into Powell.\n\nDuring his interview on Wednesday the president alluded to some of that criticism: Namely, his charge that Powell voted to cut interest rates during the 2024 election to benefit then-President Joe Biden and his running mate-turned-replacement, Kamala Harris.\n\nThe case even triggered a rare warning from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who advised the administration publicly: “I haven’t seen the case or whatever the allegations or charges are, but I’d say they better be real and they better be serious.”\n\nPowell’s investigation by the DOJ is likely to seriously complicate plans to replace him in May, when his term expires as chair. It could also encourage him to remain on as a governor, as which he is serving on a separate term thanks to the complicated leadership structure of the Fed. Typically, chairs of the Fed step down as governors when they retire from the top job, but it’s not unheard of for one to stay on.\n\nThe end of Powell’s term falls under the shadow of the greatest efforts by the White House to erode the Fed’s independence in recent history, and Trump’s own talent search to find a replacement.\n\nHis plans to do so could be further delayed by the Powell investigation launched by the DOJ, as two Republican senators (Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski) have resolved to place a hold on nominations for Powell’s replacement until the probe is concluded.\n\n“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” Tillis wrote on X.\n\nIn July of last year, Trump said it was “highly unlikely” that he would fire the Fed chair. But that only came after he reportedly polled Republican lawmakers on the question and even showed them a draft letter of a termination notice intended for Powell.\n\n“No, we're not planning on doing anything,” Trump said at the time. “So he's doing a lousy job. But no, I'm not talking about that. We get, fortunately, we get to make a change in the next, what, eight months or so, and we'll pick somebody that's good.”","summary":"Trump has flirted with firing Jerome Powell for months and recently his DOJ opened a criminal investigation into the Fed chair","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fed-chair-davos-replacement-b2905150.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/21/21/32/cnbc_youtube_126.jpg?crop=1162.5,775,x0,y0&trim=0,227,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zi86LATM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-21 21:31:36","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":395035350,"title":"Michelle Obama Still Believes America Isn't Ready for a Female President — And Claims There Are Men Out There Who 'Won't Vote for a Woman'","text":"Michelle Obama has addressed her controversial comment in which she said the U.S. was not ready for a female president, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe former first lady clarified in an interview on Wednesday, January 21, that she believed the country was progressing and moving toward the direction where one day a female could be voted into the White House.Michelle Clarifies Her Remarks About a Female PresidentMichelle, 62, broke down her past comment while chatting with Alex Cooper on the Call Her Daddy podcast. \n\nWhile promoting her 2025 book, The Look, Michelle quipped: \"That's why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running 'cause you all are lying.

Thank goodness they have healthcare subsidized by the US to fix something if it cracks.\n\n...Still, Trump did not detail the parameters of the so-called “framework” and it was unclear what the agreement entails, especially since Denmark earlier Wednesday ruled out negotiations over ceding the semi-autonomous island to the US.“We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” Trump posted. “This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st.”...Trump told reporters after his post that he would release the specifics of the agreement shortly. He declined to answer when asked if it grants US ownership of Greenland, saying “it’s a long-term deal. It’s the ultimate long-term deal, and I think it puts everybody in a real good position.” He said it would last for an “infinite” period of time.In an interview with CNBC, Trump said he had not spoken directly with officials in Denmark about his “concepts of a plan” for Greenland, but added that he assumed Rutte had briefed leaders there.

The session, originally set for Wednesday (January 21), was organized by Fortune and was reportedly aimed at CEOs and other global business leaders.USA House, attending Davos for the first time as the US government’s officially recognized headquarters, reportedly opted not to include any US officials in the discussion, Politico reported.In a private exchange obtained by Politico, a Newsom administration official accused the organizers of bowing to political pressure from the State Department.

It was during these private briefings – conducted on background with the condition that reporters wouldn’t directly attribute the information to Weiss – that she took the opportunity to criticize Sharyn Alfonsi, the 60 Minutes correspondent behind the piece.\n\n“Status has learned that during these conversations with reporters, Weiss expressed significant frustration with Alfonsi, who had declined to make changes to her piece at Weiss’ behest,” Status News’ Oliver Darcy reported.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to representatives for CBS News and Weiss for comment.\n\nThe broadside against Alfonsi in the background calls – like Darcy, this reporter did not take part in these discussions and learned about them independently – comes after Weiss has been on the receiving end of withering press coverage and internal criticism over her leadership of the Tiffany Network’s newsroom. \n\nThe relentless scrutiny of her approach as editor-in-chief – a position the anti-woke columnist was granted by Paramount chief David Ellison in October despite her dearth of experience in broadcast news – reached a fever pitch last month when she dramatically pulled the “Inside CECOT” segment at the last minute, even though it had been cleared by the network’s legal team and promoted on CBS airwaves.\n\nAmid widespread blowback both internally and externally, Weiss repeatedly defended her decision that the segment was “not ready” to air, citing the lack of on-the-record comments from the Trump administration defending their actions and legal justifications. Meanwhile, Alfonsi fumed in a memo to her 60 Minutes colleagues that Weiss's decision to spike the segment appeared to be politically motivated.\n\n“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” she wrote. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now – after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\nAlfonsi also noted that if the White House’s “refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” adding that the network goes “from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.”\n\nThe fiasco around the segment prompted network employees and insiders to suggest that Weiss could face a “revolt” from 60 Minutes staff, which was already suffering from plummeting morale following a year’s worth of controversies, such as Paramount paying Donald Trump $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over the program’s interview with rival Kamala Harris.\n\nMeanwhile, with Weiss coming under additional fire over the “MAGA-coded” reboot of CBS Evening News – which has suffered a rocky rollout replete with internal discord, technical mishaps, cringey pro-Trump segments and soft ratings – The Free Press founder has grown increasingly frustrated with the overwhelmingly negative media coverage she’s received.\n\nTherefore, after finally giving the “Inside CECOT” story the green light to run this past Sunday – with little promotion and up against the NFL playoffs – Weiss rang up several journalists to offer her own perspective on the controversy and “do her own PR,” as one Weiss associate explained to Status.\n\nIn general, this type of behind-the-scenes outreach by a network chief amid a media firestorm in which they are embroiled is unusual, as attempts at public relations spin are typically left to spokespeople and communications staff. Making it even more eyebrow-raising from Weiss, however, was what was said during those calls – namely, the criticism of Alfonsi.\n\n“While it is no secret that Weiss and Alfonsi are at odds, the fact that the network’s top editorial executive would voice irritation with one of her marquee correspondents to outside journalists is, to put it mildly, extraordinary. Sure, disputes with subordinates happen at virtually every organization,” Darcy pointed out. “But strong leaders keep disagreements within the house. They don’t complain to the press about them—especially when the subordinate is barred from advocating in the press on her own behalf.”\n\nIndeed, with morale sinking at CBS News as a whole amid the network’s conservative shift under Ellison, who has been accused of trying to curry favor with Trump as he seeks regulatory approval in his hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, Weiss’ criticism of Alfonsi in her reporter briefings isn’t going over well with staff.\n\n“She is so out of her depth it’s astounding. Her inexperience is on full display,” one network reporter told The Independent. “How long must we endure this fiasco?”\n\nAnother 60 Minutes staffer told Status that Weiss was “deflecting” the widespread backlash she has faced since joining CBS by “blaming us,” adding that she should have expected some pushback from the show’s staff due to their experience and accolades. \n\n“They know exactly what they’re doing, and they do it exceptionally well. That’s why the show has been No. 1 for as long as it has,” that staffer said.\n\n“Of course, there’s going to be friction when Bari walks in acting like she owns the place. These are the people who built it,” the staffer continued. “You don’t gain and build trust when you insult us, come in and say we’re biased, don’t learn the place [and] how we work, the fact-checking and research involved.”\n\nAnother network staffer, who spoke to The Independent on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, stated that it seemed pretty apparent who Weiss had spoken to over the weekend based on the stories that were published about the situation.\n\n“Clearly those lines in news reports about 'people who work with Bari say she admits she got involved too late in the 60 process and wasn’t aware of the effect a late decision would have on the 60 process' is from her private briefings with reporters that Status refers to,” the staffer stated.\n\n“Trying to show it’s an honest mistake and I’m learning - f*** that - it’s not a difficult thing to understand how your involvement can f*** things up,” they added. “Firstly, you don’t need to have worked in TV to get that and secondly, it reveals her arrogance because she could have asked what the ramifications were or listened when people protested.”\n\nIn the end, while she held the story for four weeks, Weiss ultimately allowed it to air largely intact. While the report itself remained unchanged from the previously submitted version, which briefly ran on a Canadian network before CBS News pulled it back, 60 Minutes added portions to the front and back of the segment. The bookended sections included additional comments from the Trump administration and details about an “offensive tattoo” that one of the Venezuelan migrants interviewed by Alfonsi had removed.\n\nAt the same time, though, Weiss’ push to have a Trump official sit down for the story proved unsuccessful in the end. Despite her making it a top priority for the report to air, and the biggest reason she claimed it needed additional work to be ready to run, the Trump administration rebuffed 60 Minutes’ efforts to score an interview.\n\nIn fact, as several outlets recently reported, Weiss reached out to the administration to get DHS chief Kristi Noem or border czar Tom Homan to speak with the program – with Alfonsi making her way to Washington to conduct the interviews. \n\n“Since November, ‘60 Minutes’ has made several attempts to interview key Trump administration officials on camera about our story,” Alfonsi said during the aired segment on Sunday. “They declined our requests.”","summary":"‘She is so out of her depth it’s astounding.

That is, until Team Trump came to town. The fun, indeed, seemed to come to a screeching halt for Newsom once President Trump and members of his Cabinet descended upon the snowy ski town in Switzerland. \n\nIt all started when Newsom was asked if he had any advice for those in the international community who had concerns over Trump's plans for Greenland. This led to a non-response from Newsom, who, while channeling his inner Kamala Harris, went on an extended ramble about backbones, Nobel prizes, and T-Rexes. Oh, and he also called U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent \"smug.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Watch: Bessent Eviscerates Newsom in Savage Davos Take-Down – 'Patrick Bateman Meets Sparkle Beach Ken'\n\nBessent, when taking to the stage at Davos on Wednesday, quickly reduced Newsom to a quivering mass of jello with an absolutely withering line of fire. Here's bit of what Bessent said, from our earlier reporting:\n\nI think it's very, very ironic that Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken, may be the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris. He's here this week with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros, and Davos is a perfect place for a man who – when everyone else is on lockdown, when he was having people arrested for going to church, he was having thousand-dollar-a-night meals at the French Laundry – and I'm sure the California people won't forget that.And, my message to Governor Newsom is the Trump administration is coming to California. We are going to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. \n\nYowza, that definitely left a mark.\n\nDuring his remarks, Bessent noted that Newsom was supposed to give a speech at Davos, but wasn't going forward with that plan because Newsom is \"too economically illiterate to know anything.\" More Bessent:\n\nAnd I was told he was asked to give a speech on his signature policies, but he's not speaking because what have his economic policies brought? Outward migration from California. A gigantic budget deficit. The largest homeless population in America. And the poor folks in the Palisades who had their homes burned down. He is here hobnobbing with the global elite while his California citizens are still homeless.Shame on him. He is too smug, too self absorbed, and too economically illiterate to know anything.\n\nFresh from that humiliation, Newsom found out that not only wasn't he speaking at Davos, he was barred from entering the USA House pavilion. The pavilion was set up to \"celebrate the 250th anniversary of America in Davos in 2026, building on more than a decade of experience that Stromback Global brings to hosting independent gatherings in Davos and other global convenings.\"\n\nNewsom wasn't best pleased at the freeze out, claiming USA House sponsor Fortune had bowed to pressure from the Trump administration.\n\nAs of this writing, the Trump White House had not commented on the USA House development. We're left to wonder what other humiliations await Gavin Newsom in Davos has he avoids his duties in California. \n\nEditor’s Note: Help us continue to report the truth about corrupt politicians like Gavin Newsom.\n\nJoin RedState VIP and use promo code FIGHT to get 60% off your membership.","url":"https://redstate.com/terichristoph/2026/01/21/gavin-newsoms-davos-humiliation-tour-continues-as-hes-denied-entry-to-us-exhibit-n2198374","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2026/21/5c9c36e2-7764-4457-b22d-c66a09e9d6a8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 20:43:31","author":"Teri Christoph","authors":["Teri Christoph"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":394988000,"title":"Court lifts restrictions on immigration officers’ tactics in Minnesota","text":"An appeals court on Wednesday suspended a decision that restricts immigration officers’ aggressive tactics in Minnesota, while Maine declined a request for more undercover license plates for U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicles, citing “abuses of power” during the Trump administration’s crackdown.\n\nThe 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was persuaded to freeze a judge’s ruling that bars officers from using tear gas and other steps against peaceful protesters while the administration pursues an appeal.

The rule covers individuals who have publicly announced their intention to run for office and qualify under applicable state or federal law to hold the office being sought.\n\nIn 2006, the FCC determined that “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” qualified for an exemption from the rule as a “bona fide news interview” — the first time that such an exemption had been applied to a late night talk show. \n\n“Concerns have been raised that the industry has taken the Media Bureau’s 2006 staff-level decision to mean that the interview portion of all arguably similar entertainment programs— whether late night or daytime—are exempted from the section 315 equal opportunities requirement under a bona fide news exemption,” the FCC’s new guidance states. “This is not the case. These decisions are fact specific and the exemptions are limited to the program that was the subject ofthe request.”\n\nThe agency said it has “not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption.” It added that any program that is “motivated by partisan purposes” would not be entitled to an exemption under longstanding FCC precedent. \n\nThe new guidance comes after ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was temporarily pulled from the airwaves back in September for remarks the late night host made following Charlie Kirk’s death. \n\nAt the time, FCC chairman Brendan Carr condemned Kimmel’s remarks and urged local broadcasters to take action. \n\n“When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said in a YouTube interview at the time. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\n\nFollowing Carr’s remarks, Kimmel would get pulled from ABC affiliate stations owned by Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting and the network would follow suit soon after. Kimmel was suspended for around a week before his show was ultimately restored. \n\nCarr’s remarks would lead to criticism from both sides of the political aisle and he was ultimately pressed further about the Kimmel situation and pressures the Trump administration may be placing on the regulator during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last month.\n\nIn addition to Kimmel, Carr has also previously threatened ABC’s “The View” about pulling the show’s bona fide news interview exemption. \n\nHe also previously reiinstated a dismissed complaint against New York’s WNBC-TV, which accused the network of violating the FCC’s equal time rule when former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on “Saturday Night Live” during the weekend leading up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“Any program or station that wishes to obtain formal assurance that the equal opportunities requirement does not apply (in whole or in part) is encouraged to promptly file a petition for declaratory ruling that satisfies the statutory requirements for a bona fide news exemption,” the FCC’s guidance concludes. “It is important that both broadcasters and legally qualified candidates understand the FCC’s equal opportunities regulations and how they can result in broadcasters offering opposing legal qualified candidates comparable time and placement.”\n\nIn a statement, the FCC’s sole Democrat commissioner Anna Gomez said that “nothing has fundamentally changed” with respect to the agency’s political broadcasting rules.\n\n“The FCC has not adopted any new regulation, interpretation, or Commission-level policy altering the long-standing news exemption or equal time framework,” Gomez said in a statement. “For decades, the Commission has recognized that bona fide news interviews, late-night programs, and daytime news shows are entitled to editorial discretion based on newsworthiness, not political favoritism. That principle has not been repealed, revised, or voted on by the Commission. This announcement therefore does not change the law, but it does represent an escalation in this FCC’s ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.”\n\nGomez added that the First Amendment “does not yield to government intimidation.” \n\n“Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation. Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power,” she continued. “That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration’s desire to silence its critics.”","summary":"The agency added that any program \"motivated by partisan purposes\" would not qualify for a bona fide news interview exemption\n\n\nThe post FCC Says Talk Shows Must Adhere to Equal Opportunities Rule in Aftermath of Kimmel Scandal appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/industry-news/business/fcc-talk-shows-equal-opportunities-rule-kimmel/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/carr.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 20:26:00","author":"Lucas Manfredi,Nexstar Media Group","authors":["Lucas Manfredi","Nexstar Media Group"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":394996998,"title":"US appeals court blocks lower court order limiting immigration agents’ use of force in Minnesota","text":"A federal appeals court on Wednesday paused a lower court order that had restricted US immigration agents from using force against peaceful protesters in Minnesota, giving a temporary victory to the Trump administration as it escalates immigration enforcement in the state.The 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals froze an injunction issued last week by US District Judge Kate Menendez, who had barred federal agents from using tear gas and other crowd-control tactics against nonviolent demonstrators and legal observers while a lawsuit moves forward.

Gavin Newsom (D).\n\nIn an upcoming memoir, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — a Democrat who was passed over as a running mate to former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 — revealed a conversation he had with Trump following an arson attack on his home last year.\n\nShapiro opens the book, titled “Where We Keep the Light: Stories From a Life of Service,” by recounting an incident in April when an arsonist broke into the governor’s residence while he and his extended family slept upstairs on the first night of Passover, according to The Washington Post.\n\nIn October, 38-year-old Cody Balmer of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of Shapiro. Balmer also entered pleas to terrorism, 22 counts of arson, aggravated arson, burglary, aggravated assault, 21 counts of reckless endangerment and loitering.\n\nWhen learning that the attack was intentional, Shapiro questioned in the memoir whether they were targeted because they were Jewish. He writes about coming to the realization that someone wanted to kill him — and they were willing to kill his family, too, in the process.\n\n“This destruction and fear was overshadowed by the light from the love, support and rallying that came in the wake of it,” Shapiro wrote in the book.\n\nShapiro, who recently announced he is running for reelection to lead Pennsylvania, also explains that Trump called about a week following the attack, while noting that former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton reached out immediately, The Washington Post reported. \n\nTrump ended up leaving a voicemail, in which he checked in to make sure the family was “being treated perfectly” and the investigation was “perfect.” The president also gave Shapiro his personal cell phone number, telling the governor that he can call at any point.\n\nTrump answered when Shapiro later called back. When asked how he was doing, Trump began a “monologue” about the U.S. economy and how he was “doing so well,” according to Shapiro.\n\nBut then, the president went through a list of potential Democratic hopefuls for the 2028 election, Shapiro writes. He praised Shapiro for how he “talked to people and approached problems,” but went on to give him piece of advice: he “shouldn’t want to be president given how dangerous it had become to hold the office now.”\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson told The Washington Post that “no one understands the dangers of political violence” like Trump. She pointed to the two assassination attempts against him as he campaigned to return to the White House, as well as the fatal shooting of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n“He has encouraged national Democrats to turn down the temperature — amidst their continued smears of their political opponents as Nazis and fascists — while not hesitating to speak the truth about the challenges our country faces,” Jackson said in a statement.\n\nIn the book, Shapiro also reveals that he and Harris did not see eye to eye on the role of a vice president, writing that he was shocked by how she appeared to dislike the job. At one point, the governor said he found a question asked by her team to be offensive, which was whether he has been an agent of the Israeli government.\n\nShapiro’s memoir is set to be released on Jan. 27.","summary":"The governor revealed details of the conversation in an upcoming memoir following an arson attack on his residence.","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/01/trump-tells-top-2028-hopeful-he-shouldnt-want-to-be-president.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/52XYQDBBPRHIJA5SCWOOWL3N4U.jpg?auth=243eed55474b47ddba275ddc0cc3bf990de0e7372b8a562c3b6f2e9b111c30a1&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 19:05:00","author":"Rachel Cohen","authors":["Rachel Cohen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":395004570,"title":"CNN's New Kid 'Apologizes' for Telling a Complete Whopper About Trump and Then Makes It Even Worse","text":"As lawyered-up apologies go, this one's a real stinker. \n\nWhen I got a look at what the new CNN talking head, 25-year-old Cameron Kasky, said out loud in front of God, Scott Jennings, the CNN audience, and President Donald Trump's lawyers, I said on my Adult in the Room Podcast livestream these words, \"He's gonna get sued.\" But his \"apology\" is arguably worse.\n\nOn CNN, Kasky claimed twice that Donald Trump was part of a \"sex trafficking network,\" alluding to the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\nWhen asked to clarify, Kasky claimed that it was a \"provable\" fact that Donald Trump was part of what he called \"the human sex-trafficking network that he was a part of,\" alluding to his friendship in the 1990s with Jeffrey Epstein. Even the host and Trump hater, John Berman, had to admit that the president has never been charged with anything having to do with Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nOh my, oh my.\n\nA smug 25-year-old leftist activist just got HUMBLED live on CNN by Scott Jennings.Cameron Kasky claimed President Trump was part of a “human sex-trafficking network” — and for a moment, the panel let it slide.Until @ScottJenningsKY stepped in and FORCED the host John Berman… pic.twitter.com/wRxV2sQ3B5— Overton (@overton_news) January 20, 2026\n\nAnd things got even worse after that when the lone CNN right-of-center commentator, Scott Jennings, asked about the claim, and the kid doubled down. I hope he has a First Amendment lawyer on speed dial. \n\nMatt wrote about the incredible exchange that occurred Tuesday evening. \n\n[Scott] Jennings immediately objected. “Are you going to let that sit?” he asked. “Are we going to claim here on CNN that the president is part of a global sex trafficking ring, or —”Berman cut in, attempting to bring the conversation under control. “Well, I mean, we’re going to talk about the Epstein file,” he said. “Well, I mean, we're going to talk about the Epstein file. Scott, I will do the fact-checking as we go along here. Repeat what you said about the global sex trafficking ring?”Kasky did not retreat. “That Donald Trump was provably very involved with it,” he said.\n\nNow, if you think that's bad, you should get a look at the \"apology\" he issued later that, in my opinion, has made everything worse. \n\nI would like to retract my comments from CNN last night and truly apologize. Donald Trump was obviously not involved with a giant international child sex trafficking ring where women and children were systematically abused by elites. I said that by accident and didn’t mean it.\n\nIf it was an assertion about which he was so certain, indeed, it was \"provable\" and that Donald Trump was \"provably very involved with it\" that he issued his slanderous, defamatory assertion twice. His evidence for it is in inverse proportion to his really having a bad case of TDS.\n\nKasky completely owned himself with his \"apology,\" too. \n\nIf it was \"obvious\" that Trump was \"not involved with a giant international child sex trafficking ring where women and children were systematically abused by elites,\" then why did he say that slanderous sentence in the first place? \n\nThe apology assumes malice aforethought, meaning that if it were so \"obvious,\" he knew that it was untrue when he said it twice. This seems to open him up to greater legal exposure. \n\nAnd what really makes this \"apology\" the stinker that it is, you have to ask: Why would he restate the defamation in his so-called \"apology\"? Because he doesn't mean the apology.\n\nWho lawyered that letter?

His Response Is Pure Poetry. \n\nI'm always amazed at the lack of intellectual rigor with which these children glom onto to a talking point from someone's idea of what they thought they heard from a guy at the place with the thing who talked to somebody about a court case that explicitly said Trump was NOT a rapist and for which George Stephanopoulos's network had to pay $15 million to the not-rapist Trump for saying he was charged with something he was not (rape). It was in all the papers, but maybe the Chi Coms removed it from the TikTok algorithm. Anyway, if you're going to make up stuff from the rantings of a strange woman who was paid to bring that lawsuit by a Democrat donating billionaire who was in Jeffrey Epstein's files and went to Little Saint James — Pedophile Island — AFTER Epstein's 2008 legal sweetheart deal with the feds, you might want to rethink your life choices. And your anecdotes. \n\nTrump is considering suing his bank for debanking him, his companies, and his family. \n\nHe's successfully sued other media companies, as Matt pointed out:\n\nTrump is suing the BBC for $10 billion for deceptively editing his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, to make it appear he told his supporters to storm the Capitol. While that case is ongoing, Trump has had a string of successes with similar lawsuits. Meta agreed to pay $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit over his suspension from Facebook. Alphabet paid a $22 million settlement for suspending Trump’s YouTube channel. CBS settled with Trump for $16 million over its deceptive edits of Kamala Harris’s 60 Minutes interview in a blatant attempt at election interference. ABC News settled with Trump for $15 million over George Stephanopoulos’s false claims about him. These companies did not settle out of charity or goodwill.\n\nEven public figures can successfully sue if they can show that this CNN commentator maliciously spewed his venom without due diligence. This is obvious from his \"apology.\" \n\nTrump has successfully sued and has gotten settlements and apologies from these media companies. They settle rather than paying $2000 an hour to multiple lawyers whileTrump's lawyers pore over their discovery files. They also don't want to sit in court for months or years parrying with Trump's legal team. Trump doesn't have to worry about paying his legal team, either. Like his other lawsuits against the media, when he wins, Trump's opponents pay his legal fees. \n\nI talked about this on my Tuesday livestream and said that the kid had better lawyer up. I haven't changed my mind, and I think he just made things worse. \n\nEnjoying PJ Media?\n\nGet exclusive content and support independent journalism with 60% off a PJ Media VIP membership.

I think we will at some point in the near future.”\n\nThe governor cited the election victories last year for Democratic Govs. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, as well as Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., in 2024.\n\nIn November, Obama said Americans are “not ready” to elect a woman to the White House, pointing to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ election loss to President Donald Trump in the last presidential election.\n\n“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” the former first lady said at the Brooklyn Academy of Music at the time while promoting her book, “The Look.”\n\n“That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not … We’ve got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,” she added.\n\nPressed on whether Harris lost to Trump in the presidential election because she is a woman, Whitmer responded: “I don’t think it was just gender, no.”\n\nWhitmer, who is term-limited and cannot seek a third term as governor, said she does not currently have plans to run for another office.\n\nShe has been floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, but the governor said her focus remains on serving Michigan and helping her party’s candidates win the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nAsked about how Democrats could win in the midterms this year, Whitmer pointed to her gubernatorial campaign’s decision to remain “focused on the fundamentals.”\n\n“I don’t think Michigan is unique in that,” Whitmer said. \n\n“I think every person in this country wants and expects government to make their lives better, and so that’s been our formula here in Michigan and I think that can be replicated everywhere successfully.”","summary":"Whitmer cited the election victories last year for Democratic Govs. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/21/media/michigan-governor-gretchen-whitmer-disagrees-with-michelle-obama-says-america-is-ready-for-a-woman-president/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gretchen-whitmer-america-ready-for-woman-president.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1768990138&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3AvhAndX-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-21 18:07:20","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":394997346,"title":"Scott Bessent slaps down Newsom at Davos: 'He's here with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros'","text":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent issued a rhetorical beatdown against Democratic California Gov.

When Weiss spiked a story on the CECOT, the El Salvador prison where the Trump administration is sending some deportees, \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi said she did it for political reasons, even though Weiss issued a memo with very clear requests for the story (it also turned out that \"60 Minutes\" lied about being unable to get members of the Trump administration on the record, too).\n\nNow Variety is back and attacking Weiss, warning that CBS News is \"veering towards dysfunction\" under Weiss.\n\nTen people familiar with the workings of CBS News say the Paramount Skydance unit is veering toward dysfunction, with a management team led by Bari Weiss that doesn’t value the standards held by veteran journalists — and a staff that views its editor-in-chief and her hand-picked… pic.twitter.com/0x7oL2bMzC— Variety (@Variety) January 20, 2026\n\nHere's more (emphasis added):\n\nTen people familiar with the workings of CBS News say the Paramount Skydance unit is veering toward dysfunction, with a management team led by Bari Weiss that doesn’t value the standards held by veteran journalists — and a staff that views its editor-in-chief and her hand-picked senior staff with great skepticism, owing to her lack of experience managing mainstream media assets.These people suggest a cascade of recent errors at CBS News — rushing incoming “Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil into his job without a longer period to promote his arrival, airing a town hall with Erika Kirk without mainstream ad support, pulling a “60 Minutes’” segment after it had already been announced — have eroded CBS News’ value and credibility, and can only be fixed if producers and reporters challenge Weiss more regularly.Such stuff augurs a quick-moving “degradation of CBS News,” says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, who fears the dynamic could lead to a “death spiral” that is “hard to reverse.”\n\nI feel like I'm taking crazy pills. For starters, Weiss worked at The New York Times, where she was an editor. She then started her own company, which grew and did so well that CBS/Paramount bought it. Yet Variety has the audacity to say she has no experience managing \"mainstream media assets.\"\n\nI've seen how those mainstream media assets have been managed, and fresh blood is exactly what's needed.\n\nGoing back 20-plus years, it was CBS News and \"60 Minutes\" that ran the Killian documents that raised questions about then-President Bush's time with the National Guard. The story featured documents allegedly written by Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian, Bush's late squadron leader, and purportedly said he was pressured into \"sugarcoating\" Bush's performance ratings and that Bush \"failed to follow orders and take a physical.\" CBS was forced to apologize after it was revealed the documents were \"not genuine.\" Dan Rather later apologized.\n\nMore recently, it was \"60 Minutes\" that selectively edited an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris, taking her rambling word salad response on the war in Israel and turning it into something less embarrassing. President Trump sued the network over it, and they later settled.\n\nThe fact that Weiss doesn't \"value the standards held by veteran journalists\" is to her advantage. I've already pointed out three issues with CBS, but here's a picture of what those \"standards held by veteran journalists\" look like:\n\nThe standards held by veteran journalists: https://t.co/6fWgLoNtTS pic.twitter.com/BmJJGr9vLW— Amy Curtis (@RantyAmyCurtis) January 21, 2026\n\nThat's not some random YouTube channel. That's CNN. And things are no different at CBS.\n\nAs for the attacks on Tony Dokoupil, I wrote about his promise to do better for CBS viewers not too long ago.\n\n\"So here's my promise to you today, and every time you see me in this chair. You come first. Not advertisers, not politicians, not corporate interests. And yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS,\" Dokoupil said in a promotional video for the rebranded CBS Evening News. \"I report for you. Which means I tell you what I know, when I know it, and how I know it. And when I get it wrong, I'll tell you that, too.\"\n\n\"It also means I'm going to talk to everybody, and hold everyone in public life to the very same standard. After all, I became a journalist to talk to people. I love talking to people about what works in this country, what doesn't,\" Dokoupil said.\n\n\"And not only what should change, but the good ideas that should never change. I think telling the truth is one of them.\"\n\nCurtis Houck of Newsbusters praised Dokoupil, writing on X, \"Tony's track record the last few years has been better than anyone at the big three networks.\"\n\nWhich is why Variety is also attacking him. They've made no claims of wrongdoing. Just that he was rushed into the job. Had Dokoupil come out and said he would be anti-Trump all the time, Variety would probably not have complained about his abrupt debut. And here I'll be honest: I don't regularly watch mainstream news. I haven't for most of my adult life. I get the info I want and need from social media without having to wade through the garbage that passes for the \"standards held by veteran journalists.\" But I hope Dokoupil does well and keeps his promises.\n\nFor far too long, the mainstream media have been stenographers and propagandists for the DNC. That is what's eroded their credibility and value, and that was a problem that long predates Bari Weiss. Like Dokoupil, I hope she succeeds. Much to the dismay of that Yale Professor, Weiss' success absolutely requires the \"death spiral\" that will be \"hard to reverse.\"\n\nAnyone who has a vested interest in keeping legacy media going — looking at you, Leftists — should want this objectivity. It's the only thing that will keep CBS from pulling the plug permanently. Unfortunately, I've been around long enough to know the Left isn't capable of such objective, forward-looking thinking.\n\nThey want control, and they're mad they've lost their stranglehold over a handful of media outlets, including CBS and X, because the idea that news and information exist that contradict their preferred narratives is anathema to them. That's why they attack Weiss.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/01/21/vip-bari-weiss-values-n2669826","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2019/8/d6b0d95b-f0b9-406f-b186-bc9e944d2e3f.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 17:30:35","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":394935584,"title":"Exclusive first listen: Lara Trump is all at home with her new single","text":"It comes out on Friday, and you can listen to a sneak peek HERE.\n\nAnd it shows where her priorities lie right now after passing up the chance last year to dive back into politics and run for the vacant Senate seat in North Carolina, where she was born and raised.\n\n“With how crazy my life is between my Fox News show, my podcast, being a mom, being a crazy dog lady, and more, I have really enjoyed the escape that comes from music and have truly been having fun with different genres and meeting artists,” she told Secrets.\n\n“I was excited to collaborate with Mohamed and love how light and upbeat our new song turned out,” she added. “I hope people enjoy listening to it as much as we enjoyed collaborating on it.”\n\nFor those trying to read the runes of her political future, Secrets suggests looking at the way the single was recorded.\n\nRamadan flew to Miami and then drove to President Donald Trump’s golf club in Jupiter, Florida.\n\nThe main lobby was turned into a recording studio. The video was filmed right there once the track was laid down.\n\nThe whole thing was kept not just close to home, but at home, given that Lara Trump, Eric Trump, and their two children have lived in a five-bedroom home in the gated Trump National Golf Club community for the past five years.\n\nA Secrets source said Lara Trump ruled out running in North Carolina because it would have taken her away from home and her young family. If she does dive deeper into politics — her huge fundraising haul for the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election suggested big things could follow — expect it to come no more than a wedge shot away from her base, somewhere in the Sunshine State.\n\nIt was new territory for her collaborator, Ramadan. He is a regular on television and sits at the top of the charts in the Middle East.\n\nHe told Secrets that the whole thing was Lara Trump’s idea, and he contributed lyrics in the style of an Egyptian romantic song, but with a melody that would crossover to a Western audience.\n\nThe haters have already had their say. A clip of Ramadan teaching Lara Trump his signature “Tiger” dance move went viral over the weekend, with a slew of insulting comments.\n\nAnd they will no doubt have more to add about the single’s heavy use of autotune (even though Secrets, an aficionado of Middle Eastern and North African pop, where it is treated as an extra instrument, is all in favor).\n\nBut Mohamed said he never had any worries about teaming up with such a visible member of MAGA’s first family.\n\n“I had absolutely no reservations at all, and I don’t get involved in politics. I’m an artist, and I genuinely admire Lara’s art and her voice,” he said. “We were brought together by the song — and even if she weren’t from the Trump family, I still would have made this song with her.”\n\nThe single was produced by LJ Fino and his First Class Label Group. He believes much of the mainstream music industry has overlooked the “America First” audience.\n\n“Lara has a big year ahead with a collaborative EP featuring major global artists, including her record with Mohamed, and released in conjunction with Warner Music Group, followed by her debut album “Just Lara” arriving in late 2026,” he said.\n\nTrump looked and sounded exhausted when he addressed the audience at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday morning. But then, who wouldn’t be after a plane malfunction delayed an overnight flight by three hours? Even so, he couldn’t resist ad-libbing and cracking jokes.\n\n“Would you like me to say a few words about Greenland?” he deadpanned. It’s fair to say the ensuing laughter could be described as “nervous.”\n\nAI chief breaks Trump truce\n\nIt’s been barely a month since Dario Amodei, the chief executive of artificial intelligence giant Anthropic, embarked on a relationship-rebuilding tour of Washington. \n\nIt came after David Sacks, the president’s AI czar, attacked Anthropic for its left-wing, anti-Trump bias.\n\nHe pointed to a now-deleted 2024 X post that compared the president with a “feudal warlord” and to Amodei’s support for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAs a result, Amodei went into damage limitation mode. He met with Trump officials and senators to assure them that they were very much on the same side, wanting the United States to win the race to dominate AI, even if he would like tighter regulation.\n\nSo maybe the thin, mountain air at the World Economic Forum in Davos got to him yesterday. The president launched an attack on his officials’ decision to allow U.S. firms such as Nvidia to sell advanced chips to China.\n\n“I think this is crazy,” he said. “It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.”\n\nHis truce went about as well as Secrets‘s dry January.\n\nThe whiff of cigarettes\n\nA year ago, the president and his administration were relaxed about the United Kingdom’s decision to give up the Chagos Islands, which are home to a U.S. military base, and sign them over to Mauritius. In fact, the president frequently sounded as if he had never heard of the specks of rock in the middle of the Indian Ocean when the subject came up.\n\nSo why did he suddenly unload on his pal, Sir Keir Starmer, U.K. prime minister, on Monday night, calling it an “act of great stupidity?”\n\nIt marked a huge U-turn. American officials backed the deal, which included a 99-year lease for the base on Diego Garcia.\n\nSecrets immediately detected the whiff of stale cigarettes. The problem is a hobby horse of Nigel Farage, the British populist, president’s ally, and noted tobacco enthusiast.\n\nAnd the Telegraph got the goods, pointing out that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) was a guest on Farage’s TV show hours earlier when the subject came up. “Why was the U.S. not up in arms?” he was asked.\n\nIn the hours that followed, Johnson is understood to have spoken to his boss on the phone, the outlet reported. Cue angry Truth Social post.\n\nNuuk winners\n\nCongratulations to Kevin Miller, Mohamed Bushry Basheer, and Sean Maxwell for getting the other four capitals with letters that cannot be colored in.

He told Politico that she is “the only candidate with the common-sense leadership Minnesotans are desperately craving, and her message of safety, opportunity, and prosperity would be a welcome addition to our Senate majority.”\n\nDemocratic contenders and Minnesota’s Senate history\n\nOn the Democratic side, Lt.

Coleman served one term. The state’s current senators – Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar – are both Democrats.

And among many other events, he attended the first day of the Ryder Cup just outside New York in September and mingled with the Yankees on the anniversary of 9/11. Just this week, he was at the National Championship college final between Indiana Hoosiers and Miami Hurricanes.\n\nBut while athletes have largely shown respect to Trump's status as President, what do they actually think of the man himself? And did they vote for him?\n\nAccording to a remarkable new look at voting data by VoteHub, it appears that many did not. \n\nUsing publicly available voter data from 23 states and the District of Columbia, VoteHub explained it has been able to 'collect the party identification on 1,506 athletes across the “Big Four\" (NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL) and the WNBA'.\n\nThe league with the most Republican support is Major League Baseball, with 53.7% of players backing Trump's party from a sample of 434.\n\nThere aren't many names in the league who have publicly endorsed the president but when Trump visited the Yankees on 9/11, the locker room was full to welcome the President.\n\nWhether that translates as voting support though, is another thing and the players may well have decided to put their own individual allegiances to one side on an emotional day in the city.\n\nThe second sport that backs Trump and the Republican party the most is hockey, with 43.9% of players out 109 sampled counting as red. There were six democrats and 50 independents who were also counted.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, only around a fifth - 20.2% - of NFL players out of a 752-player sample size are Republican, with 34.3% counting as Democrat.\n\nIt's also the league where the most players have been open in their support of Trump.\n\nKansas City Chiefs Super Bowl winner Harrison Butker has repeatedly endorsed the President, as has his teammate James Winchester. Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones also went out of his way to shake Trump's hand before the Super Bowl last February in New Orleans, too.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Nick Bosa has also backed Trump and worked on his Council on Sports alongside other players such as Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley and Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nThe league with the most anti-Trump sentiments, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the WNBA.\n\nOnly 2.3% of players polled were Republican while a massive 67.5% were Democrat and supported Kamala Harris at the November 2024 election.

But, I won't do that,\" additionally warning that \"Canada lives because of the United States.\"\n\n The comments were enough to get Goldberg to call for the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office over his mental acuity: \"It's time, it's time, it's time,\" the 70-year-old Sister Act actress repeated at the table. The 25th Amendment allows the vice president and the presidential cabinet to deem a sitting president to be unfit to hold office for a variety of reasons.\n\"To that point, Whoopi, you'd be in a lot of company,\" cohost Sunny Hostin added. \"You believe at this point that the president of the United States may not have his full faculty?\"\n\n Goldberg quickly responded, telling her colleague, \"I felt that before now,\" and that \"there's been a lot of cherries on the cake\" and \"lines in the sand\" pointing toward him being unfit for office.\n\n The star added that Trump \"is sitting in a position that is uncomfortable to me. I'm sorry. I'm uncomfortable with him as president,\" before conservative panelist Alyssa Farah Griffin — who previously worked under Trump during his first term in office before resigning and repeatedly speaking out against him — stepped in with a sobering reminder.\n\n \"Just remember, the 25th Amendment requires the cabinet around him to act,\" the 36-year-old said. \"As a dose of reality, his cabinet is squarely with him.\"\n\n Goldberg pushed back, telling Griffin that \"it's time for them to go, too,\" before, in another conversation, Hostin called Trump a \"useful idiot\" for problematic leaders on the world stage who want to enact their own agendas.\n\n Wednesday's show was not the first in which The View cohosts called for a political leader to be removed from a key position. Following Joe Biden's concerning performance during a June 2024 debate against Trump, Sara Haines and Griffin called for Biden to bow out of the race and allow another Democrat to take over — which he eventually did, paving the way for Vice President Kamala Harris' eventual run against Trump.\n\n If the 25th Amendment were to be enacted, the vice president — in this case, JD Vance — would become the acting president. This has happened before, when George W. Bush used the third section of the amendment to temporarily transfer power to the late Dick Cheney in 2002, while he was unable to hold his post after being under anesthesia for a colonoscopy procedure.\n\n \"The 25th Amendment’s Section 4 lays out what happens if the president becomes unable to discharge his duties but doesn’t transfer power to the vice president himself,\" the Associated Press reported in a 2021 article. \"The vice president and majority of the cabinet can declare the president unfit.

USA House did not immediately respond to POLITICO’s request for comment.\n\nNewsom has planned to use the gathering to excoriate what he casts as the Trump administration’s abuses of power, framing California — and implicitly himself — as a better partner to European allies who are reeling from Trump’s effort to claim Greenland. He challenged European counterparts this week to confront Trump, calling the president “pathetic.”\n\nWhite House officials have not been shy about punching back. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mocked the governor from a Davos stage earlier on Wednesday, saying Newsom “may be the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris” and warning the Trump administration is “coming to California” to crack down on alleged fraud. Bessent also appeared to hint at the cancellation.\n\n“I was told he was asked to give a speech on his signature policies but he’s not speaking,” Bessent said, “because what have his economic policies brought?

What, didn’t you see all the New Year’s Eve eulogies sliding across your feed like tears ribboning down millions of teenagers’ cheeks? The communal misery was intense if you happened to stumble across some sad pool of it. “MTV is going off the air at midnight tonight . . . man. There was a time when MTV was THE channel to be watching on New Year’s Eve,” rued one Bluesky user.\n\nHe’s right. It’s been many years since the land of continuous “Ridiculousness” repeats gave us any reason to pay attention to it on most days, let alone in the waning hours of Dec. 31.\n\nBut if anybody bothered to click through their TV provider’s schedules that day, they may have cheered right up at seeing that MTV is very much alive.\n\nAt least the bamboozled weren’t tricked into leaving their homes on New Year’s Eve and gathering with hundreds of others to watch midnight fireworks on the Brooklyn Bridge — a highly anticipated event that was never officially scheduled, and therefore never materialized.\n\nVideos captured people murmuring confusedly, presuming technical difficulties, before the truth dawned on the crowd that pyrotechnics would not be forthcoming.\n\nHow did so many come to believe that a premier pop culture brand would quietly go off the air without every major news outlet making a fuss, considering the countless obituaries that sent off MTV News when it shut down in 2023? How were so many otherwise reasonable people pranked into venturing to an empty Brooklyn Bridge Park in the bleak midwinter as 2025 ebbed to nothing, for nothing?\n\nThe simplest answer is that TikTok told them these events were real. An even simpler one is that they wanted them to be. But in some sense, the people seeking fireworks reaped the greater benefit of the lesson provided by this hoax. If they never left the house, they might have never seen for themselves that the promised event never happened, and therefore remained convinced by AI slop that it took place.\n\nMerriam-Webster crowned “slop” as 2025’s word of the year in mid-December, defining it as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.” As ever, the reference company made its choice well after the term became as common as potholes on a neglected road.\n\nBut if the term’s prevalence wasn’t fully understood before, it will be in 2026. Oozing slop seeps into the fractures of our separate realities, pushing our divisions further apart as digital deepfakes imitate life in ways that are increasingly difficult to detect. Careful as we may be to steer around most of these pits, it’s nigh impossible to avoid all of them. The best you can do to prevent lasting damage is to slow down and gently roll through the biggest ones.\n\nThat challenge is growing, even for the savviest of us. Polls continue to show that Americans still thoroughly distrust mainstream information delivery systems, and the ones that do would rather tune out the news than engage with it beyond what they see on Threads, Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok and other social media spaces.\n\nGenerative AI technology is improving to realistically depict politically convenient narratives or buttress the dominant vibes of any moment with falsified evidence. Aggregators willfully take advantage of news avoidance, narrow attention spans and short fuses.\n\nMTV’s faked death is an example of that. In October, Paramount Skydance announced it would shut down music-specific MTV channels in the U.K. and Australia, including MTV Music, MTV ’80s, MTV ’90s, Club MTV, and MTV Live, at the crack of 2026. Drive-by headline readings led to an outcry that the media conglomerate was killing a generation-defining cable channel.\n\nMany journalistic outlets that reported the story, including Salon, spelled out the specifics within the first paragraph or two. But who actually reads past the headlines for context anymore?\n\nBesides, given the steady rate of media consolidation and layoffs, cancellations and quiet disappearances of all manner of screen-related ephemera, erasing a linear TV channel without most people noticing is not beyond the realm of plausibility. But is it really all that daunting to pick up your remote and click around a little to verify a shocking claim someone made on social media?\n\nMaybe. We’ve been groping through this land of disbelief for some time now. The mass anguish over MTV’s greatly exaggerated demise confirms that Gen X, the oft-overlooked MTV generation, is easily reeled in by cheap nostalgia bait. An AI-tribute to the fallen, posted on Jan. 4, represents that breed of absurdity’s apex. (Shoutout to Dave Holmes, who triumphantly mocked the whole affair in an outstanding Esquire feature.)\n\nAt least those hoodwinked folks weren’t tricked into leaving their houses for nothing.\n\nThen again, those New Year’s Eve revelers may have had their powers of basic detection and deductive reasoning sharpened by being led astray by AI slop. If they had consulted Brooklyn Bridge Park’s official site, or questioned why the footage featured in those fake ads mirrored the 2025 Macy’s Fourth of July celebration – which actually did take place at the Bridge – they might have found something better to do than wait beside a chilly river for sparks that never materialized in the sky.\n\nWhatever. TikTok and the ‘Gram told them to go, so they did. Among the New Year’s Eve party-seekers was user @zackgill02, whose video went viral that night. “I mean, the amount of people who are misinformed here. . .” he says in the widely-shared clip. Offscreen, a woman’s voice wonders, “What does this say about 2026?”\n\n“It’s not off to a good start,” he answers. No kidding.\n\nFalsified images and propaganda have been misleading people to worse ends for many years, but these recent shams are evidence of a culture-wide abandonment of a common reality. Instead, we eagerly swallow impossible fantasies served up on screens that align with our version of how we want or expect the world to be.\n\nAnd while it’s entertaining to giggle at a bunch of suckers mourning the end of a network that anyone can see is still around, or chumps who expected to woot at fiery starbursts launching from a bridge still visibly open to traffic, AI slop purveyors are counting on that level of credulity to further distort our perception of the world. This has real-world consequences that stand to affect all of us.\n\nThe worst that befell most of those duped by New Year’s Eve AI-generated mischief was a little discomfort, embarrassment and wasted time. Meanwhile, for weeks, Elon Musk’s xAI’s generative artificial intelligence tool Grok dutifully fulfilled users’ undressing image requests, manipulating photos of women and children to depict them in skimpy clothing without their consent. Along the way, it also created images of minors that fall within the definition of child sexual abuse material.\n\n​On Wednesday, Jan. 14, after lawmakers in Britain, Brazil, India, and other countries threatened to involve their regulators, X introduced restrictions preventing the platform’s Grok account from generating or editing images of real people in “revealing clothing such as bikinis,” according to an official @Safety post, which adds that its image creation and editing feature will only be available to paid subscribers. This doesn’t mean those images will be any less shareable, except “in jurisdictions where such content is illegal,” says the official statement. A day after that announcement, researchers and journalists found they could still generate undressing-style images using Grok Imagine, a standalone app accessible via any web browser.\n\nThe MTV and Brooklyn shenanigans are also fairly quaint next to Grok’s swift, inaccurate digital unmasking of the ICE agent who gunned down 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. Before Jonathan Ross was identified as the shooter, a social media user decided the face belonged to someone called Steve Grove. That name belongs to many people, including the Minnesota Star Tribune’s publisher and a Missouri gun shop owner. Both received threats shortly after that lie spread.\n\nNewsGuard’s Reality Check newsletter cited six provably false claims about the shooting within a day, including four that used AI to fabricate or distort the facts. According to the report, those AI-generated hoaxes alone racked up 4.24 million views across X, Instagram, Threads, and TikTok.\n\n​And this came days after fabricated videos, manipulated stills and mischaracterized reports related to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro tore across the Internet.\n\n​Frames alleged to represent the special forces raid were easily proven to have been manipulated. A 2003 picture of a Delta Force operator beside a hooded Saddam Hussein was passed off by a few X users as a picture of Maduro en route to the U.S., which was entirely unnecessary since Donald Trump posted his own photo trophy on Truth Social.\n\nWho’s to say if that’s legitimate, though? Actually, there are tools expressly dedicated to that purpose, although even they aren’t entirely reliable substitutes for healthy skepticism employed early and frequently.\n\nDonald Trump weaponized the Orwellian art of making the masses trust him more than their eyes since the earliest days of his first administration. A year into his second, if there is an entitlement program he wants to defund or a constituency he and the right desires to demonize the White House’s social media team and its MAGA allies eagerly slop the zone.\n\nWhen SNAP benefits expired on Nov. 1, AI slop was ready to keep those who still buy into the Reagan-era welfare queen myth, including many of our elected officials, well fed with Sora-generated videos portraying scowling Black women abusing SNAP benefits.\n\n​“It is unsurprising that many of these fake AI videos feature black women as SNAP recipients, furthering a nasty and debunked stereotype about the types of people who receive government aid,” said documentary filmmaker Azza Cohen, the former White House videographer for Vice President Kamala Harris, in a video for The Contrarian. She adds, “Don’t fall for it. The real scammers aren’t parents trying to feed their kids. It’s our leaders in Congress who shut down the government and scammers creating this sexist and racist content.”\n\nDisinformation AI slop isn’t limited to domestic affairs. Since Iranian authorities shut down nearly all of the country’s Internet access on Jan. 8 in response to ongoing anti-government protests, some users have been concocting AI videos to advance their version of the narrative. NewsGuard debunked a 14-second AI-generated video linked to a TikTok account that no longer exists that shows protesters cheering as someone changes the name of a street to Trump St. While the clip can no longer be found on TikTok, it remains visible elsewhere, including on a X post that user @Milajoy shared on Jan. 12 that has racked up more than 94,000 views.\n\n​Stemming the tide of misleading AI feels like a losing battle at a time when America’s leadership is more dedicated to locking its populace in a constant state of heightened emotion than governing to its benefit. This all but guarantees that many will prefer to stay safe at home and separate from the real world — perhaps while streaming past seasons of “The Real World” — while ignoring the most basic checklists involved in figuring out what is authentic and true, including trusting our gut feelings.\n\nWant more from culture than just the latest trend?

All signs point to a hell of a time sorting fact from fiction as midterm campaigning heats up. AI can make half-truths and outright lies more entertaining than footage from any stump speech, which guarantees those falsehoods will spread faster than the details of a candidate’s policy positions.\n\nAnd we can’t discount FOMO’s power to seduce us into placing undue trust in social media platforms continuing to be the best and only place to find out about experiences so exclusive, so underground that most people would never find them. Because they’re not happening.\n\n​What’s to be done?

And I thought that was going to be one of my easier ones. Not the easiest, so settled in a matter of hours,” Trump said in reply to a question on the Ukraine war.\n “It’s got to get done. Saving a lot of lives, saving millions of lives. With Ukraine and Russia, this tremendous hatred between President Zelensky and President Putin. That’s not good. That’s not good for settlements,” he said.\n “I think Russia wants to make a deal. I think Ukraine wants to make a deal. And we’re going to try getting a deal done… I think I can say that we’re reasonably close,” he said.\n Trump said many times we had a deal with Russia, and Zelenskyy didn’t agree… It’s a very difficult balance,” he said.\n Trump said, “it’s a blood bath. It’s horrible what’s happening. Drones are killing thousands of people a week. We have to get it stopped.” “So I believe they’re at a point now. I’m going to meet with President Zelensky later today. I believe they’re at a point now where they come together and get a deal done,” he said.\n “And if they don’t, they’re stupid; it’s for both of them. And I know they’re not stupid. But if they don’t get this done, they are stupid. So, I don’t want to insult anyone, but you got to get this deal done. Too many people are dying. It’s not worth it,” he said.\n On China, Trump said he has always had a very good relationship with President Xi of China.\n “He’s an incredible man. And what he’s done is amazing,” he said, adding his relationship with Xi was very severely interrupted by COVID.\n “I used to call it the China virus, but he said, do you think you could use a different name? And I decided to do that. Because why should we have a problem over that? But, I would do that … I became a diplomat for the first time,” he said.\n On Greenland, he said it is costing Denmark hundreds of billions a year to run it and Denmark’s a small country with wonderful people.\n “But you know, it’s very expensive. It’s a very big piece of ice. And it’s very important… It’s very important that we use that for national and international security,” he said.\n “That can create a power that will make it impossible for the bad guys to do anything against the perceived good ones,” he said.\n “Without us (in the Ukraine war), I think there could have been a World War III. If you want to know the truth, if Kamala (Harris) was elected, or Joe, any one of those leaders, I think you could have ended up in World War III,” he said.\n But, we’re not going to have World War III now, and we want to get it stopped. It would have been a very, very bad situation. And it still is, but it’s not that kind of bad. It’s bad because so many young people have been killed,” he said.

A resurfaced clip from an earlier interview with psychiatrist Alok Kanojia has also reignited anger, after Bartlett asked whether society should ‘put systems in place’ to ensure lonely men or self-described incels can find partners.\n\nThe discussion, critics say, treated women as an abstract solution to male dissatisfaction while failing to acknowledge consent or autonomy.\n\nComment nowWhat are your thoughts on the backlash against Steven Bartlett? Comment Now\n\nShabaz continued, addressing the controversy in his video, saying: ‘This is why a lot of people have called him like a Trojan horse, right, because it isn’t the same as Andrew Tate standing up there shouting and screaming. This has got a therapy vibe to it.’ \n\nHis criticism was met with an outpouring of support from high-profile figures, many of whom said they were former fans of the podcast. \n\nDancer and television personality Oti Mabuse commented that Bartlett was ‘so disappointing,’ adding that she had once loved the show.\n\nReality star Vicky Pattison praised Shabaz’s video as ‘insightful’ and echoed the sense of disillusionment, while Ulrika Jonsson added a simple ‘Amen.’ \n\nOthers, including Ferne McCann, Sara Cox, and The Traitors finalist Charlotte Chilton, also publicly backed the critique with emoji responses and likes. \n\n Millions of people listen to Steven’s podcast episodes daily (Picture: Kate Green/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTA)\n\nRadio 1 presenter Greg James was blunt, suggesting the podcast had been ‘hurtling’ in this direction for some time. \n\nHe continued, commenting: ‘What’s everyone’s favourite episode? Mine is the one where an “expert” claimed autism could be reversed through diet. Oh and the one that said Covid was an engineered weapon. Neither claim was challenged. Great stuff.’\n\nOf course, this isn’t happening in a vacuum. Amelia Whitworth, Head of Policy, Campaigns & Youth at Plan International UK told Metro: ‘Misogyny has long been embedded in our society, but we’re now seeing a surge in online content that claims to speak to men’s issues while actually promoting harmful attitudes. \n\n‘This content taps into very real fears and anxieties that boys and men may experience, then twist them to push misogynistic ideas that ignore – or outright dismiss – the challenges women face. \n\n This Is Not Right \n\nOn November 25, 2024 Metro launched This Is Not Right, a campaign to address the relentless epidemic of violence against women.\n\nWith the help of our partners at Women's Aid, This Is Not Right aims to shine a light on the sheer scale of this national emergency.\n\nYou can find more articles here, and if you want to share your story with us, you can send us an email at vaw@metro.co.uk.\n\nIntroducing This Is Not Right: Metro's year-long violence against women campaign\n\nRemembering the women killed by men in 2024\n\n‘What was once confined to fringe corners of the internet is increasingly entering the mainstream. It’s deeply worrying to see these narratives go unchallenged on one of the country’s most popular podcasts.’\n\nDr Ján Michalko, Research Fellow in the Gender Equality & Social Inclusion team at ODI Global think tank, also echoed these sentiments when speaking to us, saying: ‘It is important that all influencers and content creators who have millions of followers consider carefully the material they put on social media.\n\n‘Platforming ideas that undermine women’s autonomy and rights, even if they come from the words of other people, does have an impact because they reach millions of people, including men who are looking for guidance about what it means to be a successful man in this day and age.’\n\nLong-time listeners have also expressed similar concerns online. On Reddit, former fans described feeling increasingly uneasy as discussions about men’s loneliness drifted into speculation about managing reproduction and relationships at a societal level. \n\n @steven Fasting can reverse diabetes? #health #fasting #podcast #doctor #diabetes ♬ original sound – The Diary Of A CEO \n\nOne user noted that conversations framed as ‘big ideas’ often ignored women’s perspectives entirely, while another said the podcast’s refusal to meaningfully interrogate guests felt like complicity.\n\nAs Whitworth points out: ‘This isn’t happening in isolation. It comes alongside a well-funded, influential global pushback against the rights of women and girls. This movement seeks to preserve inequalities by limiting women’s agency and bodily autonomy, including through attacks on reproductive rights. Often, this is framed through rhetoric about family values, which is then used as a tool to restrict women’s freedoms.’\n\nThese criticisms are compounded by broader questions about responsibility. In 2024, a BBC investigation found that The Diary of a CEO had amplified harmful health misinformation, including anti-vaccine narratives and unsupported claims that certain medical conditions could be reversed through diet. \n\n @existentialpisces444 On the declining birth rate #patriarchy #misogyny #childfree #creatorsearchinsights #greenscreenvideo ♬ original sound – Ash \n\nA spokesperson for Diary Of A CEO told Metro: ‘The Diary Of A CEO is a long-form, conversational podcast designed to explore the perspectives and experiences of its guests in their own words. Inviting a guest is an act of inquiry, not endorsement. Steven Bartlett does not adopt the opinions of his guests, nor is the format intended to pass judgment on personal viewpoints. \n\n‘To suggest that a host is responsible for every view expressed by a guest is a fundamental misunderstanding of the long-form interview format.’ \n\nRegarding suggestions that the podcast has anything to do with the ‘manosphere,’ a spokesperson said: ‘DOAC features guests from across the entire political and cultural spectrum. In recent months alone, guests have included Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and a yet-to-be-published conversation with Zohran Mamdani. The podcast’s archive is a matter of public record and disproves this claim instantly.’\n\nBut for many exasperated listeners, that defence doesn’t quite feel like enough. As the backlash grows, many say the issue is not freedom of speech, but the consequences of repeatedly platforming harmful narratives under the guise of fact and reason. \n\nAs Dr Michalko put it: ‘As there has been a resurgence of voices advocating for traditional and harmful gender norms, any content that questions women’s autonomy can contribute to shifting what we normalise as people’s rights and roles in society. \n\n‘Influential figures should approach their social media content with care, understanding that we are in a context of increasing online and offline misogyny, at the same time as women’s rights, especially their reproductive rights, are politically targeted around the world.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.","summary":"'He's like a Trojan horse.'","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2026/01/21/stars-turn-steven-bartlett-accused-fuelling-disappointing-misogyny-26430398/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SEI_281675780-d84a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-21 16:30:00","author":"Brooke Ivey Johnson","authors":["Brooke Ivey Johnson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.404},{"id":394923016,"title":"‘Patrick Bateman Meets Sparkle Beach Ken’: Scott Bessent Delivers Sassy Retort To Gavin Newsom","text":"Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent slammed Democratic Gov.

After weaponising tariffs to arm-twist countries into signing pro-US trade deals, Trump claimed that America is becoming richer under his leadership, even as, in reality, it is American consumers paying nearly all of the price for Trump’s tariff war. An editorial review published by the New York Times on 20th January 2026, indicates that Trump, who gave the Make America Great Again slogan, is actually working avariciously on a ‘Make Trump Richer’ agenda, having amassed around $1.4 billion.\n\nThe NYT report titled “How Trump Has Used the Presidency to Make at Least $1.4 Billion” was published on 20th January, marking the first anniversary of Trump’s second presidential term. As per the report, Donald Trump has pocketed at least $1,408,500,000 since his January 2025 return to the White House, through an unprecedented exploitation of the office for his personal enrichment.\n\nThe figure NYT mentioned in its review is based on an analysis of various news reports. The report suggests that the $1.4 billion is a conservative underestimate due to undisclosed profits and ongoing revenue streams. This amount is equivalent to 16,822 times the US household income of $83,730.\n\nAs per the NYT, Donald Trump “poured his energy and creativity into the exploitation of the presidency,” allowing people, corporations, and foreign nations to funnel money into his personal pockets in exchange for US government favours. Unlike Harry Truman, who refused to commercialise his service, President Trump has qualms in indulging in massive moneymaking while in office.\n\nFrom overseas licensing deals, Amazon documentary payment, to cryptocurrency ventures, and more: Trump’s ‘Make America Rich Again’ dream turns out to be ‘Make Trump Rich Again’ reality\n\nDonald Trump pocketed at least $23 million from over 20 Trump-branded projects worldwide, including a hotel in Oman, an office tower in India, and a golf course in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. These projects often require foreign government approvals, and at times, the Trump administration extended policy favours for involved countries.\n\nIn August 2025, the Trump administration imposed 46% tariffs on Vietnam, which depends heavily on the US for its exports. However, the tariff was lowered 20%, hardly a month later. This came after the Trump Organisation broke ground for a $1.5 billion golf complex in Hanoi. The Vietnamese officials ignored their own laws to fast-track the Trump family’s project.\n\nDuring the groundbreaking ceremony, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh admitted that Eric Trump motivated him expedite the golf course project. It breezed through expedited permissions while, interestingly, Vietnam was negotiating a significant trade deal with Washington. The Vietnamese farmers who have been living and working on the land were instructed to leave their land with only $3,200 and provisions for rice in exchange.\n\nThe Trump family has also made over $90.5 million in total from companies like X, Meta, YouTube, Paramount, and ABC News. Trump raked in huge amounts from lawsuits he pursued from the Oval Office. Paramount paid $16 million over an alleged distorted edit of a 2024 Kamala Harris interview, which reportedly followed standard journalistic practice. Just three weeks later, the Federal Communications Commission “approved an $8 billion merger with Skydance,” the NYT reported.\n\nIn September 2025, YouTube agreed to pay $24.5m to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of Donald Trump’s channel over policy violation. Trump brought up a lawsuit against the Google subsidiary, accusing it of wrongly suspending his channel after the January 6 Capitol Hill attack. Trump had alleged that YouTube had “accumulated an unprecedented concentration of power, market share, and ability to dictate our nation’s public discourse”\n\nSimilarly, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, had settled a lawsuit with Trump in January 2025, after agreeing to pay $25 million. This amount went to Trump’s presidential library fund, while the $22 million from the YouTube lawsuit settlement went to restoration and preservation of the National Mall and supporting construction of the White House ballroom. The ballroom’s estimated cost was reported to be around $200 million.\n\nThe Trump family made around $28 million from Amazon for the rights to a documentary titled “Melania”, about the President’s wife, Melania Trump. This amount exceeded the next highest bidder and earlier similar deals, apparently linked to Amazon’s interest in antitrust regulations, defence contracts, and Jeff Bezos’s space company.\n\nIn May 2025, President Trump sparked controversy after agreeing to receive a $400 million luxury Boeing 747-8 aircraft, known as the ‘flying palace’, from the Qatar royal family as a ‘gift’. At home, Trump faced flak for accepting a luxurious gift from a foreign government. However, Trump defended his decision back then, saying that the US defended Qatar for many years, and that this is a gift to the United States Air Force/Department of Defence and not to him.\n\nWhile the luxury aircraft was said to be used as a secondary Air Force One during Trump’s presidency, Trump has planned to retain it afterwards and transfer it to his library.\n\nBesides, the Trump family’s cryptocurrency ventures have been the largest source of money for them. The Trump family have pocketed over $867 million via various cryptocurrencies, primarily from the family-linked World Liberty Financial (WLFI). These allow anonymous purchases by US and foreign investors, making pathways for influence. The UAE-backed firm announced a $2 billion investment in a Trump-linked company right after the US approved UAE access to advanced semiconductor chips.\n\nIn September 2025, World Liberty Financial launched a new digital currency called WLFI. Within hours of trading, the token had already created paper wealth worth as much as $5 billion for the president’s family. The Trumps collectively own just under a quarter of all WLFI tokens, instantly making it their single most valuable asset, even bigger than the family’s decades-old real estate empire.\n\nInterestingly, US President Donald Trump is listed as s a “Co-Founder Emeritus” of World Liberty, while his three sons are co-founders and active faces of the venture.\n\nThe Trump family’s crypto fortune was not merely a display of business acumen and timing, but also tied closely to legislation and policy decisions that he himself has pushed from the White House. In August 2025, Trump signed an executive order that could funnel trillions of dollars from American retirement accounts into cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets. The order allowed fund managers to include crypto, private equity, and even real estate investments in 401(k) retirement plans, something that wasn’t previously allowed.\n\nThis opened the door to a $12 trillion market of retirement funds, giving a massive potential boost to crypto projects like WLFI. For Trump, who is now both a policymaker and a crypto entrepreneur, the move could significantly enrich his own ventures.\n\nSuch is the US President’s avarice that in his second term, Trump ended up coddling the same Islamic terror-sponsoring Pakistan that he during his first presidential tenure despised and criticised for sucking billions from the US in the name of counterterrorism in Afghanistan. Rewarding a defeated in conflict against India and victorious in Trump sycophancy, Pakistan, with a massive crypto deal, the Trump-family-linked crypto venture World Liberty Financial signed a Rs 17,000 crore cryptocurrency deal with Pakistan. This move reinforced the perception that Trump’s newfound affection for Islamabad has less to do with strategy and more to do with private business interests. \n\nNot to forget, the $1.4 billion figure is a lower estimate, with probable additional hundreds of millions from crypto and other unaccounted elements. The NYT report says that Trump’s action not only raises concerns over corruption, but also risks leading to a “cynical spiral” where laws are used as tools for the wealthy.\n\nClearly, Trump is blending political power and business acumen to profit from policymaking. Donald Trump has turned the presidency into a personal revenue accelerator. Trump Organisation’s 17-fold income surge in 2025 alone raised concerns over alleged corruption and blurring of the lines between public duty and private gains.","summary":"The NYT report titled “How Trump Has Used the Presidency to Make at Least $1.4 Billion” was published on 20th January, marking the first anniversary of Trump’s second presidential term.

In the most recent news, Japanese Ambassador to India Ono Keiichi recently shared his biryani experience from AndhraBhavan, NewDelhi, where he was spotted enjoying biryani with hands. He posted on X and said that eating biryani by hand made it taste better, comparing the experience to eating sushi in Japan. This is not for the first time that Indian flavours have tempted the global leaders. Let us take you back in time and reflect on how Indian food has fascinated global leaders.As per Ayurveda, every finger has some spiritual significance which affects the eating and digestion. Thumb finger connects to Agni (Fire), index finger connects to Varun (Air), middle finger connects to Akash (Space), ring finger connects to Prithvi (Earth), and little finger connects to Jal (Water). It is believed that when eaten with hands, each finger brings in the representing element and they altogether balance out the functioning of the internal mechanism. In a video, nutritionist and author Rujuta Diwekar once mentioned that eating with hands in Sukhasana posture is the best thing to do. As per her video, traditionally, eating is considered to be a havan, an offering of food to the digestive fire in the stomach. So, the food that we eat must be with your hands, and the offering must be heartfelt. And as per science, eating with hands helps improve digestion because the hands contain bacteria which is not harmful but protects the body from various damaging microbes in the environment. It is also said that when we eat food with our hands, the nerve endings sense the temperature of the food and it prepares the brain for what we are going to eat and how hot or cold the food is. From the Ayurveda perspective, by touching food the nerves send the message to the body to prepare needed enzymes and digestive juices to digest that particular food.In 2020, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen shared her love for Indian food and mentioned that she enjoys chana masala and naan a lot. She also mentioned how Indian chai reminds her of her travel days in India.Hiroshi Suzuki, Japanese ambassador to India has also made news for loving Indian food. He was seen enjoying Maharashtrian street foods like vada pav and misal pav. He also enjoyed golgappe and mention on X. He also mentioned on Twitter (Now X) that he \"really wanted to eat golgappa\" ever since he saw PM Modi Narendra Modi and PM Kishida eating them together in March. Later, in the same twitter thread, he shared that he enjoyed Banarasi thali while in Varanasi. \"I also enjoyed a pure Banarasi Thali, after seeing mystic Night Aarti. I thank all of you for such warm hospitality,\" he wrote in his post.French President Emmanuel Macron made news in the year 20 , when he was on a trip to India and was captured enjoying chai in Jaipur. As per the video post, they enjoyed Kulhad Chai at the famous Sahu Chai Stall, which is situated in the main bazaar of Jaipur and has been running since 1968. It was established by the late Shree Ladhu Ram ji.As per a PTI report, once Michelle Obama had mentioned that Barack Obama loves Indian spices, and she loves Indian food.Alex Ellis, British High Commissioner to India was on a two-day tour to India in 2021, when he was spotted enjoying Mysore masala dosa in Bengaluru.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., implied that CBS was part of an \"oligarchy\" of powerful companies controlling the U.S. economy and media while appearing on one of the network's flagship broadcasts. During a Tuesday appearance on CBS' \"The Late Show,\" host Stephen Colbert asked Sanders to define oligarchy. \"An oligarchy is a nation where a small number of incredibly wealthy people control the economy, control media,\" Sanders explained. \"We have some experience with that right here on CBS.\" DAVID LETTERMAN BLASTS CBS NEWS AS 'WRECK' RUN BY 'IDIOTS' WHO TRAMPLED NETWORK'S INTEGRITY After taking the swipe at CBS, the senator went on to explain how, as of today, \"we have more income and wealth inequality than we’ve ever had in the history of America.\" \"You’ve got the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 93%,\" Sanders said. \"One man, Mr. Musk, one man, owning more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households. All right? And then you have a political system, all right? These guys not only want to control the economy, they want to control the political system.\" \"So you have a corrupt political system as the result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, so that billionaires like Mr. Musk can spend $270 million to elect Trump,\" he continued. Sanders also called out \"Democratic billionaires\" for contributing to the pay-to-play system of American politics before diving back into the issue of media ownership. \"So you add ownership of media, which is becoming more and more concentrated — right-wing people buying media, owning social media,\" he lamented, calling out X CEO Elon Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg by name. \"Ellison now owns Paramount and CBS,\" Sanders continued. \"You add all those things up, what you add end up with a really small number of people with incredible wealth and incredible power. Stephen, that is what oligarchy is about.\" BARI WEISS INVITES GEORGE CLOONEY TO NEWSROOM AFTER HE SAID SHE'S 'DISMANTLING CBS NEWS AS WE SPEAK' Colbert offered no defense of his network, and instead, said what Sanders just described \"goes together with authoritarianism as like the chocolate and peanut butter of terrible ideas.\" CBS, Musk and Zuckerberg did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News Digital. Following last year's acquisition of CBS and Paramount by Skydance Media, run by David Ellison, the son of billionaire Oracle founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison, both Colbert and Sanders were vocal in their criticism of the merger. Prior to the Skydance merger, Paramount, CBS's parent company, agreed on July 1, 2025, to pay President Donald Trump $16 million to settle his election interference lawsuit over the network's editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. \"I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles. It’s a ‘big fat bribe,’ because it all comes as Paramount’s owners are trying to get the Trump administration to approve the sale of our network to a new owner, Skydance!\" Colbert said. ‘EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE’ PETITION UNLIKELY TO FAZE PARAMOUNT CEO DAVID ELLISON AMID BARI WEISS SAGA: EX-JOURNO CBS staffers were outraged over the settlement, which also prompted extensive backlash from media watchdogs, journalism advocacy groups, liberal journalists and Democratic lawmakers. Sanders issued a scathing statement saying the settlement sets an \"extremely dangerous precedent in terms of both the First Amendment and government extortion,\" while Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., accused Paramount of taking a \"bribe\" and threatened future federal charges. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital's Joseph A.
