Remember, Trump tapped Halligan to serve as interim U.S. attorney after her predecessor reportedly did not have enough evidence to criminally prosecute James. \n\nJames and Comey have long been on Trump’s enemies list. While the indictment was ostensibly for allegedly lying when he testified before Congress in 2020, Trump despises Comey for his leadership during the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. That played a role in Trump sacking Comey as FBI director in 2017. \n\nThe Justice Department under Trump has made targeting the Comeys a family affair. In July, the DOJ fired Maurene Comey, the former director’s daughter, who worked as a prosecutor in Manhattan’s Southern District of New York.\n\nTrump’s beef with James is also rooted in investigations. As attorney general of New York, James launched a civil fraud investigation case against the Trump Organization, which ended in Judge Arthur Engoron ordering Trump to pay a $354 million fine along with interest. \n\nNo doubt, the Trump team will appeal this, though it will struggle to make a case in higher courts. But it will likely face the same problems it does in the lower courts.\n\nIt’s also just the latest humiliation for Trump world. \n\nLast week, Trump changed his mind on a vote to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein and gave Republicans his blessing to vote for it. This came after he had spent months calling it a “Democrat hoax.” In the end, all but one Republican voted to release the files. The Senate used unanimous consent to consider it passed as soon as it hit the upper chamber’s doorstep.\n\nThen on Friday evening, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene dropped a bomb on Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson when she announced she would resign from Congress in January. That came after Trump had unendorsed Greene.\n\nWhile Trump gloated about the resignation, it actually makes his and House Speaker Mike Johnson’s job much harder because, for the time being, they will have one less vote. \n\nAll of this should make Trump want to quit while he’s behind. But – in the words of the late Charlie Murphy on Chappelle’s Show – Trump is a habitual line-stepper. \n\nHence on Monday, the Pentagon announced that it would perform a “thorough review” of “serious allegations of misconduct” against Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.). The Pentagon said Kelly could be recalled for active duty “for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.”\n\nKelly is a popular senator in Arizona, a state Trump won. He also served in the U.S. Navy as a captain and as an astronaut — he flew four space missions and his identical twin brother Scott is also a retired NASA astronaut — before he ran for Senate in 2020 after his wife, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head in a political assassination attempt in 2011. Kamala Harris had him on her shortlist to be her running mate. \n\nBut he sent Trump into a rage last week when he – along with fellow Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Democratic Reps. Jason Crow, Chrissy Houlahan, Maggie Goodlander and Chris DeLuzio – released a video telling active duty U.S. servicemembers that they could refuse to obey illegal orders. \n\nTrump responded by calling the behavior seditious and said that it could be punishable by death. Republicans either outright defended Trump’s words or they pretended not to see it. \n\nThis case will likely fall apart in the same manner Trump’s attempts to prosecute Comey and James.\n\nAnd it will likely cause just as much backlash and make Kelly a hero among Democrats the same way that Gavin Newsom did after Trump sent the National Guard and Marines into Los Angeles without the governor’s permission. \n\nKelly for his part does not seem bowed by Trump’s attack on him. But it is just another example of how Trump is using the federal government to exact revenge against anyone he perceives as his political enemies and equating his enemies with the country’s enemies.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s enemies-list prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James were tossed by a federal judge on Monday, writes Eric Garcia.

The text chain also included Trump’s frenemy Rupert Murdoch, 94, and Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, 60.\n\nFollowing his father’s stepping down as chair of News Corp—Fox’s parent company—MAGA media criticized Lachlan as “woke,” despite the successor’s conservative-leaning speeches suggesting otherwise. \n\nLachlan’s texts were released as part of court exhibits in a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit, in which the global election technology company aims to prove that Fox Corp deliberately spread misinformation about its voting systems as part of the false claims that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. \n\nFox Corp says any allegations against Smartmatic came from the president, not the company, and that it was simply reporting a “newsworthy story.” Its bid to dismiss the lawsuit in January failed.\n\nFurther court exhibits show that viewership among Fox’s dedicated Republican base had been falling after the network became the first to call Arizona for presidential candidate Joe Biden during the 2020 election. \n\nEmails between Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan show that on Nov. 23, 2020, the father wrote, “Getting killed in audience numbers,” emphasizing the need for a discussion.

Now a familiar power broker has stepped forward: Former President Bill Clinton. The 42nd president has reportedly indicated which contender he believes offers Democrats their strongest shot at reclaiming the White House.\n\nAccording to a Democratic source speaking to Jonathan Martin of Politico, Clinton has been telling allies that California Governor Gavin Newsom is the one Democrat who looks ready to win the White House. \n\nThe former president, who interviewed Newsom at this fall’s Clinton Global Initiative, has told people how impressed he is by Newsom’s talent, a well-connected Democrat relayed to me recently. Clinton said he thought his dedicated student had what it takes to be elected president. -Politico\n\nMartin called Newsom the clear front-runner. “No Democrat has had a better two years than Gavin Newsom,” he writes. “And because of it, the California governor — a national figure since he was a 36-year-old boy mayor — has claimed a new title: front-runner.”\n\nPolling certain bears that out. The latest Atlas Intel poll had Newsom at 37%, a full 16 points ahead of the nearest opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose chances of winning the nomination are slim after her billion-dollar defeat in 2024.\n\nThough he’s made no official declaration, Newsom’s White House ambitions are no secret, and he’s been positioning himself to run for president for years now. He has been using social media and public appearances to position himself as a counterweight to President Trump. In September, he signed multiple laws aimed at restricting Trump’s immigration enforcement, including limits on officers’ access to schools and health facilities, requirements for officers to identify themselves, and bans on wearing face masks while on duty.\n\nNot all Democrats are convinced that Newsom is the future of the party, however. Earlier this month, Sen. John Fetterman called out Newsom’s “shift to the center” as pure political theater, and not representative of his true values.\n\nFetterman on Newsom Moving to Center:\n“Everyone’s going to go into the middle. But people [forget] that the Internet exists forever and all of the clips and all of the outlandish things that they’ve said or they’ve done ... ” pic.twitter.com/wToIvB7zJn\n— Trump2024_no_matter_what (@TexasTrump2024) November 2, 2025\n\n\"Everyone's going to go into the middle,\" Fetterman said. \"But people forgets [sic] that the internet exists and all of the clips and all of the outlandish things that they've said or they've done, that's going to have about 20 or 30 million dollars that can pound you for those things.\"\n\nNewsom has been trying to have it both ways on cultural issues. In 2023, he vetoed AB957, legislation that would have allowed state courts to weigh a parent’s affirmation of a child’s “gender identity” in custody disputes. His veto was widely seen as a calculated effort to appear more moderate on transgender issues. But three years earlier, he signed SB145, ending automatic sex offender registry requirements for certain adults who commit sexual acts with minors, which was deemed unfair to the LGBTQ community.\n\nFetterman made it clear he thinks Newsom and other Democrat contenders for the 2028 nomination won’t be able to hide from their radical records.\n\n\"They'll pander, scream to the base,” he said. “Then they're going to have to try to just walk it back, or now just pretend that all these things weren't said or done. That's how it works.

included selective editing of a speech made by Mr Trump before disorder at the US Capitol in 2021.\n\nMr Prescott told the Culture, Media and Sport Committee that there are “issues of denial” at the BBC and said “the management did not accept there was a problem” with the Panorama episode.\n\nThe memo highlighted concerns about the way clips of Mr Trump’s speech on January 6 2021 were spliced together so it appeared he had told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to “fight like hell”.\n\nMr Trump threatened the BBC with a billion-dollar litigation after the report was made public while US regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), launched an investigation.\n\nAsked if the documentary had harmed Mr Trump’s image, Mr Prescott said: “I should probably restrain myself a little bit, given that there is a potential legal action.\n\n“All I could say is, I can’t think of anything I agree with Donald Trump on.”\n\nPressed on the subject again, and asked if he agrees that Mr Trump’s reputation has been tarnished, he said: “Probably not”.\n\nThe former journalist also told the CMS Committee he did not know how his memo, which he had shared to the DCMS and Ofcom, was leaked to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nMr Prescott said: “At the most fundamental level I wrote that memo, let me be clear, because I am a strong supporter of the BBC.\n\n“The BBC employs talented professionals across all of its factual and non-factual programmes, and most people in this country, certainly myself included, might go as far as to say that they love the BBC.\n\n“What troubled me was that during my three years on the BBC Standards Committee, we kept seeing incipient problems which I thought were not being tackled properly, and indeed I thought the problems were getting worse.”\n\nMr Prescott added: “There was no ideology at play, no party politics.\n\n“If you take the example of the US elections report that came before the committee, if it had found that had been Kamala Harris misrepresented, not Donald Trump, I would have acted in exactly the same way.”\n\nHe continued: “I never envisaged events playing out in the way they did, I was hoping the concerns I had could, and would, be addressed privately in the first instance.”\n\nAsked if he thinks the BBC is institutionally biased, he said: “No I don’t… I do not think it’s institutionally biased.\n\n“Let’s be very clear.\n\n“Tons of stuff that that the BBC does is world class, both factual programming and non-factual programming.”\n\nThe former journalist spoke of “incipient problems” with “systemic causes” at the corporation and said: “There’s real work that needs to be done at the BBC.”\n\nAlso on Monday, BBC board member Sir Robbie Gibb told MPs the idea he led a “a broad-level orchestrated coup” at the corporation is “complete nonsense”.\n\nIt comes following the resignation of BBC director-general Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness and amid criticism that the background of the non-executive board member, who was the director of communications for Theresa May when she was in Downing Street, could undermine the corporation’s independence and impartiality.\n\nAfter Mr Prescott’s report, BBC chairman Samir Shah apologised on behalf of the BBC over an “error of judgment” and accepted the editing of the 2024 documentary gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action”.\n\nDespite the apology, Mr Trump said he would proceed with legal action for “anywhere between one billion dollars (£759.8 million) and five billion dollars (£3.79 billion)”.\n\nBBC News reported that the broadcaster had set out five main arguments in a letter to Mr Trump’s legal team as to why it did not believe there was a basis for a defamation claim.\n\nMr Prescott told MPs Mr Davie did a “first-rate job” as director-general but said he had a “blind spot” toward editorial failings.\n\nThe job position for director-general has now gone live on the BBC Careers website.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-reputation-probably-not-180012919.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TrfVJeJW4Wage7iCdFAiaQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_uk_120/4f574b8342d4a6ace9d6a37f6563dc32","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 21:23:19","author":"Hannah Roberts, Pa Senior Entertainment Reporter","authors":["Hannah Roberts, Pa Senior Entertainment Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":381867084,"title":"Are Other Republican Lawmakers on the Way Out?","text":"It’s possible that other Republican lawmakers might follow Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-GA) lead and resign amid conflicts with President Donald Trump.\n\nGreene announced on Friday that she would be stepping down from her position in early January. She cited several issues influencing her decision, including Trump’s comments about her, the lack of action in Congress, and the overall feeling that Republicans in Washington, D.C. do not wish to advance the America First agenda.\n\nMy message to Georgia’s 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1— Marjorie Taylor Greene 🇺🇸 (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025\n\nPunchbowl News published a report about Greene’s departure that suggested other GOP lawmakers had reached out and told the news outlet they are considering resigning as well.\n\nIn fact, a few other GOP members messaged us over the weekend saying that they, too, are considering retiring in the middle of the term.Here’s one particularly exercised senior House Republican:“This entire White House team has treated ALL members like garbage. ALL. And Mike Johnson has let it happen because he wanted it to happen. That is the sentiment of nearly all — appropriators, authorizers, hawks, doves, rank and file. The arrogance of this White House team is off putting to members who are run roughshod and threatened. They don’t even allow little wins like announcing small grants or even responding from agencies. Not even the high profile, the regular rank and file random members are more upset than ever. Members know they are going into the minority after the midterms.“More explosive early resignations are coming. It’s a tinder box. Morale has never been lower. Mike Johnson will be stripped of his gavel and they will lose the majority before this term is out.”Of course, Johnson’s team points out they have impossibly small margins and believe they are doing what they can with the hand they were dealt.But the idea that Republicans could lose their majority this Congress is no longer far-fetched. If Johnson were to lose another House Republican in the middle of this term to retirement, death or illness, there’s a decent chance that the GOP can end up in the minority at some point in 2026.\n\nPunchbowl News did not include the names of Republicans considering an exit, so this should be taken with a grain of salt. After all, it could simply be wishful thinking.\n\nHowever, if other Republican lawmakers decide to leave their positions over the issues with Trump, it could place the GOP in a precarious position leading up to the next midterm elections. As the report noted, Republicans have six more seats than Democrats. But if they lose even half of this, the upcoming elections could threaten their majority.\n\nThe math. Republicans have 219 seats and Democrats have 213. There’s a special election in Tennessee on Dec. 2 to fill former Rep. Mark Green’s (R-Tenn.) seat. Democrats and Republicans are pouring piles of money into that district, which Trump won by more than 20 points.If Republicans win, their margin will remain the same after MTG’s retirement.But Democrats will gain a seat in Houston at the end of January when voters choose the late Rep. Sylvester Turner’s (D-Texas) replacement. And on April 16, New Jersey voters will choose Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s replacement. That’s a seat that former Vice President Kamala Harris won by nine percentage points in 2024.Let’s say Democrats are able to steal the Tennessee seat based on subpar GOP turnout — unlikely but possible — Johnson would have 218 members to Democrats’ 214. Texas and New Jersey would bring Democrats to 216. If any members retire or fall ill, Johnson would be sunk.House retirements and resignations are common after holidays. How appealing is it to return to the Capitol when the House spends most of its time voting on censure resolutions or meaningless messaging bills?\n\nIf other Republican lawmakers decide to call it quits, it would further fuel speculation about the GOP's future. It would highlight the growing rift on the right.\n\nWhile most GOP lawmakers have stood with Trump during his second term, some, like Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), have clashed with him on several occasions. Depending on how things shake out, it would not be surprising to see other GOP lawmakers begin pushing back as well.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Seth Moulton of Massachusetts made a surprising announcement last month: The moderate Democrat said he would no longer accept donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\nSpurning AIPAC was not, on its face, shocking. In the more than two years since Israel’s onslaught in Gaza began, numerous members of Congress have pledged not to accept money from the lobby, all from the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But for Moulton, who leans heavily on his background as a Marine who served multiple tours in Iraq, to join that cohort was surprising. Now gearing up for a potentially bruising primary as he challenges progressive stalwart Ed Markey for his Senate seat, Moulton apparently decided that turning his back on AIPAC and its allies was more politically advantageous than costly.\n\nThe growing list of members of Congress rejecting funding from AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups marks a stark turnaround from the primacy those organizations recently held in the halls of power.\n\nFor decades, AIPAC focused entirely on lobbying members of Congress and did not directly support individual candidates. That changed in 2021, when AIPAC launched several Political Action Committees (PACs) expressly designed to help pro-Israel candidates win their races. These PACs — the awkwardly named AIPAC PAC and the AIPAC-affiliated Super PAC, United Democracy Project — quickly became major players in the national political scene. They were soon joined by other pro-Israel PACs, most prominently Democratic Majority for Israel, whose leadership was closely aligned with AIPAC.\n\nIn 2022, these groups spent nearly $60 million in direct support or on behalf of candidates, placing AIPAC and its affiliates among the top 10 spenders that cycle. Among their targets was Michigan Rep. Andy Levin, a Jewish member of Congress and president of his synagogue. After 2020 redistricting that merged Levin’s district with that of another Democrat, Haley Stevens, the two faced off in the Democratic primary. AIPAC and its allies, apparently upset over Levin’s critique of Israel’s illegal annexation of Palestinian territory, poured more than $4 million into backing Stevens, who won the nomination handily.\n\nIn 2024, AIPAC’s reach broadened further. In the first major election cycle after October 7, AIPAC targeted some of Israel’s harshest critics in Congress, spending heavily to unseat progressives like Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman. It spent a “record-shattering” $14.5 million to support George Latimer against Bowman, and another $8.5 million in St. Louis in support of Wesley Bell against Bush. Both Bowman and Bush were defeated. (The AIPAC watchdog site Track AIPAC rates Bell and Latimer as the top all-time recipients of AIPAC donations.)\n\nBy the end of the primary season, progressives and critics of Israel’s Gaza policy were publicly despairing. Bernie Sanders warned that AIPAC’s success would embolden the lobby to suppress critical voices wherever it found them.\n\nThen, something shifted. As Israel’s assault ground on, public sentiment on Israel-Palestine began to fracture. Surveys in mid-2024 showed clear divides in American opinion, with younger people and Democrats increasingly saying the Biden administration was too favorable toward Israel. Within the Democratic Party, these splits were even sharper: Nearly 50 percent of Democrats aged 18–29 said they sympathized more with Palestinians, compared with only 17 percent of those over 65.\n\nThese intraparty tensions were amplified by the Uncommitted movement, which urged Democratic voters in key states to select “uncommitted” during the party’s primary to protest the administration’s stance. In swing-state Michigan, the movement garnered more than 100,000 votes. Rifts deepened further when Democratic National Convention organizers denied speaking time to Ruwa Romman, a Palestinian-American Georgia House Representative recommended by the movement.\n\nMeanwhile, coalitions like Reject AIPAC pressed members of Congress to declare they would refuse AIPAC’s funding. By late 2024, with Kamala Harris facing Donald Trump in the general election, the Biden administration’s unqualified support for Israel had become a top issue. Harris, unwilling or unable to distance herself from Biden’s legacy, gave voters little reason to expect a shift in policy.\n\nUltimately, Harris hemorrhaged support among constituencies crucial to Biden’s 2020 win. Her backing among voters aged 18 to 49 dropped by 10 points from Biden’s 17-point margin in 2020. A pre-election analysis also showed that her support among Muslim voters lagged far behind Biden’s. In swing states like Michigan — where Harris lost by just over 80,000 votes — the significance of the more than 100,000 Uncommitted primary voters in that state was impossible to ignore. While the Uncommitted movement had aimed to serve as a warning to Democrats about the electoral liabilities of its Gaza policy via mounting a protest in the Democratic primaries, it had now become a grim predictor of Democrats’ weakness in the general election.\n\nNow, still reeling from their 2024 wipeout, and with Democratic support for Israel continuing to crater through 2025, the party finds itself at a crossroads. Many Democrats have decided that the electoral risks of taking AIPAC money now outweigh the benefits.\n\nMoulton is just one striking example of how quickly the tide is turning. Recently, former Missouri Rep. Cori Bush announced she would run again for her old seat, directly challenging the AIPAC-backed candidate Bell who unseated her last year. That Bush is mounting a comeback so quickly underscores how rapidly Bell’s close ties to the pro-Israel lobby have shifted from a strength to a liability.\n\nThis pattern is emerging elsewhere as well. In New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayorship thanks in part to his support for Palestinian rights, progressives are eyeing multiple congressional seats — including that of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — for primary challenges. Many of the representatives currently holding these seats — including Jeffries, Dan Goldman, and Ritchie Torres — are well-known for their close ties to the pro-Israel lobby. Torres, for example, has sponsored bills in Congress that lean heavily into AIPAC-promoted narratives about antisemitism on college campuses. He has also gained a reputation as one of the most ardent defender of Israel’s actions in Gaza on social media. Goldman, meanwhile, has been one of the most unwavering voices in supporting Israel’s “right to defend itself.”\n\nProgressives are betting that these affiliations, plus general outrage with mainstream Democrats’ feeble response to the Trump administration, will propel progressive challengers to victory.\n\nWith such a dramatic swing of the pendulum, the ball now appears to be back in AIPAC’s court. After funding the two most expensive Democratic primaries in history in 2024, AIPAC and its allies are likely to enter the 2026 cycle with ample resources. Whether the same scorched-earth spending strategy remains politically viable is unclear. The lobby will undoubtedly work to defend its closest allies and beat back challengers like Bush and the New York progressives. But it will have to consider how visibly it operates. Its reputation took another hit after Zohran Mamdani defeated Andrew Cuomo — twice — despite Cuomo’s vocal backing from pro-Israel billionaires and donors tied to Donald Trump, many of whom tried to make Mamdani’s criticism of Israel a central campaign issue.\n\nThis does not, of course, mean that AIPAC will relent in its quest to influence electoral outcomes within the Democratic primary. It does mean, however, that it may have to go to lengths to either obscure or downplay its role in campaign contributions and independent expenditures on behalf of candidates.\n\nAIPAC and its affiliates have long obscured their actual gripes with candidates they oppose in political advertising — their stances on Israel — instead focusing on those candidates’ stances on controversial domestic policies. They may push this trend further in coming cycles, making it harder for the average voter to determine when they’re subjected to messaging from the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nWhether this will be an effective adjustment in its strategy remains to be seen. As the political landscape continues to shift, the coming cycles may determine whether AIPAC can retain its once-unassailable influence — or whether rising skepticism of U.S. support for Israel signals a lasting realignment among Democrats.","summary":"Backing AIPAC may now be a political liability for candidates facing progressive challengers in Democratic primaries.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/is-the-tide-starting-to-turn-against-aipac/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2078448808.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 20:38:47","author":"Sam Rosenthal","authors":["Sam Rosenthal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":381855890,"title":"This MAGA activist claims Republicans are ‘fleeing’ N.J. Here’s what the numbers actually say","text":"Conservative activist Scott Presler on Monday claimed that Republicans are abandoning New Jersey in response to Democrat Mikie Sherrill’s win in the Nov. 4 gubernatorial election. \n\nRepublicans are “fleeing New Jersey for Pennsylvania,” Presler said in a post on X. He included a screenshot from the Instagram account of a couple who had recently celebrated moving out of New Jersey “forever” to resettle in neighboring Pennsylvania. \n\nPresler, who founded the Early Vote Action PAC, did not provide any data to support his claim of a Republican exodus from New Jersey. \n\n“I tried to help you, New Jersey,” Presler posted on X. “Maybe all of the people fleeing NJ & NY will make Pennsylvania a red Commonwealth.” \n\nDemocrats maintain a sizable advantage in New Jersey, accounting for more than 38% of all registered voters as of Oct. 1. Republicans made up roughly 25% of the electorate.\n\nBut the number of registered Republicans in New Jersey has surged in recent years, contradicting Presler’s narrative about a conservative withdrawal. \n\nThe GOP added nearly 164,000 voters over the last four years, according to the latest data released by the state Division of Elections. Democrats lost more than 51,000 voters during that same span. \n\nPresident Donald Trump lost the state to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by just six percentage points in 2024. That was the closest a Republican has come to winning in New Jersey since 1992, when George H. W. Bush came within two points of Bill Clinton. \n\nPresler, who went door to door to help increase Republican voter registration in New Jersey, viewed those developments as positive indicators for GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli heading into Election Day. \n\n“Democrats are finally realizing Jack is poised to become the next governor,” Presler told the Daily Wire on Oct. 29, six days before the election. “New Jersey is 100% in play.”\n\nDespite Trump’s endorsement and a significant uptick in registered Republicans, Ciattarelli was soundly defeated by Sherrill. \n\nEvery New Jersey county voted more Democratic than in the 2024 presidential election, and five counties that voted for Trump flipped blue. That leftward shift lifted Sherrill to a resounding 14-point victory. \n\nExit polls underscored the prominent role Trump played in the contest. \n\nAccording to independent research firm SSRS, 41% of New Jersey respondents said their vote was at least partly motivated by their opposition to Trump. Of that group, 97% voted for Sherrill.","summary":"While Scott Presler points to a single Instagram post as evidence, state records show Republicans have added nearly 164,000 voters over the past four years.","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/11/this-maga-influencer-claims-republicans-are-fleeing-nj-heres-what-the-numbers-actually-say.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/64NQYOMD3NA5LFJF2VLZUFNUNM.JPG?auth=22695c0dc82dfb330eb02341e426b8d4c1d640520d6690da2e91d6a22d264455&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 20:01:40","author":"Nick Moyle","authors":["Nick Moyle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":381860928,"title":"Watch: First Lady Melania Trump welcomes the White House Christmas tree","text":"Skip to content\n\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nIsrael-Gaza War\n\nWar in Ukraine\n\nUS & Canada\n\nUK Politics\n\nN.

Sure the Beeb likes to do the news, but there is nothing it likes more than reporting on itself. The holy grail of its output. There are whole departments within the Beeb dedicated to making TV and radio programmes about other BBC TV and radio programmes.\n\nThere can be no other organisation that subjects itself to quite so much self-analysis. Only a psychotherapist would be able to fully determine whether it is solipsism or self-hatred. Maybe both.

This was peak BBC. It’s a wonder they didn’t suspend all its afternoon programming and screen the sessions in their entirety. This was bigger than a state funeral.\n\nFirst in the hot seat was Prescott. No one was more mortified at the damage his memo had done than Mike himself.

He was just a good old centrist dad. Come to think of it, he didn’t even really understand how this politics thing worked. Even though he had been the political editor of the Sunday Times for four years from 1997 to 2001. Now all he wanted was the quiet life.\n\nPoor old Mike. There he had been minding his own business, sending off a 19-page memo never anticipating it would precipitate some high-level resignations. It had just been a small everyday thing. Just a few problems. Come to think of it, they weren’t even really problems, he said.\n\nRather they were incipient problems. Minor criticisms that had the potential to develop into problems. They were so small, they were hardly detectable to the naked eye. It was only because he loved the BBC so much that he felt it necessary to raise them. And even then he had expected them to be dealt with quietly. Behind closed doors.\n\nSo all he had done was raise the matter with the BBC board, Ofcom and the culture committee. And then all of a sudden it had appeared in the Daily Telegraph. No one had been more surprised than him.\n\nHe had no idea how this could have possibly have happened. Maybe the Telegraph employed mind readers. For someone in the eye of a storm, he seemed remarkably incurious. Naive even. And it wasn’t as if he had had 10 years working at the Sunday Times to give him some insight into how these leak thingies worked.\n\nYou could have knocked Mike down with a feather. Just imagine a critical memo falling into the hands of a media organisation that actively wished the BBC harm. Except Mike couldn’t imagine this because he had an imagination bypass. He was just an ingenu.\n\nHe had no idea why the Telegraph had focused on the culture wars of Trump, Gaza and gender. If it had been left to him he would have splashed on an incorrect story about people from ethnic minorities paying more for their insurance. Even though the BBC had acted on that.\n\nThe rest of the session was just more of the same. Mike insisting that he was doing the BBC a favour by holding them to far higher standards than he had ever met himself as a journalist. He merely wanted them to go the extra mile in the pursuit of impartiality. Why hadn’t the BBC broadcast a documentary on Kamala Harris inciting violence? Even if she hadn’t. That’s what he expected. He wanted the BBC to be the best version of itself possible.\n\nAs for how he got the job at the BBC, Mike was also guilty of the same level of self reflection as the BBC. As far as he was concerned, it was merely his own brilliance. He had filled in an application and the panel had no choice but to appoint him. And it certainly had nothing to do with the fact that he was friends with Gibb. Because, look, when you reach Mike’s status in life you can’t help but know everyone important. That’s merely how the establishment works.\n\nCome the second session, Shah was a picture of misery. Chastising himself repeatedly as he apologised over and over again while trying to muddy the waters. It’s tough being expected to reach 100% purity. A world where mistakes cannot be tolerated.\n\nRobbie Gibb – make that Sir Robbie Gibb: he was knighted for his brilliance as Theresa May’s communication director, some people fail upwards – was the master of deflection. Nothing was, or ever has been, his fault. Other people had made errors but never him.\n\nHe, too, bowed down before the majesty of the Beeb. Wishing it only well. But he had been saddened that some people had not been able to leave their politics – their leftwing politics – at the door. He might be a Tory but when it came to the BBC he was always impartial. He too was mystified that the memo got leaked to the Telegraph.\n\nThere had been no boardroom takeover of the BBC by the right. It was just the right were the only people who could be trusted to run the corporation. Would he be resigning? Heaven no. Things were all going ever so well. As the session ended you couldn’t help wondering if it had been the wrong people who had lost their jobs.","summary":"Chair Samir Shah is a picture of misery before MPs while Robbie Gibb proves the master of deflection \n\nThis was the BBC in its happiest of happy places. Sure the Beeb likes to do the news, but there is nothing it likes more than reporting on itself. The holy grail of its output. There are whole departments within the Beeb dedicated to making TV and radio programmes about other BBC TV and radio programmes.\n\nThere can be no other organisation that subjects itself to quite so much self-analysis. Only a psychotherapist would be able to fully determine whether it is solipsism or self-hatred. Maybe both. So much so that it goes out of its way to recruit people whose sole job is to criticise it.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/24/bbc-in-its-happiest-place-inflicting-latest-round-of-self-harm","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed9b12750b026066ba9543878867ff8bb4968111/553_0_3894_3116/master/3894.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 19:46:43","author":"John Crace","authors":["John Crace"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":381830956,"title":"Scott Bessent has Thanksgiving message for inflation-weary Americans","text":"American voters had had enough after four years of consistent Covid-induced inflation, sweeping the Democratic Party out of the White House and out of control in the Senate in 2024. \n\nThe economy was the most important issue for voters heading into the November vote.

Kamala Harris \n\nOnly Presidents Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, and Richard Nixon lost their first presidential general elections before going on to win their second, so former Vice President Kamala Harris already faces an uphill climb should she choose to run again in 2028. But what little hope she did have quickly evaporated with her roundly mocked book tour. Vapid, self-serving, and bereft of any positive vision for the country, Harris’s book only reminded voters of why she failed to win a single contest in the 2020 primary. She may be a fundraising powerhouse for years to come, but her presidential aspirations are over.\n\n9. JB Pritzker\n\nThe best thing Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) has going for him is that he is rich. He is worth somewhere around $4 billion, made mostly from hospitality investments, not too unlike President Donald Trump. Pritzker poured more than $171 million into his 2018 gubernatorial election, and his ability to light his money on fire will be his biggest asset should he run for president in 2028. His biggest liabilities are that he is fat, white, and male, the first of which is a liability in any election, and the last two are hindrances in a Democratic Party primary. There is nothing moderate or business-friendly about his record. It is straight progressive party-line thinking: free healthcare for illegal immigrants, higher spending on everything, and higher taxes. Most people on this list support the same policies. There is nothing unique about his policy profile. He’ll last as long as he keeps opening his checkbook, but he won’t win anything.\n\n8. Pete Buttigieg \n\nThe Democratic Party is increasingly controlled by rich, single white women, and if this were the only demographic that voted in Democratic Party primaries, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg would win in a landslide. Liberal white women love Buttigieg like he was their own gay son or brother. Minority voters? Not so much. An Emerson College poll taken in June that had Buttigieg leading every other candidate in the field, albeit at just 16, also had him at 0% — that’s right: zero — among black voters. You simply can’t win a Democratic Party presidential primary with no support from the black community.\n\n7. Chris Murphy\n\nFresh off separating from the mother of his two children, Sen. Chris Murphy’s (D-CT) greatest asset is his media-savvy new girlfriend, who, at 10 years his junior, brings experience as former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign digital producer. Always quick with a new straight-to-camera TikTok reaction to the latest outrage of the day, Murphy has positioned himself as a leader of the Trump Resistance. Despite making noises about Democrats needing an agenda that speaks directly to young men, Murphy has failed to offer anything of substance that wasn’t already part of former President Joe Biden’s failed Build Back Better agenda. Murphy does not yet have the name recognition to register in the 2028 primary polling, but his social media success could net him the donor support needed to make the debate stage.\n\n6. Andy Beshear\n\nGov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) is exactly the type of centrist Democratic governor with a proven ability to win elections in red states that the Democratic Party needs to win back the White House. And that is exactly why he won’t win. He’s too white, too male, and far too centrist. Beshear has never tried to give illegal immigrants healthcare, force Kentuckians into electric cars, or open government-run grocery stores. As governor of a coal-producing and consuming state, he’s also prioritized jobs and growth over fanciful carbon reduction targets. Beshear simply has not done enough to establish himself as an opponent of Trump to make a significant splash in the primaries, which is why he hasn’t risen above 3% in any poll.\n\n5. Josh Shapiro\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) not only has a centrist reputation like Beshear, but he won the swing state of Pennsylvania by a commanding 22-point margin and gained national recognition for his impressive handling of the Interstate 95 bridge collapse in Philadelphia. In an era where voters from both parties are desperate for politicians to build things, Shapiro proved it could be done, turning what was first estimated to be a monthslong project into just 12 days. But like Beshear, Shapiro is out of touch with the highly motivated progressive wing of the party that sees him as far too conservative on climate, criminal justice, and healthcare. And then there is Shapiro’s support for Israel, an issue which has rapidly become a litmus test among Democratic Party primary voters, and Shapiro is on the wrong side of it.\n\n4. Ruben Gallego\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) has the ideal biography for a Democratic presidential nominee. The son of immigrants, Gallego grew up poor in Chicago, raised by a single mother. Not only was he the first in his family to go to college, but he is also a Marine who served in Iraq. He has impeccable progressive credentials, joining the Congressional Progressive Caucus upon entering Congress in 2015 and co-sponsoring the Medicare for All Act and the “People’s Budget.” The only thing he has moderated on is immigration, voting for the Laken Riley Act and producing a comprehensive immigration plan that the Wall Street Journal editorial board would love. He outperformed Harris by 8 points in Arizona, proving he can win independent and Republican votes in a swing state. He is young, 46, but that will be an asset for any Democrat in 2028, as the party is looking for fresh faces after the geriatric failure of Biden. He might not run, but recent trips to Iowa and Pennsylvania show he is at least thinking about it. With no other Hispanic male in the race, Gallego would be a formidable candidate.\n\n3. Wes Moore \n\nA Rhodes Scholar, Afghanistan combat veteran, and the nation’s only black governor, Gov. Wes Moore’s (D-MD) biography is every bit as compelling as Gallego’s, and he is just as young. Unlike Gallego, Moore has always sold himself as more of a centrist than a committed progressive. He has described himself as a “social moderate and strong fiscal conservative” and has declined to endorse the Progressive Caucus’s Medicare for All bill. He has successfully raised taxes by over $1.6 billion on Maryland residents, however, and has increased spending on education, child care, and abortion. He also signed the Trans Health Equity Act, mandating that Medicaid cover hormone therapy, puberty blockers, and sex change surgeries. Moore denies he is running in 2028, but he has traveled to South Carolina, where, as the only black candidate in the field, he would have a distinct advantage.\n\n2. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nAt 39, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is the youngest candidate on this list by almost a decade and one of the only women. She has an innate understanding and mastery of social media that is simply unmatched in the party. When a who’s who of Democratic figures made ads for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D-CA) Proposition 50 gerrymandering plan, her video outperformed everyone, including both Newsom and Obama. She already has perhaps the largest national digital fundraising base in the Democratic Party, and her staff is stocked with veterans from Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-VT) presidential campaigns. And unlike most of her rivals, she begins the race with a unified, enthusiastic progressive base that gives her an instant floor of national support no other Democrat can match.\n\n1. Gavin Newsom\n\nIt is early, but Newsom is simply the undisputed front-runner to be the 2028 Democratic Party presidential nominee. Outside of one recent outlier, Newsom holds a commanding lead over his probable rivals in all recent polls, and he is the unquestioned leader of the Democratic Party in the nation’s largest state. And unlike everyone else on the list, it is clear Newsom wants the job and fully intends to run in 2028. He has traveled to all the early presidential primary states for listening tours and constantly asserts himself into national conversations, taking on not just Trump, but also Vice President JD Vance and Govs. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and Greg Abbott (R-TX). Newsom is not as young as Ocasio-Cortez or Moore, but at 58, he is decades younger than Biden, and while he is not as natural a social media talent as Ocasio-Cortez, he still gets it. Unlike Gallego, Shapiro, and Beshear, Newsom has never needed to win a Republican vote in his life, and he has a left-wing governing record to prove it. But Newsom does not need any Republican votes to win the Democratic nomination. He only needs to consolidate Democrats, and he already starts with more of them than anyone else. With unmatched name recognition, a massive donor network, a polished national media presence, and the implicit backing of the party’s most powerful coastal institutions, Newsom begins this race not just as a contender, but as the prohibitive favorite.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

‘probably’ not tarnished by Panorama edit, MPs told","text":"The reputation of US president Donald Trump has “probably not” been tarnished by a Panorama edit that spliced together parts of one of his speeches, the author of a leaked memo raising concerns has said.\n\nMichael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC’s editorial standards committee, faced questions from MPs on Monday after he raised concerns that Trump: A Second Chance? included selective editing of a speech made by Mr Trump before disorder at the US Capitol in 2021.\n\nMr Prescott told the Culture, Media and Sport Committee that there are “issues of denial” at the BBC and said “the management did not accept there was a problem” with the Panorama episode.\n\nThe memo highlighted concerns about the way clips of Mr Trump’s speech on January 6 2021 were spliced together so it appeared he had told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to “fight like hell”.\n\nMr Trump threatened the BBC with a billion-dollar litigation after the report was made public while US regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), launched an investigation.\n\nAsked if the documentary had harmed Mr

The Real Time host argued that ‘ultimatums don’t make people rethink their politics,’ but make them ‘rethink you.’ (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n The comments follow McNearney’s appearance on the We Can Do Hard Things podcast earlier this month, where she spoke about her family members being ‘deliberately misinformed every day.’ McNearney, who is also a co–head writer and executive producer of her husband’s late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, added that his recent public clashes with the president have made family life more complicated. (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n McNearney said on the podcast: ‘To me, them voting for Trump is them not voting for my husband and me and our family.’ Kimmel, along with a string of other celebrities, was previously outspoken about his support for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the presidential race last year. When it was looking like Trump may come out victorious, he told MSNBC host Joe Scarborough: ‘I was telling my wife, I don’t feel like I’m mentally prepared for the possibility of a loss. I’m not ready. I have to get there where I’m ready for either scenario.’ (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n He continued: ‘You’re going to have to be up the next morning talking about what happened or what didn’t happen and what message do you want to send to people who watch the show. Most of my shows aren’t important. That one seems a little bit more important than others because I do have a lot of people kind of asking me what I think and going along with what I think, and it’s a big responsibility.’ (Picture: AP)\n\n Acknowledging on the podcast that some of her familial relationships have broken down since, McNearney revealed that before the election she drew up a list of ’10 reasons’ why they shouldn’t support Trump. ‘I’ve sent many emails to family saying, “I’m begging you. Here’s the 10 reasons not to vote for this guy. Please don’t,”‘ she said. (Picture: Yuri Gripas/UPI/Shutterstock)\n\n McNearney added that she was ignored by 90% of her family members and received ‘truly insane responses’ from some. ‘It’s definitely caused a strain,’ she admitted. As for Maher, he said: ‘She [McNearney] says she’s lost relationships with relatives because she wrote them an email before the election with 10 reasons why they shouldn’t vote for Trump, and some still didn’t obey.’ (Picture: JC Olivera/Variety via Getty Images)\n\n While Maher said that while he could think of ‘100 reasons’ not to vote for Trump, he would never use opposing political views as an ultimatum. He continued: ‘Ultimatums don’t make people rethink their politics. They make them rethink you.’ (Picture: Noam Galai/Getty Images)\n\n Speaking on the podcast, McNearney admitted that the aftermath has led to her becoming closer with some of her relatives who are more aligned with her and her family’s views. She said: ‘I’ve definitely pulled in closer with the family that I feel more aligned with. Part of me goes, “Don’t let politics get in the way.” But to me, this isn’t politics. It’s truly values. And we’re not aligned anymore.’ (Picture: Randy Holmes/Disney via Getty Images)\n\n This comes after Jimmy Kimmel took another swipe at Donald Trump on his late-night show. The 58-year-old talk show host – whose programme was briefly pulled off air in September following comments made about Charlie Kirk, the American right-wing political activist who was assassinated that month – opened his show last week with a message for ‘the angry orange’ after the US leader called for him to be fired once again. (Picture: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\n During his monologue, Kimmel said: ‘Mr. President, I admire your tenacity. If you’re watching tonight, which I presume you are, how about this: I’ll go when you go, OK? We’ll be a team. Let’s ride off into the sunset together like Butch Cassidy and the Suntan Kid. And until then, if I may borrow a phrase from you: Quiet, piggy.’ (Picture: Jimmy Kimmel Live)\n\n For those unaware, Kimmel was referencing recent footage which showed Trump call a journalist ‘piggy,’ after she asked the President about the Epstein files. The reporter said: ‘If there’s nothing incriminating in the files, then why,’ before Trump cut her off and hurled out the insult.","summary":"","url":"https://metro.co.uk/galleries/bill-maher-calls-out-jimmy-kimmels-wife-over-trump-ultimatum-24793263/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2202464699-3112.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 16:31:00","author":"Sophie-May Williams","authors":["Sophie-May Williams"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":381785430,"title":"Mid-Day Digest","text":"THE FOUNDATION\n\n“Nothing so strongly impels a man to regard the interest of his constituents, as the certainty of returning to the general mass of the people, from whence he was taken, where he must participate in their burdens.” —George Mason (1788)\n\nIN TODAY’S DIGEST\n\nExecutive News Summary\nFeatured Analysis: MTG Resigns After Spat With Trump\nMore Analysis\nBest of Right Opinion\nBest of Videos\n\nToday’s Meme\n\nEXECUTIVE NEWS SUMMARY\n\nThe Editors\n\nDOGE is done? The Department of Government Efficiency no longer exists as an independent department with centralized leadership. However, U.S. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor insists that this does not constitute the end of DOGE as a project, saying, “The principles of DOGE remain alive and well: deregulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse.” Kupor’s position is supported by the fact that the DOGE X account posted on Sunday, with an update on 78 contracts representing $335 million in savings identified and cut over the last nine days. Former DOGE employees have now been embedded in other departments, such as Zachary Terrell, the new CTO of HHS, and Joe Gebbia, who heads the newly established National Design Studio intended to improve the design of government websites. DOGE is technically no more, but taxpayers can rest easy knowing wasteful spending is still being found and cut.\nFBI says “no cover-up here” over no Crooks motive: Following a months-long investigation into the failed assassination attempt against Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, by 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, the FBI has concluded that Crooks acted alone. “We have reviewed this case over and over, looked into every nugget. We have spoken to the families, the president — there is no cover-up here,” FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino explained on Friday. “There is no motive for it, there is no reason for it.” FBI Director Kash Patel echoed Bongino, noting that Trump was “satisfied with the results and where we left it.” The case is now classified as “pending, inactive.” Should any possible new credible information come to light, it will be investigated. This announcement comes roughly a week after reports surfaced alleging that Crooks’s digital footprint revealed he used “they/them” pronouns and engaged in “furry” fantasies online.\n100 House Dems vote for socialism: With NYC Socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani visiting President Trump at the White House on Friday, congressional Republicans decided to officially express their opposition to socialism. They introduced a resolution that amounts to little more than a virtue signal condemning socialism. While the resolution easily passed, it exposed the fact that nearly half of House Democrats, 96 of them, refused to condemn socialism. This comes as little surprise given the party’s increasing embrace of radical leftism. For years, the Democrats have peddled soft socialism, and now more of them are willing to embrace this inherently anti-American, freedom-robbing ideology in the open.\n\nSupreme Court allows use of new TX congressional map: Late Friday, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued an order temporarily restoring Texas’s new congressional map, which favors Republicans, in response to an emergency appeal from state officials after the Fifth Circuit Court ruled the map unconstitutional. The lower court had ordered the state to revert to its older map, which Gov. Greg Abbott argued was a decision that came “far too late in the day.” As Texas Solicitor General William Peterson noted, “The chaos caused by such an injunction is obvious: campaigning had already begun, candidates had already gathered signatures and filed applications to appear on the ballot under the 2025 map, and early voting for the March 3, 2026, primary was only 91 days away.” Alito set a 5:00 p.m. Monday deadline for those suing to block the new map to file a response.\nX adds location feature, leaving political shills in shambles: The social media platform X unveiled a new feature this weekend that users had been wanting for months — a way to identify an account’s national origin. As expected, several large “MAGA” accounts were identified as foreign grifters either attempting to manipulate the movement or cash in on clicks. @1776General was posting from Turkey, and @AmericanVoice__ was posting from Southeast Asia. Both deleted their accounts after exposure. Leftists were quick to celebrate the “fall of MAGA,” but it’s hardly a one-sided phenomenon. “Gaza-based journalist” @AbujomaaGaza is based in Poland, @xIsraelExposedx is based in Saudi Arabia, and @CounterAIPAC is based in Egypt. As this feature becomes fine-tuned, it will strike a fatal blow to international accounts manipulating politics under a mask of patriotism.\nJoyless Behar defames Trump: President Trump is a litigious man, having brought multiple defamation suits just this year. Apparently, the harridans of “The View” forgot that. The Epstein files were once again a source of much talk last week, when legislation to release more information on the investigation was signed into law. Joy Behar jumped on the topic Thursday to defame Trump: “But isn’t it obvious he was — that Trump was involved with Epstein?” Perhaps Behar isn’t aware that Trump was one of the few celebrities to break ties with Epstein before the allegations against him became well-known. Of course, anyone paying attention realizes that if Trump were implicated in the investigation, the Biden administration would’ve worked overtime to leak that information. Her comments were particularly bizarre given that Trump signed the Epstein legislation the night before.\nTrump wants Somalis out: President Trump has revoked Temporary Protected Status for the 300,000 Somalis in the country. This announcement follows the recently exposed scam perpetrated by Somalis on the state-run insurance program. Christopher F. Rufo summarized, “Somalis in Minneapolis opened fake autism treatment centers, secured fraudulent autism diagnoses, stole hundreds of millions of dollars from taxpayers, and gave kickbacks of $300 to $1500 per month to parents who participated in the scheme.” They also sent millions back to Somalia to the coffers of an al-Qaida-linked terrorist organization. The problem is that many of them, like Rep. Ilhan Omar, are already citizens or have been granted green cards. While we may not be able to deport all of them, citizens who defraud the government and support terrorist organizations can be charged with crimes and sent to jail. Whether or not Gov. Tim Walz’s corrupt state will do so is another matter.\n\nJudge blocks IRS from sharing data with ICE: On Friday, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the IRS engaged in “unlawful conduct” in sharing immigrant taxpayer information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Plaintiffs have shown that the IRS’s implementation of the Address-Sharing Policy was arbitrary and capricious because the IRS failed to recognize that it was departing from its prior policy of strict confidentiality, failed to consider the reliance interests that were engendered by its prior policy of strict confidentiality, and failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the new policy,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. She further ruled that the IRS did not offer a good reason for entering the sharing agreement with ICE and therefore violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The IRS is permitted to share taxpayer information with law enforcement to identify criminals.\nThe golden age of homeschooling? The COVID lockdowns pushed many parents to begin homeschooling after Zoom lessons exposed the hogwash teachers were pushing on their kids. A lockdown-inspired boom in homeschooling could be expected to end when the lockdowns did, and indeed, many students returned to traditional schooling. However, the rate of homeschooling growth nationally has never returned to the meager 2% annual rate seen before the lockdowns. In the last reported year, 2024-2025, the growth rate was 5.4%. Three states and the District of Columbia showed a decrease in homeschool enrollment from the previous year, but Vermont and New Hampshire, which shrank in the last year, grew by more than 10% in 2024-2025, so long-term trends are still being assessed. More than a third of states that report homeschool numbers recorded their highest enrollments ever, with several experiencing double-digit growth — South Carolina homeschooling grew by an astonishing 21%.\n\nTrump will designate Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization (Just the News)\nDemocrats consider using ranked-choice voting in 2028 presidential primaries (National Review)\nMaine’s Platner calls to abolish ICE, drag agents before Congress (Washington Free Beacon)\nTrump admin gives mass migration warning to U.S. allies (Newsweek)\nSex trafficking was “widely tolerated” on Meta’s sites, according to unsealed court docs (Not the Bee)\nNew Arctic discovery could deal massive blow to Chinese dominance of rare earth minerals (Fox News)\nHumor: Breaking: Hamas breaches White House perimeter (Babylon Bee)\n\nFor the Executive Summary archive, click here.\n\nComment | Share\n\nFEATURED ANALYSIS\n\nMTG Resigns After Spat With Trump\n\nNate Jackson\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, the feisty MAGA representative from North Georgia, has announced her resignation from Congress, effective January 5, 2026. After seeing her video, the first question I have is a serious one: Why is her Christmas tree up already when it’s not even Thanksgiving yet?\n\nOkay, kidding (mostly) aside, Greene’s resignation after five years in Congress prompts numerous questions for the Republican Party. At the same time, it could be little more than a ripple in the grand scheme of things — by which I mean that a Democrat is not about to win GA-14.\n\n“I believe in term limits and do not think Congress should be a lifelong career or an assisted living facility,” Greene wrote. That’s a funny line, but why resign before her term is up? Why cheat the people in her district, whom she claims to love and represent, by getting out of Dodge halfway through the term she was elected to serve?\n\nOn second thought, maybe I should be asking why she’s waiting until January 5. Well, Greene’s generous congressional pension becomes fully vested on January 3.\n\nRepublican Governor Brian Kemp will call a special election within 10 days of the vacancy, but the seat will remain empty for at least a couple of months, robbing House Speaker Mike Johnson of a critical vote in a razor-thin majority.\n\nMTG’s resignation came just days after President Donald Trump personally threw her under the MAGA Express, calling her, among other things, a “traitor” and a “ranting Lunatic.” She had earned it, of course, by becoming increasingly vocal against Trump’s priorities and actions in office to the point where Trump and others were wondering if she wouldn’t be a better fit on the other side of the aisle. On the other hand, Trump is a “ranting Lunatic” sometimes himself, so maybe it takes one to know one.\n\nFor better or worse, President Trump sets GOP priorities, and a single representative isn’t going to win that fight.\n\nIn a human sense, though, her statement included something with which I sympathize: “I … do not want my sweet district to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms. And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me.”\n\nThat’s politics, but it’s not insane to say, “No thanks.”\n\nIf she has honestly faced death threats after Trump’s “traitor” condemnation, then she shouldn’t have to put up with that either.\n\nGreene invested a lot in Trump — for example, showing personal loyalty to the point of showing up at his New York trial when few other Republicans did. The sudden souring of their relationship has been both spectacular and completely normal for people in Trump’s orbit.\n\nAs our Douglas Andrews noted after Greene issued her statement, she listed five specific issues on which she’s disagreed with Trump of late: over-issuance of H-1B visas, which she says take American jobs; state-level AI moratoriums, which she believes encroach on states rights; 50-year mortgages, which she called a debt-for-life scam; our involvement in foreign wars, which is code for Trump’s military support for Israel; and the release of the Epstein files, for which I suspect she feels some vindication. What’s interesting is that Trump is recognized as a populist president, but MTG is on the populist side in each of these five issues.\n\nThat said, Greene leans far too hard into the Uniparty idea of hers, as if there’s no difference between the parties. Sometimes, that certainly seems true. Or at least it’s true that Republicans are frustratingly ineffective at truly distinguishing themselves from Democrats. Yet Greene is simply not correct that “the results are always the same — nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman.” So far, Trump’s second term has been far short of the economic turnaround people hoped for, but his first term demonstrably improved people’s lives. So did making his first-term tax cuts permanent in this second term.\n\nRemember, no Democrats voted to cut your taxes.\n\nAs for Trump and Greene’s relationship, Trump said on Saturday that he was open to reconciliation. “Sure, why not?” he responded to a reporter’s question. “I mean, I get along with everybody.”\n\nHe added, “I said, ‘Go your own way,’ and once I left her, she resigned. She would never have survived the primary, but I think she’s a nice person.”\n\nRight. Also on Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social, “The Republican Party has never been so UNITED AS IT iS RIGHT NOW! Other than Rand Paul, Rand Paul Jr.(Massie!), Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Brown, and a couple of other ‘lowlifes,’ and other than the fact that many want the Election threatening Filibuster TERMINATED (the Dems will do it in the first minute of their first chance!), and some don’t, there is great spirit and cohesion.”\n\nActually, there are increasing signs that the MAGA movement Trump built is unravelling a bit. Something tells me that when MTG starts her own podcast, she’ll contribute a little more to that fraying. For example, she name-dropped the dreaded “Neocons” toward the end of her resignation statement, though she seems to define that as conservatives who want America to engage with the world or, more specifically, support Israel.\n\nThat’s not the correct definition, but maybe she and Tucker Carlson know that.\n\nIn any case, the Republican Party doesn’t have long to figure out what it stands for in the 2026 midterms and beyond.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.\n\nComment | Share\n\nMORE ANALYSIS\n\nDouglas Andrews: Real Commie Meets Fake ‘Fascist’ — Friday’s remarkable meeting between the Leader of the Free World and the Leader of the Democrat Party was remarkable for what a single brief exchange said about the two men.\nThomas Gallatin: Trump’s Ambitious Ukraine Peace Plan Is a Two-Edged Sword — The Trump administration proposes a 28-point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine.

Erika, who is 37, said she hoped she was carrying another baby because she always wanted a bigger family with Charlie Kirk. This was one of her most open talks since Charlie’s death. Charlie was the founder of Turning Point USA and was one of the most well-known conservative voices in the country. His killing shocked the whole conservative world.

She also spoke about why young women should not wait too long to have kids.Erika Kirk tells Megyn Kelly she wanted a baby with Charlie KirkDuring the event in Glendale, Megyn Kelly asked Erika how many kids she and Charlie wanted. Erika said they wanted four children, and she hoped she was pregnant when Charlie was murdered. She said it would have felt like a small blessing in the middle of a huge tragedy.Erika Kirk also told young women not to wait too long to have children. She said careers can continue later, but having kids cannot be delayed forever. She explained that she and Charlie were excited to grow their family and were both praying for another baby.Megyn Kelly reminded her that she has two kids, a boy and a girl. Erika said she knows they will grow up and learn how important their father was. Kelly told the crowd that one day the children will understand they are Charlie Kirk’s children, and everyone clapped.This interview was one of Erika’s most personal talks since the killing.

Some might assume it’s Home Alone, given Trump’s cameo in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. However, the franchise in question is none other than Rush Hour.\n\nThe Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker starrer action-comedy franchise enjoys a huge global fan base among cinema enthusiasts, one of them being the President himself. Reportedly, Trump might get the work done by Paramount owner Larry Ellison.\n\nApart from being the third-richest man in the world, Ellison also has a close relationship with Trump. He also made heavy donations to the President’s election campaign.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAccording to Semafor, Trump is suggesting a reboot of Rush Hour as one of Paramount’s ambitious new projects, which is currently headlined by Ellison’s son, David. A source close to the development revealed to the publication that the President “personally pressed” Larry to work on the Rush Hour reboot.\n\nTalking about the box office performance of the Rush Hour franchise, the first film was released in 1998 and grossed $245.3 million worldwide. The second film, Rush Hour 2, was released in 2001 and earned $347,325,802 worldwide. The third film was released in the year 2007 and minted $258,097,122 worldwide.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAll three Rush Hour films were directed by filmmaker Brett Ratner. However, Ratner embroiled himself in a major controversy when sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against him in 2017. This led Warner Bros. to disassociate with him.\n\nIt could be challenging for major studios to consider a new Rush Hour, especially if Brett Ratner is retained as the director; Paramount might not face much difficulty with it. This is because Ratner is said to have strong MAGA connections.\n\nAfter rubbishing the allegations against him, Brett made his directorial comeback with a documentary film on Melania Trump. The budget for the same is said to be a whopping $40 million, and it is all set to be released through Amazon in January 2026.\n\nThe documentary is based on FLOTUS’ journey over the 20 days leading up to her husband’s 2025 inauguration. The producer of the Rush Hour franchise, Arthur Sarkissian, had also bankrolled the documentary film The Man You Don’t Know about the President, which was released last year.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nIt will be interesting to witness whether Trump will be interested in retaining the original cast of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the reboot. Chan had commented on the POTUS back in 2016, saying, “Just give him a chance to try to change America and change the world. He’s a businessman… I think he knows how to handle these types of things.”\n\nHowever, according to The Daily Beast, Tucker was seen supporting Kamala Harris in July 2024 while attending her campaign rally in Georgia. He is also said to be close with former US Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.","summary":"President Donald Trump wishes the comeback of a beloved movie franchise, which is quite close to his heart.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-wants-the-return-of-this-popular-movie-franchise-and-no-its-not-home-alone","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Donald-Trump-2-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 15:33:05","author":"Shreshtha Chaudhury","authors":["Shreshtha Chaudhury"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":381759014,"title":"Charlie Kirk's widow Erika prayed she was pregnant as husband was gunned down","text":"The widow of assassinated conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk has told how she was “praying to God” she was pregnant at the moment her husband was shot dead. Erika Kirk, 37, spoke openly during a live on-stage interview, telling the audience of her longing for a larger family. Appearing with US podcast host Megyn Kelly, she said: “I was praying to God that I was pregnant when he got murdered.” Kelly told the crowd that former beauty queen Kirk had first shared the detail with her privately. “You told me this in private. How many kids did you want to have?” she asked. “We wanted to have four,” Kirk replied. Kelly responded: “Oh, wow. I thought of that once. Whether it was meant to be or whether we’d get news like that.” Kirk said the possibility of pregnancy had felt like a glimmer of hope in the aftermath of the trauma she suffered following her husband's death. “I was like, oh, goodness, that was going to be the ultimate blessing out of this catastrophe,” she said. Charlie, founder of Turning Point USA and one of the most recognisable conservative activists in America, was gunned down in September while speaking to students at Utah Valley University in Orem. His assassination sparked shock across America’s political right, triggering an outpouring of grief from Republican heavyweights and grassroots supporters. During the interview, Kirk also used the moment to appeal directly to young women not to delay having children. “When I see young couples, I tell them, ‘Please, don’t put it off.’ Especially if you’re a young woman. Don’t put it off, you can always have a career, you can always, you know, go back to work,” she said. “You can never just go back to having children. And they grow so fast and so quickly.” She said she and Charlie had long dreamed of expanding their family. “I was praying. Both of us were. We were just excited to just expand our family,” Kirk said. Kelly responded: “Thank God you have the two. Thank God.” Kirk agreed, saying their son and daughter would one day understand the significance of their father's legacy. \"A boy and girl. I know,” she said. Kelly added: “One day they’ll find out they’re Charlie Kirk’s children and they’ll know what that means,” prompting applause. The interview marked one of Kirk’s most candid public appearances since her husband was killed. Police arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who authorities say turned himself in shortly after the shooting. Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, held at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, drew Donald Trump , Vice-President JD Vance , top Republicans and dozens of conservative influencers. There, his widow delivered a widely praised tribute in which she even forgave her husband’s alleged killer. “Charlie wanted to save young men just like the one who took his life… I forgive him,” she said, as the audience clapped. “I forgive him because it’s what Christ did. The answer to hate is not hate.” Charlie founded Turning Point USA in 2012 and built it into the biggest conservative youth organisation in the country. Trump credited him as one of the “key reasons” he won re-election. His influence, however, came with fierce criticism. He attacked gay and transgender rights, plunged into high-profile cultural clashes, and repeated Trump’s false claim that former vice-president Kamala Harris encouraged illegal migration. He also drew wide condemnation for branding George Floyd a “scumbag,” comments that critics said worsened racial tensions at a volatile moment in US history.","summary":"Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead at a rally in Utah two months ago.

I say Day Six, but for all intents and purposes, when you add the six days of Code Redgate to the 43 days of the government shutdown orchestrated by the very same Democrats in Washington, you're nearing 50 days of rhetorical and political warfare on America's military in order to weaken President Donald Trump. Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin was the first of six members of both chambers with military experience to voice their part in a 90-second video warning rank and file military servicemembers not to obey illegal orders. Joining Slotkin was Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, House Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of a rented apartment in New Hampshire she had to lease after she won a carpetbagger campaign, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlihan, both from Pennsylvania. It's a recklessly dangerous and stupid video, and one that should cost all six their seats in office if the country weren't so polarized right now. In case you missed the triggering video, here it is.\n\nWe want to speak directly to members of the Military and the Intelligence Community.The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution.Don’t give up the ship. pic.twitter.com/N8lW0EpQ7r— Sen. Elissa Slotkin (@SenatorSlotkin) November 18, 2025\n\nIn short, it's wildly absurd, and about the dumbest presentation Democrats have offered since...Chuck Schumer's defense of the government shutdown. There have been no illegal orders given. None. Every court challenge that has been fully adjudicated with respect to any military activities understaken by this commander-in-chief has resulted in Trump's favor. So why is this still a story almost a week later when it's so obviously a political stunt timed to drop after the Epstein Files stunt ran out of gas last week? Three reasons1. Resistance media was on board with this story because it helped them turn the page from the shutdown and Epstein, and this media class in the Beltway-Manhattan Bubble has never met a Russiagate-esque smear job they didn't love to promote,.2. Donald Trump, thus far fairly disciplined in his social media presence this term compared to his first stint in office, nevertheless threw a spoke and poured gasoline all over this fire by referring to those in the video as the 'Seditious Six.' It gave a story that should have been a 1-2 day stunt enough oxygen to continue for the foreseeable future, or until the next Trump-hating shiny object emerges.3. Democrats are now portraying themselves as victims of potential right-wing violence. Media's role in the latest anti-Trump psyop was pretty represensible for the first few days, becasue with a story like this, there's really only one question to ask any of the six in the video. It's Journalism 101. If you are collecting a paycheck as a reporter or journalist, especially one on the cable outlets, there is only one question: What orders are being given to the troops that they should not be obeying? That's it. That's the entirety of the question set for the interview of any of the six. Jake Tapper, who is still on extended holiday from committing journalism, at least when Democrats are involved, brought on Maggie Goodlander, who is emerging as the ringleader of this band of malicious misfits. Could he be bothered to ask her what her evidence was for making this video? No. Not one question asked her directly what illegal order or orders were given. Instead, this is what we got. \n\nInsurrectionist Maggie Goodlander's husband, Russiagate Conspiracy architect Jake Sullivan, arranged for her to see his co-conspirator Jake Tapper. pic.twitter.com/6BNpFcJ9xa— Svetlana Lokhova (@RealSLokhova) November 21, 2025\n\nGoodlander is not just an innocent rube here, being caught up in the latest Trump gotcha video. She is married to Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton's bagman and Joe Biden's National Security Advisor. If you want to know how Russiagate was even remotely possible and taken seriously when it was created out of whole cloth, Sullivan was right there in the middle of the fiction writing. As for Mrs. Sullivan, she clerked for former Attorney General Merrick Garland when he was a D.C. Appellate Court judge. She also has been fighting back against campaign financial disclosures, which are bizarre to say the least. Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan have worked together on bull excrement scandals before, and this time seems no different.This entire stunt reeks of a Sullivan-Clinton-Biden-Obama dirty trick. It's coming on the heels of the military being screwed out of paychecks for almost two months, and the left-wing establishment would love nothing more than to drive a wedge between Donald Trump and the U.S. military, which thus far loves the actions and decisions of this administration. A day later, Wolf Blitzer on the same network got a little closer to the only salient question, but still couldn't get there, and yet Goodlander still struggled on the hook. \n\nWATCH: New Hampshire Democrat Maggie Goodlander BRUTALLY struggles to answer whether members of the military have told her they have been given unlawful orders.GOODLANDER: “Well… you know… what I’d say is…the, the...\" pic.twitter.com/S6K31c9rAK— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) November 21, 2025\n\nOn the main five Sunday shows, Goodlander didn't appear. But she did appear on MS-Something Timely with Alex Witt, about as friendly an outlet as she's going to get outside of CNN. Except Witt, to her great credit, finally asked her the only real question. And Mrs. Sullivan lapsed into a Kamala Harris word salad.\n\nRep. Maggie Goodlander (D-NH) is asked to her face what illegal orders she wants the US Military to disobey.She refuses to answer. She doesn’t even say what she thinks may have been illegal.Goodlander is terrified because she’s committed sedition.pic.twitter.com/2j0SYLo6b8 https://t.co/IWJUOcHCQe— Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl) November 23, 2025\n\nYou see, of course, why if the real question is asked to any of the six, the story ends, right? They can't name an illegal order, because there has been no illegal order given. What you're left with then is a video meant to insinuate there has been, and give military servicemembers doing their jobs and obeying lawful orders pause, because they might be politically prosecuted under a Democratic administration. Is it sedition? No. Sedition includes a conspiracy to overthrow the government. These six just want to throw wrenches at Trump any way possible, not overthrow it. If it's the President's desire to end this controversy and keep others from pulling a stunt like this in the future, he's creating the opposite effect. Democrats since January 20th have been looking for a part of Trump's skin to crawl under and get him sidetracked. Thus far, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has been a positive influence in keeping everyone in the administration rowing the boat in the same direction. This, however, isn't helping. \n\n🚨 BREAKING: President Trump just posted a video of the 6 Congressional Democrats BEHIND BARS after they fomented sedition from the military and CIAHope you're watching, AG Bondi!MAKE IT HAPPEN. Or seditious behavior will GROW in the United States. pic.twitter.com/zVe7zV0Yiq— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) November 24, 2025\n\nSenator Slotkin, who appeared on ABC's This Week with Martha Raddatz, gets the gold for the wildest spin when confronted with the reality that there's no there there to the illegal orders video. \n\nSlotkin is using an accusation in former Defense Secretary Mark Esper's 2022 memoir that Donald Trump allegedly told him to order the military to shoot protesters in the legs. There were other people in the room, and there are plenty of people in the chain of command who would be able to corroborate that claim. To date, exactly zero have. It's Esper, who hates Trump, and his word versus the rest of the military serving during Trump's first term. Even after Raddatz pushed back that there's no corroboration to that allegation, Slotkin is still holding onto it as though it's the Gospel truth. But then, Slotkin takes it one step further. Remember, the same Washington, D.C. Democrats have been warning ICE agents doing their job enforcing the immigration laws of the United States that when Democrats do regain power, those agents face criminal prosecutions. The threats aren't just implicit; they're very real. But to military servicemembers, Slotkin is speaking very directly to them, too. Keep up what you're doing, enforcing Trump's legal orders, and you'll face your own Nuremberg trials once we get voted back in. Democrats, because of Trump's social media comments, are complaining about threats they're receiving now that the Sedition rhetoric has been invoked, but the actual threats being issued, to anyone willing to see them, are to those wearing the uniform and obeying the chain of command from the commander-in-chief down. \n\nDeranged.Senator Slotkin (D-MI) says no unlawful military orders have been given, yet goes on to say US service members could be prosecuted like Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg:“Go back to Nuremberg: ‘Well, they told me to do it' is not an excuse… People were prosecuted.\" pic.twitter.com/GLZuQc4Aca— Nathan Brand (@NathanBrandWA) November 23, 2025\n\nRaddatz got down to the one question to Slotkin that matters. Her answer? \"To my knowledge, I'm not aware of things that are illegal.\" Oh? So there's no predicate for the video at all then? Slotkin said, \"No, comma, but...\" Her 'but' shifted back to Nuremberg and A Few Good Men, the Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson movie about the Code Red, and whether the two Marines should have followed what they should have known was an illegal order. That's Slotkin's case for the video. You want Slotkin on that wall. You need Slotkin on that wall. She wants \"her\" truth, even though she can't handle the actual truth, which is that Trump has acted legally as commander-in-chief. In her world, as soon as Democrats come to power, they will retroactively make anything Trump did illegal, and go prosecute anyone who followed out what they should have known in the future Democrats would have a problem with. That's what is so dangerous about the video the six made. On Face the Nation, Margaret Brennan displayed a case of the Journalistic Bends. She landed two of the six from the video in question - Mark Kelly and Jason Crow, and treated them wholly differently from each other in the span of 20 minutes. In the case of Kelly, whom she obviously likes, he got a total pass. \n\nWATCH: CBS's Margaret Brennan offers NO PUSHBACK to Sen. Mark Kelly's gaslighting about Trump allegedly ordering protesters be shot in the legs as the basis for the \"seditious\" video, pivots straight to Ukraine pic.twitter.com/fMNqsb3dTa— Jorge Bonilla (@BonillaJL) November 23, 2025\n\nThe laziest question any interviewer can ask a book author is, 'So why'd you write the book?' The book, if the interviewer did their due diligence by reading before the interview, should purportedly answer that question at length. This question by Brennan was just as lazy. \"Why'd you make the video?\" It was a softball on a tee, and she got out of the way for a minute-plus and let Kelly have his say. Once he was done, she moved on to Ukraine without a single follow-up. No pushback whatsoever. A few moments later, Rep. Crow from Colorado was up, and Brennan apparently doesn't have the same cozy relationship she has with Kelly. \n\nCBS: \"How do you respond to the allegations...from your colleagues, fellow veterans that what you put out there is weakening and corrosive?\"CROW: \"They know better. We were very clear in the video that what we are talking about is unlawful orders.\"CBS: \"Specifically what?'… pic.twitter.com/ovbwpkJHt1— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) November 23, 2025\n\nBrennan asked him directly what the illegal orders were, and when he came up with his list, she immediately pushed back, saying none of those had been ruled as illegal. So she knows. She didn't have to consult her notes. She knows the story is crap, yet she let Kelly advance it for inexplicable reasons. I'll leave you with this. Amy Klobuchar, who is regarded to be the brain trust for the Democrats in the Senate should Chuck Schumer lose his position of leader, was on Meet the Press with Kristen Welker. Welker asked her the question: What are the illegal orders? This is what Klobuchar offered. \n\nWelker: \"Do you know what the specific illegal acts are that your Democratic colleagues were referring to?\"Klobuchar: \"If [a National Guard] commander were to tell [troops], hey, go out on the streets and do this and that, that's not following the order that is in law. So I… https://t.co/viCkHoAxMJ pic.twitter.com/Qht2S09sNg— Western Lensman (@WesternLensman) November 23, 2025\n\nI've listened to that answer three times now in an attempt to provide cogent analysis for my rebuttal. I got nothing. I don't know where Klobuchar's answer starts, and where Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians ends. \n\nI'm not aware of too many things.I know what I know, if you know what I mean.\n\nMy friendly advice to the White House? Op-Dray the edition-say, and call it what it is - stupid, and a threat to the military. Both Trump and Vice-President Vance should remind voters who are in service to this country, or have members of their family wearing the uniform, that under this administration, from the President down through the chain of command, they have the backs of the military. If Democrats get elected, not only will they not pay you for months on end without losing a wink of sleep and treat you like a political pawn, they'll put you on trial for following orders.Republicans: Use the words and threats of the Democrats against them with the very people to whom those threats were made. And then do it again and again. \n\nEditor's note: We now have the room to run outside commentary by some of our favorite and most provocative thinkers on the Right.

Maybe not the entire six-pack, but almost. They include: –A salable message. How’s the candidate going to make life better for the voter? Specifics, not just poll-generated platitudes. And beating up on President Trump isn’t going to be enough for Democrats next year. Voters will probably be getting migraine headaches from listening to both Trump and his critics. –Curb appeal. It greatly helps to have matinee-idol looks like Gov. Gavin Newsom. But that gift is rare. Average appearance, verbal skills and a good message will usually suffice. –Boatloads of money. It costs tens of millions of dollars to market a gubernatorial aspirant’s message in far-flung, heavily populated and diverse California. –A strong desire to win, also known as “fire in the belly.” Rather than relaxing in a recliner while watching the Rams or 49ers, the willingness to fly off to beg strangers for campaign donations. –A thick skin. Top-tier candidates are constantly attacked by rivals and often covered by the news media in ways deemed unfair. But overreacting can destroy a candidacy. –A strong record of public service to show voters you’re committed and won’t need lots of time with training wheels. There also are other assets that can help. For example: youth. “We are, in fact, going through a generational change in American politics,” says longtime Democratic strategist Darry Dragow. “That’s inevitable. New generations of voters have not been widely represented in government. The boomers have held political power for a very long time.” Baby boomers are roughly ages 60 through 79 — born after World War II, between 1946 and 1964. Another plus is political incumbency — the ability for a candidate to be identified on the ballot label as, for example, attorney general or lieutenant governor. That denotes credibility and a record. You’re not allowed to call yourself a “former” anything. Democratic strategist Garry South calls the current crop basically “a field of formers” and says that saddles them with an extra burden. So far, the 2026 race to replace the termed-out Newsom has been a boring trot. That’s largely because the public’s political focus has been on Trump and the toady Republican Congress. But it’s also because none of the gubernatorial candidates possesses the full six-pack of vital assets. For months, the contest was frozen in waiting mode: Waiting for former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla to decide whether they wanted to run. Either would have been an early favorite, but not a shoo-in. They’d have faced a fight. And neither apparently felt the job was worth it. No fire. Democratic donors and activists also were focused on Proposition 50 and waiting for the Nov. 4 redistricting election to be over. Most money and effort were going there. Now that’s all behind us and the real race is underway. “It’s a total free-for-all,” Sragow says. “None of these candidates is really on anybody’s radar.” There’s no actual front-runner. “You can’t read anything into the polls,” Democratic consultant Gale Kaufman says. “Just because somebody is a few points ahead doesn’t make them a front-runner. We don’t even know who all the candidates are yet.” A late October poll of registered voters by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies showed that 44% were undecided. Former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter led Democratic candidates with a scant 11%. Former U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra was second at 8%. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, was first overall with 13%. But never mind. No Republican has been elected to statewide office in California since 2006. And one won’t be 20 years later. Last week, two more Democrats leaped into the race: –Billionaire hedge fund founder Tom Steyer, 68, who ran for president in 2020 and got nowhere. He has a good populist, anti-Sacramento message and tons of money to voice it. But he has never held elected office. And Californians have historically rejected mega-rich, self-financing candidates attempting to begin their political career at the highest level. –Rep. Eric Swalwell, 45, from the San Francisco Bay Area, who also ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. He has a good message for progressives. But right now it may be too focused on Trump and not enough on Californians’ needs. Aside from Steyer, none of the other Democratic aspirants are independently wealthy. They’ll need to raise barrels of money — ”24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Sragow says. That takes fire. Other Democratic candidates: –Porter, 51. She has curb appeal. But she publicly showed a thin skin with a contentious, rude performance during a TV interview in October. The nasty episode probably wasn’t fatal. But it apparently dropped her in polls, and that hurts fundraising. –Becerra, 67. He has a respectful record as Health secretary, California attorney general and congressman. But questions were raised recently about Becerra’s judgment when federal prosecutors revealed the then-secretary didn’t notice that a top aide had raided his dormant political account for $225,000. Becerra wasn’t implicated. The aide pleaded guilty. –Antonio Villaraigosa, 72, former Los Angeles mayor and state Assembly speaker. No one is more qualified to be governor. And he lets voters know where he stands. But they may be looking for someone younger. –Betty Yee, 68, former state controller, Board of Equalization member and chief state budget honcho. She knows every inch of state government’s fiscal quagmire and has good ideas about unraveling it. But she’s short on curb appeal. –State Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, 57, the lone incumbent in the field. But he missed an opportunity to shine as state schools chief. One of these people will probably be our next governor, although others could still enter the race. So, maybe it’s time to start paying attention. The must-read: Pondering a run for governor, Atty.

Following a high-profile appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show and a surge of online attention, political analysts say he may represent a new phase of the post-Trump MAGA movement, one driven less by conventional Republican messaging and more by youth-led nationalism, anti-establishment sentiment, and cultural frustration.\n\nHis rise coincides with shifting generational divides inside the Republican base, especially among young men, where his blend of hardline immigration rhetoric and economic grievance appears to resonate sharply.\n\nWho is Nalin Haley, and why is he gaining traction with Gen Z conservatives?\n\nNalin Haley has spent the last year building an online presence centered on themes of economic anxiety, cultural decline, and national identity. But it was his recent conversation with Tucker Carlson that propelled him into mainstream conservative discourse.\n\nDuring the interview, Haley discussed his conversion to Catholicism, distrust of the media, and an uncompromising vision for America rooted in strict immigration enforcement and a hard break from globalism. Clips circulated widely, including reposts from conservative influencers and commentators who began referring to him as the potential face of young right-wing politics.\n\nA viral endorsement from commentator Evan Kilgore captured this sentiment, declaring that Haley “is going places” and may “quickly rise to become the face of the male Gen Z right-wing.”\n\nPolitical strategists note that Nalin Haley’s appeal lies in his ability to frame right-wing arguments with a generational edge, less tied to traditional GOP talking points and more to the lived frustrations of young Americans who feel economically sidelined.\n\nWhy younger conservatives are rallying around his message\n\nExit polls from the 2024 election showed Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris by double digits among male Gen Z voters. The Yale Youth Poll found a similar lean toward Republican positions among younger Gen Z voters, particularly men, even as older Gen Z Americans remain more ideologically mixed.\n\nNalin Haley directly taps into this demographic with a rhetorical style that blends nationalist sentiment with economic populism, a combination highly effective in online conservative spaces.\n\nWhat makes Haley’s message appealing to young conservatives\n\nSeveral themes consistently appear in his commentary:\n\nfrustration with job scarcity among recent graduates\n\nskepticism toward mass immigration and foreign student enrollment\n\na belief that national identity must be exclusive and clearly defined\n\nresentment toward political and cultural elites\n\na rejection of both Democratic and establishment Republican politics\n\nIn a widely shared post, Haley argued that desires for jobs, safe streets, and affordable housing are not radical, writing, “You’re rational. Don’t let anyone convince you otherwise.”\n\nFor younger right-leaning voters who feel economically squeezed and culturally alienated, these claims offer a simplified explanation for structural issues, often attributing blame to immigration, globalism, or political elites.\n\nWhat Haley actually said during his viral Carlson interview\n\nHaley’s interview included some of the most uncompromising proposals voiced by a mainstream conservative figure in years. Among them:\n\nRestricting public office to native-born citizens\n\nHaley argued that naturalised citizens should be barred from holding public office. He claimed that understanding America requires being “raised in the US from birth.” This position directly affects several current officeholders, including New York’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nLimiting foreign students in American universities\n\nHaley described foreign student presence as a national security concern, claiming, “Some of them are spies.”His framing echoed long-running debates about foreign influence on US campuses, particularly from China.\n\nBanning dual citizenship\n\nCalling it “the stupidest idea,” Haley argued that holding allegiance to more than one nation undermines national unity.\n\nRejecting foreign military service for US-connected individuals\n\nHe insisted that service in another nation’s armed forces should disqualify a person from claiming American identity.\n\nHalting legal immigration\n\nDays before the Carlson interview, he said in a separate conversation with UnHerd that legal immigration should be paused entirely.His reasoning was economic: he described friends unable to secure jobs despite strong résumés and argued that foreign workers were replacing opportunities for young Americans.\n\nThis framing matches the grievances fueling segments of the post-Trump right, weaving economics, cultural identity, and social resentment into a cohesive ideological narrative.\n\nHow his rise reflects deeper shifts inside the MAGA movement\n\nHaley’s sudden prominence illustrates broader changes within the GOP’s populist wing. Analysts say the movement is no longer defined solely by Trump’s personal brand but by a younger generation seeking ideological purity rather than political compromise.\n\nWhy some experts believe Trump is losing control of the movement\n\nThomas Gift, director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London, told Newsweek that Trump has “unleashed a political creature he can no longer fully control.” He argued that parts of the MAGA movement now view Trump himself as too moderate or too willing to compromise, leaving space for figures like Haley.\n\nThe post-Trump succession race\n\nAdam Hilton of Mount Holyoke College described the right-wing landscape during Trump’s second administration as competitive and fragmented. With younger activists increasingly influential, he noted a “deep bench” of ambitious personalities positioning themselves as the eventual ideological successor to Trump.\n\nHaley’s refusal to adopt traditional labels, telling Carlson he does not feel represented by either party, reinforces his outsider appeal.To many young conservatives, this positions him as a voice capable of redefining right-wing politics for a new generation.\n\nWhy Nalin Haley matters now\n\nHaley’s rise is significant for three reasons:\n\nHe represents a youth-driven, online-first evolution of the MAGA identity.\n\nHis rhetoric pushes the party’s immigration and nationalism debates further right.\n\nHe may signal the opening of a generational power struggle inside the post-Trump conservative movement.\n\nWhether Haley becomes a lasting political figure or remains a social-media phenomenon will depend on how he positions himself in the months ahead. But for now, he has captured a growing segment of young conservatives eager for new leadership and more willing than previous generations to embrace hardline ideology as a form of identity.","summary":"Nalin Haley, the 24-year-old son of former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador Nikki Haley, is rapidly emerging as a breakout figure on the Gen Z right.

Romman, who rose to national prominence during the 2024 Democratic National Convention, told Salon that she believes a Democrat can flip the governor’s office with a focus on expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage and cracking down on corporate landlords.\n\nIn an interview with Salon, Romman said that Georgia is ready for change, citing reporting from Moody’s Analytics’ Mark Zandi that 22 states, Georgia among them, are already in a recession. This is partially due to policies instituted by the Trump administration, such as tariffs and federal job cuts.\n\nHowever, Romman added, other economic problems in the state are the result of decades of Republican governance. For example, Georgia’s minimum wage has been stuck at $5.15 per hour since 1999, making it one of just two states with a lower minimum wage than the federal rate of $7.25 per hour, though it generally defaults to the higher rate.\n\n“My pitch to voters is that we’re running for a Georgia that we can afford and where we belong, and we want to raise the minimum wage, reopen hospitals, invest in small businesses, feed hungry kids and take homes back from corporations,” Romman said.\n\nShe said that she arrived at this agenda through a decade-plus organizing experience and through listening to everyday Georgians in one-on-one conversations. Recently, those conversations have been happening via her volunteer canvassing effort, which launched on Oct. 25 and has already seen about 1,000 sign-ups. Six months out from the Democratic primary in May, her campaign is already canvassing in Atlanta, Athens, Savannah and Norcross.\n\nRomman’s campaign has been buoyed by the recent Democratic wins in races for the state Public Service Commission, which regulates major utilities in Georgia, including Georgia Power, a utility company that, along with Republicans on the commission, has come under scrutiny due to new datacenter construction that threatens to drive up electric bills in the state.\n\nAcknowledging the comparatively low turnout in the election, Romman said that these elections were validating for her theory that people can be driven to turn out in the state if politicians are able to clearly delineate how they plan to address pressing material issues in the state.\n\n“I want to be clear. People keep saying it’s about ‘affordability.’ It’s ‘What are you going to do about affordability?’” Romman said. “Because if all you say is the word affordability six times, I don’t know what that offers to people, but if you’re able to say ‘Here’s why your prices are going up and here’s what I’m going to do about it,’ that goes a really long way, but that requires some courage in naming who the culprits are.”\n\nPart of what sets her apart from some of her opponents, like Kiesha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta, and Geoff Duncan, the former Republican lieutenant governor, is her refusal to accept donations from corporations or special interests.\n\nRomman added that Democrats in Georgia can’t afford to put up a centrist Democrat or former Republican for governor in the state because “We tried it last year, and we lost.”\n\n“We worked really hard to attract Trump voters, and ultimately lost our own people,” Romman said. “If this were the old way of politics, I could understand the wisdom of that thinking. But people keep trying to fit a square peg in a circular hole, and it’s just not working. We keep forgetting that the world is different.”\n\nShe went on to underscore the importance of winning the governor’s race in 2026, not just to deliver economic change for Georgia residents, but also because of the power the governor has to defend their constituents from President Donald Trump’s increasingly authoritarian immigration crackdowns and the security of the 2028 presidential election.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nIn the interview, Romman, the first Muslim woman elected to the Georgia state House and first Palestinian elected to any office in Georgia, also addressed last year’s DNC, in which Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign refused to give a Palestinian American, as a representative of the Uncommitted campaign, a speaking slot. Romman, who was one of the proposed speakers and who voted for Harris in 2024, said that many Democrats in elected office have yet to reckon with the fact that Harris’s position in support of Israel was a liability with Democratic voters in the 2024 election. And that the issue, while not a top concern for some voters, is seen as a litmus test by many.\n\n“But if you look at polling and you ask people, what are their top five issues, this issue does not come up. It’s usually not ranked in their top five. It’s not a priority issue. But here’s the thing, when you have conversations with voters, they will tell you things like, ‘if you can’t be honest about what we saw with our own eyes, how can I expect you to have my back?’” Romman said. “Specifically, if you see children being bombed and dismembered and you can’t be honest about that, how can I trust you to have my back when it comes to negotiating on my behalf, against special interests, against PACs, against these sorts of big forces in our ecosystem?”","summary":"Ruwa Romman, a state representative, says economic populism is Democrats' best shot in Georgia's governor's race","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/11/24/ruwa-rommans-case-for-economic-populism-in-georgia/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2220170630-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 11:30:02","author":"Russell Payne","authors":["Russell Payne"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":381800498,"title":"Fury after White House uses Defying Gravity to promote the work of ICE on TikTok","text":"The Trump administration is under fire for using music from Wicked to celebrate the detention of people by ICE.\n\nICE, which stands for US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, is a federal agency that enforces immigration laws in the United States, including arresting and deporting people that the agency believes are in the country illegally. It was formed in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. \n\nThe White House’s official TikTok, which was launched by the administration in August despite lawmakers’ concerns that the app’s Chinese owners represent a national security risk, shared a video over the weekend using Cythnia Erivo’s Wicked ‘war cry’ “Defying Gravity” alongside distressing images and videos of people being detained.\n\nText reading: “Ahh that deportation feeling…” was overlaid on a scene of Donald Trump smiling and walking in slow-mo through the White House, before shifting to clips of ICE officers handcuffing and chasing people down.\n\nThe video itself is captioned “holding space for this ✨” in reference to the much meme’d interview between Erivo, Ariana Grande and Out magazine journalist Tracy E. Gilchrist. \n\nSince Donald Trump returned to office for his second term in January, after defeating Kamala Harris in the November 2024 election, he and his administration have made cracking down on illegal immigration a major part of his presidency, with ICE targeted with raising deportation numbers through an increase in raids and arrests across the country.\n\nIn recent months, many have alleged they have been wrongfully arrested, detained and deported by ICE despite being citizens, having correct visas or valid asylum claims. This includes the case of gay makeup artist Andry José Hernández Romero, who entered the US legally in 2024 to seek asylum after fleeing anti-LGBTQ+ violence in his home country of Venezuela, but was deported by ICE to a supermax CECOT prison in El Salvador, known for its poor conditions and human rights abuses, because the agency incorrectly believed he had links to gangs.\n\n“Human beings are not illegal”\n\nCelebrities have been speaking out against ICE, with Chappell Roan, Reneé Rapp and Hacks star Hannah Einbinder, amongst others, all saying: “F**k ICE” at various public events. RuPaul’s Drag Race alum Alaska also described the agency as a “terrorist organisation” at LA Pride, saying: “Human beings are not illegal. To protest is part of the f**king fabric of this country. Treating people like f**king human beings is not f**king negotiable.”\n\nShe continued: “Pride is a f**king party but Pride is also a f**king riot, OK? Our ability to get together like this as a community, to stand in one place all together is very powerful, especially in 2025.”\n\nProtest against ICE have erupted in cities across the US throughout 2025, with the US government deploying the national guard and members of the military to quell the unrest, which resulted in some demonstrators being hit with rubber bullets, tear gas and flashbang grenades.\n\nUnsurprisingly, people reacted with disgust at the “Defying Gravity” video shared by the White House, with social media users variously labelling it “dystopian”, “wrong”, “horrible” and “pure evil”.\n\n“how is it even legal for the white house to be so unprofessional about it?” one comment, which has more than 580,000 likes, reads. \n\n“i’m sorry what do you mean THE WHITE HOUSE posted this,” another user asked in shock. \n\nFans of Wicked, in particular, were outraged by the use of “Defying Gravity” – a song about an Othered person experiencing self-acceptance – to promote anti-immigrant narratives, with many noting that the movie’s stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande themselves would not approved of the song’s use in this way.","summary":"The Trump administration is under fire for using music from Wicked to celebrate the detention of people by ICE.

Growing scrutiny","text":"What began as a routine Democratic talking point — focused on Vance’s ties to Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, who mentored Vance early in his career and poured $15 million into his 2022 Senate run — has now become a source of tension within Trump’s own political coalition, News.Az reports, citing foreign media.\nIn recent weeks, several prominent conservative figures, including Steve Bannon, Joe Rogan, and Roger Stone, have expressed unease about Palantir’s growing footprint in federal agencies. Stone even said he warned Vance directly that his “biggest fear for the country is Palantir,” citing concerns about futuristic, large-scale government surveillance.\nVance has dismissed these claims, telling young conservatives that accusations he is “in bed” with the company are nothing more than an “internet meme.” He insists Palantir is simply a private contractor that provides both helpful and controversial services.\nDespite attempts to distance himself, Palantir has become deeply embedded in the federal government:\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\nState Department\nPentagon and U.S. Army\nThe company has secured billions in federal deals since Trump took office, including a potential $10 billion Army contract, while its stock price has tripled since the election.\nIts software is now central to major policy areas, such as immigration enforcement and federal workforce restructuring, both top priorities for Trump’s second term.\nConcerns escalated after a March executive order mandated broader interagency data coordination. Critics across the political spectrum fear that combining Palantir’s tools with advanced AI could give the government unprecedented insight into Americans’ private lives.\nPalantir strongly denies those claims, saying in a June statement:\n“We are not a surveillance company… We do not sell personal data… We don’t provide data-mining as a service.”\nStill, as the company's influence grows, skepticism only intensifies.\nVance has attempted to strike a middle ground. He argues that Big Tech platforms collecting consumer data for profit pose a bigger privacy threat than Palantir’s government contracts. Yet he also acknowledges that modern technology is “crazy and weird,” with real implications for civil liberties.\nHis position is delicate. Trump has increasingly surrounded himself with Silicon Valley billionaires, even as the GOP’s populist wing becomes more suspicious of tech giants. Recent flashpoints include:\nBannon’s ongoing clashes with Elon Musk\nRon DeSantis sounding alarms about energy-hungry data centers\nJosh Hawley pushing investigations into AI-related harms\nAgainst this backdrop, Vance — once a venture capitalist and long-time Thiel protégé — stands between two worlds: conservative populists and tech elites.\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp, who backed Kamala Harris in 2024 before shifting toward Trump post-election, has built close ties with the new administration and donated to pro-Trump groups. Former Palantir adviser Jacob Helberg now holds a senior State Department role.\nTheir growing visibility has angered activists like Laura Loomer, who accuses Palantir of trying to “infiltrate” the administration to secure massive defense contracts.\nFor now, Vance has not proposed any specific steps to address privacy or data protection concerns. None of Trump’s 213 executive orders to date prioritize consumer data safeguards, and the administration recently backed moves to block state-level AI regulations.\nAs Palantir cements its position in Washington and skepticism grows among the MAGA base, Vance must navigate conflicting pressures:\nloyalty to Trump’s governing agenda\ndistrust from conservative activists\nhis own deep ties to the tech sector\nHow he manages this divide may shape both Trump’s coalition — and Vance’s long-term political trajectory.","url":"https://news.az/news/does-jd-vance-have-a-palantir-problem-growing-scrutiny","image":"https://news.az/photos/2025/11/1763982698.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 11:15:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"az","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":381696166,"title":"Experts say recent elections in blue areas bode well for Democrats but Trump coalition holding firm","text":"MADISON - Do Democratic sweeps in blue areas of the country mean anything for the next election battle in purple Wisconsin?\n\nPolitical experts say the voter enthusiasm on display in races earlier this month in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere could mean Democrats have tailwinds heading into the midterms in the Badger State, which is much more divided politically.\n\nIt's one of the first data points political observers are using to make predictions about the upcoming midterm elections, which will take place two years into President Donald Trump's second term and will feature the first wide-open Wisconsin governor's race in more than a decade.\n\n\"It's another sign Democrats have the edge in general going into 2026,\" Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor and director of the university's Elections Research Center, said about the election outcomes.\n\nBoth Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia ran ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris' electoral result in 2024. In legislative races in Virginia, Democrats flipped 13 seats in the House.\n\n\"Those swings from year to year do say something about change despite the fact that they were Democratic-leaning states. And I think that is really relevant,\" Charles Franklin, Marquette University Law School poll director, said.\n\nFranklin said the Republicans who lost Nov. 4 won by an average of 5½ points two years ago. This time, they lost by an average of six points.\n\n\"That's an 11½-point swing in the margins in those Republican incumbent seats over just a two-year period,\" Franklin said.\n\nThe swing is likely tied to voter opinions about the job Trump is doing since his inauguration in January and cost-of-living worries.\n\n\"The economy could change in 12 months. I'm not making any economic forecasts, but I am saying, you'll want to keep an eye on whether the public remains as concerned about economic issues over the next 12 months,\" Franklin said.\n\n\"And if so, the results this week show what a challenge that can be for the incumbent party.\"\n\nBut Franklin also said Trump's approval in Wisconsin has not waned as much as it has nationally and certainly less than in the more Democratic-leaning areas, giving Republicans an advantage they may not have elsewhere.\n\n\"That's maybe a glimpse of good news for Republicans here that the president doesn't seem as unpopular in Wisconsin as he does in other states,\" Franklin said. \"His coalition isn't visibly cracking up here in Wisconsin. It's holding quite firm.\"\n\nRepublicans discount results from blue states New Jersey and Virginia\n\nRepublican Party of Wisconsin spokeswoman Anika Rickard said the New Jersey and Virginia races didn't hold any predictions for upcoming races in Wisconsin in her view.\n\n\"Those are very blue states. They've been blue for a while. In the last 13 off-year elections in Virginia, in only one has the party that controls the White House won the governor's race. So it's not unexpected to see the results there and in New Jersey,\" Rickard said.\n\n\"I don't think it says a lot about whether or not there will be a blue wave next year. I think Democrats are really gripping onto that, to energize their base, but I don't see that coming to fruition in Wisconsin.\"\n\nDevin Remiker, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, disagreed, saying potential voters are telling party volunteers they aren't happy with household prices — an issue he identified as driving the results of the elections earlier this month.\n\n\"In the races across the country, there was a resounding rejection of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. And something that wasn't surprising to me was that voters are rejecting Republican candidates largely because they have disappointed them on the most critical issue, which is the cost of living and inflation,\" Remiker said.\n\nJust days after the Democratic victories, Democrats relented on a strategy to push Republicans to include an extension of Obamacare subsidies in a new bill to fund the federal government.\n\nMore: 7 in 10 want ACA subsidies to continue, Marquette poll says\n\nA recent national Marquette University Law School poll showed voters across the political spectrum disapproved of the way Trump handled the federal government shutdown, which lasted more than 40 days.\n\nDemocrats forced the shutdown by demanding that any new spending bill include the subsidies. But at the end, a group of Democrats agreed to vote with Republicans to pass a bill without that provision.\n\nRemiker said he thinks those Democrats gave up momentum.\n\n\"I think the victory that we got out of this process was clearly connecting Republicans to what they have done, which is to further deny people the ability to put food on the table and to leave health care an unanswered question,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the most stark results after election night was how some Republicans were shifting their vote a little bit. It felt like we had momentum on this issue. And I think it was a little too soon to give up that fight.\"\n\nStill, Remiker said new votes on the health care issue will play a key role in Democrats' strategy for the midterms.\n\nMeanwhile, Rickard said Republicans are on better footing for the midterms given voters' low view of Democrats.\n\n\"Trump's approval ratings go up and down. They always have. But one thing that we've seen is the Democrat Party's approval rating continues to sit very low, lower than Republicans,\" she said. \"I think that's more of a devastating sign to them than an up and down polling for us and President Trump. We can always get those polling numbers back up, but Democrats haven't seemed to be able to figure out how to get their polling numbers up.\"\n\nDemocrats could gain from motivated voters\n\nFranklin said the flip side of Trump's approval in Wisconsin, which is higher than the national average, is that Democratic enthusiasm for voting is high and voters continue to be unhappy with the cost of living.\n\n\"When we get to the turnout game of who turns out in a midterm, highly, highly motivated Democrats may expand their turnout advantage a little bit beyond what we've seen in previous years,\" he said.\n\nNearly every statewide office will feature an open race with no incumbent in 2026, with the exception of the offices of attorney general and treasurer.\n\nIn the governor's race, the most high-profile contest in 2026, seven major candidates are running campaigns. In the coming days, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes is expected to join the Democratic primary.\n\nMore: Gilbert: With no incumbent and no big names, the 2026 Wisconsin governor's race is shaping up as unusual\n\nAlso in focus is how the state Legislature might change after the 2026 elections. Under new electoral maps, Democrats have a better chance than in cycles past to pick up more seats.\n\n\"It's easy to imagine Democrats even in a neutral environment picking up a seat or two. If they have some tailwinds because of the national tide pushing in their favor, it's possible they could flip the state Senate,\" Burden said. \"Even if they don't win the governor's race, I would say. There's still a possibility of a kind of split outcome there.\"\n\nMolly Beck can be reached at molly.beck@jrn.com.","url":"https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/24/experts-see-tailwinds-for-wisconsin-democrats-after-recent-elections/87131362007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/04/USAT/87085721007-2244964638.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5600,3151,x0,y291&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 11:04:14","author":"Journal Sentinel","authors":["Journal Sentinel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":381662760,"title":"Charlie Kirk's wife reveals she was 'praying to God' she was pregnant when her husband was killed","text":"Erika Kirk, the widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, said she had been 'praying to God' she was pregnant when her husband was shot and killed in September.\n\nErika was speaking with Megyn Kelly during a live on-stage interview in Arizona on Friday when she revealed how her longing for a larger family sparked the revelation. \n\n'I was praying to God that I was pregnant when he got murdered,' Erika told Kelly during a tour stop in Glendale.\n\n'You told me this in private - How many kids did you want to have?'

He argued that naturalised citizens should not be allowed to hold public office, saying that being raised in the US from birth is “a big part of understanding the country.” The position has implications for current officeholders, including Democratic New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who is naturalised.Haley also called for limiting foreign students in US universities, saying, “Some of them are spies, by the way.” He called for banning dual citizenship, which he described as “the stupidest idea.” He also spoke about disallowing foreign military service, calling it inherently disqualifying for anyone with ties to the US.“You are either American, or you're not an American,” Haley said.Days before that, he argued for halting “legal immigration,” linking it to job scarcity for young Americans. In an interview with UnHerd, he said none of his high-achieving friends could find work a year and a half after graduating.“So when you see a bunch of foreigners coming over here to take jobs that [my friends] wanted,” he said, “they have every right to be pissed, and I'm pissed for them.”Political experts say Haley's appeal is a slow migration away from Trump's original 2016 vision. Thomas Gift, director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London, told Newsweek, “Trump has unleashed a political creature with MAGA one he can no longer fully control… In many ways, Trump is now too tame for parts of the movement he started. That may include rising leaders like Nalin Haley.”Adam Hilton, a politics professor at Mount Holyoke College, said Haley shows a growing trend within the far-right space during Trump's second administration. “The race is on to succeed Trump as the leader of the MAGA movement,” Hilton said, noting a “deep bench” of ambitious contenders.Haley has repeatedly rejected political labels, insisting he does not feel represented by either party. “I don't feel represented by anybody,” he told Carlson.","summary":"Nalin Haley, the 24-year-old son of former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, is now one of the most popular young voices on the American right.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-gen-z-right-finds-a-new-maga-champion-in-nikki-haleys-son-nalin-haley-9688988","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-11/nuhn4ag_nalin-haley_625x300_24_November_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 09:14:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.266},{"id":381680562,"title":"Donald Trump, 79, Demands Reboot of Retired Movie Franchise","text":"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York star Donald Trump is reportedly leaning on one of his billionaire buddies to get his Hollywood studio to resurrect one of his movie favorites.\n\nTrump, 79, is close to Paramount’s owner Larry Ellison, the world’s third-richest man, who has also donated heavily to the president’s campaigns.\n\nEllison’s studio Paramount, which is run by his son David, is set to take over the Warner movie catalogue and production company.

Stone later recalled on his radio show that his answer was a technology company Vance now hears about with increasing frequency: Palantir. For years, Democrats have zeroed in on Vance’s relationship with Palantir’s co-founder Peter Thiel, the iconoclastic tech titan who gave Vance one of his first jobs and later put $15 million behind his successful 2022 Ohio Senate bid. But the pressure on Vance is now coming from inside Trump’s coalition. As the administration steers billions of dollars of new work to Palantir, prominent voices have expressed fears that the firm’s powerful data analytics tools could give the government sweeping, almost futuristic surveillance capabilities. MAGA architect Steve Bannon has likened Palantir to a sci-fi villain while comedian Joe Rogan called the company “creepy” on his top-ranked podcast. The rising unease has put Vance on the defensive. At an October gathering of young conservatives at the University of Mississippi, he bristled at “this internet meme out there that somehow I am super in bed with Palantir” when the company’s name surfaced. “Palantir is a private company,” Vance added. “They sometimes do a useful service, and sometimes they’re going to do things that we don’t like.” Since rising to the national scene, Vance has served as a bridge between the GOP’s populist wing and the tech world he once occupied as a venture capitalist and biotech executive. He joined the Republican ticket last year with the backing of Bannon and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, but also with the expectation he could convince his Silicon Valley allies to open their wallets for the campaign. Palantir’s emergence as an unlikely flashpoint comes amid a growing divide within the party over Trump’s alliance with billionaire technology entrepreneurs. The tensions underscore the challenge ahead for Vance as he takes a leading role in helping to hold together Trump’s movement — a task with clear implications for his own political ambitions. Vance’s office did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Palantir pointed CNN to a lengthy statement the company published in June, which seeks to rebut what it describes as “recurrent misconceptions” about its operations. “We are not a surveillance company,” the statement reads. “We do not sell personal data of any kind. We don’t provide data-mining as a service.” A contracting behemoth Founded two decades ago with a funding boost from American intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a go-to contractor for governments and businesses confronting enormous and complex data problems. Federal agencies, local police departments and foreign militaries increasingly rely on its software and AI models, but so do aerospace companies, hospitals and the makers of a pickleball paddle. Palantir’s government portfolio grew during Trump’s first term and expanded further under President Joe Biden. CEO Alex Karp backed Democrat Kamala Harris for president, but like many of his tech peers, he quickly pivoted after Trump won. A month after the election, Karp contributed $1 million to the leading pro-Trump super PAC. Around the same time, Palantir ads appeared over Trump and Vance’s box at the Army-Navy football game, and the company is among the donors to Trump’s new White House ballroom. Jacob Helberg, a former adviser to Karp, is now a top official in the State Department. Skeptical MAGA activists noticed. Far-right influencer Laura Loomer accused the firm last year of trying to “infiltrate” the incoming administration to secure defense contracts. Nearly every week, another US agency assigns lucrative new work to Palantir. In recent months, the company has been hired by the Department of Homeland Security to vet “wedding-based schemes,” by the Department of Veteran Affairs to track statistics, by the Internal Revenue Service to help cut costs and by the State Department to identify threats to Americans and US diplomats overseas, according to federal contracting data. Palantir’s tools have supported some of Trump’s most contentious priorities, including DOGE’s push to downsize government and the administration’s immigration crackdown. The dozens of contracts awarded to Palantir since Trump took office can be measured in billions of dollars — including a decade-long deal with the US Army worth up to $10 billion. Palantir’s stock price has nearly tripled since Trump was elected. But the expanding footprint inside the government has fueled fears that Palantir’s advanced tools — coupled with cutting edge breakthroughs, like artificial intelligence, facial recognition software and predictive algorithms — could lead to high-tech mass surveillance. A key source of concern for critics on both the right and left is an executive order Trump signed in March commanding agencies to share data with each other, though it doesn’t mention surveillance or Palantir. “I don’t like the stated plans of Palantir,” Stone told Vance, he later recalled to his listeners. “I don’t want Big Brother knowing everything about me.” Palantir has pushed back aggressively against the emerging narrative surrounding its government work. In a recent media blitz, Karp has defensively described Palantir as patriotic. He told Fortune magazine its software is a tool “to make America so strong we never fight.” He has also insisted Palantir programs can’t be used to abuse civil rights, while also dismissing fears about governments tracking their citizens. “The primary evidence for a surveillance state in the West is not government on consumer; it’s a company knowing every single action you have at all times,” he said in an interview with Axios’ Mike Allen. But that hasn’t stopped concerns from reaching Vance. On his show “This Past Weekend,” comedian Theo Von pressed Vance this summer on Palantir and Thiel’s influence, calling the company’s capabilities “really scary.” Vance downplayed Palantir’s role as “just connecting information” between agencies. Like Karp, he contended the relentless collection of data on Americans by private companies in the name of commerce is a greater threat than Palantir’s government work, while also acknowledging that modern technology is “crazy and weird and it affects our privacy.” “The only real protection that we have against that is that we’ve got to elect the right people,” Vance said. Von, a key voice in helping Trump connect with young men last year, later called Vance’s response a “political answer.” MAGA tensions over Big Tech Vance has long tried to square his professed skepticism of Big Tech with his deep ties to some of the industry’s most influential figures. He once wrote that hearing Thiel speak at Yale was the “most significant moment” of his law school years and later joined Thiel’s venture capital firm. When Vance started his own fund in 2020, Thiel joined former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and billionaire investor Marc Andreessen as backers. But during his Ohio Senate campaign, despite Thiel’s generous financial backing, Vance routinely attacked Facebook — where Thiel was an early investor and longtime board member — as well as Google. Probed about Palantir at the Ole Miss event, Vance acknowledged concerns about artificial intelligence facilitating “large-scale surveillance.” He argued he has fought against intrusive data collection practices since he first ran for Senate. “Whether it’s Palantir or any other technology company,” he said. (Palantir insists it doesn’t collect or sell data on individuals.) A Vance spokesperson did not respond to questions about how he has pushed the administration on privacy issues. None of the 213 executive orders Trump has signed since taking office have emphasized data protections for consumers, and this week, Trump publicly threw his support for blocking state regulations on AI companies. Conservative concerns about Big Tech extend beyond Palantir. Bannon has publicly sparred with Elon Musk and questioned Trump’s embrace of Silicon Valley. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has warned about the energy demands of data centers. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, has led congressional investigations into the harms chatbots may cause children. But even as skepticism on the right grows, Vance’s standing in Silicon Valley remains an asset — and a source of speculation. Asked recently by Axios’ Mike Allen whom he hoped would replace Trump, Karp did not name Vance but described a figure who closely resembled the “Hillbilly Elegy” author: someone who could keep the border sealed, uphold conservative cultural norms and “credibly fight for workers.” Allen replied: “That sounds like the current Vice President.”","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/24/politics/jd-vance-palantir-big-tech-maga","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-2025-10-30t001555z-601398160-rc20mhaaps2q-rtrmadp-3-usa-vance.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-24 09:00:58","author":"Steve Contorno","authors":["Steve Contorno"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.155},{"id":381657730,"title":"Trump calls ‘traitor’ Marjorie Taylor Greene a ‘nice person’ as longtime rival Laura Loomer flames ‘parasite’","text":"There was more MAGA rage Saturday following Rep.

So it's got to be more than Mamdani's charisma. Here, we offer up five theories to explain what Vanity Fair's Aidan McLaughlin described as a “lovefest.”\nTrump is powerless in the presence of a beard\nName the powerful bearded politician who made these comments about Donald Trump:\n\n“Trump is a cynical asshole … he’s America’s Hitler.”\n“I don’t think he actually cares about folks.”\n”He’s noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.\"\n\nTed Cruz? No, I said “powerful.” It's Vice-Presdent J.D. Vance! Before Friday, the only things Vance and Mamdani had in common were a track record of Trump opposition and a beard. After Friday, they could add Trump's glowing praise to the list of commonalities. Fox News host Brian Kilmeade might be on a similar track as I am, saying “I think J.D. Vance is jealous\" as he discussed Friday's event.\nTrump watched Heat Thursday night\nEveryone agrees that the coffee shop meeting between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's characters is the most indelible scene in Michael Mann's classic 1995 film Heat. Nemeses in the same room, the grudging respect between hero and villain, the growing understanding that the opposites are far more alike than they realized…it's one of the world's most compelling narratives, from Batman and the Joker to the horseshoe theory.\nMamdani looked in Trump's left eye\nAccording to the New York Post, which appears to be where most of Middle America gets their Zohran Mamdani news, MIT prof Tara Swart says that mothers and their babies bond using right eye to left eye contact. “Most people are right-handed so they’ll be holding their baby in their left arm, so they can use their dominant hand to do stuff,\" she says. “That means when you gaze at your baby, your right eye is looking at their left and then that interaction from the optic nerve is going around the brain.” According to Swart, that eye contact creates an “emotional resonance loop that’s part of how the mother and baby bond.” So, if we assume that Trump was able to keep his eyes open during the private meeting he had with Mamdani prior to the press event, Mamdani might have been able to provide the president with enough maternal good vibes to briefly counteract Trump's awful-sounding upbringing by Fred Trump.\nSome Mamdani-loving billionaire got on the horn\nLong branded a horrific hellhole by Fox News, San Francisco has been bracing for Trump to deploy the National Guard to the famously liberal town since he started rolling troops into Democrat-led cities earlier this year. In October, the incursion seemed inevitable—that is, until a couple oligarchs, including billionaire Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and billionaire Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, called Trump and told him to stand down. Trump complied.\n“One of the things that President Trump is really good at is he’s a really good listener,” Huang told the SF Chronicle about the call. “If you appeal to him, logically, pragmatically, with common sense, he will listen.” Benioff's Mamdami-aligned creds have recently taken a beating, but it wasn’t that long ago that he backed a hefty tax on large corporations to generate funds to fight homelessness. And Benioff was a White House guest on Tuesday, at the president's dinner to fete Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. An ideal time, perhaps, to take the president aside and suggest a warm and friendly approach.\nDonald Trump has been engaging in the greatest long con of all time\nRemember when Donald Trump was on Sex and the City? When he donated to Kamala Harris's campaign when she ran for California Attorney General? When he told CNN “I probably identify more as a Democrat…And it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans”? Some pundits describe his remarkable change in position as a set of craven flip-flops, a symptom of someone who lacks a belief in anything but power, or a sign of “accelerating cognitive decline.”\nBut Occam's Razor is overrated! What if, as Mamdani's election rival Curtis Sliwa claimed last night, “we all got played”? Is Trump about to reveal himself as a deep cover mole for The Resistance? It's 2025, don't rule it out.","summary":"Anyone expecting fireworks when New York City's mayor-elect met with the president was disappointed Friday—unless they were hoping for an explosion of love.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/zohran-mamdani-donald-trump-oval-office-white-house-meeting","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6921d1a394bd3d82a3b1a751/16:9/w_6480,h_3645,c_limit/2247217930","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 20:07:07","author":"Eve Batey","authors":["Eve Batey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.057},{"id":381619680,"title":"Trump ends deportation protection for Somalis in Minnesota","text":"Nov. 22 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump said he is \"immediately\" ending deportation protections for more than 400 Somali immigrants living in Minnesota.\n\nTrumo made the announcement on Truth Social on Friday night.\n\nThe East African nation has had protection since 1991, and it was renewed on Sept. 18, 2024, through March 17, 2026, when Joe Biden was president.\n\n\"I am, as President of the United States, hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota,\" he wrote. \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing.

Maher expressed his surprise at her comments on a recent episode of “Real Time with Bill Maher.”\n\nMichelle Obama, during a November 5 event on her book tour, implied that sexism remains a hurdle in electing a female president. Her comments came just a day after Democratic women Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger achieved significant victories in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, respectively.\n\nReflecting on Kamala Harris’s past electoral defeat to Donald Trump, Obama stated, “As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready.” She further explained her reluctance to run for office, saying, “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman.”\n\nObama’s comments underscore her belief that societal growth is needed, as she remarked, “We got a lot of growing up to do, and there are still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\n‘As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,’ she said, talking about Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump. ‘That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman.’ \n\n‘We got a lot of growing up to do, and there are still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.’\n\nMaher didn’t buy this, instead arguing it came down to the unique weaknesses of the two women who have gotten the Democratic nomination thus far: Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Harris in 2024.\n\n‘To me, this is logical fallacy 101. Just because we weren’t ready or didn’t like the candidates, Hillary and Kamala, doesn’t mean we’re not ready for a woman,’ he said.\n\n‘I think it’s a bad attitude.

The pair unpacked the former first lady’s remarks during the season finale of Real Time, calling her assessment — as Maher put it — “bulls*t.”\n\nMaher zeroed in on Obama’s comments from her book tour stop at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last week, where she opened up about why she has no plans to step into the political arena in 2028, despite persistent speculation.\n\n“She was in the news this week, Michelle Obama. She has a book out. A coffee table book,” Maher said. “Her statement, I was rather shocked by it.\n\n“To me, this is logical fallacy 101. Just because we weren’t ready or didn’t like the candidates, Hillary and Kamala, doesn’t mean we are not ready for a woman.”\n\nObama had told moderator Tracee Ellis Ross that her decision not to run stems from what she sees as a deeper issue in American politics. “As we saw in the past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” she said during the November 5 event. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not. So don’t waste my time.”\n\nShe doubled down, saying, “We got a lot of growing up to do and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\nMaher pushed back by invoking her husband’s historic 2008 victory. “I think it’s a bad attitude. We said we weren’t ready for a black president and someone, I can’t remember who maybe she remembers, said maybe it just has to be the right one,” he joked.\n\nBrazile backed Maher up with a numbers-based rebuttal. “We are ready,” she said, pointing to the popular vote totals from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss to Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’s 2024 defeat. Clinton won 65.8 million votes to Trump’s 62.9 million, while Harris pulled in 75 million in her own losing bid.\n\n“Maybe we should stop talking about it and just do it,” Brazile added, later emphasizing, “We are ready. Eighty percent of American people say, ‘they are ready.’ So the idea that America isn’t ready is bullsh*t. They might not be ready for this one or that one.”\n\nYou can watch a different clip of the panel, which also featured rapper and activist Killer Mike, in Maher’s “Overtime” segment from last night’s episode above.\n\nMaher also stirred things up earlier in the week on his Club Random podcast, where he floated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as a potential White House contender — with one caveat.\n\n“If she had some deprogramming, she could be such a fantastic candidate,” he said of AOC. “She’s never going to resonate with people outside of the bubble she lives in, in the very, very far left.”","summary":"The HBO host pushed back on the former first lady’s take: “Logical fallacy 101.”","url":"https://decider.com/2025/11/22/bill-maher-michelle-obama-america-woman-president/","image":"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bill-maher-112125.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1156","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 14:59:17","author":"Michael Haskoor,mliss1578","authors":["Michael Haskoor","mliss1578"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":381573174,"title":"Bill Maher slams Michelle Obama's 'bad attitude' over claim Americans are too sexist to elect female president","text":"Bill Maher said Michelle Obama is suffering from a 'bad attitude' after she claimed earlier this month that Americans are still not ready to elect a woman to the presidency.\n\n'Her statement, I was rather shocked by it,' Maher during Friday's episode of Real Time With Bill Maher.\n\nMichelle implied that many male voters are sexist and don't want a woman in the White House during a November 5 stop on her book tour. \n\nThis came a day after two Democratic women, Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, cruised to victory in their respective New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races.\n\n'As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain't ready,' she said, talking about Kamala Harris' loss to Trump.

This information comes from a new report.\n\nAccording to insiders speaking with The Guardian, Larry Ellison discussed the potential removal of prominent CNN hosts Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar during conversations with White House officials. The sources noted that the anchors were mentioned due to their lack of favor with former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 81-year-old Oracle co-founder is also said to have considered a shift in programming that would integrate the iconic CBS News program, 60 Minutes, into CNN’s lineup. This consideration follows Paramount’s recent acquisition by his son, David, a deal that Larry Ellison helped finance.\n\nThe report, released on Thursday, has generated buzz within CNN’s New York City headquarters located at Hudson Yards, as reported by Status.\n\nDavid Ellison, who is 42, has reportedly made an undisclosed offer for the entire Warner Bros Discovery portfolio, which includes CNN.\n\nDavid Ellison, 42, has entered an unknown bid for the entire WBD portfolio, including CNN.\n\nLarry and David are the only prospective WBD bidders who want to buy CNN as part of any deal. Others are said to be willing to spin off the ailing cable network into a separate company while focusing on more promising assets like Warner Bros. movie studio and HBO. \n\nLarry Ellison, a well-known GOP donor, donated to Trump’s 2024 campaign and does not play a formal role within Paramount.\n\n He is, however, the company’s primary shareholder – and he fourth-richest man in the world with a net worth of nearly $200billion.\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Paramount for comment on the report Friday. Reps from CNN declined to comment. \n\nBurnett, 49, has been with CNN since 2011 after joining from CNBC. Keilar , 45, joined CNN as a correspondent in 2006, after several years with CBS News. The two have offered critical reporting Trump for years, but are far from the only CNN stars known for targeting the president. \n\nBurnett – currently the host of hour-long primetime program Erin Burnett OutFront – last week tore into the conservative for what she saw as inconsistencies in his story about Jeffrey Epstein on November 13.\n\nOn Thursday, she hosted Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan to criticize Trump for accusing six Democratic lawmakers of of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’ for a video urging members of the military to not follow orders if they are unlawful.\n\nKeilar did the same later in the night on News Central with Congressman Chris Deluzio (D-PA), one of the politicians in the video, calling Trump’s comments ‘outrageous.’\n\nLast year, she tore into the president for his false claims about Haitian immigrants.\n\nThe news comes after former New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss was minted as CBS News’ chief on October 6 after ‘informally consulting’ the network for weeks, a source told the Daily Mail last month.\n\nDavid Ellison personally headhunted Weiss after buying Paramount in July.\n\nShe is said to be keen to hire a new evening news star, with Fox News host Bret Baier and CNN favorite Anderson Cooper among her rumored top picks. Weiss resigned from Times in 2021 to found the Free Press, which was purchased by Ellison in October for roughly $150 million.\n\nAfter being named CEO, Ellison pledged to shed any prior political connotations that may be tied to the company after a string of controversies and claims of ‘deceptive’ editing practices from both Donald Trump and Homeland Security boss Kristi Noem.\n\nBefore the merger, Paramount balked at settling a lawsuit with Trump that claimed a 60 Minutes interview with a then-campaigning Kamala Harris was ‘deceptively edited.’\n\nThe suit was settled for $16million days before the FCC approved the merger. \n\nOther companies who have entered a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery – sans CNN – include NBC News parent Comcast and Netflix.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a recent development, Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of David Ellison,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Billionaire Meets with White House to Discuss Potential CNN Anchor Changes Amid Son&#8217;s Interest in Network Acquisition first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/billionaire-meets-with-white-house-to-discuss-potential-cnn-anchor-changes-amid-sons-interest-in-network-acquisition/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Billionaire-whose-son-wants-to-buy-CNN-held-talks-with.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-22 12:43:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.089}]}
