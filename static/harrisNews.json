She’s on manoeuvres and looking for yet another relaunch’.\n\nAnd in a flurry of activity in October, Meghan popped up in Paris at the Balenciaga Spring-Summer 2026 show nine days ago where her daring white and black outfits made headlines around the world.\n\nToday the Daily Mail revealed that she had asked the brand’s top designer if she could attend – rather than receiving an invite.\n\nBut insiders in the fashion world have said while there were a number of controversies on the trip, her Parisian adventure has been well received in that cossetted world and more appearances at these type of events could follow.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex has had a busy 2025 – but there have been bumps in the road.\n\nIn March there was the launch of her Netflix show With Love, Meghan – but the TV series has suffered poor ratings.\n\nHer Netflix cookery show was savaged by critics following season one in March, and a second season in August. There is also a Christmas special but no confirmation if the show will continue after that.\n\nBritish Vogue suggested the first episode alone left them confused, asking ‘why does Meghan chop onions so slowly?’ and ‘why does Meghan need edible flowers next to her cooker?’ \n\nThe Spectator branded the second series ‘just as ghastly as season one’, adding Meghan risks ‘dwindling into obscurity’. \n\nBut even with celebrity guests including Chrissy Teigen, John Legend and Tan France, many critics argued the show lacks substance – and claim Meghan failed to be authentic. \n\nFive years ago, Harry and Meghan secured a lucrative contract thought to be worth $100million (£74million) with Netflix after quitting as senior working royals in 2020.\n\nBut in August, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex signed a new ‘multi-year, first look deal for film and television projects’ with Netflix – a downgrade on their previous contract. \n\nThe new arrangement means Netflix can say yes or no to new film or TV projects before anyone else – but there is no guarantee of work and a person familiar with the deal says Netflix is loosening its ties with the couple.\n\nHer Spotify podcast Archetypes ended and her Confessions Of A Female Founder podcast was not universally liked with her episode with friend Jamie Kern Lima widely lampooned.\n\nThe Guardian said: ‘Meghan’s sycophantic interview podcast is stomach-turning’.\n\nShe also launched her lifestyle business As Ever with items selling out almost immediately. \n\nAt first glance it appeared to be a wildly successful but some experts have accused As Ever of using a PR strategy using small product runs that don’t amount to huge sales.\n\nExperts have also warned that her latest launch – a 2024 Sauvignon Blanc – is ‘risky’ following a muted reaction to her last rosé launch. \n\nAlthough the former working royal would not share specific figures, she told Bloomberg’s Emily Chang in August that she has ordered a million jam jars and lids for future sales. \n\nIn September it emerged she seemingly closed down ShopMy website, which sold items such as £20 ($26) grey t-shirts to £1,600 ($2,000) silk gowns.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex, 44, will speak to Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell in Washington DC on Tuesday at a starry event also featuring the likes of former Vice President Kamala Harris and pop star Selena Gomez. \n\nShe will discuss life as the founder of her As ever lifestyle business, her new products and ‘navigating entrepreneurship in the public eye and building a brand that will endure’. \n\nTheir chat, titled Next Level Influence, will also cover how Meghan plans to build a ‘successful, long-lasting business empire’. \n\nIn the past year, Meghan has returned to Instagram, launched her Confessions Of A Female Founder podcast, appeared in her own Netflix cookery show, and launched a range of lifestyle products and website. \n\n‘She joins us to discuss the opportunities and challenges of life as a high-profile, highly scrutinised founder, as well as how she plans to leverage her significant influence to build a successful, long-lasting business empire,’ the blurb from Fortune read. \n\nMeghan’s first range of lifestyle products with her As ever brand sold out just minutes after going live when it first launched in April.\n\nHowever, experts later theorised this was a ‘common marketing ploy’ as items had only been made in small quantities, while later launches including her rosé wine failed to sell out. \n\nHer trip tomorrow also comes in the wake of a busy few weeks following Meghan’s solo appearance at Paris Fashion Week, and then a joint trip to New York City with her husband Prince Harry to receive a ‘Humanitarians of the Year’ award. \n\nThe Duchess of Sussex used her acceptance speech to voice fears about Archie and Lilibet growing up in a digital age – hours after the Princess of Wales visited a children’s charity and warned that excessive screen time can harm family life.\n\nMeghan was also praised as ‘a mother, wife, entrepreneur, and philanthropist’ as she received the award. Harry’s work with mental health companies and his controversial 2021 memoir Spare were listed among his achievements. \n\nThe competing events, 3,500 miles apart, could stir up trouble and pour cold water on hopes of peace talks between the warring Windsors.\n\nThe Daily Mail revealed that a friend of the Sussexes has predicted: ‘Meghan will return to Britain before the year is out’ and could come bearing ‘humble pie’.\n\nThe couple are apparently planning their reconciliation with the royal family in a secret plot dubbed: ‘Project Thaw’. There have been claims that William could even meet Harry – but he is not willing to do so with Meghan present.\n\nHer Washington DC appearance tomorrow is her first at the event in five years. \n\nIn October 2020, Meghan previously spoke at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Next Gen Virtual Summit to discuss ‘courageous leadership’ and share how she learned to ‘lead on a global stage’. \n\nShe looked elegant in a $328 blue and white strappy dress from African American designer Tracy Reese’s sustainable label Hope for Flowers for the occasion. \n\nHowever, it was reported at the time that guests would need to pay $1,750 for the privilege, with tickets to the summit limited to invited guests willing to pay the hefty registration fee. \n\nA month earlier, she joined a virtual conversation with senior Fortune editor Ellen McGirt. \n\nDuring their conversation, she insisted that she does not actually focus on anything written about her – be it negative or positive – turning to a quote from artist Georgia O’Keeffe to express her views about ‘flattery and criticism’. \n\n‘I have already settled it for myself so flattery and criticism go down the same drain and I am quite free,’ she quoted at the time, while adding her own sentiments, claiming that she feels ‘liberated’ from opinions about her. \n\n‘And the moment you are able to be liberated from all these other opinions of what you know to be true, then I think it’s just very easy to just live with peace and live with authenticity,’ she said. ‘And that is how I choose to move through the world.’ \n\nThe announcement about Meghan’s return to the summit comes after she and Prince Harry were named ‘Humanitarians of the Year’ during Project Healthy Minds’ World Mental Health Day Gala which took place on Thursday. \n\nAs they accepted the award, Meghan expressed the couple’s fears about how social media exposure will impact their children, Lilibet and Archie, six. \n\nShe said: ‘Our children, Archie and Lili, are just six and four years old. Luckily still too young for social media, but we know that day is coming.\n\n‘Like so many parents, we think constantly about how to embrace technology’s benefits, while safeguarding against its dangers.’\n\nWhile the Duke of Sussex, 41, was honoured as ‘a humanitarian, mental health advocate, environmentalist, and military combat veteran’, Meghan was noted as a ‘mother, wife, entrepreneur, and philanthropist’. \n\nA week prior, Meghan was seen in the audience at Paris Fashion Week, but, despite it being her first attempt to be taken seriously by the world of high fashion, found her whirlwind tour beset by gaffes and awkward moments.\n\nShe also shared an awkward kiss with Balenciaga’s designer Pierpaolo Piccioli – and ended up butting heads with him as they leaned in for an embrace.\n\nShe then faced claims she may have made yet another front row blunder, with video emerging of her appearing to laugh as a model took a tumble on the Balenciaga catwalk, next to her stony-faced friend.\n\n When her friend didn’t seem amused, Meghan turned back around to watch the show with a more neutral expression, though a representative insisted she was not laughing at the model falling. \n\nMeghan had to ask for an invite to her catwalk debut on her polarising Paris trip, Balenciaga’s top designer revealed.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex said the visit to Fashion Week in the French capital was ‘the culmination of many years of…friendship’ with Pierpaolo Piccioli.\n\nBut Mr Piccioli has been rather more muted in his response, suggesting that their friendship is one of casual texting.\n\nIn a new interview the celebrated clothing designer revealed that Meghan had asked him if she could attend – rather than him sending her an invite.\n\nBut Mr Piccioli did say it was a ‘beautiful surprise’ and had helped keep her Paris visit to his show secret.\n\nWhen asked about Meghan’s trip – and her two outfits – he said: ‘Meghan and I met some years ago, and we’ve been texting ever since. She reached out and said she’d love to come to the show’.\n\nHe added: ‘There was no strategy or big orchestration’.\n\nMeghan’s decision to take a 10,000-mile round trip to Paris Fashion Week came straight out of the blue, Piccioli confirmed, and he helped her keep it secret.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMeghan Markle appears to be on &#8216;manoeuvres&#8217; after a string of public&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Meghan Markle Sparks Rumors of a Comeback Plan first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/meghan-markle-sparks-rumors-of-a-comeback-plan/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Meghan-Markle-has-set-tongues-wagging-that-shes-plotting-relaunch.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-14 00:10:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.469},{"id":368958628,"title":"'It's Meghan Markle 3.0': Why the duchess has set tongues wagging that she's plotting another Sussex relaunch 'as she holds cosy meeting with new editor of US Vogue'","text":"Meghan Markle appears to be on 'manoeuvres' after a string of public events in the US and Europe with more on the way this week.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex is set to lecture on life as a 'high-profile business founder' as she makes an appearance at Fortune's Most Powerful Women summit in Washington DC tomorrow.\n\nLast week Meghan made a string of public appearances in New York with Prince Harry where the couple were handed a Humanitarians of the Year award and were stars at a Mental Health Day Festival.\n\nThe Sussexes were also pictured heading for a slap-up lunch with friend and tennis legend Serena Williams in the Big Apple's Soho House.\n\nBut experts suspect a PR blitz with a photograph emerging today of her said to be holding a solo meeting with the new editor of American Vogue, Chloe Malle, in a quiet corner of the luxurious Whitby Hotel in Manhattan.\n\nThe Daily Mail has asked both the Sussexes and Vogue to comment on the talks.\n\nMeghan was also spotted without her husband visiting her friend Gloria Steinem, arguably one of America's most influential liberal activists and feminists who has been a vocal supporter of Meghan post-Megxit.\n\nAnd in a flurry of activity in October, Meghan popped up in Paris at the Balenciaga Spring-Summer 2026 show nine days ago where her daring white and black outfits made headlines around the world.\n\nOne leading PR guru with clients in the US and UK told the Daily Mail: 'It's Meghan 3.0.

Let’s go.”\n\nOn Monday’s episode of The View, Farah Griffin did not wear a MAGA hat but did praise Trump’s role in securing the ceasefire, which she said would be a “historic, massive diplomatic achievement” if the peace deal holds.\n\nShe added: “I think everyone should be able to celebrate it. And listen, whether you like Trump or not, I think he, Steve Witkoff, and I think Jared Kushner do deserve credit for this deal. They personally met with Hamas. \n\n“I used to be of the mind we don’t negotiate with terrorists, but sometimes the only way to get peace is to sit down with some of the most evil people and try to come up with what we can do to end the bloodshed. So, thank God, I pray that this peace holds.”\n\nAt the summit in Egypt where the deal was signed, Trump spoke of how moved he was by seeing Israeli hostages being reunited with their families.\n\n“It's a beautiful thing to see,” he said. “In one sense, it's so horrible that it could have taken place, but in another sense, it's so beautiful to see a new and beautiful day is rising.”","summary":"The View’s Alyssa Farah Griffin made the pronouncement in December 2024","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/donald-trump-jr-the-view-maga-israel-hostages-b2844685.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/13/21/37/GettyImages-2033750267.jpeg?crop=6000,4000,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/DtREnAHr-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-13 23:35:37","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":368964474,"title":"Elon Musk Targets Hardware and Software With New Microsoft Competitor","text":"Elon Musk has set out an expansive brief for “Macrohard”, a platform initiative incubated within xAI that he says will span software and steer hardware ecosystems through partners, much like Apple. \n\nIn a post on X, Musk wrote the following: \n\n“The @xAI MACROHARD project will be profoundly impactful at an immense scale.” \n\nHe added: “Our goal is to create a company that can do anything short of manufacturing physical objects directly, but will be able to do so indirectly, much like Apple has other companies manufacture their phones.”\n\nThe @xAI MACROHARD project will be profoundly impactful at an immense scale 😉 Our goal is to create a company that can do anything short of manufacturing physical objects directly, but will be able to do so indirectly, much like Apple has other companies manufacture their… https://t.co/7mDcBOxFLi— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 12, 2025\n\nThe positioning signals a full-stack challenge to Microsoft at the platform level rather than a single application or service.

Her latest album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” released Oct. 3, sold more than 4 million copies in its first week—which is quite a lot for someone the president of the United States says is “no longer hot.”\n\nDespite President Donald Trump’s August claim that the “tide” was turning against Swift and her “woke” music, she has officially broken Adele’s record for most album sales in one week. \n\nSwift has built herself into an international success, cementing her place at the throne of musical greats, and—despite what Trump says—she isn’t going anywhere. But this feud might outlast us all. \n\nSwift first started voicing opposition to Republicans in 2018, when she spoke out against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. \n\n“She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. “She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values,” she wrote on Instagram at the time.\n\nTrump responded to Swift’s post by saying that he liked her a little less.\n\n“You know, Marsha Blackburn is doing a very good job in Tennessee, she’s leading now substantially, which she should,” Trump, who had a track record of praising Swift, said to reporters. “She’s a tremendous woman. I’m sure Taylor Swift doesn’t know anything about her. And let’s say that I like Taylor’s music about 25% less now, okay?” \n\nThe two celebrities haven’t had a clear connection outside of appearing in ads together, but Swift did briefly date Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s son, Conor Kennedy, in 2012. Though it’s unclear how close she ever ran with Trump’s circle.\n\nThen in 2020, Swift called out Trump’s incendiary approach to politics amid protests following the police murder of George Floyd. \n\n\"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence?

We will vote you out in November,” she wrote on X.\n\nAnd while Trump was ultimately voted out in 2020, Swift expressed her opposition to his 2024 campaign after Trump used an AI-generated ad stating that she supported his run.\n\n“Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site,” she wrote on Instagram in September 2024. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.”\n\nContinuing, she said, “I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for [Harris] because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.”\n\nBut Trump’s public disdain toward celebrities who don’t support him isn’t just limited to Swift. \n\nSeemingly in disbelief that stars like Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen could support his opponent, Trump claimed that Harris was using campaign funds to pay celebrities for their endorsements.\n\n“According to news reports, Beyoncé was paid $11,000,000 to walk onto a stage, quickly ENDORSE KAMALA, and walk off to loud booing for never having performed, NOT EVEN ONE SONG!” he wrote on Truth Social in May. “THIS IS AN ILLEGAL ELECTION SCAM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL!”\n\nBut despite Trump’s best efforts, Democrat-supporting artists like Swift seem to be doing just fine without his support.","summary":"No amount of hate will stop Taylor Swift from reaching new heights.

For perhaps the first time in either of Trump’s two terms, partisan Democrats and members of the media publicly acknowledged that he deserved credit. \"If you can’t give Donald Trump credit for what he did on Hamas and Israel, you are a totally blind partisan,\" said former CNN journalist and longtime Trump critic Chris Cillizza. Presidential historian and former Biden speechwriter Jon Meacham agreed, calling it a \"terrific day\" for Trump and for the hostage families. \"We can go on and on about the various chapters, but we should make no mistake about this: This is a victory for President Trump and for those who wish that we can govern ourselves at home and around the world not simply by brute force, but by ideas and civilized norms,\" Meacham said during an appearance on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\" on Monday. Even the hosts of \"The View\" struggled to find a negative angle. Alyssa Farah Griffin, who presents herself as conservative but frequently nods along with her liberal co-hosts, said: \"Listen, whether you like Trump or not, I think he, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner do deserve credit for this deal. They personally met with Hamas. I used to believe we shouldn’t negotiate with terrorists, but sometimes the only way to get peace is to sit down with some of the most evil people and figure out how to end the bloodshed. So thank God, I pray this peace holds,\" Griffin said. Griffin previously vowed to wear a red MAGA hat if Trump ever freed the Israeli hostages. If she keeps her word, now would be the time. In another sign of the shifting tone, CNN host Abby Phillip criticized one of the most protected figures in American politics for refusing to acknowledge Trump’s role in the peace deal. \"Honestly, it’s not unfair to say, if President Obama is going to write a whole post about a peace deal, maybe he should acknowledge the president who brokered it,\" Phillip said during CNN’s \"Table for Five.\" Be careful, Abby. We aren't sure if MS Now is hiring… Even the two Democrats who Trump defeated for the presidency could not deny his achievement. \"I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region, for committing to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what’s often called the day after,\" Hillary Clinton told CBS’s Norah O’Donnell on Friday. It took her a few deep breaths, but Vice President Kamala Harris eventually echoed similar sentiments. \"I don’t think we should hold any credit where it’s due. I really do hope it becomes real, that the hostages are out, that Gaza is no longer being treated with such brutality of force, that aid goes in. And I commend the people who have been a part of this process. I commend the Qataris, the Egyptians, and the president,\" Harris told MSNBC. Of course, the brief acknowledgment from Democrats and the media will likely give way to familiar partisanship by this time next week. However, the significance of this achievement cannot be overstated. The peace deal represents one of the most consequential foreign policy victories of this generation. If it holds, bringing peace to the Middle East will stand as a defining accomplishment in Trump’s legacy. Anyone attempting to diminish that reality forfeits credibility. The deal also serves as a definitive rejection of the reckless, dishonest and inflammatory comparisons between Trump and Adolf Hitler that dominated political discourse for years. Those who made them can never do so again, at least not in good faith. Attention now turns to the more radical members of the Democratic Party who have yet to acknowledge the peace agreement in the conflict they have spent years exploiting for political gain. We are referring to Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zohran Mamdani, none of whom have commented as of publication.","summary":"Trump earns rare praise from Democrats and the media after brokering a peace deal that frees 20 Israeli hostages from Hamas.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/trump-freeing-israeli-hostages-forced-even-even-democrats-media-give-him-credit","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/08/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 22:30:05","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.097},{"id":368953578,"title":"This far-right 'influencer' is among MAGA’s 'most powerful women' — but Trump allies can’t stand her","text":"During the United States' 2024 presidential election, far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer's comments about Democratic nominee Kamala Harris were so racist that even MAGA Rep.

Katie Porter, who has been leading Democrats in all polls, went viral on the internet. It reinforced persistent rumors and evidence that Porter comes off as combative and angry. (Incidentally, have you seen the president of the United States lately?)\n\nIn the clip, a CBS Sacramento reporter asks Porter what she’d say to the 40 percent of California voters who voted for Trump, “who you’ll need in order to win” the governorship, about backing the redistricting ballot measure intended to counter Trump’s gerrymandering scheme. (That ballot measure is almost certainly going to win, by the way.) “How would I need them in order to win, ma’am?” Porter replied, questioning the premise.\n\nThat’s pretty much correct; a Democrat is going to win the governor’s race in California next year, without needing Trump voters. It’s true that in a state with a primary system where the top two vote-getters advance regardless of party, Porter could find herself facing a fellow Democrat, with Trump voters as the swing. But every Democrat in the race is also backing the redistricting measure, and the makeup of the race, which has a half-dozen Democrats and only two prominent Republicans, makes it overwhelmingly likely that it will be a traditional Democratic-Republican general election.\n\nOf course, this wasn’t why the clip went viral. It’s because Porter got angry about follow-up questions and threatened to walk out of the interview. (“Threatened” is the operative word; she stayed and answered questions for 20 minutes after that clip.) It played into an impression that Porter was a hothead without the proper temperament to be governor.\n\nPorter’s opponents were obviously waiting to pounce on this, because a bunch of other hit pieces flew out almost immediately. One involved Porter yelling at a staffer on a Zoom call to get out of her “fucking shot,” and another was a series of text messages to the mayor of Irvine that had already been public for years. This was followed by the obligatory “campaign in disarray” Politico piece.\n\nThere is no doubt that Porter has a bad reputation as a manager, something that has been long whispered about. We should be honest that people berating their staff really stinks. But we can also be honest about what’s going on in this gubernatorial race.\n\nPorter is disliked by the Sacramento establishment, not because of her interpersonal skills but because she’s more populist than they’d like and more willing to challenge the corporate interests that rule California politics. Her 2024 Senate election was derailed by millions of dollars from the crypto industry. (There’s actually a crypto cutout in this race now named Ian Calderon, who wants to “make California the undisputed leader on Bitcoin.”)\n\nWhen Kamala Harris passed on the race and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis dropped out, the establishment was left without a candidate. Former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former state Controller Betty Yee, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, and rich guy Stephen Cloobeck have done little for voters. So the establishment has been desperately trying to get Sen. Alex Padilla to jump in, seeing him as someone they “can work with.” The viral Porter video provided an opening to knock down the frontrunner and signal to Padilla that it is a race he can win.\n\nIt won’t be so simple. Porter got the EMILYs List endorsement last week, and Teamsters California and other supporters haven’t abandoned her amid this firestorm. We’ll see what the polls say, but her momentum doesn’t seem to have been reversed, and the plan by California’s establishment to dictate who controls the state isn’t quite locked in.","summary":"Today on TAP: The political establishment in California saw their moment and pounced.","url":"https://prospect.org/politics/katie-porter-california-governor-race-democrats/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/23668/download/Katie%20Porter.jpg?cb=b71c7b0468b63963ed68d2b70968057a&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 19:00:00","author":"David Dayen","authors":["David Dayen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.433},{"id":368903424,"title":"Trump and Macron continue their ongoing handshake contest with bizarre 'arm-wrestle' as they greet each other at peace summit","text":"Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron continued their ongoing handshake contest with a bizarre 'arm-wrestle' as they greeted each other at Monday's peace summit.\n\nThe duo's uncomfortable 'death clasp' handshakes have gone viral over the years, with footage from 2017 showing the two leaders locking hands for 29 seconds straight.\n\nAnd they almost matched that during their most recent meeting ahead of the US president's landmark speech on the day 20 living Israeli hostages were released home and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners delivered by the busload to the West Bank.\n\nTrump drew his French counterpart in for a warm handshake before the pair each placed an affection hand on the other's upper arm in front of a large crowd of photographers.\n\nThe embrace soon turned into something akin to an arm wrestle as the two presidents exchanged what seemed like intense conversation while swinging their opposite number's hand from side to side.\n\nMacron eventually freed himself from Trump's grasp and hurried off the stage ahead of a busy day in Jerusalem.\n\nThe US president trumpeted 'the dawn of a new Middle East' during a speech before the Israeli parliament later in the afternoon, just over two years after Hamas militants invaded Israel and sparked a harrowing war in Gaza that wiped out about 67,000 of its population. \n\n'Israel, with our help, has won all that they can by force of arms,' Trump told the Knesset while appealing directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the leader to strive for peace rather than armed conflict.\n\n'You've won. Now it's time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East.'\n\nFor the first time in two years, Hamas no longer has any Israeli captives. Over 1,900 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel will also be set free as part of the deal.\n\nMacron and Trump's relationship has sparked interest among global onlookers over the last eight years and has often been punctuated with enthusiastic handshakes, bordering on the bizarre.\n\nIn February, the pair awkwardly shook hands three times as they met in Washington DC to discuss a possible end to Russia's war against Ukraine. \n\nBody language expert Judi James referred to the shake outside the White House as a 'death clasp'.\n\n'With the eyes and the fate of the world currently resting on their shoulders,' James told the Daily Mail, 'this latest handshake greeting was always going to be riddled with signals of superior power and dominance.'\n\nDuring a May 2017 meeting ahead of the NATO summit in Brussels, Trump and Macron gripped hands so tightly that their knuckles turned white and their jaws clenched.\n\nMacron said at the time that the clinch of a handshake was 'not innocent' and meant to be a 'moment of truth' showing his US counterpart that the French leader would not be intimidated.\n\nThey shared several more bizarre handshakes during Trump's first term, which ended in January 2021.\n\nIn December 2024, after Trump won reelection over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, he and Macron were reunited in Paris for the reopening of the Notre Dame, which had been severely damaged in a April 2019 fire.\n\nTrump and Macron were back at it with the intense handshakes during that trip.\n\nThe watershed moment in Jerusalem on Monday solidifies Trump's transition from New York dealmaker to global peacemaker. This was evident when the Knesset honored the US president with a nearly three-minute standing ovation and broke out in cheers, chanting 'Trump, Trump, Trump...'\n\nThe US president also extended an olive branch to Israel's chief regional rival, Iran, saying, 'The hand of friendship and cooperation is open.' Trump further noted that his next project is 'getting Russia done' and ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nTrump's daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also received major applause. Kushner and Witkoff have been praised by Trump and the Israelis for their central role in negotiating the details of the peace agreement.\n\nStill, there are already questions whether the ceasefire can hold beyond the release of hostages and prisoners.\n\nOver the weekend, a senior Hamas official told AFP that disarmament is ‘out of the question,' declaring that demands for the group to hand over its weapons are non-negotiable.\n\nAnd Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has emphasized that the current ceasefire is temporary and that Israel retains the option to resume its military operations if Hamas fails to meet the terms of the agreement, particularly regarding disarmament.\n\nWhile the president was speaking, a protest briefly broke out during Trump's remarks as a Knesset member banged on his desk and began shouting.

The exchange crystallized a growing rift in the Democratic Party.\n\nFor Klein, Coates’s dismissal of Kirk and his followers sounded too much like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s famous lines from her 2016 speech at an LGBT fundraiser in New York City. Klein played the full quote for Coates.\n\n“You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,” Clinton began.\n\n“They’re racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that, and he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people but now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets. They’re offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric. Now, some of those folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully, they are not American,” Clinton finished.\n\nAfter the clip ended, Klein asked Coates, “What do you think when you hear that?”\n\n“She probably shouldn’t have said it,” Coates began before Klein cut him off. \n\nKlein pressed, “But you think it’s true?” \n\nCoates replied, “I mean, it’s probably not how I would say it, but you know, I mean, there are things that I would say.” In other words, yes, Coates agrees with Clinton’s premise that large swaths of Americans do, in fact, have deplorable ideas and are irredeemable.\n\nKlein then made the case that by refusing to engage with people who disagree with Democrats on certain cultural issues, the party is making it harder for the Left to wield political power. \n\n“I think in many ways we’ve stopped doing politics,” Klein said. “We’ve written a lot of people off, and in writing them off, we are losing and we are unable to protect ourselves, unable to protect them, just unable to make a good change in the world.”\n\nCoates eventually mustered three responses. First, he claimed this isn’t really his problem. “I shouldn’t be running for president of the United States. You know what I mean?” Coates said. “And my expectations for the rhetoric of writers, intellectuals, journalists, etc., is very, very different than what the expectation should be for people who you know expect to hold office.”\n\nKlein responded by noting that “political strategy” is downstream from “political culture” and that what Coates says about whom Democrats should and should not engage with does affect how Democratic politicians behave. He mentioned activists attacking Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for speaking to alleged transphobe Joe Rogan. Coates seemed to accept that he has a role in deciding who is and is not acceptable for Democratic politicians to engage with. \n\nCoates next denied that the Democrats have a problem that needs addressing. He pointed out that Klein made the case that former President Joe Biden shouldn’t have run and added, “I think, you know, obviously I think sexism is a very, very real force,” implying that former Vice President Kamala Harris lost because she is a woman.\n\nKlein wasn’t satisfied with this answer either. He pointed out that it took 60 senators to pass Obamacare in 2010, with senators from Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, and Missouri. “It has become easier to imagine the end of the country than winning a Senate seat in Missouri,” Klein said. In other words, if Democrats want to accomplish anything, barely eking out victories with the current constituency isn’t going to work.\n\nWhat Democrats need to do, Klein argued, is allow Democratic candidates in red states to take positions that Coates would consider deplorable. “Do people feel like even if they disagree with us on some things that they have a place with us?” Klein asked rhetorically.\n\n“We have come to the view that a pretty wide variety of people are in some ways kind of deplorables,” Klein said.\n\nCoates objected to Klein bringing up the “deplorables” line again.\n\n“So when you ask me about that Hillary Clinton line … I would never say it like that,” Coates explained. “I don’t even focus on people like that. Look, I am at war with certain ideologies and ideas, and I want them expunged. I want to turn them into phrenology. That’s what I want.”\n\nBut is that what Democrats are really fighting now, ideologies that are demonstrably false, like phrenology? \n\nKlein and Coates touched on other issues, including immigration and affirmative action, but most of their conversation centered on gender ideology. And science is simply not on the Democrats’ side.\n\nCoates and Klein may wish it were not so, but sex is binary. All male mammals are fundamentally different from female mammals, and this includes humans. Now, there are some extremely rare genetic disorders, such as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, in which women with female genitalia are born with XY chromosomes and no ovaries, but these are usually women who consider themselves women and only find out about their condition when menstruation fails to occur during puberty. Almost all of them go on to live their lives as women.\n\nThis is not what is happening in the contagion of young girls who suddenly want to be boys and men who suddenly decide they want to be women. If a grown man wants to dress up as a woman, that is fine. But no American is under any obligation to participate in his delusion. And no young woman should be forced to share a bathroom with a biological man pretending to be a woman.\n\nNeither Coates nor Klein ever even acknowledged the very real harm their transgender delusions inflict on vulnerable women who want single-sex safe spaces.\n\nCoates brought up the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement, arguing that it took more than just excluding unapproved voices to achieve political progress. It took outright violence. But is this an actual comparison the Democratic Party wants to stake its electoral viability on? That the struggle to put men in women’s locker rooms is the same as ending bathrooms separated by race?\n\nCoates later said politics is “a contest of ideas and narratives” and that his “role as a writer is to state things as clearly as I possibly can to make them in such a way that they haunt, to state truths, and to reinforce the animating notion of my politics.”\n\nGood luck convincing the 70% of people who believe that, like every other mammal on the planet, a human’s biological sex is determined at birth. \n\nCoates also took issue with Kirk’s views on immigration, decrying his rhetoric about Haitians in particular “coming into the country” and “raping your daughters.” Kirk’s inflammatory rhetoric aside, there is no acknowledgment by Coates or Klein that Democratic Party elites are far outside the mainstream on immigration as well.\n\nBiden’s “humanitarian” catch-and-release policies at the southern border allowed over 5 million illegal immigrants into the country in just four years, the largest illegal immigrant invasion in our nation’s history. Where is Coates’s compassion for the American citizens who now face longer wait times in emergency rooms, can’t find affordable housing, and have half their children’s class filled with students who can’t speak English?\n\nCoates doesn’t care about their plight. In Coates’s mind, anyone who expresses any discomfort with the mass migration policies of the Biden administration is no better than a Confederate secessionist.\n\nKlein succinctly summarized the difference between him and Coates. “I think from your perspective and from my perspective, we probably don’t believe hugely different things,” Klein began. “A huge amount of the country, right, a majority of the country believes things about trans people, about what policy should be towards trans people, about what language is acceptable to trans people that we would see as fundamentally and morally wrong, right?”\n\nCoates agreed. \n\nKlein continued, “What politically should our relationship with those people be? Do we win them over? Do we compromise with them?”\n\n“I’m all for unifying,” Coates continued. “I’m all for bridging gaps, but not at the expense of my neighbor’s humanity.”\n\nAnd this is the real question the Democratic Party now faces: On which issues is it willing to deny the fantastical claims of the base so it can expand its tent?\n\nAre Democrats willing to admit that men should not be allowed in women’s locker rooms?\n\nAre they willing to deport an illegal immigrant whose only crime is being in the country illegally?\n\nAre they willing to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion policies even if it means more Asians and fewer other minorities in higher education?\n\nFor Coates, the answer appears to be “no.”\n\n“If you think it is OK to dehumanize people,” Coates explained, “then conversation between you and me is probably not possible.”\n\nThe problem for Democrats is that Coates has a rather reductive view of who is and is not worthy of human dignity. In his book Between the World and Me, Coates writes of the first responders, police, and firefighters who gave their lives to save others on 9/11: “They were not human to me.”\n\nThe Democratic Party’s capacity for empathizing with others is quite selective. It includes men who believe they are women and illegal immigrants but does not include women who want single-sex spaces or parents who want their children’s classmates to be able to speak English. \n\nUntil Democratic Party elites like Coates and Klein are able to empathize with the very real pain being felt by the “deplorables,” they will continue to lose elections.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Gavin Newsom signs law banning new Glock sales in California","text":"Glocks are among the most popular handguns sold in California. Even former Vice President Kamala Harris owns one. But Californians will no longer be able to buy a new Glock gun in the state.Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that bans the sale of new Glock guns in California.At issue, the new Glock design allows the gun to be easily modified with a Lego-sized piece of plastic known as a \"Glock Switch\" that can be 3-D printed to turn it into a fully automatic weapon. Glock \"switches\" are already illegal, but Democratic lawmakers in California went one step further by passing a bill along party lines that outlaws the sale of any new gun with a Glock-like design. The new law does not ban possession of Glocks, nor does it ban reselling used Glocks in California.Southern California Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who introduced Assembly Bill 1127, said he hopes this legislation forces Glock to change its design so \"switches\" no longer work. \"They (Glock) have known about this design flaw for a long time,\" Gabriel said to CBS News California. \"They could help save lives.\"California is the third-largest U.S. market for gun sales. Gun store owner Eddie Ford explained that, unlike some other handguns, Glocks are designed to be customizable. He noted that the design of the Glock has remained the same due to \"its ultra-reliability.\" Newer models of Glocks do have an added piece that is intended to block the Glock switch. But California's attorney general hasn't approved that model for sale here.Ford acknowledged, realistically, someone could easily file that added piece off in about a minute. Despite the new law, Ford said that California gun stores like his will keep selling used Glocks, and he doesn't expect this bill to reduce the number of incidents where Glock switches are used.\"Because there are still millions of Glocks on the streets,\" he said. \"If criminals want them, they're going to get them.\"Deborah Grimes lost her only son, Greg \"Najee' Grimes, when he was shot seven times with a modified Glock. Najee was shot and killed in a downtown Sacramento nightclub in 2022. The gunman fired 11 rapid shots into a crowd, with seven hitting Najee.\"Had he been shot maybe once, even twice, I feel that he would have been able to survive that,\" Grimes said. Najee was a star football player, a coach, and a mentor to special needs kids. He is now the reason for Deborah Grimes' mission with the advocacy group Moms Demand Action.It was the second mass shooting in the shadow of the California State Capitol in just three months and one of 55 statewide that year.The shooter used a Glock handgun, modified with a Glock Switch.\"There was just too much damage because that Glock 'switch' was a killing machine,\" Grimes said of her son's shooting. Najee's murder garnered national attention, even being featured on \"America's Most Wanted\" while law enforcement officials were still searching for a suspect. Now, his mom hopes her advocacy will have a national impact.\"I hope that Glock moves forward to make the (design) change,\" Grimes said. If Glock were to redesign the gun, it could be sold in California again. However, the current design was grandfathered in before California passed its stringent gun certification laws in 2001. A new design would have to go through a lengthy certification process. AB 1127 was passed by the California legislature on a party-line vote, with all Republican assemblymembers in opposition. \"By specifically targeting the potential for modification, this bill disproportionately affects potential Glock purchasers and restricts access to one of the most popular handguns available,\" Republican lawmakers outlined in their analysis of the bill. Glock did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Glocks are among the most popular handguns sold in California. Gov.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nNo tax on tips, a campaign promise by President Donald Trump, is now part of the U.S. tax code – but experts across the political spectrum see limited benefits for California workers.\n\nThe Treasury Department and the IRS late last month released details of their proposed regulations around the new tax deduction, which Republicans included in their spending bill. \n\nUnder the provision, taxpayers who make less than $150,000 a year, or $300,000 if filing jointly, could deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes, regardless of whether they itemize their deductions. Among the nearly 70 occupations that qualify are restaurant servers, gig workers, barbers, cosmetologists and golf caddies. The deduction is effective starting this tax year and runs through 2028. \n\nThe public can submit comments to the IRS until Oct. 22. \n\nWorkers and experts who spoke with CalMatters about no tax on tips had more questions than answers, because income tax outcomes can vary significantly depending on people’s circumstances. Are they single, married filing separately or married filing jointly? Do they have kids? Do they deduct mileage or other expenses? Experts also said the provision brings up issues of fairness: Some low-wage service workers will get deductions that workers with comparable wages in other industries won’t get. \n\n“I would be hard-pressed to think of a stupider tax policy that’s become law,” said Brian Galle, a law professor at UC Berkeley whose focus includes taxes. \n\nGalle said the provision makes taxes even more complicated. He also said it could lead some employers to cut workers’ pay “by the full amount of tax savings.” \n\nMeanwhile, polls show consumers are tired of tipping, so they might stop doing so if they assume that all tipped workers will now be able to deduct their tips, Galle and other experts said. \n\nIn addition, for some workers the deduction may not be enough to offset the negative effects of other aspects of the Republicans’ spending bill.\n\n“It’s a bit of a distraction from the overall bill and how disproportionately it’s helping rich folks at the expense of low-income folks,” said Kayla Kitson, senior policy fellow at the California Budget & Policy Center, a left-leaning think tank. “Many low-income tipped workers will likely be harmed by the cuts to health care and food assistance and the failure to extend enhanced premium tax credits.”\n\nWhat workers think\n\nDell Randle, a self-employed barber in Fairfield, a Bay Area suburb, thinks he could take advantage of the new deduction. But he doesn’t know how much in tips he will actually receive.\n\n“It’s kind of hard, because everybody doesn’t tip,” he said. “It’s hit or miss, there’s no consistency. I might go a whole week without someone giving me a tip.”\n\nAlso, business has been slow since the pandemic’s onset five years ago, because lots of new barbers have oversaturated the market since then, he said. Data from the state confirms that: Barbers licenses issued this fiscal year totaled 42,958, a 33% increase from fiscal year 2019-20. Business has been especially bad in the past several months, Randle said. \n\n“The benefit of this (deduction) will depend on how good business is,” he said. “Business is slow, so I can’t count on something that’s not there.”\n\nThat’s in line with a Yale Budget Lab analysis that not taxing tips may not benefit more than a third of tipped workers because they do not make enough to owe income tax in the first place.\n\nElsewhere in the Bay Area, Crissie Brown said she makes about $95,000 to $100,000 a year from being a server at two different restaurants in Alameda. She said she’ll probably have to hire a tax preparer to see if she could benefit from the new deduction, but she’s skeptical because she doesn’t believe the Trump administration is “looking out for the working class at all.” \n\n“With the economy, I still live pretty poorly,” Brown said. “I can’t even afford to pay what I owe (in taxes) now.” She said keeping tips tax-free “sounds good, but I have a feeling it will bite us” in the end.\n\nOnly tips that are given voluntarily by customers will count toward the deduction. That means restaurant servers will not be able to deduct service charges that some restaurants automatically apply to diners’ checks. \n\nCalifornia food service workers’ reliance on tips vary. In September, 27% of bartenders’ income came from tips, according to payment-processing company Square, which analyzed payroll data from more than 100,000 employees. Full-service restaurant workers’ tips made up about 17% of their income last month, just like cafe workers. For workers at quick-service restaurants where there is no table service, tips were about 11% of their income.\n\nTrump said he got the idea for no tax on tips from a Nevada restaurant server who complained about taxes she had to pay on tips. The union that represents Las Vegas food and hospitality workers is mostly supportive of the new deduction, though it has some complaints about the details.\n\nAs for gig workers, they might see uneven benefits from the new deduction, said Sergio Avedian, a ride-hailing driver in Los Angeles and a contributor at the gig-work blog Rideshare Guy. \n\n“For drivers, who often rely on tips to offset low base pay, this could feel like an immediate raise,” Avedian said. But he added that the new deduction may not benefit drivers much because he thinks only 15% to 20% of Uber and Lyft riders tip. He said the deduction could be more beneficial for food-delivery drivers, such as those who deliver for DoorDash, while it would probably not help Amazon Flex workers who don’t typically get tips. \n\nMore than 53% of food-delivery drivers’ income is from tips, according to 2024 data from Gridwise Analytics, which is based on information from more than 260,000 drivers. Tips made up only about 10% of ride-hailing drivers’ pay, while for couriers who deliver packages that number was less than 4%.\n\nAvedian also said gig workers have to pay self-employment tax, so that could eat into any benefit of the new tip deduction — again, if the workers qualify for it at all, depending on their income. \n\nAlmost 40% of taxi and ride-hailing drivers nationwide are on Medicaid or receive health care subsidies, according to Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. In California, those drivers could be among the more than 1 million people expected to lose Medi-Calcoverage under new work-hour requirements in the Republican spending bill.\n\nFairness and other issues\n\nThe uneven effect of the deduction will apply to other industries, according to analyses by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, and American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank. Both think tanks criticized no tax on tips during the 2024 presidential election, when both Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris proposed it. They said it has “no other redeeming quality” and that only some low-wage workers will get the tax deduction.\n\nAnother way the deduction is unfair is that it has a marriage penalty, said Andrew Gradman, a tax lawyer in Los Angeles County. \n\n“If two tipped workers are married, they can only claim $25,000, while a single person would get to claim $25,000,” he said.\n\nAnother possible problem: Because the new deduction introduces even more complexity to tax law, some workers risk committing tax fraud or being accused of it, Gradman said. \n\nIf someone works for an institutional employer, “they’re going to have accountants who will do the heavy lifting,” he said, and that could help taxpayers know whether they qualify for the deduction. “If you get your paycheck from Patreon or whatever, it’s gonna be burdensome.”\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.","summary":"“I would be hard-pressed to think of a stupider tax policy that’s become law,” said Brian Galle, a law professor at UC Berkeley.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2025/10/13/no-tax-tips-may-have-limited-benefits-california-workers/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Deb-debate15.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 16:55:10","author":"Ken Stone,Levi Sumagaysay • CalMatters","authors":["Ken Stone","Levi Sumagaysay • CalMatters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":368895390,"title":"Why ‘no tax on tips’ may have limited benefits for California workers","text":"No tax on tips, a campaign promise by President Donald Trump, is now part of the U.S. tax code, but experts across the political spectrum see limited benefits for California workers.\n\nThe Treasury Department and the IRS late last month released details of their proposed regulations around the new tax deduction, which Republicans included in their spending bill.\n\nRELATED: Only ‘voluntary’ tips are exempt from taxes, IRS clarifies\n\nUnder the provision, taxpayers who make less than $150,000 a year, or $300,000 if filing jointly, could deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes, regardless of whether they itemize their deductions.

They said it has “no other redeeming quality” and that only some low-wage workers will get the tax deduction.\n\nAnother way the deduction is unfair is that it has a marriage penalty, said Andrew Gradman, a tax lawyer in Los Angeles County.\n\n“If two tipped workers are married, they can only claim $25,000, while a single person would get to claim $25,000,” he said.\n\nAnother possible problem: Because the new deduction introduces even more complexity to tax law, some workers risk committing tax fraud or being accused of it, Gradman said.\n\nIf someone works for an institutional employer, “they’re going to have accountants who will do the heavy lifting,” he said, and that could help taxpayers know whether they qualify for the deduction. “If you get your paycheck from Patreon or whatever, it’s gonna be burdensome.”","summary":"Experts doubt the effectiveness of ‘no tax on tips,’ especially for California workers who are facing cuts in other benefits.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/13/why-no-tax-on-tips-may-have-limited-benefits-for-california-workers/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/041624_San-Ysidro-Border-Economy_AH_CM_12.webp?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 16:37:58","author":"Levi Sumagaysay","authors":["Levi Sumagaysay"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":368901564,"title":"Trump lauded by MSNBC, liberal media figures for securing Israel peace deal","text":"President Donald Trump was praised on Monday by members of the media after securing a peace deal between Hamas and Israel as all 20 living Israeli hostages were released from Hamas captivity. \"You’re right, we don’t know how the story ends,\" Jon Meacham, a presidential historian and former speechwriter for President Joe Biden, said during an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Monday. \"We can go on and on about the various chapters, but we should make no mistake about this: This is a victory for President Trump and for those who wish that we can govern ourselves at home, and around the world, not simply by brute force, but by ideas and civilized norms.\" Meacham said it was a \"terrific day\" for Trump and the hostage families. Meacham, along with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, praised Trump for the deal on Thursday, with the historian calling it \"remarkable.\" FROM GRIEF TO GRATITUDE: TRUMP PRAISED AS ISRAELIS CELEBRATE HAMAS HOSTAGE DEAL IN TEL AVIV The prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas began Monday, with Hamas releasing the final 20 living hostages in exchange for Israel freeing 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The release was part of a sweeping 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the conflict and rebuilding Gaza. So far, only four of the 28 presumed dead hostages have been returned. Former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza said people who weren't giving Trump credit for the peace deal were \"blind.\" Former President Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday that the president deserved credit. \"Of course he does. And I give credit to President Trump, I give credit to [Steve] Witkoff and [Jared] Kushner and [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio. These are hard jobs. The president of the United States is the hardest job in the world, and these other jobs, including the job I occupied, are tremendously difficult,\" Sullivan responded. \"And to get to something like today takes a village, and it takes determination and really hard work, and so I, without question, offer credit for that,\" Sullivan added. TRUMP HAILED AS PEACEMAKER WORTHY OF NOBEL PRIZE FOR 'HISTORIC' ISRAEL-HAMAS PEACE DEAL CNN's Clarissa Ward described the scene in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Sunday and said the crowd lauded the president. \"And I have to say, everywhere you go here, there are posters of Trump, we have seen people who have made artifacts dedicated to Trump. Fair to say that President Trump is possibly even more popular here than he is in the United States,\" she said. CNN host Abby Phillip called out former President Barack Obama on Saturday for not naming Trump specifically in his post about the peace deal. \"Honestly, it’s not unfair to say, if President Obama is going to write a whole post about a peace deal, maybe he should acknowledge the president who brokered it,\" she said during CNN's \"Table for Five.\" Obama's social media post about the deal did not mention Trump. WORLD LEADERS PRAISE 'LANDMARK' ISRAEL-HAMAS PEACE DEAL MEDIATED BY US: 'NEW HORIZON OF HOPE' Phillip was asked to explain her remarks in a video posted by journalist Nicholas Ballasy. \"I think it's the end of an incredible amount of bloodshed. And just, there are real human beings on the other side of this and if it is successful, everybody should be happy about it. And it should be no problem saying that President Trump's responsible for it. You don't have to endorse everything that he does to say that there's a thing that he's done that is important for the world. So I think that's a pretty straightforward thing to say. I actually don't think it's all that controversial,\" Phillip told Ballasy. \"I think if you can't say that ending a deadly war that has killed so many children and human beings is a good thing, I think you need to take a look at your gut and find out what's going on there. This is, everybody wants this to end and if he's able to get it done, he deserves credit for it,\" the CNN host continued. Axios reporter Marc Caputo wrote on social media, \"The people who said they wanted peace but now seem unhappy with peace never really wanted peace.\" NEW YORK TIMES ANALYSIS SAYS TRUMP HAS LEGITIMATE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE CLAIM IF MIDEAST PEACE DEAL HOLDS During \"The View\" on Monday, co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said the president and members of his team deserved credit. \"Listen, whether you like Trump or not, I think he, I think Steve Witkoff, and I think Jared Kushner, do deserve credit for this deal. They personally met with Hamas. I used to be of the mind we don’t negotiate with terrorists, but sometimes the only way to get peace is to sit down with some of the most evil people and try to come up with what we can do to end the bloodshed. So thank God, I pray that this peace holds,\" Griffin said. Several key Democrats also praised the president in the wake of the deal, including Hillary Clinton. TRUMP SAYS 'WHOLE WORLD CAME TOGETHER' TO SECURE ISRAEL-HAMAS PEACE DEAL AFTER MONTHS OF DEADLOCK \"I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what's often called the day after,\" Clinton told CBS' Norah O'Donnell on Friday. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was also asked if Trump should be commended for the deal during an interview with MSNBC's \"The Weekend\" that aired on Sunday. \"I don’t think that we should hold any credit where it’s due. I mean, first of all, let me say about that deal. I really do hope it becomes real, and that the hostages are out, that Gaza is no longer being treated with such brutality of force, that aid goes in. And I commend the people who have been a part of this process. I commend the Qataris, the Egyptians and the president,\" she said.

(The answer is a lot of them, some at the highest levels of establishment journalism.) And yet there was Trump, addressing the Knesset, standing by the Israeli flag, receiving ovation after ovation. Let’s just say it wasn’t a good time for the Trump-is-Hitler people.\n\nOf course, the Resistance will figure out a way around the temporary roadblock of Trump’s current success. As for the Israel-Hamas agreement, they will try to give credit to others, arguing (improbably) that Trump simply built on the foundation laid by former President Joe Biden. They will also try to redirect focus onto domestic issues, on which they will continue to call Trump an authoritarian. \n\nPerhaps some will wrestle with the question of how Trump accomplished what Biden could not, and also what former Vice President Kamala Harris almost certainly could not, had she become president. Maybe the reason lies in one of Trump’s characteristics they like least: the fact that he is simply not part of the international elite consensus that they believe should responsibly rule the United States and the world.\n\nOn the Middle East deal specifically, here is how one perceptive observer, Temple University professor Jacob Shell, put it: “Seems like the Trump/Kushner vulgar dealmaking style is just more effective for Middle East geopolitics than the outwardly highminded ‘Peace Studies’ approach preferred by Democrats and their nonprofit proxies. Harris win would surely have meant no ceasefire now.” At this moment, that seems indisputably true.\n\nThe bottom line is that Trump simply knew better than the elite consensus how to approach the seemingly intractable problem of this latest Middle East conflict. Yes, that is likely galling to some in the Resistance, just as the pro-Trump celebrations across Israel are galling, or at least mystifying, to the Trump-is-Hitler crowd. But perhaps all can be thankful that Trump was free to make peace — and not in the New York prison his adversaries hoped to put him in for years to come.","summary":"TRUMP TRIUMPH IS BAD NEWS FOR HIS ADVERSARIES.&#160;If Alvin Bragg, the Democratic district attorney of Manhattan, had his way, Donald Trump would have spent Monday in a New York state correctional facility.

And this time it is not for politics or controversy but for reportedly amassing a fortune worth $150 million. US President has often credited Barron for introducing him to the world of cryptocurrency- which has fuelled his rapidly growing wealth. It was Barron who reportedly explained to the President what a 'wallet' is, co-founded World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture launched with his father and older brothers just weeks before the 2024 US Presidential election. And once Trump defeated Kamala Harris, the company skyrocketed. Forbes estimated that the venture has boosted the Trump family fortune by more than $1.5 billion, with Barron’s share alone worth around $150 million.ALSO READ: Why Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples Day fall on the same day: When is the federal holiday observed?Barron Trump's net worth is $150 millionBarron Trump gained attention during Donald Trump's inauguration in January 2024 and became a well-known face due to his business ventures. He has recently surpassed the net worth of his mother Melania Trump, Forbes reported. The youngest son of Donald Trump and Melania Trump, Barron has largely stayed out of the public eye compared to his high-profile family but he has quietly built an empire of his own.At just 19 years old, Barron Trump is reported to have amassed a fortune estimated at around $150 million and this estimation places him ahead of his mother, Melania Trump, whose net worth is reported to be around $20 million.

It is pertinent to note that a huge chunk of Barron’s wealth comes from his involvement in the cryptocurrency market. Vanity Fair reported that his cryptocurrency assets surged significantly, jumping from $80 million to $150 million within a few months. According to journalist Séraphine Roger of Vanity Fair, “On top of this, he is said to hold almost 2.3 billion tokens, which he could resell for $525 million.” “He’s got four wallets or something, and I’m saying, ‘What is a wallet?’” Trump joked during the company’s launch, hinting at his son’s surprising grasp of the digital finance world.ALSO READ: Is the stock market open on Columbus Day, October 13?

Forbes estimates that Barron holds around 10 per cent of the company.Initially, the WLFI tokens appeared to hold little value. However, everything changed after Donald Trump’s election victory in 2024. Crypto mogul Justin Sun injected $75 million into World Liberty — a move that coincided with the SEC pausing its investigation into him. The investment sparked a buying frenzy, sending token sales soaring. Forbes estimated total sales reached $675 million by August 2025, with Barron Trump’s post-tax share reportedly around $38 million.ALSO READ: Diane Keaton major lifestyle change revealed as her health 'declined very suddenly' in recent monthsSoon after, the family launched a USD-pegged stablecoin valued at $2.6 billion, boosting Barron’s estimated gains by another $34 million.

That was 12 points better than his 2020 performance against Joe Biden -- an improvement Republicans hope to lock in and establish as a new baseline with the influential and diverse voting bloc.\n\nSome Democratic strategists, who acknowledged Harris' underperformance with Hispanic voters, have argued that Trump's strength with the group may not translate to Republicans down ballot in the upcoming off-year and midterm elections.\n\nA recent New York Times poll of registered voters found that roughly 26% of Hispanic voters approved of Trump's handling of his job, with 69% disapproving.\n\nThe poll also found 52% of all voters disapproving of his handling of immigration, including 75% of Hispanic voters. The president's deportation and immigration enforcement agenda, including the deployment of ICE agents into some major cities, has prompted backlash in some corners of the Latino community.\n\nTrump has also received mixed marks on his handling of the economy, which was a top issue to Latino voters and Americans at large last year. According to The New York Times, 44% of voters approve of Trump's handling of the economy, while 53% disapprove. \n\nRoughly 45% of respondents said Trump has made the economy worse since taking office, compared to 32% who say it is better, and 20% who say it is about the same.\n\nAt a time of deep political polarization in the country, the new campaign could help conservatives deliver their message to voters at a different decibel than the political discourse, and also help Libre sell some of the legislative accomplishments in Republicans' major rewrite of the tax code earlier this year.\n\n\"This is common ground.

Nearly one year later, a notable shift is underway. The influential voices within the “manosphere” — right-wing podcasters known for their brash and often controversial takes — are increasingly retreating from their past support of Trump. But as the same podcasters who helped Trump win are now lightly criticizing him for doing what he promised to do, sports talkers, a constellation of the podcast bro ecosystem, are beginning to fill the void. \n\n“The way it looks is just horrific,” Joe Rogan recently said of Trump’s hardline deportation operation. “When you’re just arresting people in front of their kids — normal, regular people that have been here for 20 years — everybody who has a heart can’t get along with that.” \n\nLast year, as early voting had begun in most states, Rogan hosted Trump on his popular podcast. The Oct. 25, 2024 episode was Rogan’s best-performing of the year, amassing more than 35 million views on YouTube within the first three days of airing live. Now, Rogan is telling his listeners that “the Democrats were pushing to release the Epstein files. The Republicans fought against it,” and he is suggesting the federal government shutdown is meant to slow walk the release of the documents.\n\n“Now that I look back on it, I really, really wish I never got into like politics,” Adin Ross, a popular “manosphere” YouTuber, recently told his followers. Ross interviewed Trump on his livestream in August 2024 and he, like Rogan, has grown disillusioned. “As I’m getting older, I don’t think I’ll ever care enough again for any other politician ever in the future,” he said. \n\nFellow podcast bro Theo Von has also spoken out against the Trump administration, accusing the Department of Homeland Security of using an out-of-context joke of his in a social media video to dehumanize immigrants.\n\n“Everything [Trump] campaigned on, I believed he wanted to do,” Andrew Schulz said on his “Flagrant” podcast. Trump appeared on the comedian’s show in Oct. 2024. “And now he’s doing the exact opposite thing of every single f******g thing… I voted for none of this. He’s doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for.”\n\nThere are some indications that criticisms from the most popular podcast bros are reflecting a growing disillusionment among parts of Trump’s base that put him back in the White House. “I feel like the transparency as well is an issue, not just with tariffs, but also feeling like he switched positions when talking about the Epstein files from saying it’s a huge deal to saying that ‘Oh, it’s not really a big deal,’” a 22-year-old Republican from Pennsylvania recently told NBC News. \n\nIt’s important to note, however, that even though Rogan’s is the biggest podcast in the U.S., with more than 14.5 million followers on Spotify — 80% of whom are male, according to Edison Research, a firm that’s tracked podcast data since 2006 — a recent poll from the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics found that 35% of young men have an unfavorable view of Rogan. Another 36% had never heard of him or did not know enough about him to have an opinion. \n\nNotably, Rogan waited until two days before Election Day to formally endorse Trump. On election eve, Trump joined former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick as part of his “Let’s Go” podcast. To celebrate his win on election night, Trump invited UFC CEO and president Dana White to the podium. A top staffer for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, on the other hand, lamented after the election that “the culture that has been associated with heavy sports-watching has become associated with right-wing culture,” revealing that the campaign had trouble booking the vice president on many sports podcasts during her failed presidential bid.\n\nThe sports talk industry has never forgotten the fallout from the firing of Don Imus, who infamously described the Rutgers women’s basketball team as “nappy-headed h**.” Many see that event as one of the early flashpoints of the so-called woke era — and Trump’s election to a second term as a final rejection of political correctness.\n\nTrump, whose fondness for “locker room talk” was made infamous in the “Access Hollywood” tape released ahead of the 2016 election, has a long history with professional sports. He owned a New Jersey-based team in the short-lived United States Football League during the 1980s. He also hosted WrestleManias and promoted boxing fights featuring Mike Tyson during the same period. His Atlantic City casino is a frequent venue for UFC.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nSince returning to the White House, he’s named Susie Wiles, the daughter of legendary NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall, as his chief of staff, and in February he became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. Trump has also attended the Daytona 500, NCAA Wrestling Championships, FIFA Club World Cup final and U.S. Open men’s tennis final. UFC pay-per-view events have effectively become Trump rallies. Last month, he attended a New York Yankees game on the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, and only one day after the killing of far-right activist and podcaster Charlie Kirk. The president has also promised to host a UFC event at the White House as part of the nation’s 250th anniversary celebrations. In a speech on Oct. 5, he indicated the fight has been scheduled for June 14.\n\nBased on Trump’s long history with sports, it’s no surprise the world of sports media is now stepping up with full-throated support. The president seems to have found a safer haven for support in the world of sports during his second term than his first. \n\nTrump, who once referred to NFL players who knelt for the national anthem as “sons of bitches,” hosted NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to help announce that the 2027 NFL Draft will be held on the National Mall. The president, meanwhile, is still threatening to withhold a new stadium deal in D.C. until the Washington Commanders revert back to its original Washington Redskins name. \n\nStephen A. Smith, perhaps America’s most famous sports-talker, regularly criticizes outspoken Trump critics like Michelle Obama and Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas. “How much work goes into that? ‘I’m just going to go off about Trump, cuss him out every chance I get, say the most derogatory, incendiary things imaginable, and that’s my day’s work,’” Smith said on a recent episode of his podcast. Smith has defended Trump’s record on the economy, crime and immigration. The ESPN host has featured Steve Bannon and Candace Owens on his podcast and regularly appears on Fox News, often on former ESPN colleague Will Cain’s show.\n\nAs right-wing influencers sour on Trump, sports-focused media outlets appear steadfast. OutKick, for instance, is owned by Fox Corporation, and founder Clay Travis regularly appears on Fox News to praise the president and bash Democrats. Barstool’s Dave Portnoy, a casual day trader from Massachusetts who built his media empire on college gambling advice, is perhaps the only prominent voice in the sports world who previously supported Trump but has since criticized the president. \n\nPortnoy’s is a media company that caters to a large male audience. Barstool’s most popular show, “Pardon My Take,” regularly ranks among Apple’s top 20 podcasts. The hosts infamously argued that Taylor Swift needs to “release a sex video” to make her presence at NFL games tolerable to the average male fan. Portnoy told NPR that his support for Trump was more “an indictment of the Democrats than an endorsement of Trump’s politics,” citing a particular disdain for an excess of “woke politics.” \n\nThese “sports bros” are helping normalize a culture that aligns with anti-woke sentiments, like toxic masculinity, that undergird the MAGA movement. Even if they don’t always explicitly defend Trump, their style of sports commentary often overlaps with messaging common in pro‑Trump circles. And like their brethren in the “manosphere,” sports bros may soon see their popularity suffer as a result of their support for Trump. Ultimately, Trump will simply replace the new influencers — just as he has his disillusioned old influencers.","summary":"There's a notable shift on Trump taking place in the manosphere","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/10/13/as-podcast-bros-grow-critical-of-trump-sports-bros-step-in/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2024/10/joe_rogan_donald_trump_2181247017_975449576-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 13:10:29","author":"Sophia Tesfaye","authors":["Sophia Tesfaye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.143},{"id":368797736,"title":"Trump speaks in Israel after historic peace deal and more top headlines","text":"Good morning and welcome to Fox News' morning newsletter, Fox News First.

The quiet in our rural area was eerie. It captured the mood in the days after a national election that no one in my little community yet knew exactly how to respond to.\n\nIn my rush out the door, I’d grabbed my baseball cap, with the logo for my preferred presidential candidate on it, to shield my eyes from the sun’s glare.\n\nThe bus arrived and left. I collected my charges and, just as we were preparing to walk home, a tall young man leapt from the passenger seat of a battered Chevy pickup truck parked at the side of the road. He shook one sunburned finger at my hat and yelled, “Traitor! Traitor!” his face red with rage, or possibly alcohol — who knew? I gripped the pepper spray I carry in my pocket and told my kids to run home. They disappeared into the woods.\n\nLuckily, the man scuttled back into his vehicle and drove off as soon as I looked him in the eye and sized him up. (Maybe word hadn’t yet spread that masks could do more than protect from illness. They could also let a man harass families without the moral weight of the act landing on him. How little we understood, just months ago!)\n\nOnce his truck disappeared, I walked home, rattled, not sure how to explain what had happened to my kids. But in the foyer, they explained the whole scene for me in their own satirical way.\n\nOne child shook a finger and yelled, in a mockingly deep voice, “Traitor!” Another pretended to swoon in response. “Oh no! I am so scared! What a big, brave man!” They collapsed in giggles.\n\nThis is the sort of anti-bully cosplay I’ve come to see often in recent months: Kids I know strutting around with their chests puffed out like roosters, imitating a neighborhood bully who insults immigrants. Expressions of fake awe about motorcycle gangs that pass by displaying Confederate flags and other racist symbols of the Old South and revving their engines for attention. (“Wow! They are so strong and tough! I want to shake their hands!”)\n\nAs private as this mockery tends to be, lest (sadly) someone retaliate with violence, it gives us a way to express our sorrow at what is happening to the American value of peaceful coexistence, while lightening the mood. Such laughter diminishes the bullies among us, at least in our hearts. As leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and comedian Jimmy Kimmel show so well, it can diminish them publicly by holding up a mirror to their bluster and overreach.\n\nHumor as resistance\n\nThe use of parody against authoritarian leaders is nothing new. Among my favorite models is Serbian activist Srdja Popovic’s book “Blueprint for Revolution.” Recounting his own experiences with the student movement that, in the 1990s, resisted then-dictator Slobodan Milosevic, Popovic explains how jokes about ruling elites can make them look less invincible, while also puncturing widespread fear. And better yet, leaders who try to suppress such humor tend to look ridiculous. For example, Serbian police arrested (so to speak) a barrel with Milosevic’s face painted on it after Popovic and his fellow activists encouraged citizens to line up and hit it with a bat.\n\nWe in the mid-Atlantic region got a taste of how such mundane gestures can goad leaders into buffoonery when then-Justice Department employee Sean Charles Dunn threw his sandwich at one of the Customs and Border Patrol officers Trump recently deployed in Washington, D.C. The Department of Justice tried to charge Dunn with assaulting a federal officer, a felony, but a grand jury declined to bring such charges against him. Whether or not Dunn actually meant to be funny, that incident reminds me of how a seemingly small act of resistance can indeed expose executive overreach.\n\nAs I walked in a September protest against Donald Trump’s National Guard occupation of Washington, I watched leaders of the tens of thousands of marchers hoist a banner depicting Dunn with his sandwich and felt strangely encouraged by the raucous cheering that echoed through the capital. He has, in fact, become a potent symbol of the anti-Trump resistance.\n\nMen and rage\n\nI guess there’s nothing new about angry men, either — at least not in my neighborhood. My home sits in a valley, and the nearby rural highway often feels to me like a repository of White male road rage. I moved here in 2020 and, just in that first year, I watched two drivers at two different moments plow, purposefully or not, into the vehicles in front of them. In one case, the driver got out and began hurling racial slurs at the group of Latino farmworkers he had slammed into.\n\nIf you’re unlucky enough to be standing by the side of that road, you’d better believe that you could get hurt, even if it’s just by someone speeding. The battered guardrails at the valley’s nadir attest to that. Once, a cop pulled me over when I was walking home along that very road after my car broke down to warn me that I could get hurt by the reckless drivers there. Safe in my white suburban mom identity, while pointing at the dimpled metal of the rails along that stretch of road, I replied, “No kidding. Why don’t you pull more of them over instead of me?” He blushed and actually agreed before letting me go home.\n\nAnd mind you, those guys on my road are anything but aberrations. Many signs these days point to a scourge of anger and despair among American men, who all too often don’t seem to have been raised to express a wide range of emotions. A Pew Research study from early 2025 found that 57% of U.S. adults think children’s caretakers place far too little focus on teaching boys to talk about their feelings when they’re sad or upset. Less than a third said the same about girls. In another survey, at least two-thirds of parents felt that boys were uncomfortable expressing feelings of fear, sadness, loneliness and insecurity. Nearly half of those parents also felt that boys were uncomfortable expressing feelings of love. By and large, while women and men might feel anger in similar numbers, men are significantly more likely to act out their anger using verbal or physical aggression.\n\nThough laughter offers a wonderful way to respond to stress, it turns out that it, too, is remarkably gendered. Women are more likely to laugh in social settings, while we as a society tend to expect men to make other people laugh through jokes and humor. Right-wing podcaster Joe Rogan is a notably popular exception to such a generalization in his ability to express vulnerability and laugh at himself. An analysis by Industry Leaders Magazine argues that his largely male audience does indeed value his willingness to admit he’s been wrong and his openness to laughing at himself. As one example, in an interview with English comedian Russell Brand, Rogan poked fun at himself as a child, a kid then learning martial arts, calling himself “so weird” and laughing.\n\nWhen we express ourselves peaceably rather than by being accusatory, threatening or violent, we connect with others, as Rogan shows so well (regardless of what you or I may think of his politics). And the ability to connect that he has — a trait conservative activist Charlie Kirk arguably had as well — may otherwise be in short supply among today’s male adults, especially on the political right. About a third of Americans report that they are lonely at least some of the time, though women tend to reach out more often to friends or loved ones when they feel that way. It’s probably no accident that men in this country are four times more likely than women to die by suicide.\n\nIf a certain prevalent strain of MAGA masculinity feeds on anger and hate — just look at “he who hates his political opponents” (aka our president!) and his speech at Kirk’s funeral — it’s not an easy persona to sustain. Just consider all the mourners who showed up at Kirk’s memorial service in genuine grief. Perhaps what most unnerved the Trump administration, when comedian Jimmy Kimmel flashed that clip of the president redirecting a question about Kirk’s death to the subject of his new White House ballroom, was confronting how alone he was in his indifference.\n\nAfter Charlie Kirk\n\nGiven all the hostile rhetoric of Trump and his party toward their political foes, I find it easy to blame him and his followers for the uptick of political violence in this country over the past decade. After all, the vast majority of domestic extremist attacks have been perpetrated by individuals professing right-wing ideologies. Yet, as Jia Lynn Yang of the New York Times points out, this year’s spate of violence against public figures did not map as clearly onto the political spectrum as in earlier eras. Today, the attacker tends to be a “lone individual, lost in a conversation with an online void.” After all, Charlie Kirk’s shooter didn’t even vote in the last election. In a text exchange, he referred to the engravings he had made on his bullets, which included words like “catch, fascist,” as “mostly a big meme.”\n\nWhile it would be reductionist to blame violence on video games and other nihilistic online spaces, it’s worth considering that the current generation of young people do, of course, spend more time online than any previous generation. If popular war games form part of their immersive environments, we as a society would do well to look more closely not just at the political leanings of shooters, but the contexts within which political violence flourishes in contemporary America.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nWhat makes a gun feel like the solution to any political disagreement for some individuals? And if people like Kirk’s alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, don’t see it as a solution, then what does it mean to shoot someone? If political assassination is a crime of despair, what series of events leads a person to such a feeling and such an act? Psychology tells us that anger makes us feel more powerful because of the adrenaline that courses through our bodies prior to acting out. But what causes a young man who, unlike Donald Trump, professes to be tired of hate to kill?\n\nA new American way?\n\nI’m at a loss. And I think many of us may be. But what we can do (and by we here, I mean those of us who write stuff) is call attention to the forms of nonviolent resistance that challenge our prevalent culture of rage and alienation. The people participating in the “We Are All D.C.” march that I mentioned earlier held homemade signs like “D.C. crime wave” (with a picture of Trump waving from the White House), played music, and sang. Though arguably comparable in size to the D.C. Women’s March of 2017, this demonstration warranted exactly zero articles in the New York Times. Somehow, in the age of Donald Trump, such legacy media outfits tend to prefer to amplify angry male voices rather than those of resistance, which, I think, is a genuine problem, explain it as you will.\n\nIf you think that a focus on resistance, humor and joy is a losing path, as Kamala Harris’ “joy-based campaign” turned out to be, maybe you should remember that being with others in person does materially change the chemistry of our bodies. When we laugh or cry, especially in community, our bodies can release dopamine, serotonin and other chemicals that support empathy, communication and a sense of hope for the future.\n\nPerhaps with a greater sense of community, we would also take in more of our disturbing world and not, for instance, forget the two Minnesota lawmakers another extremist shot and killed in June or the young Black student recently found hanging from a tree in Mississippi. They received remarkably less attention than Charlie Kirk.\n\nUnfortunately, our field of vision remains narrow indeed and, like the road I stood on that day last November, it contains a disproportionate number of angry white men. And no less unfortunately, we’re speeding down it quickly with a maniac in the driver’s seat, and it lacks the guardrails of a law-abiding Supreme Court and a constitutionally aware secretary of defense.\n\nUnless we start talking to one another, that road seems to be leading nowhere good. In the meantime, you might try a little humor or mockery to get through the day. If you haven’t yet, I highly recommend it.","summary":"Through mockery, we express our sadness, forge solidarity and lighten the mood.

However, some Democrats have suggested that the president should receive credit only if the plan—which is still in the early stages—is successful.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the White House for comment via an email sent outside regular business hours.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks with the media aboard Air Force One as he flies from Washington, D.C., to Israel on October 12. (Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nAfter two years of fighting in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, Trump has brokered a deal that he says ends the war and lays the path for lasting peace in the Middle East. However, the broader plan has many unanswered questions, such as whether and how Hamas will disarm and who will govern Gaza.\n\nIsrael’s offensive in Gaza began after Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza. Hamas has released 148 hostages over the past two years, eight of whom were dead, according to the Associated Press. Since October 2023, Israel’s campaign has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded almost 170,000, the AP reported, citing Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry. It has also displaced 2 million people—almost all of Gaza’s population—and devastated the enclave.\n\nWhat To Know \n\nClinton said in an interview with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell that “it’s going to take a lot of work” and coordination for the Israelis and Palestinians to get through the first phase of the deal. \n\nShe called Israel’s September attack on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar’s capital, an “ill-advised” move that gave Trump’s negotiators an opening.\n\n“That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel: ‘No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end, and we’ve got to move on,’” Clinton said.\n\nIn an appearance on CNN on Sunday, Kelly said of Trump: “I mean, this was his deal. He worked this out. He sent Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, you know, over to negotiate this, and it so far has gone well.”\n\nJake Sullivan, who was former President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, also said Trump deserved credit for the peace deal.\n\n“Of course he does,” he told CNN. “I give credit to President Trump. I give credit to Witkoff and Kushner and [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio. These are hard jobs. The president of the United States is the hardest job in the world. And these other jobs, including the job I occupied, are tremendously difficult.”\n\nBeyond Kelly, other Democratic senators have applauded Trump for the deal—though they caution that it remains to be seen how the peace process will play out.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin of Illinois said on Thursday that Trump deserved credit for the deal “if it works,” adding that it was “off to a good start.”\n\nOn MSNBC, Harris said that she doesn’t think that people “hold any credit where it’s due” but she added that she hopes the deal “becomes real.” \n\nMeanwhile, former President Barack Obama welcomed the deal in a post that did not mention Trump, prompting criticism from the White House.\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Israel on Sunday: “The war is over.”\n\nHe added when asked whether he believed the ceasefire would hold: “I think so. I think it’s going to hold. … A lot of reasons why it’s going to hold, but I think people are tired of it. It’s been—it’s been centuries.”\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CBS News: “I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region, for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what’s often called the day after.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris said on MSNBC: “I don’t think that we should hold any credit where it’s due. I really do hope it becomes real and that the hostages are out, that Gaza is no longer being treated with such brutality of force, that aid goes in. And I commend the people who have been a part of this process. I commend the Qataris, the Egyptians and the president.”\n\nSenator Dick Durbin said when asked whether Trump deserved the Nobel Peace Prize: “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

The book, which chronicles her presidential campaign following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race in August 2024, was published in September.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Harris’ office by email to comment on this story outside of normal business hours.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nHarris, who lost the 2024 election to President Donald Trump, remains a significant figure in U.S. politics, and it has been rumored that she might run for president again in 2028.\n\nThe heckling shows that tensions about the previous administration’s handling of tensions in the Middle East remain. Harris lost some support during the presidential election from pro-Palestinian advocacy groups who called on the Biden administration to impose on arms embargo on Israel in response to its attacks on Gaza since October 7, 2023.\n\nFormer U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at the Wiltern Theatre on September 29, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn September, during her first stop of her tour in New York, Harris was heckled about Palestine, prompting her to respond: “I’m not president right now, there’s nothing I can do.”\n\nMeanwhile, during an event in Chicago on October 12, at least one protester began shouting and accusing Harris of complicity in Israel’s assaults on the Gaza Strip. “You are a killer, Kamala. You support genocide,” one protester shouted, before being removed by security.\n\nHarris said: “I’m not president and if you want to talk about legal lets talk about the legacy of mass deportation, of people not voting and Donald Trump.”\n\nHer supporters cheered in response.\n\nThe previous day, protesters interrupted an event in Washington D.C. and spoke about Gaza. Harris said in response: “You know what, I am not president of the United States.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nMark Shanahan, who teaches American politics at the University of Surrey in the U.K. told Newsweek: “The previous Biden administration bears some responsibility for the length of the war in Gaza and the severity of the Israeli prosecution of it. Biden was slow to react to Netanyahu’s growing brutality and, as Harris says in her book, failed to show sufficient empathy for the plight of the Gazans. \n\n“Harris was his right-hand woman – and she’s taking the flak for it now. Even when she became the candidate, Harris was unable to make the shift from the Democrats’ traditional role of supporter of Israel to being clearly seen as a Middle East peace maker and her book does little to make the case for what she might have done. She has been heckled several times on her tour now and still hasn’t got a clear response to those who challenge her. Younger Democrats are increasingly associating her with the past and see her as part of the problem that let Donald Trump back into the White House rather than a credible candidate for 2028.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nHarris will continue touring various U.S. cities including Miami, Florida and Nashville, Tennessee, until November 20. Whether she is well received remains in these locations to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement with Israel is underway, and Hamas has released all of the living hostages it had captured in October 2023.","summary":"The former Vice President has been on a tour after she released her book, 107 Days, on September 23.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-getting-heckled-book-tour-10868417","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238215310.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 10:03:14","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":368871644,"title":"In South Texas, Allred and Talarico compete for Latino voters by vowing to fight for working class","text":"Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nJonathan Torrez of Harlingen walked into 1848 BBQ in Brownsville for a town hall with Colin Allred earlier this month unsure of who he’d support in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate.\n\nAn hour later, after hearing Allred describe how his mother would swipe her teacher’s credit union debit card “and say a prayer” to buy groceries, the 37-year-old car wash and restaurant worker decided Allred would get his vote.\n\n“It’s not just he’s a minority, but he knows certain struggles I’ve gone through,” said Torrez, who grew up poor as one of six children raised by a single mother. “I know he can relate to that struggle and understand that struggle and take it seriously.”\n\nThe town hall was one of several events Allred, a former Dallas congressman and the 2024 Democratic Senate nominee, held on a recent two-day trip through the Rio Grande Valley, five months before next year’s March primary. Just the week prior, his main rival in the Senate race, state Rep. James Talarico, held rallies in McAllen and Brownsville.\n\nThe swings through the Valley are part of a broader effort by both candidates to win over Latino voters in South Texas, many of whom are blue-collar workers, Catholic or nondenominational Christian, and worried about rising everyday costs and widespread immigration raids. Allred and Talarico are both trying to break through by leaning into their own working class backgrounds and pitching economically populist visions, hoping the message will resonate with a voting bloc that lurched to the right in 2024 largely due to economic concerns.\n\nThe early attention devoted to South Texas is a sign both candidates recognize the region’s critical importance in deciding the primary — and that whoever emerges as the nominee will need to regain the party’s footing there to have a chance of winning in November.\n\n“James and Colin going down early and making them a focal point is a big deal for both of their campaigns,” said Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist who hosts a podcast about Latino voters. “They realize the same thing that everybody else does: This is a boat that’s very fluid and very persuadable and open to the ideas of candidates who are going to bring them solutions to their everyday problems.”\n\nThough Texas’ border counties used to vote reliably blue, recent cycles saw the largely Hispanic voter population side increasingly with Republicans, especially at the top of the ticket. Donald Trump carried counties along the border over Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, including all four counties in the Valley after drawing just 29% there in 2016.\n\nBut Latino voters more broadly have begun to sour on Trump, with local elected Democrats in South Texas reporting signs of buyer’s remorse among communities still saddled with high everyday costs and worn down by fear of the Trump administration’s immigration raids.\n\n“We’re starting to see the real effects of the Trump policies,” said Richard Gonzalez, chair of the Hidalgo County Democratic Party. “You’re going to see a lot of these people basically be looking for a way out. If we do our messaging correctly, we can try to win those people back.”\n\nBefore then, Allred and Talarico will have to compete for their vote in the primary.\n\nCounties within 20 miles of the Texas-Mexico border, most of which are overwhelmingly Latino, supplied 11.5% of voters in the 2024 Senate Democratic primary. Statewide, Latinos make up about one-third of the Democratic primary electorate, according to Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University who conducts statewide polling.\n\nSylvia Tanguma, president of the McAllen chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, said she was still undecided between Allred and Talarico, but that their focus on kitchen-table issues would resonate with people in the Valley. In Hidalgo County — which includes McAllen and more than half the Valley’s residents — the median household income is about $57,000, and roughly one-quarter of the population lacks health coverage, both near the bottom of Texas’ major counties.\n\nVoters in the Valley “just want someone that understands where they are coming from,” she said. “That they’re not rich, they don’t have money, and what they want is to be able to go to the store and buy groceries.”\n\nIn his loss to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, Allred ran ahead of Harris by about 10 points in the Rio Grande Valley, a record he points to as evidence that his candidacy resonates with South Texans and makes him the best qualified to take on the Republican nominee in 2026. He’s also trying to distinguish himself from Talarico by highlighting his biography and record in Congress, and rolling out a set of policies he’d pursue to make life more affordable, from reversing Trump’s renewable energy cuts to reining in the cost of prescription drugs.\n\n“What we have to make sure we do in this election, and what is personal for me, is grounding ourselves back in working people’s lives and experiences,” Allred said at a town hall in Brownsville. “Folks who look like me and come from where I come from usually don’t make it this far. So I have a story to tell about who we are as a state, where we can go and also what kind of coalition it’s going to take to win in this state.”\n\nPolling of the nascent primary has found that Latino voters are divided between the two candidates, with many still undecided. A statewide survey conducted in late September by the University of Houston and Texas Southern University found Talarico leading Allred, 42% to 38%, among Latinos, with 20% unsure who to support.\n\nTalarico, a four-term state lawmaker from Austin, has similarly centered his pitch on fighting for working Texans and taking on billionaires, with a greater emphasis on his Christian faith — a religious background shared by many Latinos in the Valley — and his background as a former public school teacher in San Antonio.\n\nAt rallies in Brownsville and McAllen late last month, Talarico argued that national Democrats had taken Hispanic communities “for granted,” leading people to turn to an alternative.\n\n“Republican politicians came here and made big promises,” Talarico said. “They promised big change, but they delivered more of the same. If you feel like you’ve been conned, if you feel like you’ve been left behind by both political parties, you have a place in this campaign.”\n\nVoters in the Valley still up for grabs\n\nOver lunch at a cozy Italian restaurant in Brownsville earlier this month, Cameron County Clerk Sylvia Garza-Perez raised to Allred a common criticism of his 2024 Senate campaign.\n\n“You weren’t here as often as we needed you to be,” she told him, sitting alongside three other local elected leaders. “The party is in a place right now where they need hope. They need to have someone they can believe in.”\n\nThough Allred spent time in South Texas during his 2024 run and grew up visiting his grandmother in Brownsville, some Democrats criticized his campaign last year for its buttoned-up approach, especially compared to Democrat Beto O’Rourke’s electrifying run in 2018.\n\nThis time, Allred, a civil rights lawyer and former NFL linebacker, is being more open about his backstory and how it shapes his politics, with the goal of establishing deeper connections with voters at smaller, community-centered events and “meeting people where they are.” In discussions with college students, a teacher union and local leaders, Allred drew on his upbringing by a single mother and how she couldn’t afford to buy her house until he was in the NFL to underscore his campaign focus on lowering costs for working Texans and uprooting corruption in politics.\n\n“I decided that if I was going to run again that I wanted to try and show more of myself,” Allred said in an interview. “A lot of people see in my story either experiences that they’ve had or that they’ve seen in their community.”\n\nFrom events with just a handful of participants to larger town halls, Allred also talked about how his mother, a public school teacher of 27 years, struggled to find child care and pay for groceries. He mentioned that he found out via the internet that his father died from alcoholism, and that their only real connection is a scar his father left on his lip when he was a baby.\n\n“I have lived the same way that you live,” Allred told a couple dozen people at 1848 BBQ. “So I have a story to tell about who we are and what we have to do to address what folks are going through. And I have the experience.”\n\nTalarico, meanwhile, is betting that his experience as a public school teacher on the west side of San Antonio, his focus on education in the Texas House and his faith will bring South Texas voters to his campaign. He was born to a single mother from Laredo, who fled an abusive partner with an infant Talarico in tow, and who made a nursery for him in the closet of a room at the hotel she worked at in Austin.\n\nLines to greet him and take photos after his events have stretched for three to four hours long, Talarico said, with voters in South Texas often asking to talk about faith and spirituality and to pray together.\n\n“They want to know that faith is central to my work and my life, just like it is for them,” Talarico, an aspiring Presbyterian minister, said in an interview. “It creates an opportunity for a real, deep connection that’s deeper than partisanship, deeper than public policy. It’s something that I think resonates at the core of what people’s lives are all about.”\n\nIn Pharr, Marco Martinez, a broadcaster filming the school district’s homecoming football game this month, said he was undecided between Allred and Talarico. Allred had given a pep talk to the team at halftime, and, as he walked the sideline under the Friday night lights, Martinez excitedly took a video of him going by — until his colleague told him the flash on his phone was on.\n\n“He’s down to earth. He knows and he understands the middle class. He understands the needs down here,” Martinez, who is from Laredo and has lived in the Valley for 25 years, said of Allred. But he added that as a Catholic, he admired Talarico’s faith and his efforts to fight Republican lawmakers’ bill requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\n\nMartinez still didn’t know how to pick between the two. “That’s the tough part,” he said.\n\nDisclosure: Rice University and University of Houston have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

His only recorded contribution to a Republican was a $520 donation to Nikki Haley’s 2024 presidential campaign. \n\nTalbott is the son of Strobe Talbott, who served as deputy secretary of state under President Bill Clinton after holding senior roles focused on the former Soviet republics. He went on to lead the Brookings Institution, one of Washington’s most influential think tanks, from 2002 to 2017. During his tenure, Brookings employed Igor Danchenko, who worked with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and was identified as a key source for the Steele dossier about alleged links between President Donald Trump and Russia. Those connections have led some critics to argue that Devin Talbott’s political and business roles fit within a broader Democratic establishment network.\n\nPublic records show Talbott registered as a Democrat in Maryland in 2006 and has voted in most general elections since, underscoring his long-standing political ties as his company plays a growing role in state election systems.\n\nTalbott’s dual role as a political donor and chairman of a voting technology firm has drawn scrutiny from some election oversight advocates. \n\n“When the person overseeing voting systems across the country is also a six-figure donor to one political party, it undermines public confidence in the neutrality of our elections,” said one advocate familiar with Hart InterCivic’s contracts, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the situation candidly.\n\nHart InterCivic, based in Austin, Texas, produces the Verity voting platform used in hundreds of jurisdictions across 20 states. The company is considered one of the “big three” election technology vendors in the United States, alongside Election Systems & Software and Dominion Voting Systems, which recently was purchased by a new firm called Liberty Vote.\n\nDominion became a flashpoint in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when false claims about its software and alleged ties to foreign actors fueled widespread conspiracy theories. After years of litigation, Dominion secured massive settlements, $787.5 million from Fox News and $67 million from Newsmax, tied to those baseless allegations. The company has maintained its systems are secure and reliable. \n\nBy comparison, Hart InterCivic has largely avoided the national spotlight, though it has faced its own share of technical controversies. In 2018, the Texas secretary of state issued a statewide advisory after reports that Hart’s eSlate voting machines were changing voters’ straight-ticket selections or omitting certain races altogether during early voting. State corporate filings in Texas list Talbott as Hart InterCivic’s chairman and director.\n\nHart’s ownership has faced similar scrutiny before. In 2011, Miami-based private equity firm H.I.G. Capital, founded by former Bain & Co. and Blackstone Group executives, made what it described as a “strategic investment” in Hart. The following year, several H.I.G. principals, including managing director and Hart board member Jeff Bohl, were revealed to be major donors to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. At the time, Hart denied “any suggestions that the company might try to influence the outcome of election results.”\n\nIn response to questions about the company’s ownership and independence, a spokesperson for Hart InterCivic said the firm “is an impartial and independent U.S. technology company with more than 100 years of experience providing election solutions.” The spokesperson added that Hart’s systems “are consistently certified at the federal and state levels as reliable, secure, and accurate,” and noted that the company is the only election-system provider in the nation certified to the latest federal standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0.\n\nHart’s Verity Vanguard system became the first in the country to earn VVSG 2.0 certification from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission in July 2025, a milestone the company said marks “a significant advancement in secure, transparent, and accessible election technology.” The company also said its systems comply with directives outlined in Trump’s March 2025 executive order on preserving the integrity of American elections.\n\nThe company said Enlightenment Capital is one of several investors in Hart and that day-to-day operations and product development are handled by a professional management team. They also noted that Hart executives are prohibited from making political donations, adding that the company’s technology undergoes extensive testing by independent laboratories before being certified by the Election Assistance Commission and individual states. The commission, chaired by a Trump-nominated official who has served since 2019, oversees certification for voting systems nationwide. Hart officials emphasized that certification and oversight are conducted independently of any company ownership.\n\nBefore entering the election-technology industry, Talbott built his career investing in companies that serve the defense and government sectors. He launched Enlightenment Capital in 2012 and has backed firms involved in cybersecurity, intelligence, and aviation logistics. The firm’s advisory board has included retired military and national security officials, giving it deep reach into federal contracting circles. Enlightenment Capital’s 2020 acquisition of Hart InterCivic positioned Talbott at the intersection of political finance, government contracting, and election administration during a period of deep public skepticism about voting systems.\n\nElection policy analysts say Talbott’s case highlights a broader gap: private vendors that supply voting systems are not required to disclose the political activities or affiliations of their owners and executives.\n\n“There’s nothing illegal about a partisan donor owning or having a stake in a voting-machine company,” one nonprofit policy adviser said, “but it’s a dangerous precedent in an era when trust in elections is already fragile.”","summary":"EXCLUSIVE — Devin Talbott, founder of the Maryland-based investment firm Enlightenment Capital and chairman of voting machine giant Hart InterCivic, is under scrutiny for his extensive political donations to Democratic candidates while leading a major U.S. election technology company, a combination raising questions about potential conflicts of interest in the U.S. voting system.

It describes the decision to quietly drop calls for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files as yet another.\n\n“People laying down their arms on the most jealously guarded power that Congress has tells you a lot about what people think their likelihood is of being successful in fighting back,” said Brendan Buck, a one-time aide to Johnson’s predecessor as speaker, Paul Ryan.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Gov.

Gavin Newsom and President Trump find themselves in a vulnerable moment that could make-or-break their standing with voters in the months ahead.\n\nIndeed, the stakes are high across the aisle as the shutdown begins to creep its way into the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans through mass layoffs, increased insurance costs, and cuts to funding for vital programs.\n\nAnd in California – a state that employs over 150,000 federal workers – these repercussions will likely be felt the hardest.\n\nFor the last decade, California has steadily expanded access to healthcare coverage, implementing tools like auto-enrollment and “shop-and-compare” that have made attaining financial help easy. Now, the shutdown puts that – and more – in danger.\n\nMost jarringly, California officials warned that, due to expiring Obamacare subsidies, monthly premiums may double, causing as many as 400,000 people – almost a quarter of total enrollees in the state – to drop out of the nation’s largest health insurance marketplace.\n\nBut Californians aren’t the only ones bracing for impact – blue states nationwide are also in jeopardy of feeling the shockwaves from the shutdown as President Trump targets Democrat-backed programs while shielding those that align with his own priorities, like mass deportation and tariff efforts.\n\nIndeed, it’s important to note that the negatives of the shutdown for Democrats don’t come without a long list of positives for Trump and his Republican base: reducing the size and scope of government, accelerating the ability to impose time limits and work requirements on Medicaid, and curbing excessive federal spending. \n\n“We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,” the president said. “Cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.”\n\nHowever, Trump’s gamble carries real risks for the future of the Republican party. If ordinary Americans – especially conservatives – feel that the shutdown has gone on too long, he could be viewed as putting ideology over stability, undermining the very political advantage he hopes to build.\n\nIt is this high-risk, high-reward formula that defines what one former Trump official has called his “strategic” approach: an attempt to inflict maximum pain on Democrats in the hopes that it’ll add to the chaos already surrounding the party.\n\nAnd after the bombshell book drop by former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party is in no need of any more internal disarray and scrutiny.\n\nFor Newsom, the shutdown presents an opportunity to cement himself as the only Democrat able to fight back against Trump – an effort he’s been working towards since the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n\nJust after the midnight funding deadline Sept. 30, Newsom mocked the president’s signature social media style, writing on X that Trump is “a very weak man” in all-caps.\n\nNonetheless, it’s clear that Newsom is ready to put a stop to MAGA antics – the question that remains is whether the governor will be the leader Democrats need to do so.\n\nWhile early numbers show Newsom leading in three of the five most recent polls compiled by RealClearPolitics – averaging a 5.5-point advantage– how he tackles the shutdown could prove to be yet another do-or-die moment in his career.\n\nIf he manages it well, Newsom could be seen as a Democrat who offers real, effective solutions to the nation’s most hard-hitting problems – natural disasters, social tensions, economic crises, and now a government shutdown.\n\nIf he doesn’t, though, he’s in danger of succumbing to the very trap that tanked Harris last election cycle: running on pure resistance to Trump.\n\nFollowing the release of Harris’ “107 Days,” it’s evident that the Democratic electorate is looking for a standard-bearer who can unite Americans in times of need, not divide them further. \n\nAnd if Newsom can prove to do just that – while also maintaining moderate, common-sense stances on pertinent issues like the economy and immigration – he may have what it takes to make a true bid for the Oval Office.\n\nAlthough it’s too soon to see the effects of the shutdown on Newsom and Trump, whether good or bad, they’re sure to be critical in determining who will call the White House home come 2028.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Although it’s too soon to see the effects of the shutdown on Newsom and Trump, whether good or bad, they’re sure to be critical in determining who will call the White House home come 2028.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/13/newsom-and-trump-prepare-for-damage-control-following-government-shutdown/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LDN-L-FIRE-6MO-CHANGES-0706-AP.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 07:08:46","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":368699502,"title":"Hillary Clinton offers unexpected compliment to Trump over Gaza peace deal","text":"Hillary Clinton has publicly praised Donald Trump for his role in brokering a landmark Gaza peace deal that could bring an end to two years of bloodshed in the region.\n\nThe 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said she 'really commended Trump and his administration' for their work in securing the agreement between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe statement, a rare moment of bi-partisan praise, marks a surprising reversal of tone for Clinton. \n\n'I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region, for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what's often called the day after,' Clinton told CBS News in a lengthy interview.\n\nIsraelis on Monday welcomed home the last living hostages from devastated Gaza and mourn the return of the dead, in the key exchange of the breakthrough ceasefire after two years of war. \n\nPalestinians awaited the release of hundreds of prisoners held by Israel. \n\nTrump was also in the region along with other leaders to discuss the US-proposed deal and postwar plans on Monday morning. \n\nHamas agreed to Trump's 20-point peace plan, which calls for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in stages, the release of remaining hostages, and the disarmament of Hamas.\n\nThe deal, already being hailed as the most significant breakthrough in Middle East diplomacy in decades, could finally end the two-year war that has devastated Gaza and strained Israel's international standing.\n\nDuring the interview Clinton said she was 'cautiously optimistic' but warned that the process would require patience and diligence from all sides.\n\n'That's not self-evident,' she said when asked if she believed this would end the war. 'It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take a lot of coordination.'\n\nClinton also said she hoped the US and other global powers would throw their full weight behind the plan to ensure its success. \n\n'Let's now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability, and a better future to the Middle East,' she said. \n\nThe former secretary of state noted that Trump's negotiators capitalized on a critical opening after Israel's controversial strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar in September - an attack Clinton described as 'ill-advised' and a 'strategic error.' \n\n'That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, \"No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end, and we've got to move on,\"' Clinton said. \n\nClinton said of US negotiators, 'They took advantage of an opening that was available and were able to be successful.' \n\nThe praise from Clinton, who served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama and clashed repeatedly with Trump during and after the 2016 election, is almost unprecedented.\n\nThroughout her career, Clinton has been a staunch advocate for a two-state solution, a policy goal that eluded successive US administrations. \n\nUnder Obama, her tenure at the State Department was marked by difficult relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two smaller conflicts in Gaza.\n\nBut Clinton told CBS that this time the Trump administration's pressure on Israel to halt its military campaign appeared to be the decisive factor that pushed both sides to the table.\n\n'The work of rebuilding Gaza will be arduous, laborious, and intensive,' she said. 'The international community has to commit together to bring peace to the Middle East.' \n\nShe urged Israel to stop its expansion of settlements in the West Bank something she said has 'to cease' and called on the global community to prepare for the hard work of rebuilding Gaza.\n\nClinton isn't the only prominent Democrat to recognize Trump's success in securing the deal.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris agreed Trump should be praised for securing a peace deal.\n\n'I don't think that we should hold any credit where it's due... I commend the people who have been a part of this process. I commend the Qataris, the Egyptians and the President,' Harris said on MSNBC.\n\nJake Sullivan, President Biden's former national security advisor, told CBS that Trump's breakthrough was long overdue.\n\n'It's only now, after all that time, that we have gotten to a deal,' Sullivan said.\n\nSecretary of State under Biden, Antony Blinken, also praised Trump in a lengthy tweet. \n\n'President Trump and his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner deserve our collective thanks for producing this ceasefire and the renewed possibility of lasting peace,' Blinken wrote.\n\nEven former President Obama acknowledged the progress in a post on X although he notably did not mention Trump by name, instead emphasizing the 'long-overdue' need for a lasting peace in the region. \n\nHamas was set to release 48 remaining Israeli hostages on Monday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nUnder the Trump's proposed roadmap, once Hamas have handed over the surviving hostages, Israel will begin releasing around 2,000 detainees in exchange. \n\nTrump's plan also outlines a gradual Israeli troop withdrawal from much of Gaza. \n\nIn exchange, Hamas has agreed to disarm, and an international 'technocratic' body, excluding both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, will govern Gaza during the transition period.\n\nWhile the agreement describes an independent Palestinian state as 'the aspiration of the Palestinian people,' it stops short of committing to a timetable for sovereignty - a key point of contention for regional leaders and Western diplomats.\n\nTrump, who is making a lightning visit to Israel and Egypt has called it 'the first phase of a comprehensive 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war.'\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One at the start of the 'very special' visit, Trump brushed off concerns about whether the ceasefire would endure.\n\n'I think it's going to hold. I think people are tired of it. It's been centuries,' he said of the fighting.\n\n'The war is over. Okay?

It says age is the most common risk factor.","summary":"","url":"http://www.today.az/news/regions/262674.html","image":"http://www.today.az/pictures/pic262674.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 04:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"az","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":368669622,"title":"Kamala Harris’ flaws on full display during her tour de farce book tour","text":"Kamala Harris is on a ridiculous 15-city “international” book tour, during which she tells the gullible women who line up for hours to see her that she only missed out on being president by a whisker.\n\nShe claims that 2024 was the “closest presidential election in the 21st century.”\n\nEveryone knows this is a “lie,” as Donald Trump said in a heated Truth Social post, listing the details of his “LANDSLIDE!” victory. He won the Electoral College by 312 to 226, won counties nationwide by 2,600 to 525, won all seven swing states and won the popular vote by millions.\n\nHarris’ claim that she almost won is Biden-level delusion. It’s a reasonable assumption that she is using her self-justifying “107 Days” and book tour with cameo appearances by the likes of Hillary Clinton as a springboard for another kamikaze run for the White House.\n\nBut last week, when asked point blank onstage in Washington, DC, whether she would be a presidential candidate in 2028, she was coy: “Maybe, maybe not.”\n\nMaybe not, methinks.\n\nHarris’ flaws as a candidate have been on full display in her book tour — the inappropriate laughing like a hyena, the painfully inarticulate word salad, the constantly shifting accents and affects. It’s clear this is a person with no concrete sense of self, a woman who has been gifted big jobs and flubbed every one.\n\nDem women a mess\n\nAnd, yet, the way the Democratic Party is heading, these impediments may not mean a thing. Blunders and character flaws that would have disabled a candidate just 10 years ago are shrugged off and excused, especially when it comes to entitled liberal women with low self-esteem who seemingly can do no wrong.\n\nWhen the repellent Katie Porter, Democrat front-runner in the 2026 California gubernatorial race, was exposed last week as an unhinged bully with anger-management issues in a viral on-air meltdown during a CBS Sacramento interview, the sisterhood rushed to excuse the inexcusable.\n\nLiberal and union luminaries praised the 51-year-old three-time congresswoman as “strong” and “tough” and “the gutsy leader California needs to go toe to toe with Donald Trump.”\n\nPorter was just “having a menopausal moment,” said Joy Behar on “The View,” before turning the criticism to Trump. Maybe she’s “having a bad day,” said her co-host Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nGee, Porter must have a lot of bad days, judging from leaked videos showing her swearing at staff and abusing them for minor transgressions.\n\nShe had to have anger-management classes after dumping a bowl of steaming hot potatoes on her ex-husband’s head. The father of her three children subsequently claimed in their divorce that she was prone to “extreme anger,” was “unpredictable and unstable [with] a history of snapping and screaming at [him] and the children.”\n\nNot the sort of person to whom you should give enormous power as governor of our richest state, but Porter clearly appeals to the AWFL cohort of Democrat voters: Affluent White Female Liberals.\n\nAnother star of the post-Hillary generation of aspiring AWFL leaders is Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operative who is front-runner to be Virginia’s next governor.\n\nDisqualifying all over\n\nWhile she is more polished than Porter, her refusal to disavow or withdraw her endorsement for Democrat ally Jay Jones suggest a moral callousness that belies her carefully cultivated image as an empathetic woman and mother.\n\nIn this assassination era, it should have taken every Democrat exactly one millisecond to denounce Jones — who is running for AG on the Democratic ticket with Spanberger — and force him out of the race after text messages were revealed in which he expressed violent threats to murder a Republican rival and his children.\n\nInstead, Dems think they can ride out the scandal.\n\nIn a previous era, older women used to uphold basic moral standards for younger generations to follow.\n\nBut liberals have dispensed with such feminine relics, priding themselves on being even tougher and more ruthless than men in their pursuit of power.\n\nHarris’ sins are more mundane. She was simply a woefully inadequate candidate whose every vapid utterance reminds us that she has been elevated well beyond her abilities, for reasons that are not immediately evident.\n\nBut that doesn’t stop her from having an enthusiastic fan base of liberal women, dubbed the “K-Hive,” who flock to her every public engagement and hang off her every vacuous word, despite the fact that she has set back the cause of female candidates half a century. Even the VIP “meet and greet” tickets on her book tour are sold out at $350 a pop, such is the hunger for female leadership on the left.\n\nThe women who lined up outside DC’s Warner Theatre to hear Harris speak last week were a “collage of brat nostalgia and MSNBC #Resistance [folk, wearing] the blazer-jeans-Converse combo,” buying campaign buttons that read, “No Kings in America” and “Anti Trump Grandmas Club,” according to The Washington Post.\n\nWhile her book has been panned for what Bill Maher dubbed its “Everyone Sucks But Me” self-indulgence, it does tap into the reigning girl-boss narrative of liberal women: that they are terribly important and very stressed and the world is there to serve them — especially men, who must always be romantic and supportive and cater to their every whim.\n\nDastardly to Doug\n\nOne scene sums up the attitude.\n\nIt’s Harris’ birthday on the campaign trail, and she is looking forward to a “special evening” with her husband, Doug Emhoff, in a posh hotel in Philadelphia.\n\n“I was wondering what he’d planned for the evening. The simple answer: nothing. Not a thing.” It was her staff who ordered a cake and her girlfriends who sent flowers.\n\nPoor Doug at least gave her a present: an expensive designer pearl necklace. But Harris noticed the necklace was engraved with the date of their wedding anniversary, not her birthday.\n\nShe was very upset that he had “repurposed” the gift instead of buying her a new one and flounced off to soak in the tub.\n\nBut when she called out for a towel, Doug didn’t respond.\n\nEvery week, Post columnist Miranda Devine sits down for exclusive and candid conversations with the most influential disruptors in Washington. Subscribe here!\n\nHe was watching baseball in another room and presumably didn’t hear her. So she called his phone.\n\n“His answer: a casual ‘What’s up?’ Really?! It was a bridge too far,” she writes. “And then we got into it . . . It was one of those fights every couple has.”\n\nLater, Harris had her staffer, Storm, hand Doug a set of note cards and instruct him to write apologetic notes “telling me how much he loved me” that would be placed on the pillow of her hotel beds for the remainder of the campaign.\n\nInflated opinions of self-worth are not a recipe for harmony, in life or in politics.","summary":"Kamala Harris is on a ridiculous 15-city “international” book tour, during which she tells the gullible women who line up for hours to see her that she only missed out on being president by a whisker.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/12/opinion/kamala-harris-flaws-on-full-display-during-her-tour-de-farce-book-tour/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/2025-los-angeles-california-harris-112465677_335e5b-e1760320378551.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-13 02:19:35","author":"Miranda Devine","authors":["Miranda Devine"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":368682866,"title":"Zelensky calls Trump with as much energy as he once campaigned for Harris — Putin’s envoy","text":"MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/.

EMAIL TIPS@DAILYMAIL.COM.AYU \nBy ANTOINETTE MILIENOS, NEWS REPORTER, AUSTRALIA \n Published:01:03 BST, 13 October 2025 |Updated:02:03 BST, 13 October 2025 \n\nA woman has slammed police after she was 'treated like an animal in a cage' during a strip search at a music festival.\nMonique Sellars attended a music festival in Wollongong, south of Sydney, in 2021.\nMs Sellars explained it was her first year of university and her first year living out of home when she and a group of friends decided to attend their very first music festival.\nUpon entering the festival, a police sniffer dog jumped onto the then 19-year-old Ms Sellars, and she was immediately taken into a makeshift police tent for a strip search.\nMs Sellars said the area had about three gazebos, each with three makeshift walls and one side completely open to the rest of the police search area.\nA female officer introduced herself and explained the process of the strip search before instructing Ms Sellars to remove her clothes.\nThe officer patted down her body and felt around Ms Sellars' corset as she searched for any drugs or prohibited substances.\n'I was told to sit on the floor. They took my clothes away. So I was just like sitting on the floor in a G-string and corset, exposed to the rest of the police search area,' Ms Sellars told 10 News.\n\nWestern Australian woman Monique Sellars said she was 'treated like an animal in a cage' during a police search at a music festival\n\nMs Sellars, who was 19-years-old at the time, was attending a music festival in Wollongong when a police sniffer dog jumped onto her\nNo drugs were found, but police did find a pouch of vodka, which they confiscated.\nMs Sellars claimed a male officer then entered the area unannounced and grabbed her bumbag containing all her personal belongings while she was still barely clothed.\nSitting frozen on the ground, Ms Sellars said she did not know who had access to the area, who was allowed to enter, or whether people from the festival were able to see her.\nShe added she felt like 'an animal in a cage' and that her entire strip-search ordeal was a 'very violating situation.'\n'Even though I had done nothing wrong, they just made me feel really guilty. It was condescending, violating, not humane,' Ms Sellars said.\n'Being told to just sit on a grass floor for 10 minutes with barely any clothes on whilst they take your other belongings away, to just search without you around, it was really degrading.\n'I don't think that having a dog come up and touch me was enough to have that kind of degrading experience.'\nMs Sellars is one of more than 3,000 Australians taking part in a class-action lawsuit against the NSW Police Force over their treatment during strip searches at music festivals.\n\nMs Sellars was immediately taken to a makeshift police tent where she was told to remove all her clothes for a strip search (pictured, police dogs on display) \n\nMs Sellars' said the experience was 'condescending, violating and not humane' and left her with long-lasting anxiety whenever she encounters security or police officers (pictured, police seen on patrol during Splendour in the Grass 2023)\nIt comes after another woman, Raya Meredith, was awarded $93,000 in damages after the Supreme Court of NSW found her strip search unlawful.\nMs Meredith was at the Splendour in the Grass festival in Byron Bay in 2018 when a drug detection dog sniffed towards her.\nPolice took Ms Meredith to a makeshift cubicle for a strip search and forced her to remove all her clothes, including her underwear and tampon.\nA male police officer walked into the cubicle without warning to return her bag while Ms Meredith was still naked from the waist down.\nMs Meredith was detained for about 30 minutes and released after officers failed to detect drugs or any other prohibited items.\nNSW Police officers argued the strip search was justified because the drug detection dog had sniffed towards Ms Meredith.\nIn September, Supreme Court of NSW Justice Dina Yehia condemned the humiliating and unlawful strip search and ruled in Ms Meredith's favour.\n“[NSW Police's] conclusion was entirely wrong,” Justice Yehia said.\n\nIt comes after another woman was awarded $93,000 in damages after she was forced to remove her clothes, including her underwear and tampon, during a strip search at a Splendour in the Grass festival in 2018 (pictured, general view during Splendour in the Grass 2023)\n'She recalled feeling disgusted that another woman was putting her through this. She felt like vomiting. \nJustice Yehia added the entire experience was degrading, humiliating and caused fear to Ms Meredith who felt compelled to obey police. \nMs Sellars has not specified an amount for what she believes would be fair compensation for her ordeal. \nShe added the experience has left her with heightened anxiety whenever she sees or has to pass through security, including at the airport. \nHowever, she would like to see NSW Police make changes to their strip searching laws so that others do not have the same experience. \n'Strip searching, it's a very, very personal invasion, and it can be very triggering for a lot of people,' Ms Sellars said. \n'I think that's something that's kind of forgotten just because they are the police... how I felt as a 19-year-old, I wouldn't want anyone else to go through that.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nI went to a music festival for a day of fun - but it turned out to be my worst nightmare\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

During the interview, Harris argued that recent indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James show that Trump is on a \"vengeance campaign\" against those who oppose him, using the federal government to carry it out. When host Eugene Daniels asked whether Americans can trust the Department of Justice, Harris replied that she did not believe they could. KAMALA HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE A 'MANDATE' AFTER 2024 ELECTION \"I don’t know if we can trust what’s coming out of the Department of Justice right now,\" Harris said. \"And that pains me to say that as someone who spent the majority of my career as a prosecutor, where the work of a prosecutor should be to do justice.\" She added that U.S. attorneys must be able to do their jobs \"without any fear and not in the interest of favor,\" but said that was \"not what is ruling the day\" under Trump’s administration. PROTESTERS INTERRUPT KAMALA HARRIS’ CHICAGO BOOK TOUR EVENT, FORCING MULTIPLE REMOVALS \"And when you have an administration and individuals who are manipulating the justice system of America, in that way, they best understand that this is not only about something that affects the individuals that they’re targeting. This affects all of us who believe that, flawed though it may be, that a justice system is actually supposed to be blind in the way that it does its work, not targeting people because of who they are, or for that matter, what they look like,\" Harris said. Fox News Digital reached out to the Department of Justice for comment.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy ASHLEIGH GRAY \n Published:00:49 BST, 13 October 2025 |Updated:00:57 BST, 13 October 2025 \n\nJohn Legend weighed in on President Donald Trump's failed ambitions to win a Nobel Peace Prize, despite his peace deal in the Middle East between Israel and Gaza.\nThe 79-year-old second-term Commander-in-Chief lost this year's nomination to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. \nAnd on Sunday, the 46-year-old singer had words of advice for Trump if he'd like to campaign for the honor in 2026: 'Stop declaring war on the American people, stop sending the military intro our cities simply because they're run by Democrats.'\n'He'd have to stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane sh*t he’s been trying to do,' Legend added. \nThe Save Room music artist mentioned his personal connection to the award, after having performed at 2017's Nobel ceremony. \nLegend, born John Roger Stephens, used Instagram to record a straightforward statement directed at the politician on Saturday.\n\nJohn Legend, 46, weighed in on President Donald Trump's failed ambitions to win a Nobel Peace Prize, stating he'd have to 'stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t' first\n\nLegend shared a video trolling Trump's bid for the coveted prize on Sunday, captioned: 'Trump for Peace Prize 2026!'\n\nThe 79-year-old second-term Commander-in-Chief lost this year's nomination to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado; pictured October 9\nHe captioned the video post, shared with his nearly 16 million followers: 'Trump for Peace Prize 2026!' \nThe Voice coach has long been an outspoken critic of Trump's, declaring him a racist in past remarks.\nBut on Sunday he took a softer, though snarky, approach to his differences with the former reality TV show host. \n\n Homeland Security fires back after Chappell Roan's anti-ICE outburst at LA concert \nLegend rattled off previous winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, noting that it's often been gifted to human rights activists and world leaders who had negotiated a big peace agreement.\nHe also acknowledged that the president has 'made a step in the right direction' with the recent ceasefire he helped negotiate between Palestine and Israel. \n'We all want to see peace in Gaza, in the West Bank,' he declared in the video. 'And President Trump has been instrumental in bringing about this new peace deal.'\nAnd he added, 'Let's all pray that this deal is actually lasting, that it's long-term. The people of Gaza have had their lives and their communities destroyed for the past two years.'\n'If this peace is really lasting, we just might see Donald Trump get that peace prize that he really, really wants,' the musician said. \n\nThe singer had words of advice for Trump if he'd like to campaign for the honor in 2026: 'Stop declaring war on the American people, stop sending the military intro our cities simply because they're run by Democrats'\n\n'He'd have to stop all this authoritarian dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane sh*t he’s been trying to do,' Legend added\n\nLegend and wife Chrissy Teigen have been candid about their anti-Trump stance; pictured in October 2024\n\nIn February Legend defended DEI and labeled Trump a 'white supremacist' while speaking at The Fifteen Percent Pledge's 15th Street Block Party in Hollywood\n\nThe Voice coach has long been an outspoken critic of Trump's, declaring him a racist in past remarks; pictured October 7\n\nWhile explaining that he too wants to see Trump win the award, he outlined what behavioral changes the Leader of the Free World will have to make.\n'Believe it or not, I want you to do this. I want this peace prize for you so badly. I want this for us, for all of us. Hear me out, y'all. \n'If Trump is able to actually earn the peace prize, it probably won't be enough that he's helped bring peace to the Middle East,' he prefaced before listing his latest gripes with the Trump administration.\n'Let's look at what else he would have to do: He'd have to stop sending Black Hawk helicopters to terrorize people while they sleep in their apartment buildings in Chicago,' he said, referencing the recent incident in Illinois.\n'Yes, the so-called \"Peace President\" who's ending wars around the world would also have to stop declaring war on the American people,' he emphasized. 'Stop sending the military into our cities simply because they're run by Democrats.'\nAnd pointing to the widespread ICE raids, he added, 'Stop sending masked, unaccountable ICE agents to torment immigrant communities. Stop ordering the prosecution of his political opponents on flimsy charges.'\nLegend said that in order for Trump to win the prize, he would also have to 'stop bombing boats in the Caribbean, stop executing people without proving that they've done anything wrong.'\nHe'd have to stop all this authoritarian, dictator sh*t, all the fascist sh*t, all the inhumane shit he's been trying to do.' \nToward the end of the clip, Legend stated: 'We should all really, really want Donald J. Trump to earn a Nobel Peace Prize, right?'\nThe day prior, Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria explained why she chose to dedicate the award to Trump following her shock win.\nMachado, who leads the opposition to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was announced as this year's winner 'for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela,' the committee announced.\nHer victory came as a surprise to many who believed that that Trump would be honored with the award.\nShortly after her win Machado took to X where she explained that many people across the world are relying on the president, 'to achieve Freedom and democracy'.\n\nNobel Peace Prize winner Maria explained in a recent interview why she dedicated her award to Trump \n\nMachado praised Trump as a 'clear and courageous leader' and argued that he's ended numerous wars during his presidency \n\n'I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!' Machado wrote.\nOn Saturday she further explained the dedication during an interview with Rachel Campos-Duffy on Fox News where she heaped praise on the president.\n'Not only has he been involved in only a few months in solving eight wars, but his actions have been decisive to have Venezuela now at a threshold of freedom after 26 years of tyranny,' she said.\nShe praised Trump as being a 'clear and courageous' leader, arguing that he's been an advocate for dismantling criminal structures in Venezuela.\nJohn LegendDonald TrumpDemocratsIsrael\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJohn Legend trolls Donald Trump over Nobel Peace Prize bid: 'Stop all this authoritarian dictator s***!'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 40\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It's devastating to her. She's shocked,' an unnamed source told People on Tuesday.\nThe insider also claimed that Nicole 'didn't want this and has been fighting to save the marriage.'\nDaily Mail has contacted representatives for comment.\nReese WitherspoonSandra BullockKeith Urban\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCould a divorce party be on the cards for Nicole Kidman?

Email jada.bas@dailymail.co.uk \nBy JADA BAS, TRAINEE REPORTER \n Published:23:54 BST, 12 October 2025 |Updated:00:15 BST, 13 October 2025 \n\nWould-be drivers are being fleeced out of hundreds of pounds by social media scammers promising to give them full UK licences - without ever having to take a test.\nTikTok fraudsters are offering desperate learner drivers the chance to skip the queue in what they call 'driving made easy', encouraging customers to message them on WhatsApp.\nIt comes with a hefty price tag of up to £800 as several claim to be working with the DVLA ensuring it's legitimate.\nThe Daily Mail counted more than 20 accounts like this, with the fraudsters assuring that 'you won't have to do a thing' except hand over your provisional licence for them to make arrangements.\nIn one WhatsApp exchange seen by the Daily Mail, the scammer says it's £650 to obtain a full UK licence, including the theory, driving test and card itself.\nThey claimed it is carried out as an 'inside job' by someone working within the DVLA who will take the tests for you.\nAnother opportunist charged £700 and said 'we specialise in assisting individuals who have faced multiple challenges in passing their theory test or obtaining their full driving licence.' \nThey and several others claimed to work in the DVLA and so can make changes and updates directly within the database system, which should appear in three days.\n\nWould-be drivers are being fleeced out of hundreds of pounds by social media scammers promising to give them full UK licences - without ever having to do a test\n\nIt comes as the pass rate for driving theory tests is at its 'lowest point in history', according to a 2023 report\nA fourth account also charging £700 said the process takes up to seven days and they require a £300 deposit to secure your details in the DVLA database.\nBuyers are promised an easy win as they are told, 'you won't have to take any tests or lessons, we'll handle the entire process for you from start to finish'.\nOne man behind one of the accounts said a full licence would cost £590 and guaranteed everything is '100% legit' and 'fully registered on the DVLA database.'\nHe even asked to be referred to friends as 'client satisfaction is my main priority'.\nAlongside fake licences, some promise to lift bans for £600, which drivers can be legally prosecuted for.\nWhile the cost for a HGV licence can set you back £1200 and removal of penalty points are being priced at £200 for every three points.\nOne TikTok account has taken a clip of a girl that passed her driving test first time, but have captioned that she did it with no test.\nIt has raked up 120,000 views, with skeptical users asking in the comments 'is it real', 'how does this actually work' and 'is this legal'.\n\nThey claimed it is carried out as an 'inside job' by someone working within the DVLA who will take the tests for you\nBut hundreds of others are intrigued by the possibility of fast track success and have asked 'how much', 'how can I do it' and said 'I am interested'.\nIt comes as the pass rate for driving theory tests is at its 'lowest point in history', according to a 2023 report.\n\n Learner drivers being exploited by brokers charging over DOUBLE the price for earlier tests \nLearners' chances of passing their theory test dropped by a third since 2007/08 from 65.4 per cent to just 44.2 per cent in 2022/23.\nAverage driving theory test pass rates were generally between 60 and 65 per cent in the late 2000s, though changes introduced a decade ago sparked a sharp fall in pass rates to around 50 per cent.\nThese included an increase in questions, the withdrawal of interpreters and - likely having the biggest impact - the decision to stop publishing new theory test questions online or in practice papers.\nA DVLA spokesperson said: 'These accounts are not connected to DVLA and are recognised scams that attempt to obtain payment or personal information.\n'Anyone concerned they may have been a victim of a scam should contact the police through Action Fraud straight away.'\nNo evidence to date has been identified to suggest that DVLA staff are involved in such incidents.\n\nAlongside fake licences, some promise to lift bans and points for a fee of up to £600, which drivers can be legally prosecuted for\nAny documents received as a result of applying through these social media accounts will be counterfeit, they warned.\nWith the cost of lessons mounting and the threat of being pushed to the back of a queue if they fail, many learners see the shortcut as a cheaper alternative.\nAseem Munshi, Founder of financial firm Updraft, warns that economic strain on would-be drivers is what makes the scams more tempting.\nHe said: 'When people are under pressure, whether it's from rising costs or the fear of falling further behind in the driving test queue, they're more vulnerable to offers that promise a quick solution. \n'Scammers are clever at exploiting frustration, but the only safe and legal way to get a licence is to pass your test. No social media account can shortcut that process, and paying them could cost you far more in the long run.'\nMeanwhile Britain's learner drivers are facing the biggest backlog on record and are being exploited by dodgy brokers charging more than double the price for an earlier test.\n\nWith the cost of lessons mounting and the threat of being pushed to the back of a queue if they fail, many learners see the shortcut as a cheaper alternative\nEndless waiting lists as long as six months to sit practical tests means the slots have become hot commodities.\nGiven the huge demand, a driving test black market has been created as test bookings are now being sold at inflated prices of around £200 through third party websites, Facebook groups and WhatsApp.\nUnofficial broker companies are selling the appointments by using instructors' official Personal Reference Numbers to access available slots, then selling them at an extortionate price where they take the profit off the original fee.\nThe details are then changed to match that of the buyer. The service allows learners to get a test in a matter of days or weeks.\nWhatsappDVLATikTok\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWannabe drivers who are buying fake UK licences from TIKTOK without ever taking a test are being scammed out of hundreds of pounds\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS, US ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:23:32 BST, 12 October 2025 |Updated:00:01 BST, 13 October 2025 \n\nBella Hadid shared a deeply personal reflection on her ongoing battle with anxiety and depression with her 61 million Instagram followers on Sunday.\nJust days after ringing in her 29th birthday, the supermodel shared a message of empathy and solidarity to fans experiencing similar struggles. \nIn an attempt to remind her fans to slow down and focus on the present moment, she posted a moving poem, which read: 'When the load feels too heavy, and the future is looking dark, it's okay to take a moment, if you feel you've lost your spark.' \nThe Kin Euphorics co-founder proceeded to open up about carrying the 'weight of anxiety and depression' for many years and how it has felt 'all-consuming, paralyzing, and invisible to the outside world.' \n'It can leave you in tears before starting your day, wondering why your mind feels so heavy when life around you seems so bright,' she wrote in the caption.\nHadid said she has grappled with shame surrounding her mental health, but has learned to view her sensitivity and empathy as strengths rather than weaknesses.\n\nView gallery\n\nBella Hadid shared a deeply personal reflection on her ongoing battle with anxiety and depression with her 61 million Instagram followers on Sunday\n\nDiane Keaton's final moments laid bare in chilling 911 call\n\n15.6k viewing now\n\nEye-popping pictures prove Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau ARE a couple\n\n72.5k viewing now\n\nDiane Keaton's grieving son Duke, 25, seen for first time since death\n\n8k viewing now\n\n'It's not a weakness – it's a part of me,' she shared. 'My sensitivity, my awareness, my empathy… it's what makes us human. These parts of me have helped me understand myself and others more deeply.'\nThe model went on to send words of love and support to anyone who struggles daily with mental health, assuring followers, 'You are not alone. And I love you so much.'\n\nEXCLUSIVE The grueling truth about 'missing' Bella Hadid: We've discovered what's really going on \nHadid also reflected on her work with UNICEF, saying her experiences meeting children and families who have endured trauma and displacement have deepened her understanding of resilience.\n'Beneath those smiles, they hold the same invisible battles with anxiety, PTSD, and fear, but without access to the care and safety we so often take for granted,' she said.\nThe Vogue cover girl also emphasized that access to mental health care is a 'right, not a luxury' and reminded her followers that they are 'loved, needed, and worthy.'\nShe closed her message with a compassionate reminder: 'Please don't feel afraid to ask for help. I've been there and I started to understand the workings of my mind by speaking to others.'\nHer post comes just weeks after sharing an update on her 13 year battle with Lyme Disease. \nIn September, the model sparked concern when she was seen getting an IV in her arm as she was breathing through an oxygen tube while in an overseas hospital in a series of alarming images. \n\nView gallery\n\nJust days after ringing in her 29th birthday, the supermodel shared a message of empathy and solidarity to fans experiencing similar struggles\n\nView gallery\n\n'It can leave you in tears before starting your day, wondering why your mind feels so heavy when life around you seems so bright,' she wrote in the caption of her mental health struggles\nIn another photo she appeared to be crying and then she was seen with a bag of ice on her forehead. \n'I’m sorry I always go MIA I love you guys,' Hadid captioned a collection of photos while getting treatment. \nBella's mother - 61-year-old RHOBH alum Yolanda - also posted an Instagram tribute to her 'bada** warrior' daughter. \n'I admire your bravery and your willingness to keep fighting for health despite the failing protocols and countless setbacks you have faced,' Yolanda wrote.\n'There simply aren't words big enough for the darkness, the pain, and the unknown hell you've lived through since your diagnosis. You didn't really live, you learned how to exist inside the jail of your own paralyzed brain.\n'I am so proud of the fighter that you are. You are not alone, I promise to have your back every step of the way, no matter how long this takes.'\n\nBella Hadid goes braless under a semi-sheer cropped shawl\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:30\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\nIn September, the model sparked concern as she shared photos of herself connected to an Oxygen tank and IV drip in bed \nThe mother-of-three continued: 'You have fought through another month of treatment and I know god is good, miracles do happen everyday. I pray for your speedy recovery my love.\n'This disease has brought us to our knees, but we always get back up. We will continue to fight for better days, together. You are a survivor… I love you so much.'\nLike Bella and her younger brother Anwar Hadid, the Dutch-born grandmother contracted tickborne illness in 2012 but stopped sharing her personal story because she wanted to stop 'absorbing other people's opinions about my journey.'\nYolanda is 'still determined to find a cure affordable for all' eight years after writing about seeing '106 doctors' and undergoing a Stem Cell transplant, Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, Chelation therapy, colon hydrotherapy, among other treatments in her book Believe Me.\nBella HadidInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBella Hadid details breaking down in tears before starting her days due to 'paralyzing' depression and anxiety\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nDiane Keaton's final moments laid bare in chilling 911 call\n\nDiane Keaton's grieving son Duke, 25, seen for the first time since star's sudden death as he leaves her home in LA...and honors her with a touching tribute\n\nAl Pacino reveals his one big regret after his on-screen wife Diane Keaton's death\n\nI knocked back 36 hot toddies and ended up on a platform, hellbent on jumping in front of the next train, by PAUL GASCOIGNE\n\nKylie Jenner is slammed for 'out of touch' post with fake cops amid tense ICE raids\n\n'It allowed me to grow my income without taking too much risk': The secret behind one business owner's expansion\n\nLorraine Kelly breaks her silence on brutal ITV cuts as she brands overhaul of her daytime show 'heartbreaking' and 'tough' but insists she will NOT quit\n\nRICHARD KAY: Andrew's lies have put the monarchy in peril.

Why hasn’t the US?","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics or culture.\n\nJapan is expected to soon break ground that the United States has so far left intact. By mid-October, the East Asian country could be led by a woman.\n\nSanae Takaichi was elected on Oct. 4 to lead the Liberal Democratic Party, the right-wing governing party of Japan’s coalition government. For Takaichi to replace current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is resigning, she will need to win a vote in the country’s legislature. That is expected to happen, but some hurdles remain.\n\nIf Takaichi becomes the next prime minister, Japan would become the 50th democracy led by a woman since the end of World War II. Meanwhile, the U.S. would then become one of only 20 that has kept women out of national leadership.\n\nDaily Kos reviewed data from the Council on Foreign Relations on the history of elected or appointed female heads of state and government, among United Nations member nations, since the beginning of 1946. Daily Kos updated CFR’s data, which dated to Aug. 7, to be current as of this past Tuesday. Our analysis focuses only on nations that rank as a “flawed democracy” or better on the Economist Intelligence Group’s 2024 democracy index.\n\nThe U.S. position is even more stark among its economic peers, according to Daily Kos’ analysis.\n\nSince the end of World War II, 35 high-income democracies—defined by the World Bank as those with a gross national income of at least $13,935 per capita—have had a female head of state or government. If Takaichi ascends to the role of prime minister, Japan would become the 36th, leaving the U.S. as one of just eight led exclusively by men since 1946.\n\nBut what exactly is holding the U.S. back? \n\nSexism is no doubt a big reason. Forty percent of voters say they personally know someone who wouldn’t vote for a female presidential candidate, and 18% openly admit they themselves aren’t open to casting their presidential vote for a qualified woman. Nearly 80% of Americans blame gender discrimination for why there have been fewer women than men in higher office. \n\nSociety also encourages men more than women to seek higher office. And even when women do run, their candidacies face harsher media coverage. One analysis of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary discovered that female candidates suffered more gendered and even racialized media coverage than their male counterparts did, with coverage often criticizing the women for lacking “warmth.” Kamala Harris, last year’s Democratic nominee for president, faced the same misogynistic bias.\n\nBut sexism isn’t unique to America. As of early August, only 26 of 193 U.N. member nations had a female head of state or government, according to CFR. And only six had a national legislature composed of at least 50% women.\n\nIn some ways, the U.S. has actually been more inclusive than other democracies. A 2025 report by U.N. Women, the United Nations’ agency that promotes global gender equality, found the U.S. with a higher share of women in top governmental positions (40%) than Japan had (10%). The U.S. was also ahead of New Zealand (35%), Poland (35%), Denmark (30%), and other democracies that have had a female head of state or government.\n\nAnother key reason why America’s glass ceiling is intact is our electoral process itself.\n\nMany countries that have had female leaders use a parliamentary system, unlike the U.S., which has a presidential system. Under a typical parliamentary system, the head of government is usually the leader of the largest party in the government’s lower house, which is directly elected by voters. \n\nConsider Canada. In 1993, Kim Campbell became the nation’s first—and so far only—female prime minister. But Canadians didn’t directly elect her to the role in the way Americans elect their president. Instead, she won a much smaller vote at her party’s leadership convention, and because her Progressive Conservative Party was the governing party of Canada, she became prime minister. This is a somewhat similar process to how Takaichi is set to become Japan’s first female prime minister.\n\nHowever, America chooses its head of government via voting in a presidential election. This likely introduces a distinct level of scrutiny for candidates that isn’t faced in many other democracies that have had a female leader. \n\nAnd unlike in many other countries, if President Donald Trump were to pass away or resign or be removed from office, the Republican Party would not get together and vote on his replacement. Instead, Vice President JD Vance would immediately be sworn in. (God help us.)\n\nIf the U.S. had a parliamentary system, our head of government might be chosen by the House of Representatives, which would surely be much larger. For instance, the U.K.’s House of Commons has 650 seats for a national population of about 69.3 million—or one seat for every 107,000 people or so. Give the U.S. that same ratio, and the House would have over 3,200 seats. It currently has 435. \n\nA parliamentary system in the U.S. would no doubt mean more parties—and very possibly a female head of government. In fact, if the leader of the House functioned as the U.S. president, Nancy Pelosi would’ve broken the glass ceiling in 2007.\n\nNevertheless, another quirk of our current system has already stood in the way of the nation getting a female leader: the Electoral College. If the nation elected its president by a simple national popular vote, Hillary Clinton would have become president. In 2016, she beat Trump in the popular vote by over 2.8 million votes.\n\nDespite all of this, the U.S. is trending in the right direction. The number of women serving in Congress has rapidly increased over the past 30 years. And it’s very likely the momentum will eventually, maybe even in three short years, propel a woman into the Oval Office.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Pennsylvania Democrats may soon tap a better man than Democratic Sen. John Fetterman. Since taking office, Fetterman has undergone a startling political shift, drifting to the right of the voters who pushed him into office—and new polling suggests he will face hard headwinds in his 2028 Democratic primary, should he choose to run again. A recent Quinnipiac University poll finds that just 33% of state Democrats approve of the job he’s doing, while 54% disapprove. And while Republicans widely approve of the Democratic senator—62% approve, 21% disapprove—Keystone State Republicans can’t vote in Democratic primaries. And if Fetterman were to endeavor an independent run at retaining his seat, it’s unlikely Republican voters will back him over an actual Republican.\n\n As Trump needlessly deploys troops to Democrat-run cities, most of the American public doesn’t want the National Guard involved in controlling local crime. Fifty-three percent think local police departments would better address crime in their states, while just 6% think the National Guard would, according to YouGov. Another 28% think local police and the National Guard would do equally well.\n\n Conservative misinformation, is there anything it can’t do? Just under half of Republicans (42%) falsely believe that undocumented immigrants are eligible to receive Medicaid, according to new YouGov polling. Only 29% of Republicans know undocumented immigrants are ineligible.\n\n We already know Americans hate Trump’s tariffs, but new data finds that it’s changing their shopping habits. About 1 in 3 Americans who recently shopped secondhand say they’re doing so because of the tariffs, according to Morning Consult. Ironically for Trump, secondhand shopping is one way to combat the climate crisis, which he claims is a con job and a hoax.\n\nThe United States might soon lose its measles-free status, according to a United Nations agency on public health, as outbreaks continue to spread across the nation.\n\nAt least 1,563 measles cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data published on Wednesday. That makes for the most yearly cases since 1992, which was soon after major health organizations first started recommending a second dose of the vaccine to all children.\n\nBetween 2023 and 2024, the weekly average number of cases was just 3.3. In 2025, it’s 39.0.\n\nMeasles causes a blotchy rash and a high fever, along with a cough, a runny nose, and other symptoms. It is highly contagious and bears the most threat to children and those with compromised immune systems. Measles vaccination is estimated to have saved over 93 million lives across the world between 1974 and 2024.\n\nBut now vaccination rates are falling, cases have climbed this year, and at least three people have died.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. must be thrilled.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics or culture.\n\n\n\n\nJapan is expected to soon break ground that the United States has so far left intact.

Especially those who are fiercely critical of the Biden administration’s response to the war in Gaza.\n\nAt another point in the evening in Chicago, Harris was interrupted by hecklers blaming her and Biden’s stance on Gaza for her defeat to Trump. A similar episode played out in New York City, where Harris was repeatedly shouted over by protesters during an event in Times Square.\n\n“I understand your concern and how you feel — I think I do,” she told one heckler, according to PBS. “And the reality of it is where we are right now didn’t have to be this way — in terms of the blank check that this president has given [Israel].”\n\nWriting in 107 Days, the former vice president laid the blame for those decisions on Biden, claiming that she’d urged her former boss to show more public compassion for Palestinians. Campaign officials, meanwhile, disputed that there was ever daylight between the two politicians.\n\nAs she recovers politically from the defeat to Trump last year, many have questioned whether Harris will run again for public office. Earlier this year she said in a statement that she would not run for governor in California, her home state, in 2026.\n\nHarris has not ruled out serving in other settings as her party gears up for the next presidential election cycle in 2028. \n\nThough she hasn’t indicated any clear interest in running, her name has been floated as a potential contender for the Democratic nomination. On Sunday, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said in an interview that she’d be an “incredibly strong” candidate in the next cycle.\n\nMSNBC’s Eugene Daniels that aired Sunday, Harris said that she hadn’t spoken with Biden since news broke that the former president was due to begin radiation therapy to treat prostate cancer. but told Daniels she’d left him a message and called him a “fighter.”\n\nShe added that she left him a message and called him a “fighter.” However, should she make a run for president, many in her party will have questions over how the White House’s deflected criticism about his age, the issue Harris says ended up costing her the election.","summary":"Harris met with protester for second time on ‘107 Days’ book tour","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-trump-book-election-voting-b2844063.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/23/15/02/Kamala-Harris.jpeg?crop=2715,1810,x259.5,y0&trim=0,260,0,259&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ikgy7la9-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-12 22:19:57","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":368679618,"title":"Author: Movie Critics Are All Wrong to Celebrate 'Revolutionary' New DiCaprio Movie","text":"American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis called out out the gushing critical response to Paul Thomas Anderson’s new movie One Battle After Another, saying its fans have a serious leftist bias.\n\nNew York Times film critic Manohla Dargis celebrated this Leo DiCaprio-Sean Penn flick as “an exciting, goofy and deadly serious big-screen no — a no to complacency, to oppression, to tyranny.” (Italics hers.)\n\nThe “oppression” that makes this film so “timely” is deporting illegal migrants. DiCaprio’s bumbling Bob was in a “revolutionary” group. Wrote Dargis: “Early on, Bob eagerly follows her lead during the group’s attack on a migrant detention center where, under the cover of night, they and the other insurgents disarm the military guards and liberate a crowd of men, women and children.”\n\nLet’s connect the dots. Deportation is racist. Armed resistance to deportations is “anti-racist.” Deportations are “tyranny.” Even if Americans voted for mass deportations. On his podcast, Ellis called out its politics, according to Variety:\n\nIt’s kind of shocking to see these kind of accolades for — I’m sorry, it’s not a very good movie — because of its political ideology, and it’s so obvious that’s what they’re responding to, why it’s considered a masterpiece, the greatest film of the decade, the greatest film ever made. Because it really aligns with this kind of leftist sensibility.\n\nEllis even predicted the move will eventually be dismissed as a “kind of musty relic of the post-Kamala Harris era — that thing everyone gathers around and pretends is so fantastic and so great when it really isn’t, just to make a point...There’s a liberal mustiness to this movie that already feels very dated by October 2025. Very dated. And it just doesn’t read the room. You know, it reads a tiny corner of the room, but it does not read what is going on in America.”\n\nAs for critics who hail the film as \"important,\" Ellis protested: “No, it is not. It has really not read the room. It has not read the room at all about what’s going on in America.”\n\nBut that's often how Hollywood operates. The film will be celebrated for its \"urgency\" about the Trump \"moment,\" and will probably get a pile of awards. Ellis is right: the evaluation of art often depends on whose side is served. In this case, though, the movie has earned more than $114 million at the box office. Often, the Oscar bait sells far fewer tickets.","summary":"American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis called out out the gushing critical response to Paul Thomas Anderson’s new movie One Battle After Another, saying its fans have a serious leftist bias.\n\nNew York Times film critic Manohla Dargis celebrated this Leo DiCaprio-Sean Penn flick as “an exciting, goofy and deadly serious big-screen no — a no to complacency, to oppression, to tyranny.” (Italics hers.)\n\nThe “oppression” that makes this film so “timely” is deporting illegal migrants.
