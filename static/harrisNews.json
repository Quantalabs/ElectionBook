Speaking on “The Chris Salcedo Show,” Halperin said Biden’s team harbors deep frustration over Harris.\n\n“What some Biden folks have said to me is Kamala Harris better stay on the reservation. She better stay on the good side of Joe Biden and his team. Otherwise, they’re prepared to tell the stories that they know that at least one Biden official described as Palinesque,” Halperin said.\n\nHalperin said tensions between Biden and Harris date back to the start of the administration, when Biden’s team scrambled to prepare her for the presidency in case he couldn’t finish his term.\n\n“It’s not just the book. It’s the whole relationship. The Biden folks, at the beginning of the administration, found that Kamala Harris needed a big pressure, a big briefing, series of briefings. So they spent a lot of time getting her to meet with world leaders, policy briefings to try to make sure that she was ready to be president in case Joe Biden had to step aside or left office for some other reason. Now they know all those stories,” Halperin said. (RELATED: Kevin McCarthy Has Three Questions He Wants Kamala To Answer In Her New Book)\n\nHarris said her forthcoming book, “107 Days,” will detail her short-lived presidential run and explain why she chose not to pursue California’s governorship, blaming what she called a “broken system.” Despite that criticism, Harris built her career through decades in public office, holding positions from San Francisco district attorney to U.S. senator.\n\nHarris’ next political move remains uncertain after losing the 2024 race to President Donald Trump. Major Democratic donors and strategists have shown little enthusiasm for a potential Harris 2028 campaign, pointing to her $1.5 billion spending spree marked by media buys and celebrity events.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The network will be ending The Late Show in May.\"\n\n \"It's not just the end of our show, but it's the end of The Late Show on CBS. I'm not being replaced,\" he said. \"This is all just going away. And I do want to say that the folks at CBS have been great partners.\"\n\n Colbert expressed his gratitude to everyone behind the scenes of the show and to the fans who watch.\n\n \"And let me tell you, it is a fantastic job. I wish somebody else was getting it, and it's a job that I'm looking forward to doing with this usual gang of idiots for another 10 months,\" he said. \"It's gonna be fun.\"\n\n CBS said in a statement that the cancellation of The Late Show was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\" \n\n The network added that it was \"not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,\" the parent company of CBS.\n\n Many questioned the timing of the cancellation, as the decision came days after Colbert criticized Paramount during his July 14 episode for its $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump on July 3.\n\n Trump had alleged that CBS News' 60 Minutes had deceptively edited an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election.\n\n The settlement occurred while Paramount was in the middle of a merger with the entertainment company Skydance, a business move that required approval from Trump's administration.\n\n The merger was complete on Aug. 7, the same day as Colbert's most recent new Late Show episode.\n\n Colbert has already lined up an exciting new gig outside of The Late Show. \n\n The comedian will guest star on Elsbeth season 3. While many details about his role are under wraps for now, PEOPLE learned that art will imitate life as he will play a late-night talk show host on the Carrie Preston-starring series.\n\n Preston plays the titular Elsbeth Tascioni, an attorney from Chicago who utilizes her equally unique and quirky perspective to help the New York Police Department solve crimes.\n\n Colbert had previously expressed interest in appearing on the series when Wendell Pierce stopped by The Late Show in February.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n The Late Show with Stephen Colbert returns with new episodes on Tuesday, Sept. 2 on CBS.","summary":"CBS recently announced that the late-night talk show will come to an end in May 2026","url":"https://people.com/when-is-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-coming-back-11790624","image":"https://people.com/thmb/hMsHeV1ccN1Lglji5qeS3EHCyUc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/stephen-colbert-1-080125-ff47ed205dd04c2189d008f424d9f572.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 22:46:14","author":"Carson Blackwelder","authors":["Carson Blackwelder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.16},{"id":350860912,"title":"Bezos pushes the Washington Post further into the Trump gutter","text":"The Washington Post published a couple of op-eds Tuesday from Trump officials trying to spin administration initiatives, reflecting the paper’s rightward shift under owner and multibillionaire Jeff Bezos.\n\nIn her op-ed, recently installed U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro argued in favor of the Trump administration’s decision to infiltrate the capital with federal law enforcement and the National Guard, despite falling crime rates.\n\nPirro was confirmed earlier this month by Senate Republicans, despite her long history of promoting unfounded conspiracy theories on Fox News.

We don't want you on Staten Island,\" a protester wearing a \"Trump girl\" t-shirt and holding an American flag shouted at the 33-year-old self-described socialist as he exited the backdoor of the Istanbul Bay Authentic Mediterranean Restaurant. Inside the event, as Mamdani kicked off his third anti-Trump event of the week, protesters outside the restaurant drowned out the introductory speeches with their cowbells, sirens and megaphones. Despite the heat in the crowded restaurant and his detractors outside, Mamdani maintained a smile throughout the event and told reporters, \"It saddens me to hear language of being told to go back to where I came from, and yet, it is not surprising because it is so much of what characterizes President Trump's politics.\" MAMDANI TAKES AIM AT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN FIERY STATEN ISLAND SPEECH: 'WE ARE FIGHTING TO KEEP NYC A SANCTUARY CITY' Mamdani was hosting his third \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" event of the week on Wednesday, reaffirming his commitment to protecting New Yorkers from Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration if he's elected mayor of New York City this November. MAMDANI ZINGS CUOMO IN RENT-STABILIZED HOUSING SPAT DURING ANTI-TRUMP TOUR STOP \"I will not let it dissuade me from continuing to come to Staten Island, from continuing to speak to New Yorkers, no matter where they live, no matter what politics they have,\" Mamdani said in response to the protesters. \"Because I know that just as there are Republicans who feel that way, there are others who are sincere in their questions.\" Several protesters outside the restaurant told Fox News Digital that they planned to vote for Curtis Sliwa, CEO of the Guardian Angels, this November. \"He's the only one that could save our city,\" Ed, a Staten Islander carrying a large American flag, said. Ed told Fox News Digital that he wanted to give Mamdani \"a little surprise party\" and let the socialist candidate know that his values do not represent those of Staten Island. \"This is Trump country,\" said Manny, another protester and Wall Street retiree who said Mamdani's policies are \"anti-Wall Street.\" Trump won Staten Island by 30 points in the 2024 presidential election, according to The New York Times' data. Meanwhile, in neighboring Brooklyn, former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the borough by 44 points. Tommy Banks, a native Staten Islander, said his message to Mamdani on Wednesday was simple: \"Get out of town.\" \"He wants to make everything free. He can't afford that. He's a socialist. He don't live that. We're not socialist,\" Banks said. Banks agreed with the other protesters outside the restaurant, telling Fox News Digital that \"nobody else\" could be mayor but Sliwa. \"He's a true New Yorker. He's been fighting for New York all his life. Give him a chance to get in there,\" Banks said. Another protester, Liz, shouted, \"Mamdani's a commie!\" as the Democratic nominee departed in his SUV. Liz said she doesn't like Mamdani because \"he's not a Democrat, he's a communist.\" She said Mamdani is trying to tempt New Yorkers with campaign promises like free childcare, free bus fare and government-run grocery stores, but Liz said it would be a \"disaster\" if he became mayor. When Mamdani declared victory in the Democratic primary, incumbent mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, called Mamdani a \"snake-oil salesman\" that would \"say and do anything to get elected.\" Trump has often criticized Mamdani and his policies, calling him a \"100% communist lunatic.\" Staten Islanders who spoke to Fox News Digital outside Mamdani's anti-Trump event on Wednesday seemed to agree with those sentiments, calling him a \"commie\" and criticizing his socialist policies, which include freezing the rent, raising corporate taxes and increasing the minimum wage. But Shahana Masum, who sported a \"Zohran for Staten Island\" sticker on her purse and attended the event, told Fox News Digital that Mamdani is the person who is representing \"me and my community.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Masum said she has also been told to go back to her country.

According to CBS News, the first town hall took place on Tuesday in New Jersey with Mayor Ras Baraka, Rep. Monica McIver, and several other local leaders in attendance. Baraka and McIver were both arrested earlier this year at a protest outside of a Newark ICE detention center. Baraka had his charges dropped, but McIver was charged with assaulting a federal law enforcement officer. “It may still seem far away, but the 2026 midterm elections will determine whether our democracy still holds on or whether the people surrender their power to a king,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement to CBS News. “So, from our perspective, as the NAACP, it’s clear: we’ve got to start organizing early.” Johnson’s warning of democracy being at risk is far from hyperbole. The NAACP’s town halls come as Texas Republicans have begun a redistricting process critics have called blatant gerrymandering. Texas Democrats have stood their ground, fleeing the state to prevent a vote on a new map that would add five new seats in Republican-controlled districts. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered the arrest of the Texas Democrats and filed a lawsuit to have the lawmakers removed from office. The Texas redistricting effort has inspired several Democrat-led states to consider a redistricting attempt of their own to counterpunch Texas. These aren’t things that happen in a healthy, well-functioning democracy. In the coming months, the NAACP plans to have town halls in Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, Wisconsin, New York, and Maryland. The town halls will focus on Trump’s policies and the adverse effect they’ve had on Black communities. This includes the Trump administration’s attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools and workplaces, as well as examining how cuts to SNAP benefits and Medicaid will disproportionately affect Black communities. “Our neighbors are being illegally kidnapped by ICE, Trump’s budget is taking away our health care and access to food stamps, and our civil rights are being stripped away at every turn – all while costs, from housing to groceries, continue to rise, and the billionaire class get richer,” Johnson said in the statement. The town halls will also encourage civic engagement with information on how to help with voter recruitment, grassroots organizing, and old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning. “We’ve got to strengthen community, recruit volunteers, inform each other about Donald Trump’s oppressive policies, and map out local strategies that will ensure everybody gets out to vote,” Johnson said in the statement. “As we build toward the 2026 midterm election, our campaign will focus on connecting past liberation struggles to the urgent demands of the present,” Wisdom Cole, the NAACP’s Senior National Director of Advocacy, told CBS. The NAACP spent $20 million on voter mobilization efforts during the 2024 election, which helped get 14.5 million Black voters to the polls. While Black voters overwhelmingly went for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, 21% of Black men voted for Donald Trump. Given how much contempt the Trump administration has shown to Black and brown communities over the last year, one only hopes that number goes down significantly in the midterms.

Those warrants can only be enforced within state lines, making them largely symbolic for the lawmakers who had absconded to Illinois, Massachusetts and New York.\n\nBut Burrows and Paxton took the unusual step of asking courts in those states to carry out the warrants and bring the lawmakers back to Texas.\n\nOn Wednesday, Illinois Judge Scott Larson rejected the petition, ruling that Paxton and Burrows had “failed to present a legal basis for the court” to take up the issue.\n\nIllinois courts’ cannot consider whether “foreign legislators” were willfully evading their duties, and they cannot direct Illinois law enforcement to execute civil quorum warrants upon “nonresidents temporarily located in the State of Illinois,” Larson said, noting that the warrants specifically say they are to be enforced within Texas. Even if the court were to take up the case, which Larson ruled it lacks the ability to do, the response would be a ruling on whether the lawmakers are willfully disobeying a court order — not an order returning them to Texas as Paxton and Burrows demanded, Larson said.\n\nSpokespeople for Paxton and Burrows did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Illinois’ westernmost county, four and a half hours away from the Chicago suburb where the Democrats have camped out. The county voted for Trump by 47 percentage points in 2024, suggesting Paxton was seeking a friendlier venue than he might have found in DuPage County — where the Democrats are staying — which went for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by 14 points.\n\nThe Legislature is winding down its first 30-day special session, which was abruptly interrupted by the Democrats’ quorum break. Burrows has said he will adjourn the session Friday if there is no quorum, and Gov. Greg Abbott has promised to call lawmakers back immediately for another overtime round.\n\nThe new congressional map, drawn after pressure from President Donald Trump, aims to give Republicans five additional seats to shore up the party’s slim majority in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15! This year’s lineup just got even more exciting with the addition of State Rep. Caroline Fairly, R-Amarillo; former United States Attorney General Eric Holder; Abby Phillip, anchor of “CNN NewsNight”; Aaron Reitz, 2026 Republican candidate for Texas Attorney General; and State Rep.

Throughout that season, the Chiefs' WAGs were spotted in suites together at several Chiefs games, and it was not uncommon to see them hanging out outside of games with their significant others. However, the two appeared to support different candidates in the 2024 presidential election. Mahomes liked a post from Donald Trump on Instagram and wrote several messages regarding her critics, while Swift openly endorsed Kamala Harris. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The duo made headlines at the Chiefs' first game against the Ravens when they sat in separate suites to open the season. The two sat separately after Brittany incited backlash for publicly liking a post by Trump on Instagram. Swift fan groups on social media were partially responsible for circulating screenshots of Brittany's like of Trump's post. Trump even weighed in on the controversy after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president on Sept. 10. In an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" the next day, Trump said he liked Brittany \"much better\" than Swift. However, Swift and Brittany continued to occasionally make public appearances together throughout last season, and Brittany even congratulated Swift on winning back ownership of her music in May.

Why?","text":"It’s a tough time to be a Democrat.\n\nThe party is locked out of power in Washington, largely relegated to the sidelines as President Donald Trump pursues his sweeping agenda. Republicans are trying to redraw congressional maps in Texas and other states, adding potential hurdles to Democrats’ efforts to take back the House in 2026.\n\nThen there are the polls.\n\nDespite the fact that Mr. Trump’s approval rating has fallen to its lowest point since Inauguration Day, Democrats are facing historically ugly numbers of their own. Poll after poll has shown them to be underwater, with higher unfavorable ratings than favorable ones. In four July surveys, Democrats were between 26 and 30 percentage points underwater, hitting levels of unpopularity not seen in decades. In the long-running Gallup survey, the Democratic Party’s approval rating hit 34%, the lowest ever recorded by the polling firm.\n\nOne subgroup driving the Democrats’ poor ratings: their own base. A recent CNN poll found that Democratic voters currently hold far more negative views of their own party than Republican voters do of theirs. At town hall events and in focus groups, frustrated Democrats say they want their representatives to push back harder against the Trump administration. But congressional Democrats have few tools to do so, especially as the courts have allowed Mr. Trump to keep expanding presidential power.\n\n“Outside of banging your fist on a table, there aren’t many mechanisms on the federal side for Democrats to step up and stop the president,” says Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist. “That’s what’s really driving this sense of despair and hopelessness coming from the base. They want Democrats to do something about it, but they can’t.”\n\nDemocratic politicians eyeing potential 2028 presidential runs have tried to break the despair cycle with marathon speeches, social media tit for tat, and stunts such as hosting Texas legislators who fled the state in their attempt to block Republican gerrymandering efforts.\n\nBut the party remains without a clear leader. Complicating the messaging challenge, its base has moved left since Mr. Trump’s first term, with more Democrats self-identifying as liberals, even as the party grapples with an urgent need to woo independent voters who helped Mr. Trump win all seven swing states last November.\n\nDemocratic operatives admit the base’s frustration is cause for concern, particularly if it depresses turnout. But some also see it as fuel for much-needed change. For Democrats to be successful in 2026 and 2028, they can’t keep doing things the same way, they say. And Democrats will have to start by showing they can respond to disgruntled voters – both far-left and moderate – who are increasingly unhappy with politics as usual.\n\n“This is an opportunity,” says Jennifer Hilsbos, chair of the Pinal County Democrats in Arizona. “We like to talk and explain things, but we don’t spend enough time listening. No one was sitting down at kitchen tables last year and listening to voters say what they needed from us.”\n\nMs. Hilsbos, who was elected chair a few months after Mr. Trump took back Arizona on his romp to the White House last fall, has been spending three to five hours in a public place every week, so voters can come talk to her. She says she wants to show them her party can “focus on more than just the ‘isms,’” such as racism or feminism. In her increasingly red county outside Phoenix, that means more conversations about immigration.\n\n“We have recognized there is a problem,” says Ms. Hilsbos, “and now we’re trying to address it.”\n\nYoung Democrats taking on incumbents\n\nFor many, fixing the party’s problems will require not just fresh thinking – but fresh faces. A slate of younger Democrats have already launched primary challenges against longtime congressional incumbents ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nDemocrats’ rock-bottom polling “has been a long time coming,” says Harry Jarin, a Democrat running in Maryland against Rep. Steny Hoyer, a former House majority leader who has been in Congress for more than four decades. Voters have become disillusioned with the party, says Mr. Jarin, because veteran Democrats like Mr. Hoyer haven’t solved problems that matter to them, such as a lack of affordable housing. Worse, he adds, many voters don’t know what the party stands for.\n\n“You could have gone to any polling booth in America on Election Day last year and the average voter [knew] what Donald Trump’s plan for the future was,” says Mr. Jarin. “I’m not sure you could have said the same about [Kamala] Harris or the Democratic Party.”\n\nMr. Jarin has seen that play out within his volunteer firefighting department. When he joined 12 years ago, the firehouse was split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. Now, he says, the entire department is “100 percent MAGA Republican” except for him and one woman.\n\nGeorge Hornedo has seen a similar drop in support for Democrats in Indianapolis, where 2024 voter turnout was the lowest in two decades. Mr. Hornedo, a Democratic strategist, has launched a primary challenge against Rep. André Carson, a nine-term congressman representing one of Indiana’s two Democratic House districts. He says Democrats need to rebuild their state parties.\n\n“Too often, we bring spoons to a knife fight when Republicans bring a machete,” says Mr. Hornedo. “I may not like what the Republicans are doing, but we can’t say they aren’t thinking out of the box.”\n\nWhen a recent Associated Press poll asked Democratic voters to describe their party, fewer than one-quarter offered positive adjectives. The most common descriptors were “weak” and “tepid.”\n\nFrustrated – but still motivated to vote\n\nStill, just because voters are frustrated with their party’s representatives doesn’t mean they’ll vote for the other side. In polls where Democratic voters have given their own party poor marks, they also have given Democrats an edge in voting preferences.\n\nAnd, right now, Democrats appear more motivated to vote than Republicans. In the CNN poll from July, 74% of Democratic voters called themselves “extremely motivated” to vote in next year’s congressional elections, while only 54% of Republican voters said the same. If the election were held today, 46% of voters in a recent Wall Street Journal poll said they would vote for a Democratic candidate, compared with 43% who said they would vote for a Republican.\n\nIt’s not as clear an advantage at this point as it was in 2017, ahead of 2018’s “blue wave.” But Democrats have led Republicans in YouGov’s poll of a generic congressional ballot – where respondents are asked to pick between an unnamed Democrat and an unnamed Republican – for the past six months. And the Democratic Party surpassed the Republican Party in voter identification in the first half of 2025, according to Gallup, after the GOP had led through most of 2024.\n\n“At the end of the day, elections are binary choices,” says DJ Koessler, a Democratic strategist who worked on Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign. Democratic voters might be frustrated with their own party, but their antipathy toward Mr. Trump’s GOP could be strong enough to make up for it.\n\nMr. Koessler expects Democrats’ poll numbers to improve as the midterm elections get closer and actual candidates are campaigning against Mr. Trump’s agenda – including his “Big Beautiful Bill,” which remains widely unpopular. To effectively convey their message, he and others add, Democrats will need to build a new media ecosystem through social media and podcasts, as Republicans have done.\n\n“All this chaos is going to give us the opportunity to rebuild,” says Mr. Hornedo. “Do we rebuild back to what we have which wasn’t sufficient? Or do we have the imagination to think about what can be?”","summary":"Frustrated Democratic voters describe their party as “weak” and “tepid.” As Democrats try to regain their footing ahead of next year’s midterm elections, some call for fresh faces and fresh thinking.","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2025/0813/democrats-polls-unpopularity-midterms?icid=rss","image":"https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/08/0813%20NDEMS%20aoc%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_1200x800","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 19:00:08","author":"Story Hinckley","authors":["Story Hinckley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.477},{"id":350820762,"title":"'Hercules' Star Turned Trump Looney Kevin Sorbo Fumes Over Male On Football Team's Cheerleading Squad and Threatens to End Fandom — As 'Has Been' Actor Mocked Over 'Fragile' Stance","text":"Kevin Sorbo has found another way to cling to relevancy, this time raging over a man on an NFL team's cheerleading squad, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe 66-year-old, best known for his role on the TV series Hercules, took to X to complain and even threatened to find a new team to root for.Sorbo Ripped For Being 'Fragile'On Tuesday, August 12, Sorbo took to X to post a video of a male dancing in a cheerleading uniform while holding pom poms.

Lawless would hit back, claiming Sorbo has only stuck up for one Black person: suspected killer O.J. Simpson.\n\nShe claimed at the time: \"The NZ summer, Feb 1995, when my character, Xena, was introduced into my husband's show, 'Hercules the Legendary Journeys.' \n\n\"We actors were sitting around, and I brought up a news item. I said, 'Guys, did you guys hear about that woman and her friend who were brutally murdered in LA? I think maybe the footballer did it!'\"\"And Peanut [Sorbo] growled: 'Hey! I knew Nicole [Brown Simpson], and let me tell you… she was no picnic!' BOOM,\" Lawless added.\n\nLawless reportedly said Nicole \"didn’t deserve to be stabbed to death.\" To which, Sorbo is accused of responding, \"I'm just saying, she was a piece of work.\" \n\n\"It stuck in my mind because those Americanisms were unusual to us. But we knew what he meant,\" Lawless recalled.\n\nDespite his shocking comments throughout the last couple of years, Sorbo thinks he will be welcomed back into Hollywood, even while being the \"first canceled victim,\" all thanks to President Trump.\"Well, I'm the first cancel culture victim before I knew it was a term,\" the deluded Sorbo said during an interview with Fox News Digital. \n\n\"Hollywood booted me up a dozen years ago for things I was posting on the internet. And I looked at my age and I said, 'Oh, you guys are upset that I'm posting the truth? Is that a problem with you guys?' Because they hate the truth, and they hate anybody who's a Christian in Hollywood, anybody who is a conservative.\" \n\n\"So I'm like a double leper to them. I'm, like, kryptonite or something,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Sorbo thinks things are changing.He explained: \"I think people are tired of it, and Hollywood's tired of losing money, like they're going to lose another $300million on this woke Disney movie with Snow White.\n\n\"I think the American people are fed up, and I think they showed it in the last election as well.

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., is recycling the “democracy in danger” declaration as he opposes Senate Republican appropriations efforts. \n\nMurphy, who is the Democratic Deputy Conference Secretary in the Senate, explained that in his view working with Senate Republicans to fund the government through appropriations bills was “putting a bipartisan veneer of endorsement on an illegal process that’s ultimately part of [Trump’s] campaign to destroy our democracy.” \n\nAs Politico recently reported, Murphy has in the past few weeks come out against every spending measure that has been moved forward during the Senate Appropriations Committee markups when he was present in the process. He also voted against the Senate’s stopgap funding bill in March, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. was criticized by some Democrats for allowing to become law. \n\nThe strident opposition to the GOP agenda coupled with media appearances, including on a notable social conservative’s podcast, has prompted prognostication that the Connecticut senator may be setting himself up for a future presidential run. As such Murphy’s rhetoric is a potential bellwether for whether Democrats will continue to discuss American democracy’s state in such bleak terms.\n\nDemocracy in danger rhetoric was a mainstay during the final months of last year’s presidential race with then-President Joe Biden declaring at the Democratic National Convention, “We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024.” 2024 Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris had urged voters to imagine “Donald Trump with no guardrails.” But those arguments fell flat to the extent that Trump managed to surge not only an electoral college win from all seven swing states, but also a plurality of the popular vote. Trump’s popular vote victory was the first time the Republicans managed such a feat since 2004.\n\nBut the talking point has not abated with Trump’s decisive victory. In a recent interview with Stephen Colbert, Harris said, “I always believed that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles, and I think right now that they’re not as strong as they need to be.” \n\nSuch rhetoric has been a part of the discourse around the president and his supporters for about ten years at this point. \n\nOne of the most notable proponents of the line about democracy in peril was none other than former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In a July 2016 speech given in Springfield, Illinois, Clinton said, “This man [Trump] is the nominee of the party of Lincoln. We are watching it become the party of Trump, and that’s not just a huge loss for our democracy, it is a threat to it.” \n\nThe mainstream media has also taken to portraying the president and his supporters as opponents to the American system of government. “Trump’s triumph threatens an already battered democracy, experts say,” ran one headline from the Washington Post published a day after the president won reelection in 2024. That paper had previously unveiled the slogan “Democracy Dies in Darkness” in February 2017 as Trump was beginning his first term. “Capitalizing on Democrats’ weakness, President Trump is winning his battle to undermine democracy in this country,” begins a recent opinion article in the New York Times.\n\nFor now, Murphy’s dogged approach to appropriations is getting a decidedly lukewarm reception from Democrat colleagues.\n\n“He has the right to his opinion, and I just have the opinion that the more we can do to get bills done, the better chance we have of getting better things for our country.” Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash, the Senate Appropriations Committee vice chair, remarked. \n\n“I’m not his spokesperson, so all I can say is: We’ve been demanding a bipartisan process. So when there’s a step in that direction, I think it’s our obligation to try to be constructive,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii., commented.","summary":"Sen.

Her fans expect that the episode itself could shatter podcast records and said they hope the producers have “backup servers to handle the traffic.”\n\nIn anticipation of the episode, multiple news and entertainment outlets, from the Associated Press to People magazine, have published stories to let the public know how they can listen or watch Swift on the podcast — as if her appearance is of significant national importance, like the Super Bowl or Donald Trump’s inauguration.\n\nSpeaking of Trump, the fact that there’s been so much frenzy around Swift going on a podcast seems to counter his declaration in May that she’s “no longer hot,” as Billboard reported. On Truth Social on May 16, Trump raged: “Has noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?'”\n\nTrump could have been talking about Swift’s looks, although he revealed in an interview, published in a June 2024 book, that he found her to be “unusually beautiful” — even if she’s “liberal,” Billboard also reported.\n\nIn terms of Swiftness being “hot,” Trump was most likely talking about her as a force in national culture. And he changed his tune about her appeal in September 2024 after the “Reputation” singer endorsed Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival in the 2024 election. Swift’s highly anticipated endorsement of the vice president came shortly after Trump and Harris finished their one and only debate.\n\nIn her Instagram post, which received more than 11.5 million likes, Swift said, “I’m voting for @kamalaharrisbecause she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.”\n\nSwift also took issue with Trump earlier using AI images of her to portray her as a MAGA supporter. “The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth,” Swift said.\n\nIn response, Trump said: “I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time … She’s a very liberal person, she seems to always endorse a Democrat and she’ll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.” Several days later, Trump posted an all-caps declaration on Truth Social: “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!”\n\nTrump got to gloat after he and Swift attended the 2025 Super Bowl, and Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. At one point, some people in the crowd booed when Swift’s face appeared on the giant screens at the stadium. Trump used the boos to contend that Swift’s cultural influence was on the wane because she didn’t endorse him.\n\n“The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!”\n\nSince Swift announced her new album in a clip promoting the “New Heights” episode, her fans have speculated that her new album might contain diss tracks about Trump, according to the Daily Mail. TMZ also said she could write about the reported end of her friendship with Blake Lively, from whom she reportedly became estranged after Lively dragged her into Lively’s messy legal battle against Justin Baldoni.\n\nOverall, little is known about Swift’s appearance on the podcast. In one of the clips, she told the Kelce brothers she wanted to show them something, revealing a mint-green briefcase that featured her initials in orange. She then pulled out a vinyl record with a blurred cover.\n\n“This is my brand new album, ‘The Life of a Showgirl,’” she shared.\n\nIn another teaser, Swift took a playful swipe at “male sports fans.” She said to the Kelce brothers: “As we all know, you guys have a lot of male sports fans that listen to your podcast. I think we all know that if there’s one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens — it’s more of me.”\n\nSwift’s joke played off the backlash she has received from football fans for being shown too many times on TV screens during games. This same clip also had Jason Kelce jubilantly introducing Swift by shouting out many accomplishments, which could again counter Trump’s view that she’s no longer a cultural force.\n\n“She is the most awarded artist in the history of the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, and I Heart Radio Music Awards,” Jason Kelce declared. “Fourteen Grammy Awards, and is the only artist in the history of the awards to win album of the year four times. Last December, she wrapped up (her) Eras Tour, which spanned 149 shows across 51 cities, five continents. It was the most attended tour of all time. Her last album, ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ set a record with 1.76 billion streams within the first week alone.”\n\nMeanwhile, Swift’s episode of the “New Heights” podcast premieres 7 p.m Pacific time. It will be available to stream in full on YouTube. Fans who would prefer to listen to the show, instead, can do so via most podcast-streaming platforms: Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, Audible, Spotify and Wondery, which produces the show.","summary":"All the social media frenzy surrounding Taylor Swift's new album and appearance on Travis Kelce's 'New Heights' podcast Wednesday seems to counter Trump's declaration in May that she's 'no longer hot.'","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/13/taylor-swift-on-new-heights/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ENTER-MUS-SWIFT-KELCE-GET.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 18:06:15","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":350814932,"title":"Laura Loomer sets her sights on her next target to get the boot from the Trump administration","text":"After playing an outsized role in pushing out roughly a dozen Trump administration officials for supposedly showing insufficient allegiance to the president, far-right extremist and self-appointed MAGA “loyalty” enforcer Laura Loomer is now setting her sights on a new target.\n\nIn an interview with Politico Playbook this week, Loomer said she is taking aim at Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his senior counselor Stefanie Spear over concerns that Kennedy is eyeing a 2028 presidential run. \n\nLoomer, who says she is running a tipline to purge “disloyal” members from the administration, told Politico that while she is realistic about the unlikeliness of her running Kennedy out of Washington, she does feel she can knock out some of his deputies – with Spear being front and center on her list.\n\n“I’m not naive enough to think that the president is going to get rid of RFK, but I will say that … there are concerns about some of the staffing decisions over at HHS,” Loomer said.\n\nSpear, who served as the principal communications adviser on Kennedy’s long-shot 2024 presidential campaign, is now one of his closest aides at HHS and apparently tightly controls access to the secretary.\n\nAccording to Politico, even before Loomer began targeting her, Spear had begun to run members of the Trump administration the wrong way and had “been a thorn in their side for months,” with many expressing concern about her influence on Kennedy. However, for Loomer, the main issue is that Spear is apparently steering the 71-year-old MAHA leader towards another presidential run. \n\n“I think that there’s a clear intention by Stefanie Spear to utilize her position to try to lay the groundwork for a 2028 RFK presidential run,” Loomer claimed, adding that she knew this through “sources in HHS.”\n\nWhile Spear did not respond to Politico’s story, a senior HHS leader did not deny that Kennedy is indeed weighing a presidential bid. A Trump administration official also said they “would not be surprised if [Kennedy is] thinking about” running again, even though they “don’t think anyone thinks it’s a real threat.”\n\nWith the 79-year-old president constitutionally ineligible to run in 2028, though he has repeatedly quipped about campaigning for a third term, Trump has suggested that Vice President JD Vance will be the MAGA movement’s heir apparent – though he has yet to officially crown Vance as his successor.\n\nIn response to Loomer’s campaign against Spear and Kennedy, HHS acting chief of staff Matt Buckham said Kennedy and his staff “are laser-focused on delivering President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again” while ignoring “Beltway gossip” and political speculation.\n\n“Secretary Kennedy and the entire HHS team are doing a terrific job as they deliver on President Trump’s mandate to Make America Healthy Again,” a White House official told Politico. “Scores of prominent restaurant chains and food brands dropping artificial ingredients from our food supply and historic reforms at the FDA to fast track lifesaving drugs and treatments prove that the entire HHS team is delivering for the American people.”\n\nSpear helped kickstart speculation about a Kennedy 2028 run last month when she joined an organizing call for MAHA supporters and influencers that Kennedy’s super PAC co-hosted, Axios reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy has long been in Loomer’s crosshairs. Despite his vaccine skepticism and embrace of conspiracy theories, which generally align with Loomer’s worldview, she has labeled Kennedy a “Marxist” and “very problematic person.” Also, after Loomer successfully launched a campaign to oust FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad for being a “progressive leftist saboteur” last month, the agency brought him back two weeks later as its top vaccine regulator.\n\nBesides taking issue with Spear supposedly prepping a Kennedy presidential run, Loomer is also lobbing allegations of disloyalty at the HHS aide.\n\n“There’s been some things that have happened,” Loomer cryptically said. “There’s been several things that have happened at HHS that are contradictory to the initial promises made.”\n\nOutside of her role as “Trump’s Rasputin,” which has prompted the president’s inner circle to grow tired of her influence, the “proud Islamophobe” has also been busy with her defamation lawsuit against HBO late-night host Bill Maher for joking that she “might be” sleeping with Trump.\n\nIn an off-the-rails deposition with HBO lawyer Katherine Bolger late last month, Loomer not only claimed that she lost out on a White House job because of Maher’s quip but also repeatedly tried to avoid admitting that she made her own wild accusations about prominent figures.\n\nAt one point, after Loomer refused to explain what she meant when she tweeted an especially gross allegation about Kamala Harris, Bolger apparently had enough. “God, you’re a coward,” the attorney said. “You’re a coward, you won’t even admit to what you did.”","summary":"‘I’m not naive enough to think that the president is going to get rid of RFK, but I will say that … there are concerns about some of the staffing decisions over at HHS,’ Laura Loomer said this week.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/laura-loomer-rfk-hhs-stefanie-spear-b2807088.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/12/15/newFile-11.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ycDaAiU0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-13 17:36:26","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":350767986,"title":"Patrick Mahomes reveals what Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce did immediately after recording New Heights show","text":"Patrick Mahomes is a true Swiftie. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is just as excited as the rest of the world for Taylor Swift's debut appearance on boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason's New Heights podcast.\n\nThe pop sensation is set to make her long-awaited guest appearance on the hit show in a special episode Wednesday night to unveil her 12th studio album: The Life of a Showgirl. \n\nAnd while Mahomes, Travis's Kansas City teammate and close friend, is eagerly awaiting the release, he admitted that he got a little heads-up. \n\nThe three-time Super Bowl winner revealed that he was the NFL's power couple's immediate port of call after wrapping up the recording. Or rather, his wife was. \n\n'It surprised me too,' he said when asked about the special episode. 'I mean I knew before y'all did just because they called me after the podcast was done.'\n\n'They didn't call me, they called Brittany. I was in the back of the FaceTime,' he added, hilariously self-correcting. \n\nThe Mahomeses have struck up a close bond with Travis and Taylor since the pop sensation began dating the tight end two years ago. The two couples have frequently spent time during the offseason together and even dined out in New Orleans before February's Super Bowl. \n\n'I'm obviously super excited,' Mahomes continued. 'Just knowing Taylor and seeing the process from just a little bit closer of how she makes the albums, it's going to be amazing because of how much work she puts into it.\n\n'What better place to announce it than New Heights podcast, where I feel like she can be herself and showcase who she is. I think people are going to be really excited to watch it tonight. I haven't seen it yet, just little clips of it. But I'll be tuning in tonight just like everybody else. I'll be able to have something to watch on this night off that I have here.'\n\nThe signal caller already considered Travis to be a close friend, however his wife Brittany warmly welcomed the singer into the NFL world with open arms. \n\nThroughout Taylor's first season as a Chiefs WAG, the duo were frequently spotted cheering on their NFL beaus from a luxury suite at Arrowhead Stadium, even preparing a special handshake to celebrate touchdowns. \n\nHowever, there was speculation that their political differences may have triggered a rift between the close friends last summer. \n\nBrittany sparked a meltdown when she was spotted liking a social media post endorsing Donald Trump ahead of the presidential election. Taylor, meanwhile, made her own stance clear when she shared a statement on Instagram publicly endorsing Trump's rival for the White House, Kamala Harris.\n\nThe two WAGs were not seen together as games as frequently last season, sparking speculation that they had drifted apart. However, that doesn't appear to be true with the two couples seemingly as close as ever. \n\nChiefs head coach Andy Reid shared Mahomes's enthusiasm as he gushed over Travis and Taylor's romance. \n\n'Listen, I'm like really old. My grandkids will be all over it,' the 67-year-old told reported Wednesday when asked if he'll be tuning into the podcast.\n\n'I'm happy for them,' he added of the A-List couple. 'Both of them care about each and what a plus that is. The older you get, you want these guys to have someone they can settle down with. I think it's a neat deal for both of them.","summary":"The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is just as excited as the rest of the world for Taylor Swift's debut appearance on boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason's New Heights podcast.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14997485/Patrick-Mahomes-Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce-new-heights-recording.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/13/17/101191367-0-image-m-15_1755102059530.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 16:24:43","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":350758132,"title":"US presidents have always used transactional foreign policy – but Trump does it differently","text":"The US president, Donald Trump, watched on recently as the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands in the White House. They had just signed what Trump called a “peace deal” to end nearly four decades of conflict. \n\nThe deal grants the US exclusive rights to develop a transit corridor through southern Armenia, linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan. The White House says the corridor will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity. \n\nTrump has positioned the US as the guarantor of security in the South Caucasus, packaging this as a commercial opportunity for American companies. This exemplifies what researchers call transactional foreign policy, a strategy that offers rewards or threatens costs to get others to act rather than persuading them through shared values.\n\nUS presidents have long mixed economic incentives with diplomacy. But Trump’s approach represents something very different. It’s a foreign policy that operates outside institutional constraints and targets democratic allies. It exploits American power for personal gain in ways no previous president has attempted.\n\nUS presidents have commonly used transactional approaches in their foreign policy. In the early 20th century, Theodore Roosevelt promised to protect Latin American governments from internal rebels and external European intervention to ensure debt payments to American bankers. \n\nThis sometimes required the US military to take control of customhouses, as happened in Dominican Republic in 1905 and Cuba in 1906. Presidents Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge ordered similar military interventions in Nicaragua in 1911, Honduras in 1911 and 1912, Haiti in 1915 and Panama in 1926. \n\nIn the mid-20th century, presidents Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy innovated foreign aid policy in an attempt to dampen the appeal of communism. They did so specifically through land reform policies. \n\nAmerican officials viewed rural poverty in developing countries as fertile ground for communist recruitment during the cold war. So US aid was used to promote food price stabilisation and facilitate land distribution. \n\nAround the same time, Dwight Eisenhower applied financial pressure on the UK during the 1956 Suez crisis. Britain and France, coordinating with Israel, invaded Egypt to retake the critical Suez Canal waterway after it was nationalised. The US blocked British access to financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to force the withdrawal of its troops.\n\nMore recently, Barack Obama’s 2015 Iran nuclear deal bundled sanctions relief with nuclear limits. And Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, coupled export controls with subsidies and tax credits to pull allies into a shared tech-security posture. As a result, Japan and the Netherlands limited the sale of semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nThe Armenia-Azerbaijan peace negotiations also began under the Biden administration. It is not hard to imagine that a similar deal, without the Trump branding, would have occurred under a Kamala Harris presidency.\n\nTrump’s undemocratic approach\n\nWhile a transactional approach isn’t unique in American foreign policy, Trump’s strategy marks a shift. Particularly in his second term, it resembles that of a typical authoritarian leader. Trump is carrying out his approach with minimal congressional or judicial constraint, with policies shaped by personal whims rather than institutional consistency.\n\nThis manifests in four key ways. First, Trump operates outside international and domestic legal frameworks. His tariff policies, for example, probably violate international and US domestic laws. \n\nSecond, Trump systematically targets democratic allies while embracing authoritarian partners. The US has had strained relationships with its allies before. But there has never been this level of animosity towards them. Trump has threatened to annexe Canada, while praising authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Viktor Orbán and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nThird, Trump prioritises domestic political enemies over traditional foreign adversaries. He has gutted institutions that he views as politically hostile like the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) and the State Department. He has even deployed federal forces in US cities under dubious legal reasoning.\n\nAnd fourth, Trump exploits American foreign policy for personal gain in ways no previous US president has attempted. He receives more gifts from foreign governments, including a US$400 million (£295 million) Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar. The jet was expected to serve as Air Force One during his presidency, but was transferred to Trump’s presidential library foundation. \n\nTrump’s own company, the Trump Organization, has also signed deals to build luxury towers in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. And Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner secured US$2 billion from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund just six months after leaving the White House. Kushner has denied the investment represented a conflict of interest.\n\nAuthoritarian approaches lead to authoritarian outcomes. Research consistently shows that authoritarian systems produce weaker alliances, underinvestment in public goods and non-credible promises. \n\nThey also decrease state capacity as professional institutions are hollowed out in favour of personal loyalty networks. Trump’s weakening of career diplomatic services and development agencies sacrifices institutional competence for direct presidential control. This undermines the very capabilities needed to implement international agreements effectively.\n\nTrump’s style further encourages flattery over mutual interests. The naming of the Armenian transit corridor mirrors earlier examples: Poland’s 2018 proposal for a US military base named “Fort Trump”, foreign nominations for a Nobel peace prize and overt flattery at diplomatic meetings. These are all designed to sway a leader with personal praise rather than emphasising American interests.\n\nPrevious US presidents usually embedded transactional bargains within larger institutional projects such as Nato, the IMF, non-proliferation regimes or the liberal trade system. While those arrangements disproportionately benefited the US, they also produced global gains. \n\nTrump’s deals may yield benefit. The Armenia-Azerbaijan peace agreement, for instance, could reduce the risk of conflict and unlock trade in the South Caucasus. But his approach represents a fundamentally different kind of American leadership – one that is undemocratic.","summary":"US presidents have long mixed economic incentives with diplomacy, but Trump’s approach represents something very different.","url":"https://theconversation.com/us-presidents-have-always-used-transactional-foreign-policy-but-trump-does-it-differently-262920","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685282/original/file-20250813-66-lxltc3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C4000%2C2000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 16:05:01","author":"Patrick E.

PBS PRESIDENT DECLARES SHE 'CAN’T MAKE ANY SENSE' OF ACCUSATIONS OF LEFT-WING BIAS \"Just like its investigations into ABC News’ slanted 2024 debate moderation and CBS News’ hidden 60 Minutes interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the FCC should investigate whether Arizona PBS violated its duty to act in the public interest when it engaged in viewpoint discrimination against a candidate for governor,\" he said. In 2022, during the Arizona gubernatorial race between Democrat Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake, Hobbs declined an invitation to debate Lake. Hobbs and Lake did participate in a town hall-style event where each candidate was questioned separately during a forum hosted by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, but Hobbs subsequently refused to debate her opponent. She cited concerns that a debate with Lake would become similar to the Republican primary debate, and would support erroneous claims that the 2020 election was rigged. Lake, a former TV news anchor, had also expressed fears that Democrats would cheat in the 2022 election. The Arizona PBS station gave Hobbs what Petersen called \"an unprecedented 30-minute interview\" but Lake’s solo interview with the outlet, set for Oct. 12, 2022, was canceled hours before it was set to begin. PBS STATION SINGLES OUT GOP SENATORS IN CONTENTIOUS PUBLIC BROADCASTING FUNDING BATTLE AZ Central reported that \"The Arizona Citizens Clean Election Commission backed out of the event that was to be hosted in partnership with Arizona PBS (KAET) after the television station agreed to a separate, similar interview with Democrat Katie Hobbs.\" Petersen alleged that the day after Arizona State University’s president \"questioned the long-standing tradition that would have provided Kari Lake with a solo interview because of her positions on election integrity, university officials internally predicted that Hobbs would win the election.\" The letter quotes emails between Arizona State’s Media Enterprise head, Mi-Ai Parrish, who said, \"Katie is getting roasted hard, but I don’t think it will matter,\" and a response from the university president’s chief of staff, which said, \"I don’t think it matters either.\" In his letter, Petersen said that it took Arizona State University \"more than two years—743 days—to produce the internal emails exposing these partisan conversations.\" \"Based on the emails between top university officials, Arizona PBS made broadcast decisions based on how it viewed Kari Lake’s positions on election integrity and Katie Hobbs’ electoral prospects,\" Petersen wrote. \"Arizona PBS did not act in the public interest because it exhibited ‘broadcaster favoritism’ for Hobbs and acted ‘in a partisan, discriminatory fashion’ that was ‘designed to serve the political advantage of a candidate,’\" he added. The Arizona state senate president is asking the FCC to investigate KAET for \"PBS’ blatant viewpoint discrimination against Kari Lake and partisan calculations designed to benefit Katie Hobbs,\" and the revocation of their license. ARIZONA ICED TEA'S 99-CENT PRICE MAY FINALLY END AFTER 30 YEARS — TARIFFS COULD BE TO BLAME Fox News Digital reached out to the Arizona PBS station and Arizona State University for comment. Arizona State University directed Fox News Digital to this webpage addressing Arizona PBS, which said, in part, \"As one method of delivering information on candidates, Arizona PBS had an arrangement with Arizona Clean Elections Commission to host and broadcast debates among candidates for state offices. While the Clean Elections Commission was the producer of the debate, Arizona PBS continued to maintain its responsibilities under its license and to its viewers by providing coverage of the elections separate from and in addition to the debates. Debates are not the sole mechanism for informing the public about elections.\" It added that, \"In 2022, one of the planned debates was for the office of Governor of Arizona between Republican nominee Kari Lake and Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs. When Hobbs decided not to debate Lake, the Clean Election Commission’s plan to proceed with a one-party debate conflicted with Arizona PBS’s licensing requirements. Arizona PBS was prepared to move ahead with a different format with the Clean Elections Commission to allow each candidate to speak and be interviewed about their candidacy on Arizona PBS. Hobbs chose to accept the interview invitation.

But now, it's showmanship all the way down: She appears to be trying to publicly position herself as a #Resistance figure while also accepting federal help.\n\n\"But DC's crime is falling!\" is a terrible response to Trump's takeover. DC's homicide rate was five times New York's last year, and we're optimistic that this year, it will fall to merely 3x. As a matter of political strategy and moral correctness, it is better to acknowledge…\n— Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) August 12, 2025\n\nTo some degree, Bowser and Leavitt—as well as the president himself—are conflating crime and quality-of-life issues. Is the intention, with the deployment of federal force, to get the specific carjacking crime wave under control? Or is it to curb crime more broadly? Or is it to clean up homeless encampments and make the city less dirty?\n\nIt all reminds me of the cleanup of San Francisco in advance of Xi Jinping coming to town. Prior to hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in 2023 (and a meeting between then–President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping), state and city leaders took it upon themselves to clear homeless encampments, power-wash the sidewalks, and ramp-up law enforcement, leading many San Francisco residents to wonder why Xi deserves such special treatment but they must be subjected to living in perpetual dereliction. It was all for show, but it also made the issue politically salient for a moment and proved to San Franciscans that a cleaner, better-functioning city was possible. Of course, the effects didn't really last—dealing with homelessness long-term is a lot harder than moving the homeless people temporarily out of sight—but it's possible it had a lasting political effect.\n\nBut the situation in D.C. is, in many ways, different: The real issue here is whether this is an appropriate use of executive power, and whether it will be an effective means of getting the problems under control. But it's an interesting moment because it's forcing Democratic politicians to decide whether they're going to become crime denialists or not and how exactly they want to position themselves going forward.\n\nScenes from New York: This is kind of a funny read (from May) because—despite being a young person in New York—I don't really know many of these names dropped who are allegedly part of the \"it\" crowd that endorsed Zohran Mamdani. Ella Emhoff (Kamala Harris' stepdaughter)? That's the best you can do? If this is the youthmentum, I'm not buying that it's very strong (especially without the Dimes Square set, which is more inclined to talk Curtis Yarvin than Frantz Fanon).\n\nRelatedly: I don't have an issue with these people's ages, but I do have an issue with them coming from the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nMamdani's policies were written by 28/34 yo DSAs. Few in his inner circle ever worked in government. And the person he charged to hire his city hall team is a California native. \nThis is who we're getting to run the top financial capital in the world and the largest school… pic.twitter.com/q3yC0fsXUj\n— Yiatin Chu (@ycinnewyork) August 12, 2025\n\n\"Mexico sent 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States Tuesday in the latest major deal with the Trump administration as American authorities ratchet up pressure on criminal networks smuggling drugs across the border,\" reports the Associated Press.\nReally good Just Asking Questions episode (if I may say so myself) with Rob Henderson, the guy who popularized the phrase luxury beliefs:\n\n\"China Evergrande Group's delisting marks a bleak milestone for the nation's property sector, now in a fourth year of paralysis that continues to weigh down the world's second-largest economy,\" reports Bloomberg. \"The company, once China's biggest developer by sales, will be removed from the Hong Kong stock exchange on Aug. 25, a year and a half after the shares were suspended and almost 16 years after the Guangzhou-based firm was listed.\"\n\"The White House plans to conduct a far-reaching review of Smithsonian museum exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of America's 250th anniversary,\" reports The Wall Street Journal.

Nestled in the middle of the stunningly beautiful Cotswolds countryside , Daylesford Organic sells hampers for £690. The manicured shelves feature £36 honey, £10 chocolate and cashew butter sourdough cookies, £175 tablecloths, £40 mushroom coffee and a £23 \"immunity formula\". Outside, a beautiful garden centre displays £1,600 garden dining furniture and £1,000 trees. Walking around it in the sunshine was one of the highlights of my summer. The whole place is gorgeous — and the customers (and their dogs ) are as meticulous and beautifully presented as the shop. I came away with a bag full of Isle of Wight tomatoes (the best I've ever tasted) and a lavender bush which cost £20. Daylesford Organic has made headlines for its prices in the past . But it's back in the news this week because the US vice president, JD Vance, called in. Donald Trump's second-in-command is in the Cotswolds for a holiday with his family and footage shows his huge entourage of security and police at the farm shop and in the surrounding lanes on Monday. He reportedly spent hours there. But on my visit, the first thing that struck me wasn't the food or the prices. It was the cars in the car park. I immediately spotted two Ferraris, several Porsches and too many Range Rovers to count. Right outside the front door was a white Ferrari with a number plate reading \"cash\". I parked my car in a distant corner of the car park and then did my best not to look too gobsmacked as I walked around. But this level of ostentatious wealth isn't surprising when you consider the area. The farm shop is around halfway between Chipping Norton and Stow-on-the-Wold in the Cotswolds, every inch of which belongs on a postcard . People who call this area home include the Beckhams, David and Samantha Cameron, Mike and Zara Tindall, Princess Anne, Kate Moss, Ellen DeGeneres, Simon Cowell, Richard E Grant and many, many more. Jeremy Clarkson has made it even more famous with his huge Amazon Prime Video hit Clarkson's Farm, on which you'll see sweeping drone-shot views of the sunlit countryside and farmland. I've been to his (very different) farm shop too, which you can read about here , as well as his sensational pub, which you can read about here . Its towns and villages, like Bourton-on-the-Water ( read about it here ), Bibury ( known as Britain's most beautiful village ), Burford, Broadway and Stow-on-the-Wold are among the most beautiful you'll find anywhere. And the farm shop itself was founded in 2002 by Lady Carole Bamford, whose husband is JCB founder Lord Anthony Bamford. The couple are said to have a joint fortune of £9.45bn, making them comfortably one of the very wealthiest people in the UK. Earlier this summer, Lady Bamford was pictured alongside King Charles and Queen Camilla at Ascot Racecourse. The Bamfords own several prize-winning horses, including one bought for £1.4 million. Walking around the shop and its outdoor garden centre, I enjoyed trying to figure out if I recognised some of the more glamorous customers (I didn't). But visitors this week would have had no trouble figuring out who the most famous customer was, given the convoy of black SUVs he arrived with. Locals in the Cotswolds have likened the security lockdown around Vance's holiday to the Men in Black as roads, footpaths and village lanes were blocked. One said: \"Stopped off at a farm shop...so did JD Vance. Security everywhere.\" Another said: \"There were a few American SUVs and then loads of Mercedes . And a full police riot van and about three police motorbikes. \"Because of this, there are loads of police everywhere at the moment - normally, you'd never see a police car around here.\" One local said: \"You do seem to get a few political celebrities round here - Kamala Harris has been, David Cameron lives around here, and Boris Johnson often comes. I go to Daylesford Organic most days with my kids. It's not often you see a presidential motorcade here though!\" I'd go most days myself if I could and am certainly looking forward to my next visit. It would have been wonderful if Cotswolds farm shop rival Clarkson had decided to pop in at the same time to check out the competition. He has described Vance as \"a bearded God-botherer who pretty much thinks that women who've been raped should be forced to have the resultant child\". Clarkson, whose Diddly Squat Farm Shop is no more than a mile from the vice-president's fortress-like holiday mansion, also said: \"I've searched for the right word to describe him and I think it's 't**t'.\" Oh well, I still hope Vance, who has also said the UK is a \"truly Islamist\" country, enjoyed his visit as much as I did. At least he could probably afford to buy a bit more than I could.","summary":"The farm shop is in the news again this week because US vice president JD Vance arrived with a huge entourage of security and police — I visited earlier this summer and one thing was glaring long before I got inside","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/went-uks-poshest-farm-shop-35724482","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35724480.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Steffan-Rhys-in-the-garden-centre-at-Daylesford-Organic-Farm-Shop.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 13:20:51","author":"Steffan Rhys","authors":["Steffan Rhys"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.31},{"id":350735716,"title":"Adam Scott's 2 Kids: All About the “Severance” Star's Son Graham and Daughter Frankie","text":"Adam Scott is an award-winning actor thanks to his roles in Severance and Parks and Recreation, but his crowning achievement is being the dad of two children, son Graham and daughter Frankie.\n\n The actor shares his kids with his wife, Naomi Scott, whom he married in 2005. The couple welcomed their first child, son Graham, around one year after their wedding. They completed the family when daughter Frankie was born around 2008.\n\n Adam leans heavily on his wife when it comes to balancing his family and career. \"I couldn't do it without Naomi,\" he told SheKnows in January 2019. \"We have a great partnership at home and professionally, so it makes the family juggling act that much easier when we can all be together.\" Sometimes that means Naomi “[holds] down the fort for months” while Adam “attempts to parent by Zoom,” he said.\n\n When he is working, Adam is always thinking of his family. In March 2025, he told Jimmy Kimmel that he “goes into a closet” to take calls with the Severance producers so he won’t spoil the hit show for his kids. His young costar Sarah Bock also revealed to PEOPLE that he was “such a dad” on set, and would steal moments to play games virtually with Frankie.\n\n As Graham and Frankie have gotten older, they’ve also started making more red carpet appearances alongside their famous dad. In November 2016, they made their first appearance as a family of four when Adam brought the kids onstage to present at the Glamour Women Of The Year event. More recently, Graham and Frankie joined Adam and Naomi at a PaleyFest Screening for the Severance season 2 finale in March 2025.\n\n Here’s everything to know about Adam Scott’s kids, Graham and Frankie.\n\n Graham Scott, 18 \n\n Adam and Naomi welcomed their first child, son Graham, on Oct. 7, 2006. Though they’ve kept his early years very private, he did grow up in Los Angeles, and Naomi shared that she and Adam were inspired to start their own company when Graham was a baby.\n\n \"I had taken a bit of time off when we had our first child, and I was heading back to work when I realized that the hours I was going to be working on someone else's show were going to be so great that I was going to not see not only my child but also my husband. So we hatched a plan one night,\" she told SAG Indie in August 2017.\n\n \"We took the chance and started a company and really came up with our first series idea, which we did for Adult Swim, called The Greatest Event in Television History,” she explained. The company, Gettin’ Rad Productions, has produced films and series including Fun Mom Dinner, Other People and Ghosted, which aired on FOX in 2017.\n\n The parents have also talked about Graham's big personality. In February 2017, Adam shared a hilarious story on Jimmy Kimmel Live! of the then 10-year-old “stealing” mints from the late-night host’s bathroom during a party.\n\n “[He] takes me aside and he’s like ‘Dad, check this out’ and he pulled out a tin of Altoids that he put into his jacket pocket,” Adam recalled. “I was like, oh man, now I have to do the parent thing where you pretend that this is a big deal and say, ‘I hope Jimmy doesn’t call the cops.’ ”\n\n Adam explained that he made Graham write Kimmel an apology letter, which hilariously ended with the line “with plentiful amount of sorriness, Graham Scott.”\n\n Now a teenager, Adam and Graham seem to bond most over their love of comedy. In February 2019, Adam shared a photo of Graham wearing a mannequin head in a craft store and captioned the silly image, “One of my prouder moments as a father not kidding at all.” He also gets a kick out of making his son laugh, as evidenced by a December 2020 gift tag he shared that was addressed to Graham from “Diarrhea J. Penisface.”\n\n “I’m so lucky to be this guy’s dad on his 13th birthday,” Adam wrote in a heartfelt October 2019 birthday post for Graham. “He’s hilarious, kind, and so goddamn sharp. Every day I try to be more like him.”\n\n While Graham seems to mostly stay off social media, he has made cameos on his sister’s TikTok account.\n\n Francesca “Frankie” Scott, 16 \n\n Adam and Naomi completed their family with the birth of their daughter Frankie around 2008.\n\n He shared a rare glimpse at her interests in August 2018 when he posted three photos of a young Frankie grinning and pointing at different license plates with the caption, “I hope my daughter’s current fascination with out-of-state license plates never, ever stops.”\n\n He also posted a sweet photo hugging his little girl in September 2019, writing, “Turns out yesterday was ‘Daughter’s Day’? How could I have been doing anything other than this.”\n\n Now that she’s older, Frankie loves clowning on her famous dad. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2023, Adam revealed that Frankie often collects unflattering screenshots during their FaceTime calls. “Every single time I see that flash on the screen, it's just like, Jesus, really?” he said. “This past year, they made a calendar of all of those photos.\"\n\n Frankie also has no problem teasing her dad for his choice of facial hair. \"I like having a mustache, and my daughter and my wife hate it,” he told PEOPLE in May 2024. “Whenever I do have one, they immediately are just like, 'No, no, turn around, go back and get rid of it right now.' [My son] might say I look stupid, but other than that, he's fine.\"\n\n Despite the constant jokes, Frankie is one of Adam’s favorite red carpet dates. In June 2023, she accompanied her dad to the L.A. premiere of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and in September 2024, she was his date for the launch event for Agatha All Along.\n\n Frankie has been dipping her toe into the spotlight lately, too, by making TikTok videos, and she often invites her dad to make a cameo. He’s been seen spoofing the Kardashians, trying out the handsome face filter and enjoying dinner with the fam in Frankie’s funny videos.\n\n It’s clear that no matter how much she grows up, Adam loves spending time with his daughter. In October 2022, he brought her and her “buddies” to Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights for a “fun, genuinely scary” time, and in 2024, he shared a post stating that he planned to vote for Kamala Harris for president in Frankie’s honor.\n\n “I am proud to be my daughter’s dad, and am committed to fighting for the rights of girls and women everywhere,” he said. Frankie responded to the post, writing, “I love you dad❤️❤️proud of you.”","summary":"Adam Scott shares two kids with his wife, Naomi Scott","url":"https://people.com/all-about-adam-scott-kids-11789287","image":"https://people.com/thmb/GuvJoPjS58lwbTt8_DnzPwZqRvQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(976x329:978x331)/adam-scott-kids-graham-scott-frankie-scott-wife-naomi-scott-main-081225-d6def0909b86400aac9bf65cd9517187.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 13:00:00","author":"Emy Lacroix","authors":["Emy Lacroix"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.202},{"id":350735958,"title":"Hollywood Writers Wage War on Trump","text":"The entertainment press found it very important to report that Hollywood thinks President Donald Trump is an authoritarian. This is still somehow considered “news.” Over 2,300 members of the Writers Guild felt compelled to speak out in an open letter because they believe in their “role in a healthy democracy.”\n\nIn 2024, democracy was healthy and Hollywood’s candidate lost. “Writers Guild of America West PAC [political action committee] Endorses Kamala Harris for President,” they announced. So sad. They can’t get over it.\n\nWhen the Left’s feverishly spinning propaganda machines don’t work, “now, we face an unprecedented, authoritarian assault.” The Democrats are about as popular right now as measles, so democracy is somehow endangered.\n\n“We are members of the Writers Guild of America who speak with one voice to decry the dangerous and escalating attacks on the First Amendment, independent media, and the free press,” the letter read in part. “He has retaliated against publications reporting factually on the White House and threatened broadcasters’ licenses. He regularly calls for the cancellation of news and entertainment television shows that criticize him in late-night and, most recently, ‘The View.’”\n\nThey complained, “We don’t have a king, we have a president. And the president doesn’t get to pick what’s on television, in movie theaters, on stage, on our bookshelves, or in the news.”\n\nOf course not. The kings and queens of Hollywood insist they get to pick what people see, and the “healthy democracy” librarians get to dictate what’s on the public bookshelves. The leftists think “democracy” is healthiest when they are in charge of all “mainstream” messaging.\n\nWhen it comes to Trump, Hollywood rushed to make hostile movies—for the Cineplex and for TV—asserting the rudest things, like Trump raped his first wife (“The Apprentice” movie). Nobody made a Hunter Biden movie, despite all the wild crack-and-hookers narratives, not to mention Hunter sleeping with his brother’s widow and getting her on drugs.\n\nThe fundamental fallacy of these “attacks on the First Amendment” arguments is that the First Amendment includes the freedom to attack the “free press”—like asserting liberals lie when they call themselves the “independent media.” They’re partisan operatives.\n\nTrump suing news organizations and spurring settlements isn’t authoritarian. This is where you undermine the silly claim of these scriptwriters that leftist “news” outlets are being attacked for “reporting factually.” They don’t lead with facts. They lead with their angry opinions and often unproven accusations.\n\nNews outlets are sometimes sued because they say things that are untrue, like George Stephanopoulos claiming Trump was found “liable for rape” in the utterly unsubstantiated E. Jean Carroll case. Trump sued “60 Minutes” for deceptive editing, which they clearly do on a regular basis. But calling them out for that? You hate the First Amendment, they say.\n\nAnother fallacy is that the Left is a beacon for free expression. They’ve made it quite plain that they can’t stand an opposing view. It must be categorized as “misinformation” and shut down. For example, say something “anti-transgender” and you’re banned.\n\nSpike Lee & Co. never issued angry statements about anti-woke comedy routines getting banned on Instagram—because they’re at the center of wokeness. The Writers Guild West issued statements lashing out against the “racist” murder of George Floyd and “institutional white supremacy” as well as the need for more sensitive script treatments of blacks and “Indigenous people.”\n\nHollywood writ large is an airless, double-reinforced leftist bubble. It can’t engage with the outside world that sees them as hopelessly snobby and patronizing scolds. They dash off an “open letter” and they aren’t open to rebuke. That would be too much free speech.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Rory theorized that the song could sample Jay-Z's track, postulating that the New York rapper might have cleared the sample to allegedly get back at Nicki Minaj.\"I do have a very deeper 'Barb' theory with Imaginary Players...this is a full theory...I think Cardi had an Imaginary Players beat that was a flip of the Jay-Z record, and she wanted to use it, and Hov said no, and then Nicki went on her f**king insane Des-Hov (feud),\" Rory said.He continued:\"And then I think Hov probably went, 'Cardi, you want the sample? I got you.' I fully think that Hov cleared the Imaginary Players sample based of everything that Nicki has been doing.\"For the uninitiated, Nicki Minaj has had feuds with both Jay-Z and Cardi B. Her dispute with Cardi B resulted in a supposed altercation between the two rappers at a New York fashion week party in 2018, after Cardi seemingly threw her shoe at Minaj and was stopped by the latter's security. According to The Guardian, Cardi was photographed leaving the party with a bump on her forehead.Meanwhile, Nicki Minaj's current online feud with Jay-Z has occupied social media for the past few weeks, with the former taking shots at Roc Nation (the rapper's company) and its CEO, Desiree Perez.Exploring Nicki Minaj's online feud with Jay-ZIn July 2025, Nicki Minaj attacked Jay-Z, Roc Nation, and Desiree Perez in a series of X posts. According to US Weekly, Minaj's feud with Jay-Z seemingly stemmed from her 3% equity share in Tidal (a streaming service that Jay-Z founded in 2015 and sold in 2021).In September 2024, Minaj had alleged that she did not receive her full 3% share after the sale, claiming that she was offered only $1 million, which she allegedly refused to take. In her X post on July 8, 2025, Minaj claimed that she was supposed to receive $100 to 200 million after the sale, adding that Jay-Z had to settle his \"karmic debt\" with her.“We’ve calculated about 100-200MM so far. #JayZ call me to settle this karmic debt. It’s only collecting more interest. You still in my TOP 5 tho,” Nicki Minaj wrote.In a follow-up post, Nicki Minaj added that she would use the money to pay her fans' student loans and education fees via her #StudentOfTheGame charity.Nicki Minaj @NICKIMINAJLINKI’m going to use some of the money #JayZ owes me to send some of my Barbz to college, pay their school fees & student loans via my #StudentOfTheGame charity.According to RapTV, she also accused Jay-Z and Desiree Perez (Roc Nation's CEO) of \"ruining\" hip-hop and football. The \"ruining\" football comment could likely be a reference to the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show, as Minaj had previously criticized the NFL, Roc Nation, and Jay-Z for choosing Kendrick Lamar instead of Lil Wayne as the headliner.In another post, Nicki Minaj accused Jay-Z and Desiree Perez of not endorsing Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election because Perez had received a presidential pardon from Donald Trump in 2021.Jay-Z has not responded to any of Nicki Minaj's claims at the time of writing this article.","summary":"Podcasters Rory Farrell and Jamil “Mal” Clay discussed Cardi B's upcoming single, Imaginary Players, and its connection to Nicki Minaj and Jay-Z during a recent episode of the New Rory and Mal show.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/music/news-rory-mal-think-jay-z-cleared-sample-cardi-b-s-song-imaginary-players-subtle-jab-nicki-minaj","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/08/78e42-17550729167042-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 12:02:20","author":"Juhi Marzia","authors":["Juhi Marzia"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":350728216,"title":"Hasan Piker Thinks America Might Be Cooked","text":"Here’s how Hasan Piker starts each day: working out, shooting the shit. It’s Monday at 8:30 a.m., and we’re in the backyard of a house in West Hollywood, where there’s a makeshift private gym with benches, pull-down machines, and dumbbells galore. This is where the 34-year-old political influencer keeps his thirsted-after body fit, joined by a few other neighborhood characters, including a guy who works on Pod Save America. His Bernese beefcake Kaya tussles with a few other golden-brown dogs. As Piker burns through his 70-minute workout, exhausting himself in the process, he strips his shirt off. An army of girls and gays—not to mention admiring looksmaxxers—would kill to be where I am now, next to Piker, as he pants in a pair of neon shorts with black Calvin Klein boxers poking out and sunlight glinting off the sweat beaded on his chest hairs.\nPiker’s trainers fib to me about how much he’s bench-pressing (300 pounds?) before the real number comes out: 175. (His personal best is 285.) The conversation among the seven men and women grows increasingly unhinged, jokes about semen-retention exercises morphing into a discussion about which Hollywood plastic surgeon is least likely to kill you. “The new meta is ballerina cups—women only going for A to B to C cup, max,” Piker muses at one point (“meta” is a gamer-derived term for “state of the art”). “Nick Fuentes is gay,” he says at another, echoing a common attack on the far-right streamer. (“He definitely likes catboy porn,” he adds, referring to an infamous incident on one of Fuentes’s streams, which we will not detail here.) Groans, gossip, and athletic guidance fly from all angles: “Good, Has, get taller!” “Face down, ass up!” Toward the end, Piker starts describing how a chicken wrap he’s been loving recently is very fibrous and “bottom-friendly,” leading another gymgoer to tease him about his diet. “Have I been having anal sex? No,” Piker responds. “I’ve always had nice poops.”\nPiker has no filter. That’s one reason he’s the hottest left-wing political commentator online. His “management team” consists of a single guy named David, so he basically has no leash and answers to no one. Every day, tens of thousands of people watch him dissect the news for seven hours on Twitch. A typical stream involves him scrolling frenetically while clicking on links sent by fans in his chat, reacting to the latest viral clips and headlines, dishing with his viewers, and viciously sparring with haters. “America deserved 9/11” is one of his most infamous wisecracks; when Rush Limbaugh died, Piker played a clip of a dancing crab in celebration and vigorously bounced around his room. Piker’s one of a new breed of streamers, like Adin Ross and Sneako, who are shaping the worldview of kids who never watch MSNBC or read The New York Times. In this online mirror world, Piker is the “himbo gateway drug” introducing a legion of kids to progressive ideals like Medicare for All.\nAnd then there’s Gaza. Young people across America are calling out what they see as Democratic politicians’ complicity in a US-backed war that is more and more widely being called a genocide, as Palestinians starve. (Republican support of the war has been taken as a given, although MAGA congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has broken rank.) Piker has opposed Israel’s offensive since the start. It’s the online arena where the most progressive but also most-right-wing ideologies are taking hold now. In this unshackled world animated by constant beefs, Hasan is hated by both the right and center. He’s a demigod and a demon, a crusader for good and a parasite on society, an empathetic hero and a so-called terrorist sympathizer. He claims the FBI might be surveilling him. Haters say they want him dead. As political experts sound alarms about authoritarianism, he’s fighting back, one expletive and brain rot–filled livestream at a time.\n\nAfter the gym sessions, Piker, Kaya, and I load back into his black Mercedes-Benz and drive to his place, a large townhouse with a Suzuki motorcycle in the front and a slender pool in the backyard. Piker dips for a second to freshen up, leaving me to explore the house. Fan art litters the walls, and TVs, hats (TRUMP PENCE 2020; JESUS IS MY BOSS; KOREA VETERAN), and Zyn containers are scattered around. A set of shelves contains a slew of books including Noam Chomsky’s Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order, Tony Tulathimutte’s incel epic Rejection, and numerous volumes of Marvel, Naruto, and Death Note manga and comics. He isn’t beating the socialist-who-owns-commodities allegations, but his house feels more like the product of a nerd who would write “Anime, Swords, and Free Public Transportation” in his Hinge bio than it does someone obsessed with luxury excess.\nPiker suggests we chill in his studio, which is even more chaotically cluttered than the rest of the house: There’s a shelf stacked with rare World of Warcraft collectibles, a basketball, and a vinyl record of rapper OsamaSon’s Jump Out. One corner contains a colossal Labubu doll encased in plastic; behind it, there’s a cutout of Bernie Sanders’s classic diva pose at the inauguration and a poster of Barack Obama with Queen Elizabeth II. Cameras and mics flank an intricate recording setup that could pass for the bank of security devices at a Westfield mall. Piker, who’s put on a black merch T-shirt for the streamer Vakyrae, sits across from me and slurps on an iced coffee.\nAs we talk, I sense that Piker wanted to hold the interview here so he could keep an eye on his screens. His stream doesn’t start for an hour, but the chat’s buzzing with fans impatiently waiting for him to log on. He’s remarkably energized for a guy who just finished a punishing workout and spent the previous day playing basketball with influencer Ludwig Ahgren and other friends. His team lost the first game but came in clutch later on. “I had to show these nerds what’s up,” he says with a laugh.\nBy the way, for anyone looking to get buff and clutch games like him, here’s Piker’s supplement stack:\n\n1 espresso shot (pre-workout)\nFour creatine pills\nFish oil (“I don’t eat seafood”)\n\nAshwagandha (“I don’t know if it works; I just take it”)\nMinoxidil and Finasteride (“I am technically on HRT [Hormone Replacement Therapy]. I have DHT blockers [for hair loss] that I’ve been taking for years now at this point.”)\n\nPiker grew up in Turkey, developing his leftist worldview against the backdrop of Prime Minister and eventual President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s regime. He moved to America, rushed a frat at Rutgers University to impress girls, and nepo baby’d himself into working for his uncle, Cenk Uygur, who owned the left-wing news network The Young Turks. Piker went full-time streaming in 2020, and has since become the most popular political creator on Twitch, with over 2.9 million followers. Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and numerous other celebs have hopped on his stream. His work ethic is terrifying; in 2020, he claims, he spent 42% of his time on camera—more than 10 hours a day. “I’m an addict,” he says. “I’ve been an addict my whole life, so everything I do, I get addicted: Twitch streaming, working out, eating healthy.”\nPiker describes his career as a protracted and so far largely unsuccessful effort to “pull the Democrats to be more radical, to be actually progressive.” While he’s beloved by many leftists, he’s often reviled by liberals—the centrists whose views are largely reflected by the party leadership. This became especially clear after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. “You have a guy like me, name is Hasan, and I’m saying, ‘No, you don’t understand, Israel is still very much the responsible party for October 7, for like 75 years of brutal occupation and apartheid.’ And people were like, ‘Oh, you’re a terrorist.’ And that really hasn’t gone away.”\nLast year, Democrats first invited him to and then ejected him from the Democratic National Convention after he interviewed some delegates who were part of the “Undecided” group protesting Israel’s war in Gaza. “I just eat it from both ends on that issue,” he says. “You’re getting [hate] from the far-right, and you’re getting it from the liberals and the centrists and the institutions. So you just have nothing. You only have your community. You only have your grassroots backing.”\nBut in recent weeks, with videos of starving Palestinian children flooding social media, more Democrats are speaking out about the war. Piker won’t give them credit for that just yet. “I’m used to Democrats operating in this incredibly cynical way,” he says. “So I’m not surprised by this about-face, if you can even call it that. Many people aren’t even doing an about-face. They’re mostly just ass-covering.”\nPiker is also quick to call out his peers in the manosphere, saying that social media has putrified into a hate-filled hellscape worse than the subculture that gave rise to GamerGate, the coordinated misogynistic attack on women in the video game world that was an ignition point for the modern reactionary right. This rage chamber is thronged by far-right figures like Andrew Tate, white supremacists like Fuentes, and outwardly apolitical podcasters and streamers, like NELK and Adin Ross, who fawningly interviewed Trump ahead of the election in 2024. “I call it ‘vice signaling’—these guys, whether they’re real villains or not, are presenting themselves as bad people, and people like it,” Piker says. “Nobody likes cancel culture, but goddamn, that shit was keeping motherfuckers in check.”\nOf course, Piker himself is an edgelord, too, eager to breach taboos—just on behalf of progressivism. For example, he proposes “Nuremberg”-style trials for those in the media who he sees as taking part in a “propaganda apparatus for the state.” He says he told the NELK boys “straight up” that they should be “tried.”\n“But,” Piker continues, “there are far more consequential, far more noteworthy, figures that deserve [to be put on trial] than, like, the fucking NELK boys.” Specifically, he says, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens. Piker may be the product of an often irony-poisoned online space, but his defense of the Palestinians is pure and deeply felt, as it is among large swaths of Gen Z. So he was incensed when Stephens recently wrote that “there is no genocide” being committed by Israel. “Literally three days after, like, a Jewish Israeli Holocaust scholar wrote a New York Times [editorial] saying it's definitely a genocide,” Piker says, “Bret Stephens came in hot and was like, No, actually, listen to me instead.” (On July 15, Dr. Omer Bartov, a professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University, wrote a Times opinion piece headlined “I’m a Genocide Scholar. I Know It When I See It”; a Stephens column, “No, Israel Is Not Committing Genocide in Gaza,” followed one week later.)\nPiker may see mainstream media as propaganda, but he blames prominent online figures for actively suppressing criticism. He says many creators keep silent to avoid retribution: “They’re fearful of the mass doxing and hate-raids they’ll incur from some of the top content creators in the space right now.”\nPiker is, for that reason, paranoid—and justifiably so. Sinking back into his chair, he says that years ago during a livestream, he was SWATTED (someone had anonymously sent a SWAT team to his house). He was “arrested, handcuffed, had a gun pulled on me, helicopters,” he recalls. “I heard something outside, and I was like, what the fuck’s going on? It’s dudes with AR-15s going, ‘Get the fuck out!’”\nPiker, it was widely reported, was also recently detained by border control when he returned to America from France. He says he was interrogated about his politics, especially as they relate to President Trump and Gaza. The incident led him to cancel a trip to Cuba, fearing that it could be used as an example of him visiting a “state sponsor of terror.” He’s certain he’s being surveilled by government entities. “I’ve had brushes with federal law enforcement, mostly around the death threats that I receive,” Piker says. “But in those conversations, they elaborate further that they’re very knowledgeable about who I am and what I do.” Is it the FBI? “I cannot confirm nor deny,” he demurs.\nWhile he’s unfiltered and earnest while streaming, Piker has managed to keep his off-stream activities secret, refusing to air out his private life with friends or paramours the way that many of his peers do. So when I first arrived at his home in the morning, I was surprised to find his mom, Ülker, an art scholar, just chilling in the living room. She complimented me on my shirt and asked what it referenced; when I told her “Drain Gang” (the experimental Swedish music collective), Piker went into hysterics.\nDuring our interview, I try to squeeze out whatever intel I can about Piker’s romantic life, which is feverishly gossiped about on Reddit. I ask point-blank if he’s dating Valkyrae, the massively popular gaming streamer, and he looks freaked out. “Oh come on, please don’t put that in the article,” Piker says. “I just want to keep certain things private. I don’t wanna even fuel speculations. Think of me as an asexual being.” He plans on settling down eventually, shielding his family from the noise generated by his fame as much as possible. “It’s definitely something that I want. I would just keep it private. I would keep my child, potentially if I were to have one, offline.”\nThe desire to safeguard his inner sanctum makes sense, given how many influencer overlords have Piker in their crosshairs. Maybe his most deranged “beef” this year was with Ethan Klein, the popular creator and former cohost of their old joint podcast, Leftovers. The feud started over Gaza—both call it a genocide, but Klein has called Piker a terrorist sympathizer and Piker, in turn, has called Klein racist. The spat spiraled into online mayhem, sucking everyone in these creators’ orbit into a vortex of toxicity. Klein “will call you a token Jew after this interview comes out,” Piker warns me. “I did pay you $7 million to do this interview.”\nSome have accused Klein of having a “psychosexual obsession” with Piker. “He talks about my body and the way I look a lot,” Piker says. “I don’t know why—maybe it’s low-hanging fruit for him. He was always a funny guy, he was never a big looker or anything. It wasn’t part of his brand. So I never thought he cared about that sort of thing, but maybe after he lost the weight, his personality changed a bit. I genuinely don’t know. Last time I talked to Ethan, he was fat. I mean he still had his issues…but at least he was seemingly more empathetic.”\nThe Klein fight reveals just how insular and incestuous the world of streaming is. These beefs and online personae are the substrate from which Piker, the streamer and person, springs. He texts with AOC sometimes, sure, but his close friends aren’t campaign strategists and professional politicians. They’re the creators he plays basketball with, like Ludwig, Buddha, and video game speedrunners like PointCrow; and the influencers who cohost his podcast: QTCinderella, Will Neff, and AustinShow. You could visualize the streaming world as a series of lunch tables or loose clusters of collaborators, like the AMP collective and the FaZe clan. This world of influencers is its own Hollywood, with a distinct cast of A-listers and cult faves. Piker recently attended creator Tarayummy’s birthday party at the Roosevelt Hotel, a weird collision between old- and new-school celebrity where FaZe Adapt and JasonTheWeen sidled up next to Miranda Sings and Love Island contestants. Indie sleaze documenter Cobrasnake shot the photos.\nIn LA, Piker likes to hang out with the Roomies, a gamer-lifestyle streamer house run by people like Valkyrae, Fueslie, and Tinakitten. When he’s in New York, he socializes with “professional media world friends” like Adam Friedland and the other cheeky stars of leftist pods Chapo Trap House and True Anon. Piker’s thoughts are so frenetic I can’t help but probe him on anyone and everything, like whacking a piñata to see what falls out. He denigrates Asmongold and Contrapoints; praises iShowSpeed and Joshua Citarella; says that the fact that I watch the surrealist YouTuber JREG means I’m fried. I test him on a scatter-spray of media heroes and villains.\nCurtis Yarvin and Peter Thiel: “Baby-brained, LARPing as educated people. Even William F. Buckley would make mincemeat of these guys.” On one of his three desktop computers, he pulls up a long-winded X thread in which Yarvin called billionaires a censored version of the N word. “He didn’t actually say the N word, which is kind of funny, cause I thought the point of wanting to kill cancel culture was so you could say the N word as a white guy…he tells rich people that they’re fucking gods and rich people love hearing that from a guy who’s maybe read one Nietzsche book or something.”\nRed Scare’s Dasha Nekrasova and Anna Khachiyan: “I don’t think about them at all. But, um, they’re annoying. And kind of dumb. I don’t think they like me too much. Because I’m progressive, and not a shithead.”\nZohran Mamdani: “Big Z’s the man, he’s great. He’s going to implement woke sharia in New York. Very excited about that. All the buildings have to face Mecca. That kind of good stuff.”\nDrain Gang: “I can’t believe you told my mom that.”\nOne of the main things people criticize Piker for—besides the whole Champagne socialist thing, which is overblown—is taking criticism poorly. Piker acknowledges this while also criticizing the criticisms of how he takes criticism. Still, he seems to realize he’s made mistakes in the past; he cites “ReactGate,” the backlash he faced for putting content on stream while stepping away from the camera for extended periods of time. “This is so crazy and so niche to talk about on fucking Gentleman’s Quarterly,” he says with a chuckle. “I did not respond well to that at all. I apologized immediately and said I would never watch [the critics’] videos again. But then people kept hammering it over and over again…after a while I was just like, alright, well, fuck these people.” Now he only watches YouTube videos from people he knows.\nAs obnoxious as his methods can be, Piker clearly has genuine convictions. Remember what the web was like back in the 2010s, when YouTube was overrun with mini Ben Shapiros and “WRECKING BLUE-HAIRED SWJS” compilations? Now there’s a cluster of progressive influencers who Piker proudly calls “HasanAbi heads”; he cosigns SeanDaBlack, Chris Kunzler, JAAM, and overzealots. He’s also trying to mentor new establishment Dem influencers like Dean Withers and Harry Sisson. “I told Dean personally: One, stop with this liberalism shit. Cut it out. Become more leftist. And two, try to do things that are not just debate-focused,” he says. “They’re not listening to me, so who knows?”\nSome would argue that if the Democrats were smart, they’d go all in on leftist populism and subsidize a Piker-led creator bootcamp to help beat back Trump 2.0. But Piker has no faith in liberal politicians; he thinks Kamala Harris, who currently leads in many polls about prospective Democratic presidential candidates, has no shot in 2028. He’s not even convinced there will be elections in 2028. “I mean, it’s moving in that direction pretty hard. All it takes is one big event for Donald Trump, who’s been salivating at this, to be like, It’s martial law time,” Piker says. “First they will take out or erode some of these Constitutional protections, whether it be due process, birthright, citizenship, and the First Amendment. Then they’ll rebuild the legal system to their advantage, in a way that suits their white nativist agenda.”\nAs he prepares to start up his stream for the day, Piker says, “I wonder what this is doing to my brain.” “This” is a gesture at the many vectors of anguish and evil in his life: the always-on work schedule, the paranoia he feels about his private life being overrun, the doxing and the SWATTING, the volume of vitriol he receives daily from right-wingers “demanding that the government arrest me ‘cause I’m a terrorist and that Twitch ban me.” I wonder to myself if his fitness and diet regimens are attempts to counterbalance the stress he puts on himself. He’s said in the past that he eats exactly “1.1 pounds of roasted chicken breast with low-carb pita, mezze, and sauces” for lunch every day. Still, he thinks the Make America Healthy Again movement is full of “fucking charlatans”: “Medicare for all, TRT for all, Ozempic for all, HRT for all. That’s my argument.”\nPiker can’t get lost in thought for long; our interview made him late to start streaming, and his viewers are antsy as fuck. Piker pops a Zyn and attempts to film an Instagram video to announce the stream. “Fuck!” he roars after the app shuts off midway. He shoots it again, then launches the stream, blitzing through the news. Sydney Sweeney white supremacy ad. Texas Democrats fleeing to avoid arrests. White women posting Nazi-salute selfies on X. A viewer sends him a link that turns out to be a Grindr audio clip. “I don’t know if I can show this, what is this,” Piker mumbles. You are fighting for the people in Gaza, who are starving for food, the audio clip begins. But you forgot about me. The need that I have for a cock in my mouth. Piker goes silent for 10 seconds. \"That'll be it for today. Some things are better left unwatched!\"\nSoon I get up to leave. I walk out, and Piker is left alone, rambling at three screens.","summary":"Martial law. Canceled elections. The combative leftist streamer Hasan Piker predicts an ominous possible future for the US.

Here’s why","text":"“And as I said, it would be a good idea to broaden the readership base of the Washington Post to bring in more conservatives,” he continued. “But the question is, how do you do that without losing your liberal readers?”\n\nSo, because of angry emails from the Left, the Washington Post and, by extension, Kessler tried to quell said anger with stories targeting the Right, appeasing the Left, and fact-checks that would keep the email inbox silent.\n\nDemocracy dies in darkness, indeed.\n\nAnd it’s not just limited to the Washington Post but to other fact-check organizations as well. Take Politifact. The site was launched 18 years ago by former Tampa Bay Times Washington Bureau Chief Bill Aidar. Politifact won a Pulitzer for its coverage of the 2008 election, although finding fact-checks of Democrats, particularly the winner, Barack Obama, is difficult, while there’s a treasure trove of checks of Republicans.\n\nA 2011 study by the University of Minnesota’s Smart Politics showed that Republicans were three times more likely to be fact-checked by Politifact than Democrats. It also assigned “Pants on Fire” ratings to 39% of Republican statements, while Democrats only received the same analysis just 12% of the time.\n\n“In total, 74 of the 98 statements by political figures judged ‘false’ or ‘pants on fire’ over the last 13 months were given to Republicans, or 76 percent, compared to just 22 statements for Democrats (22 percent),” it also reports.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the bias of omission was even more pronounced. Former President Joe Biden’s first press secretary, Jen Psaki, told some real whoppers during her time at the podium in the James S. Brady Briefing Room:\n\n– Republicans “are the ones who want to defund law enforcement.”\n\n– The border is “closed.”\n\n– The crisis at the border is Trump’s fault because he left a “dismantled system.”\n\n– Rising inflation is “transitory.”\n\n– Rising inflation is actually “[Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s price hike.”\n\n– The Afghanistan withdrawal “can’t be called “anything but a success.”\n\n– Biden takes questions “nearly every day from the press.”\n\nWe could go on, but there’s finite space here. So with all of the lies to choose from above, how many fact-checks did Pskai receive for any of them?\n\nAnd overall, how many did she receive during her two-plus years as White House press secretary?\n\nTwo. And this one was rated true, no questions asked:\n\n“You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you’re not vaccinated [for COVID-19] and 20 times more likely to die.”\n\nCompare this with President Donald Trump’s third White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, who received five times more fact-checks than Psaki. Of those 10, seven were rated false, including this one from a comment she made as a host of Outnumbered on Fox News. The conclusion defies logic:\n\nMcEnany: “Joe Biden’s wide-open southern border is to blame for fentanyl deaths in the U.S.”\n\nPolitifact: False!\n\nThe piece also goes on to say, “There have been 4.5 million encounters with migrants at the southern border between February 2021, Biden’s first full month in office, and December 2022. But McEnany is wrong to suggest that’s because the border has been ‘wide open’ since he took office.”\n\nHow again is she wrong in saying that?\n\nPsaki’s successor, Karine Jean-Pierre, got similar treatment under Biden. Snopes, another fact-checking organization, fact-checked her just five times despite telling as many whoppers as Psaki. Jean-Pierre, for example, pushed the “cheap fake” videos hoax that some reporters actually bought into regarding video and audio clearly showing Biden’s mental decline.\n\nOverall, Snopes sided with Jean-Pierre on four of the five “fact-checks” while ignoring statements at the time, such as when she said Biden didn’t lie after promising not to pardon his son Hunter Biden, which he did.\n\nWe also saw during the 2024 campaign that the broadcast networks are hopelessly biased when it comes to fact-checking. The prime example came during the presidential debate on ABC between Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, when Trump claimed that crime had skyrocketed under Biden and Harris.\n\n“As you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country,” moderator David Muir piously corrected Trump.\n\nBut, after the debate, of course, the FBI updated its report. After reporting a 2.1% decrease in violent crimes in 2022, the FBI amended the number to show there was actually a 4.5% increase.\n\n“According to crime and data expert John Lott, the new numbers reflect a net increase of 80,029 violent crimes in 2022 over 2021,” Fox News reported at the time. “He found that under the umbrella of violent crime, there were an additional 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes, 33,459 robberies and 37,091 aggravated assaults that year.”\n\nAnd when the FBI released the accurate stats after the fact, ABC and Muir didn’t acknowledge it or apologize.\n\nOverall, that night, Trump was fact-checked five times and was asked six follow-up questions. Harris? Zero fact-checks and zero follow-ups, despite claiming that:\n\n1) There were no U.S. military personnel in active war zones. At the time, the United States had 900 military personnel in Syria, with another 2,500 troops in Iraq.

Not even close.\n\nNo fact-check.\n\nFortunately, the tide is turning in the Trump 2.0 era. Kessler just took a buyout at the Washington Post, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced earlier this year that the social media giant will eliminate fact-checkers.\n\n“The fact checkers have just been too politically biased, and they’ve destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.,” Zuckerberg said in a video statement. “What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it’s gone too far.”\n\nZuckerberg has since moved to a community notes model, following in the footsteps of Elon Musk’s X. This can’t be seen as anything but positive after how each company conducted itself, pre-Musk, in the lead-up to the 2020 election, which included locking out accounts of anyone who shared the New York Post’s exclusive on the damning contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop, or claimed that COVID-19 may have come from a lab that literally studies coronaviruses in Wuhan.\n\nFact-checking was once a noble profession. It served as the last bastion of gatekeepers in a world where politicians and the media that cover them are at an all-time low in trust.\n\nThe problem was that the fact-checkers needed fact-checkers themselves. Perhaps it’s because of what Kessler described as an angry mob seeking confirmation bias. Or perhaps enough is finally enough.\n\nGood riddance.","summary":"It was a telling revelation from now-former Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler when he shared a conversation he once had with publisher Will Lewis, in which Lewis asked, &#8220;What should the Post do to appeal more to Fox News viewers?&#8221; &#8220;[I felt he] was crossing a bit of a business-newsroom line where he was asking [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3497672/fact-checker-era-cannot-end-soon-enough-heres-why/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP17053579428378-scaled-1024x693.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 12:00:00","author":"Joe Concha","authors":["Joe Concha"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.363},{"id":350739082,"title":"Left Protests Vance's English Holiday While VP Meets Leaders of the British Right","text":"Palestine-coloured keffiyeh-wearing activists protested against U.S. Vice President JD Vance having chosen England for his summer vacation, as the VP meets with British political leaders including Nigel Farage and Robert Jenrick.\n\n“Around 60” people from the ‘Stop Trump Coalition’, despite the name a catch-all leftist cause group, turned out in Charlbury in England’s rural Cotswolds on Tuesday to protest U.S. Vice President JD Vance who is holidaying nearby.\n\nAnger at President Donald Trump’s policy on Israel and Gaza dominates among the protesters in reports by the Agence France-Presse and Guardian. Another strain of concern was upset over Trump’s anti-mass migration policies, somewhat ironically given the preponderance of “go home” signs intended for Vance at the protest.\n\nOther signs included “Not Welcome”, “Sod Off”, “Cotswold childless cat ladies say go home”, “VD would be more welcome”, and “not too posh to protest”.\n\nDespite Vance having shared the meme himself on social media in the recent past, the protest was dominated with print-outs of the Vance-Baby format, presumably because organisers think the Vice President dislikes it. The Stop Trump Coalition even went to the expense of hiring a mobile video billboard for the meme.\n\nThe Guardian notes former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris visited the very same Cotswolds town just last month, stopping for a drink at its famous The Bull country inn. Harris was accompanied by a Secret Service detail and was not protested.\n\nThe Stop Trump Coalition, active at least since 2017, is a UK-based hard-left group that uses President Trump as a pretext to campaign on the popular left-wing causes of the day.\n\nIn 2017 its anti-Trump events including the ‘Trump Blimp’ balloon were cut with anti-Brexit activism, while by 2020 the Stop Trump Coalition was publishing a statue-toppling hitlist of historic artworks to be destroyed.\n\nThat campaign continues to this day, and the statue of Robert Clive which was named in the Stop Trump Coalition’s Topple The Racists dossier is now the focus of a campaign to see it destroyed.\n\nNow in 2025, talk of Palestine preoccupies the Stop Trump Coalition group, and red-green-black keffiyehs have become de rigueur.\n\nMeanwhile, VP Vance has been meeting a series of British political figures while holidaying in the Cotswolds. Having started over the weekend by being hosted by the British government at a state-owned historic mansion and having talks with the left-wing Labour government’s David Lammy, Vance then progressed to a privately rented manor and has been entertaining guests of his own choosing.\n\nVance met with the defacto leader of the UK’s Conservative Party Robert Jenrick on Tuesday. While the party now seriously struggles for relevance after years of promises of border control while actually implementing the opposite, leading to a collapse at the polls, it nevertheless enjoys the position of official opposition for now.\n\nJenrick has been active in the UK media in recent months highlighting issues including crime in London and that “mass migration is making young people poorer”.\n\nRemarkably, Vance is not meeting with the actual official leader of the Conservatives, Kemi Badenoch, who blamed conflicting diaries for passing up the opportunity.\n\nA JD Vance spokesman told Breitbart News that the Vice President plans to meet with Nigel Farage on Wednesday. Mr Farage has long shared a friendship with President Trump, having campaigned for him in the 2016 and 2024 Presidential elections and being the first non-U.S. political leader to personally meet with then-President Elect Trump after he won that vote.\n\nAlso calling by the Vance Cotswolds house was Thomas Skinner, businessman and cockney television personality who appeared on The Apprentice in 2019. and Celebrity MasterChef in 2020. Skinner has previously expressed his “love” for President Trump and has hinted at a potential run for the Mayor of London, next up for election in 2028.\n\nSkinner revealed of his trip to see Vance on Tuesday evening that they’d enjoyed a “cracking night” with a “smashing” barbeque and “a few beers”. He said he’d found Vance to be a “proper gent”.","summary":"Palestine-coloured keffiyeh-wearing activists protested against U.S. Vice President JD Vance having chosen England for his summer vacation.\n\n\nThe post Left Protests Vance&#8217;s English Holiday While VP Meets Leaders of the British Right appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/08/13/left-protests-vances-english-holiday-while-vp-meets-leaders-of-the-british-right/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/08/GettyImages-2229011879-e1755076733414-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 11:17:28","author":"Oliver JJ Lane","authors":["Oliver JJ Lane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.41},{"id":350716656,"title":"Chappell Roan explains why her second album will take a long time to arrive","text":"Chappell Roan has explained why her sophomore album has taken a while to get started, revealing that she still feels “unsettled” after being displaced by the wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year.\n\nSpeaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music Radio recently following the release of her lesbian heartbreak anthem “The Subway”, Roan revealed that she wants to start properly writing music again when she feels “settled”.\n\n“I want to write music whenever I feel settled. I haven’t felt settled. It’s been a very unsettling year and a half and I think once I really feel calm in a new house and have a routine, I just can’t wait to have a routine. And then I can think about writing a song once I have a routine,” she explained.\n\nThe 27-year-old’s meteoric rise to fame in 2024 saw her tour the globe and top the charts, but it also placed her at the centre of numerous online controversies. Most notably, Roan came under fire for calling out “creepy behaviour” from her fans and for refusing to endorse Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nIn January 2025, she was affected by the wildfires in Los Angeles, which destroyed almost 20,000 homes in Los Angeles county.\n\nShe told Lowe that she works best when in one place as part of a structured routine. \n\n“That’s just not a thing right now and it hasn’t been for a very long time. Because since I lived in Altadena and got displaced from the fires and have been living in Airbnbs for seven months, and I finally got a new place and I’ve only been there for 10 days.\n\n“And then I came on this big tour. So it’s been a journey on how do I release music within the state of everything?” she added.\n\nEarlier this month, Roan revealed to Vogue that her second album, the follow up to 2023’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, “doesn’t exist yet” and it may take “at least five years” to create.\n\n“I’m not that type of writer that can pump it out,” she said. “I don’t think I make good music whenever I force myself to do anything.”\n\nDespite a full-length project being a far off prospect right now, Roan is continuing to release music here and there. Most recently, she dropped ballad “The Subway”, about her fixation on an ex lover.\n\nThe song topped the UK charts – becoming her second number one after “Pink Pony Club” – and placed at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIt became the biggest song by a female artist of 2025 on the Spotify Global Chart, surpassing Sabrina Carpenter’s “Manchild” and her own song, the country-tinged sapphic bop, “The Giver”.\n\nSpeaking to Lowe about how “The Subway” fits in with what she has created so far for album number two, Roan said: “I think it’s a good ring on the ladder. Midwest Princess is her, but even though this next era, I don’t really know what it is, but ‘The Subway’ is a very safe segue to it.”\n\nShe continued: “I just think that ‘The Giver’, ‘Good Luck, Babe!’, ‘The Subway’, they’re all kind of so different, so that’s why I’m just like, ‘I have no idea what the next era is’. That’s the scary part of putting out new music and then people not liking it because it’s not like the music you made before, and so it makes you scared to release stuff.”\n\nChappell Roan is set to conduct a mini tour in America this autumn, with some proceeds being donated to support transgender charities in the country. Yet Roan confirmed that she will continue touring into 2026.\n\n“I’m far from done touring. We got some stuff February and March next year so we’re not done yet,” she revealed.\n\n“But I think that once this is done and the US shows are done, it’ll definitely feel like a big breath of weight off my shoulders just so I can chill for a sec and actually think about writing.”\n\n“The Subway” is streaming now.\n\nShare your thoughts!

The arbitration panel’s favorable ruling frees the company from potential liability in the case, extending a string of positive developments related to its U.S. LNG operations.\n\n“We are pleased with the tribunal’s determination which reaffirms what Venture Global has maintained from the outset--the plain language in our contracts, mutually agreed upon with all of our customers, is clear. We have consistently honored these agreements without exception,\" the company said in a statement. \"The world needs more abundant, low-cost energy and our company looks forward to playing a leading role in meeting that demand for years to come.”\n\nA Streak Of Good News For Venture Global’s LNG Projects\n\nThe news of the arbitration ruling came on the same day Venture Global reported second quarter earnings which exceeded expectations. Revenues for the months of April through June came in at $3.1 billion with net income of more than $400 million.\n\nEarlier in August, the company received a positive decision from the U.S. Department of Energy when Energy Secretary Chris Wright signed a final authorization for additional gas exports to non-free trade agreement (non-FTA) countries from the Calcasieu Pass project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.\n\nUS engineer and businessman Chris Wright arrives to testify before a US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on his nomination to be Secretary of Energy, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on January 15, 2025.

Wright said, “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the United States has made massive leaps in unleashing LNG dominance. Today’s authorization is another reminder that this administration is committed to expanding the supply of abundant, affordable, and secure American energy. The data over the past 10 years of U.S. LNG exports clearly shows that we can lead the world in energy production while lowering energy costs here at home.”\n\nA month ago, on July 16, Venture Global announced a new deal to beef up its supply commitments, finalizing a long-term, 20-year agreement with Italian national oil company ENI to export 2 million metric tonnes per year of LNG from its CP2 LNG terminal. The CP2 project is currently under development, with deliveries set to commence by the end of 2027.\n\nLess than 2 weeks later, on July 28, Venture Global was able to announce the greenlighting of construction at CP2 after it was able to secure $15.1 billion in capital financing for the project. It was the largest such announcement in the U.S. LNG sector thus far in 2025. Once completed, CP2 will have an expected production capacity of 28 million metric tons per annum (MTPA), which would make Venture Global one of the two largest LNG exporters in the U.S. along with Cheniere Energy.\n\nCAMERON, LA - APRIL 13: An LNG tanker makes its way into Cameron Pass near the site of Venture Global LNG's facility at Cameron Pass, near Cameron, Louisiana, on Wednesday, April 13, 2022.\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n“We are extremely proud to have taken FID on our third greenfield project in under 6 years with over $80 billion in capital markets transactions executed to date,” said Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel said in a release. “This success would not be possible without the dedication and relentless execution of the entire Venture Global team. Our significant early investments and work on the project make CP2 the most advanced project at FID to date. This project, fully owned by Venture Global and our shareholders, is expected to deliver reliable American LNG to the world beginning in 2027.”\n\nA Bright Road Ahead For U.S. LNG\n\nNo sector of the U.S. energy economy has benefitted more from the sea change in energy policy brought to bear since January 20 by President Donald Trump and his key energy-related appointees, like Sec. Wright, Interior Sec. Doug Burgum, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. After spending most of 2024 in a state of uncertainty under the yoke of Biden’s permitting “pause” - which many feared would become permanent policy in a Kamala Harris presidency - this is an industry now in full boom mode again.\n\nAlready the world’s largest supplier of LNG, the U.S. industry seems certain to continue to expand amid exploding global demand and a newly favorable policy environment. Thus far in 2025, Venture Global has been one of the biggest winners in the LNG sweepstakes.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Big LNG export firm Venture Global received a favorable arbitration ruling on Tuesday, extending a streak of favorable developments related to its projects in 2025.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/08/13/arbitration-win-extends-venture-global-lng-win-streak/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/689c6b6508d2a089b9ae8195/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 10:54:39","author":"David Blackmon,Michael M.

The company has grappled with a number of issues in 2025, including tariffs affecting its margins, which briefly brought Walmart into conflict with President Donald Trump when it announced that it was considering pricing adjustments. The company has also faced periodic boycotts over changes to its diversity hiring initiatives and broader opposition to its corporate practices.What To KnowThe lawsuit stemmed from a civil complaint filed by a group of district attorney's offices, including Santa Clara County, alleging that Walmart \"unlawfully charged customers prices higher than their lowest advertised or posted price.\"In addition, the company was accused of selling loose goods—such as fresh fruits, vegetables and baked goods—with lower weights than were shown on the label.Walmart reached the settlement with the district attorney's offices of Santa Clara County, San Diego County, San Bernardino County and Sonoma County.As part of the settlement, it is set to pay $5.5 million in civil penalties, after being found in violation of California's false advertising and unfair competition laws, and $140,000 to cover the cost of the investigation.Santa Clara County is set to receive $1.4 million of the penalty payment, which the district attorney's office said would go toward its Consumer Protection Fund.This is not the first time Walmart has been investigated or ordered to pay a settlement over similar issues. In 2012, the company paid $2.1 million to the state of California after failing to comply with a 2008 court judgment that required it to fix pricing errors. This followed a 2005 investigation that found that more than 100 stores in the state had charged customers higher prices than were advertised.\"Consumers should feel confident that the price on the shelf will be the same price they are charged at the cash register,\" then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris said in a news release. \"Californians who shop at Wal-Mart should know that they have the right to ask for the appropriate discount.\"What People Are SayingSanta Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a news release on August 8: \"When someone brings an item to the register to be scanned, the price must be right.

My Office expects it—and we will apply the law to make sure of it.\"What Happens NextIn a statement to the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Walmart said it was \"pleased this matter is resolved.\"","summary":"\"When someone brings an item to the register to be scanned, the price must be right,\" Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen said.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/walmart-overcharging-settlement-california-lawsuit-2112696","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2701459/walmart.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=f04a4e92fecddb5ea7a0b9230ff940d7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 10:18:12","author":"Hugh Cameron","authors":["Hugh Cameron"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.574},{"id":350776802,"title":"Establishment Struggles to Maintain Control of California","text":"Katie Porter got in a lot of trouble at the end of her 2024 Senate campaign for using the word “rigged” to describe the statewide primary race she lost. She was referring to a coordinated campaign by big money, particularly crypto interests, to drive up her negatives and hand California’s Senate seat to Adam Schiff. Those interests got their return on investment this year when Schiff supported the GENIUS Act.\n\nBut underneath that was another kind of rigging, one that experienced observers of the political scene here have long witnessed. Schiff was anointed the front-runner by a class of influential politicians and consultants who have long played kingmaker in California. Contested elections between Democrats for major statewide offices in this one-party state have been nonexistent during the past 20 years, as establishment-chosen politicians have divvied up the spoils.\n\nBut two bombshell announcements in the last week have left the establishment without a candidate for next year’s governor’s race. First, Kamala Harris decided against running, and then, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, the expected beneficiary of that decision, dropped out. As a result, Porter has become the unlikely beneficiary of a fractured field, and Democrats in the Golden State may experience something they haven’t seen in a while: democracy, minus the establishment putting its finger on the scale.\n\nAt the end of July, the field in the governor’s race was large but frozen, with everyone waiting to see whether Harris would end the speculation and jump in. If she did, it was likely that several candidates would immediately drop out, including Porter, the former congressmember who credits Harris with appointing her to her first job in politics, monitoring the 2012 foreclosure fraud settlement. But Harris decided she didn’t want the job, breaking a cycle where the consultants and donors who shape state politics identify their favorite and clear the field.\n\nHarris and Gavin Newsom share the same political consultants and Bay Area donor base, and though they’ve long denied it, there was an informal nonaggression pact to split up the state’s two grand-prize positions. Harris took retiring Barbara Boxer’s Senate seat in 2016 and Newsom went for governor in 2018, Jerry Brown being termed out, winning the post fairly easily over Antonio Villaraigosa and a few others.\n\nVillaraigosa also shared those same consultants, led by Ace Smith and Sean Clegg, who’d been a deputy mayor under Villaraigosa in Los Angeles. But they shifted to Newsom in that 2018 gubernatorial primary. Smith’s Bearstar Strategies has connections to every major California politician of the current generation and its predecessor: Harris, Newsom, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Jerry Brown, and more. Another Bearstar Strategies partner, Juan Rodriguez, was a senior adviser to Harris when she was California attorney general and her campaign manager for Senate; he also was lead consultant for Alex Padilla, Harris’s Senate replacement, who was a Feinstein staffer before running for office himself.\n\nThe other pillar of the California establishment is Nancy Pelosi. In Congress, she forged a close relationship with fellow San Franciscans Feinstein and Boxer, and she was actually once related to Newsom by family marriage; the informal connections go much deeper. One of Pelosi’s top allies in Congress was Adam Schiff, whom she worked hard for to beat Porter in last year’s Senate campaign.\n\nPorter’s Senate campaign and national profile have given her a healthy lead in polling, more than three times greater than the next-closest Democrat.\n\nIn the wake of Harris’s announcement, Pelosi tried to anoint Kounalakis, an ambassador to Hungary before becoming lieutenant governor, for the governor’s seat. Kounalakis’s father Angelo Tsakopoulos is a wealthy real estate developer in Sacramento and a longtime Democratic donor who bankrolled his daughter’s lieutenant governor and first-time candidacy with millions of dollars in 2018. On CNN on July 30, Pelosi (who is a neighbor to Kounalakis in the Pacific Heights section of San Francisco) slipped with her endorsement by using Kounalakis’s maiden name, the name of the rich patron. “We have many great candidates, one in particular, Eleni Tsakopoulos, whom I support,” she said. Consultant kingmaker Ace Smith retweeted the announcement.\n\nBut just days later, Kounalakis dropped out, opting instead to run for state treasurer. This was in some ways a bigger bombshell than the Harris decision. Kounalakis was the fundraising leader despite sharing donors with Harris, most of whom were waiting for the former vice president’s decision. With her national fundraising ties and family fortune, Kounalakis was one of the only candidates in the race who could deploy the kind of sums needed for a high-profile statewide office.\n\nThere’s no real history of retail campaigning in California, and voters are only marginally engaged, especially in state politics. You need either built-in name recognition or the GDP of a small country to compete. Kounalakis had the latter but couldn’t put anything together in the early days of the race. The most recent poll had her tied for sixth place with just 3 percent of the vote, behind one candidate who hadn’t even actually announced.\n\nAmong those remaining, Porter has an advantage. Her Senate campaign and national profile have given her a healthy lead in polling, more than three times greater than the next-closest Democrat. Porter’s own connection to the Newsom-Harris network is Nathan Click, who has worked for all three. But last year’s experience showed that she is not exactly the establishment’s top choice, when the big money went to her opponent.\n\nVillaraigosa is running again. But despite his past support from the consultacracy, his crash and burn against Newsom in 2018 and his willingness to challenge Harris over Joe Biden’s mental competency shows that those days are long gone. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra was once part of Pelosi’s House leadership. But despite a long career in the House and as state attorney general, he’s mired in polling and stuck in the same lane as Villaraigosa, a Latino male ex-politician. The last time he ran against Villaraigosa, for mayor of Los Angeles in 2001, he got trounced.\n\nFormer Controller (an elected office) Betty Yee has a committed base of supporters among those active in liberal Democratic politics at the state level, but it’ll be hard for that small cohort to grow enough to win. Toni Atkins, who was the top Democrat in the State Assembly and Senate at various points, has a line to millions from developers, but also massive conflicts involving her spouse’s consulting firm, which represents numerous entities with business before the state. Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction, is actually the only Bay Area candidate in the race right now, but his support is microscopic. There’s also a rich timeshare magnate named Stephen Cloobeck, who has already put $13 million of his own money into the race. Though money talks in California, the state’s history of rejecting wealthy self-funders is incredibly long.\n\nThere are a couple of Republicans: a Fox News host named Steve Hilton and Riverside County sheriff Chad Bianco. This likely will ensure a Republican will finish in the top two of the state’s jungle primary (in which candidates of all parties are on the same ballot), advancing to the general election.\n\nDespite a standoffish-at-best relationship with the state establishment, then, Porter has a relatively clean path to win the race. The bigwigs in the state are more focused on a potential special election this year asking voters to authorize maps that would match Texas’s gerrymandering. By the time they turn to the governor’s race, it could be too late.\n\nI see a couple of possible options. Villaraigosa, a former senior adviser to multilevel marketing firm Herbalife, would be comfortable going full crypto and running the 2024 Schiff play. But crypto firms might not see much upside in a state governor’s race. The establishment could choose among the field, but there’s not much separating them. Pelosi could shift to Becerra but might be gun-shy after seeing her choice check out just a week after her endorsement. It could be a sign of her waning influence among the state establishment.\n\nIn talking to people involved in state politics, I sense a lot of uncertainty. The other name for that would be democracy, and it increasingly looks like California is going to try to have one in 2026. A race testing and sharpening messages in a state with an affordability crisis whose policies have been too often on autopilot would pay off in governing.\n\nBut there’s one wild card. In 2022, a mall developer billionaire named Rick Caruso spent upwards of $100 million to try to buy the mayoralty in Los Angeles. He lost by nine points to Karen Bass. Observers were surprised to learn that the top consultant for Caruso, a Republican-turned-Democrat, was Ace Smith, the kingmaker of state politics.\n\nCaruso may try again to unseat Bass in Los Angeles.

Tommy Tuberville, Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Colorado Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet.\n\nThe more typical path is for a governor to continue their time in politics by running to be one of their states' Senators. Currently, 12 senators are a part of this former governor caucus, including both Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, Florida Sen. Rick Scott and New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who is retiring at the end of this term.\n\nJessica Taylor, the Senate and Governors editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said this cycle's inversion of the typical governor-to-Senate pipeline is the highest the country has seen in at least 90 years. One potential reason is the partisan gridlock that has hampered the power of Congress.\n\n\"In this current political environment that we're in, I think it just speaks to the polarization,\" Taylor said. \"The Senate used to be the world's greatest deliberative body, but a lot of those people that worked across the aisle have retired or been defeated.\"\n\nIt's also a move that carries a high degree of success. According to Ballotpedia's research, 10 of 14 incumbent or ex-senators have won their gubernatorial campaigns in the last 40 years, compared to 27 of 56 governors who ran for Senate.\n\nThis year, it's also notable to look at governors who have opted not to run for Senate in key races, like popular Republicans Brian Kemp of Georgia and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire.\n\nSome of these figures may have eyes towards the wide-open 2028 presidential primaries on both sides of the aisle as reasons to avoid running for Senate, Taylor adds, \"but there's no doubt that just Washington is a less attractive place than it was a few decades ago.\"\n\nOn the House side so far, there are nine Representatives, five Democrats and four Republicans, looking to make the jump to the Senate, also higher than some recent election cycles. They include Georgia Republican Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins who are looking to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff and Alabama Republican Rep. Barry Moore, who announced Tuesday, Aug. 12 his run to fill the seat Tuberville will vacate to run for governor.\n\nThere are also eight House representatives – all Republican – running for governor.\n\nTaylor said another reason some members of Congress might be choosing to run for governor is to raise their political profile in a way that holding that position might not have in the past.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of governors, I think, especially in the wake of COVID, that have been able to raise their profiles through media,\" she said. \"I think a lot of people before COVID probably didn't think about who their governor was as much. I think after COVID, more people are paying attention to governors.\"\n\nDepartures keep growing in the Trump era\n\nOf the 535 lawmakers that were in the 115th Congress that coincided with the start of Trump's first term in 2017, just over half are no longer in office. So far, all of the people who have announced retirement from public office after the current 119th Congress term are from this class of lawmakers.\n\nIn total, there have been nearly 900 people who have served in the House or Senate during the Trump and Biden administrations. \n\nSeventy-five members of Congress joined some time after 2017 and are no longer there, including several placeholder members who were appointed to hold vacant seats until the next election, lawmakers drawn out of their seats in the latest round of redistricting and more controversial figures like the expelled former Rep. George Santos.\n\nThere are lawmakers who resigned to join a new presidential administration, like former Oklahoma Republican Senator-turned-NASA-administrator Jim Bridenstine, who served in Trump's first term, former Senators-turned-vice presidents Kamala Harris and JD Vance and former Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who serves as Secretary of State and holds numerous acting roles, including National Security Advisor, in the Trump White House.\n\nThe most common form of departure for members of Congress in the Trump era by and large has been retirement, followed by losing in the general election, running for a different office or getting ousted in a primary.\n\nTaylor says there are two big reasons that lawmakers might want to leave Washington nowadays: having a life beyond Congress and because of the additional scrutiny on the age and performance of older lawmakers, exacerbated by questions about former President Biden's health during the 2024 election.\n\nWho else might leave?\n\nWhen Biden was president, more Democrats left Congress than Republicans, and during Trump's first term the opposite was true. So far this year, the president's push to exert power over Congress, its budgetary authority and other changes may entice Republicans who aren't fully on board to hang up their hat, Cook Political Report's Jessica Taylor said.\n\n\"Even if you are in the majority, you're having to continually fight,\" she said. \"And I do think, there's a fight within the Republican Party that if you are more of a moderate, continually having to bump up against Trump and his allies is exhausting.\"\n\nThe August recess for the House and Senate is a time when lawmakers return home to their districts and get a taste of what their constituents – and polling data – says about the popularity of the current administration and how much of an uphill battle they could face in a re-election campaign.\n\nHistorically, the time between that recess and when candidates begin to face deadlines to qualify for primary ballots sees an uptick in those who decide to add their name to the retirement list.","summary":"A record number of Congressional lawmakers have announced they don't plan to run for their current seats in 2026, including three sitting senators leaving Washington to run for governor.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/13/nx-s1-5495665/lawmakers-leaving-washington-run-for-governor-congress-2026-midterms","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7889x5259+0+0/resize/7889x5259!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F55%2F01dc0dce4f74b3523710c16aeecc%2Fgettyimages-2207939828.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 09:00:00","author":"Stephen Fowler","authors":["Stephen Fowler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.129},{"id":350634616,"title":"Welcome to Super-City, USA: To make it cheaper to buy a home in America, we need to think bigger","text":"Depending on who you ask, suburban living is either the stuff of the American dream, a desolate, alienating existence, or something in between. But there is no doubt of the grip that the white picket fences and green lawns have on the American imagination. In his 1985 book Crabgrass Frontier, the historian Kenneth T. Jackson — perhaps the dean of American suburban studies — wrote that \"suburbia has become the quintessential physical achievement of the United States; it is perhaps more representative of its culture than big cars, tall buildings, or professional football.\" To many urbanists, the suburbs also represent something a little more prosaic, though no less important: a major governance problem.In particular, the suburbs pose a problem called municipal fragmentation. Most of the little bedroom communities surrounding a major city have their own governments, their own electorate, and their own set of policy priorities. The central problems of urban governance — how to run a safe and efficient transportation network, where to put housing, how to cultivate a strong job market — are essentially regional, but the mosaics of incorporated towns and unincorporated county lands that surround major American cities struggle to properly coordinate to address these issues. Each little fiefdom is largely free to pursue its own goals, even if those goals conflict with the interests of the larger metropolitan region, and there are few regional bodies in the United States that have the muscle to overcome this parochialism.But overcoming local parochialism is the key to creating vibrant, growing cities across the nation. If we're going to solve the housing crisis, build a transportation network that works for all people, and provide economic opportunity to all of the more than 80% of Americans who live in urban areas, then we need institutions that can tie together the towns, hamlets, and satellite cities of our major metropolitan regions, so that they all start moving in the same direction.To understand the problem of municipal fragmentation, consider New York City's housing shortage. (By one estimate, the New York metropolitan area would need to build more than half a million homes in order to close the housing gap.) The city can and should stimulate a lot more housing production within its borders (and is attempting to do so), but even if the city council abolished all zoning laws tomorrow and allowed massive amounts of new construction, New York would probably still be digging out of a housing shortage in a decade, albeit a less severe one.That's in part because New York City comprises less than 10% of the entire New York City metropolitan area in terms of surface area. The region as a whole includes more than 900 other municipalities, from New Haven, Connecticut, in the north to the seaside towns of southern New Jersey. Quite a few of those localities are affluent bedroom communities that have grown prosperous off their proximity to New York while providing the city with very little in return.For example, many residents of Greenwich, Connecticut (average household income: $272,636) have lucrative jobs in Manhattan. They benefit from the city's booming economy, as well as its high concentration of skilled workers and major employers in high-wage industries like finance, but their property taxes don't go to New York. Instead of seeing itself as part of the broader NYC area and welcoming people who are looking to secure their economic future there, Greenwich has instituted a draconian zoning code that keeps people out and contributes to the region's housing supply crunch. (It doesn't help that the governor of Connecticut recently vetoed a bill intended to mitigate the state's housing shortage.)If Greenwich and every other exclusionary suburb in the New York metro area loosened up their zoning, it would go a long way toward easing the central city's affordability crisis. There's plenty of room there; even increasing Greenwich's population density to make it on par with a denser midsize city like New Haven would mean growing its population by fivefold, adding more than 250,000 residents. More homebuilding in the suburbs would not only make the region as a whole more affordable, but it would also give more enterprising people a chance to move to the area, work, build businesses, and contribute to the shared prosperity of the region. But officials in New York City have no jurisdictional authority to push other towns to greenlight more housing. And since the potential benefits are so diffuse, Greenwich residents who oppose more development (aka NIMBYs) have little clear incentive to be part of a region-wide solution.Some metropolitan areas have solved this collective action problem through municipal consolidation: New York City's borders stopped at the edge of the Island of Manhattan until it absorbed the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island between 1873 and 1879. More recently, Louisville, Kentucky, merged with surrounding Jefferson County in 2003. But in general, consolidation is a nineteenth-century phenomenon. Fragmentation is the norm in the United States.While it's unlikely that big cities will be able to annex surrounding counties en masse anytime soon, there is another way to fight municipal fragmentation and to alleviate the housing crunch on a wider scale: through regional super-governments that conduct planning and exercise some land use authority over entire metropolitan areas. The United States is already dotted with regional government authorities — in particular, the metropolitan planning organizations that help distribute federal transportation funding, like the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, the San Francisco Bay Area's Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. But regional bodies often have little power compared to cities, making the battle for change an uphill fight.Our tradition of strong hyperlocal rule and weak regional government is fairly unusual across the globe. The regional governments of Barcelona and Helsinki's urban areas, for example, do genuine regional planning. And in stark contrast to the United States, Japan is subdivided into prefectures, which are supercharged regional governments that have broad control over planning and land use. That may help to explain why housing costs in big Japanese cities like Tokyo have largely remained stable even as the country's rural population has shrunk and its urban population has grown.Three decades ago, California very nearly became the first US state to inch in Japan's direction. In some ways, the state is an ideal testing ground for super-regionalism, thanks to the extreme fragmentation of its largest metropolitan areas (Greater Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area), its history of progressive experimentation, and its yawning housing shortage. Policymakers in the state spent a lot of time in the late 1980s and early 1990s thinking about solutions to municipal fragmentation. Some of what they came up with was genuinely radical.For example, the Los Angeles 2000 Committee, which then-Mayor Tom Bradley assembled to consider the city's future planning needs, issued a report in 1988 that proposed a regional Growth Management Agency for greater Los Angeles. The goal of this agency would be to produce plans that would help the Los Angeles metro area, which sprawls over 4,850 square miles and more than 100 municipalities, \"achieve a favorable balance between jobs and housing.\" The agency would have been empowered to, for example, stimulate job growth in eastern Los Angeles and encourage greater housing production in prosperous Orange County.Inspired in part by the work of the Los Angeles 2000 Committee, in 1989 some influential Northern California residents secured both public and private funding to create the Bay Area 2020 Commission. This commission's work was much more explicitly regionalist, and so its core recommendation was for a significantly more muscular regional planning mechanism than even the Los Angeles committee had devised. The Bay Area's commission proposed merging the area's three major regional bodies (the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District) into a single commission.This Regional Commission would have had extensive powers, including the ability to levy fines on local governments that didn't comply with regional plans, and to issue permits for a proposed development anywhere in the Bay Area's nine counties. A bill was introduced in the state senate to implement Bay Vision 2020, but, needless to say, it didn't pass. Many local governments, and two of the three regional bodies that were supposed to merge, were not pleased with the prospect of ceding their autonomy.But that wasn't even the spiciest proposal from the era. That honor belongs to an idea cooked up by then-Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. Brown was one of the central figures of late 20th-century California politics: the first Black speaker of the Assembly, the first Black mayor of San Francisco, and the kingmaker who helped launch the political careers of both Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom. He actually floated two separate proposals for overhauling regional government across the state. The first one was about as audacious as it gets: In 1987, Brown casually suggested completely abolishing city and county government in the state of California and replacing it with a series of regional governments. In essence, he was proposing that California adopt the Japanese prefectural system. Though his idea never made it into legislative language, a couple of years later, he proposed something a little less radical. As Bill Fulton, the dean of California urban planners, wrote of Brown's proposal in his book about Los Angeles, The Reluctant Metropolis, Brown's proposed \"Regional Development and Infrastructure Agencies\" would have been directly-elected boards that could pass \"judgment on large development projects that were previously the province of local cities and counties.\"By making the boards directly elected, these \"regional legislatures\" would have seriously diluted the power of the NIMBY bedroom communities and drawn in ambitious politicians seeking to enact major projects on a region-wide scale. Once again, this proposal died on the vine: Brown didn't push it particularly hard, the governor wasn't interested, and a looming recession bumped regionalism off the legislative agenda. But maybe it's time to take another look at some of these ideas.If states like California did beef up their regional governments, it could go a long way toward solving the housing crisis. A 2023 report from California YIMBY (my former employer, full disclosure) found indications that the biggest potential housing gains from zoning and land use reforms can be found in suburbs, not the high-cost cities they surround. Eliminating zoning in San Francisco could yield a lot more units, but doing the same in Marin County would lead to much bigger results.Granted, implementing something like Brown's proposal for regional super-governments would likely infuriate a lot of people in both San Francisco and Marin. Opponents would no doubt describe regionalism as an unconscionable usurpation of local democracy. In return, I would argue that region-wide planning is more democratic than giving exclusive enclaves like Sausalito free rein to write their own rules and lock out lower-income residents from the rest of the region. If hyper-local control is what got us the Bay Area's current housing and homelessness crisis, what is it really worth?We may never get the Bay Area mega-city that Willie Brown seems to have envisioned. But at a time when many Americans are concerned about housing costs and commute times, even some halfway measures toward tighter integration across metropolitan benefits would yield enormous benefits.Ned Resnikoff is an urban policy consultant and writer.

In a new interview, the author answered a series of fan questions for The Guardian, including “If you had to invent an ending for Trumpian America, what would it be?”\n\n“I think it would be impeachment – which, in my view, would be a good ending,” King responded. “I would love to see him retired, let’s put it that way. The bad ending would be that he gets a third term and takes things over completely. It’s a horror story either way. Trump is a horror story, isn’t he?”\n\nKing has been an outspoken critic of Trump for years, sharing his thoughts on social media on an almost-daily basis. In June, he tweeted, “Deep down in his heart, I believe Trump knows he’s an incompetent asshole.” He recently added, “Trump is like a spoiled child. When he doesn’t get his way, he does a tantrum.”\n\nIn 2022, King was asked for his views on Trump during an interview for the Sunday Times and he didn’t mince words. “I happen to think that Trump was a horrible president and is a horrible person,” King said. “I think he actually engaged in criminal behavior and, certainly, I felt that he was a sociopath who tried to overturn the American democracy not out of any political wish of his own but because he could not admit that he had lost.”\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, King speculated that Trump had refused to debate Democratic nominee Kamala Harris despite an official announcement. “Trump has announced he won’t debate Kamala Harris,” King wrote. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung responded in a statement to Newsweek, “Stephen King is a dumbass.”\n\nTrending Stories\n\nSwifties Uncover Years’ Worth of Easter Eggs After ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ Reveal\n\nZoë Kravitz Says Her Mom Lisa Bonet Let a Snake Loose in Taylor Swift's House\n\nMeet CORTIS, the Coolest K-Pop Debut of the Year\n\nChatGPT Lured Him Down a Philosophical Rabbit Hole.

I’m very excited to see [Edgar Wright’s remake of] The Running Man, which was filmed in England. I don’t write with movies in mind. I just write what seems like a good story that people and I will enjoy. Then whatever happens to it happens. That’s fine. I like the movies, but I think they’re different things, like apples and oranges, so to speak.”\n\nHe also responded to a question about whether he felt Netflix series Stranger Things was comparable to one of his novels. “I don’t see it as a Stephen King story as much as some other people do,” he said. “I think the Duffer Brothers give me more credit than I deserve. Like a lot of talented people, they grew up with my material. When they were young and malleable, they read a lot of Stephen King and said: ‘We wanna do something like that.’ But they’re very talented guys and the story they have developed has a lot more to it than Stephen King. It’s got a lot of Duffer Brothers in it. It’s good. I’ve seen all the episodes.

The weather was perfect. At first glance, it could have been a joyful community gathering in a sun-dappled Cotswolds village park, but the placards gave the game away.\n\nThese pulled no punches, criticising the policies and stances championed by the US vice-president, JD Vance, who is enjoying a country break down the road.\n\nAbout 100 people, mostly women, turned up for the “not welcome” party organised by the Stop Trump Coalition on the park opposite the Co-op in Charlbury, north-west Oxfordshire.\n\n“He’s simply not welcome here,” said Sue Moon, a therapist from nearby Chipping Norton, who was carrying a placard reading: “Cotswold childless cat ladies say go home” – a reference to Vance’s typically blunt put-down of Democrats.\n\nMoon – who has children and no cats – said the Cotswolds was earning a reputation as a bolt-hole for the rich and powerful; the former prime minister David Cameron lives nearby. “That’s not what we’re about. We don’t want anything to do with people like him,” she said, referring to Vance.\n\nNatasha Phillips, who had travelled 70 miles from Bath to attend the event billed as a “Dance against Vance”, bore a placard saying: “JD Vance – the guy who bullied a war hero from the comfort of his couch.”\n\n“The way he treated Volodymyr Zelenskyy was disgusting,” she said. “The Ukrainian people are heroes. British people admire the way they are standing up to [Vladimir] Putin. I wanted to come here to show that.”\n\nChris Tatton, a long-term resident of Charlbury and a former councillor, said one of the worst things he had seen in a lifetime of watching politics was Vance’s ambush of the Ukrainian president. “That was disgraceful,” he said.\n\nHis friend Steve Akers, a retired union organiser, said even worse for him was the sight of starving children in Gaza. “That wouldn’t happen without this US government.”\n\nOne placard said: “Make Charlbury great again – go home.” Another said: “Not too posh to protest.” A third: “Rolling hills. Not rolling back climate change.”\n\nThere were plenty of versions of the meme of Vance as a bloated baby. In June, a Norwegian man, Mads Mikkelsen, 21, accused American border officials of denying him entry into the US because he had the meme saved on his phone.\n\nMore wholesomely, a boy with a skateboard wore a T-shirt with a cheerful Canadian motif. And the organisers had brought along a Colin the Caterpillar cake with an image of Vance’s face attached to it.\n\nRachel, a carer from Banbury, Oxfordshire, said: “I’m most worried about his environmental policies. They risk eliminating the whole of humanity, all the creatures on the Earth.”\n\nOver the past few decades, this corner of Oxfordshire has been turned into a celeb-magnet – a place of designer delis, gastropubs, spas and private clubs.\n\nJeremy Clarkson’s Diddly Squat farm shop and pub attract fans of his TV shows and his conservative views (though he called Vance “a bearded God-botherer” in a Times column earlier this year). The former Top Gear presenter shared an image on Instagram on Tuesday which highlighted that his farm is under a no-fly zone.\n\nIn an apparent reference to filming for the fifth series of his series Clarkson’s Farm, the 65-year-old wrote: “On the downside, no drone shots today. On the upside, no annoying light aircraft.”\n\nClarkson later sarcastically shared a video of a peaceful Cotswolds scene and wrote: “Utter chaos caused by Vance. How will we ever manage?”\n\nIn the interest of political balance, Vance’s predecessor as VP, Kamala Harris, was spotted in Charlbury’s pub, the Bull, last month.\n\nHouse prices here have soared, making it hard for local young people to find a place to live. A modern three-bedroomed house in Charlbury will set you back the best part of £500,000. As in rural areas across England, services such as health and transport are stretched.\n\nVance probably won’t see the issues. He is believed to be staying in an 18th-century manor house owned by the lightbulb millionaire Johnny Hornby and his wife, Pippa, a London art patron and collector, who are friends of Cameron.\n\nJonathan Mazower, the communications director for Survival International, a charity that works with Indigenous peoples, did not attend the “party” but was angry that Vance had been invited.\n\n“There’s massive disruption – all roads and footpaths have been closed, all cars are searched, no visitors are allowed in. There are police and US Secret Service agents everywhere,” said Mazower, who lives near the sprawling digs where Vance is staying.\n\n“But more important than the disruption is what he represents. On the whole people here are very much ‘live and let live’ but this is something else entirely. Trump’s No 2 coming here feels like an absolute outrage and imposition.\n\n“The massive police and Secret Service presence makes any normal protest impossible, so we’ve had to resort to putting up placards around the village, some of which are being taken down.”\n\nAndy Graham, the leader of West Oxfordshire district council, compared the scenes to the Will Smith film Men in Black. “Seeing someone dressed up with black suit, sunglasses, the whole lot, you kind of felt it was a bit over the top really,” he said. “We understand that people do need security but I think they haven’t been discreet about it.”","summary":"About 100 people turn up for ‘not welcome’ party in Charlbury, Oxfordshire as Trump’s No 2 stays nearby\n\nThere was cake and music.

MMA culture is intertwined with bro culture, and bros are considered the antithesis of “woke” liberalism.\n\nBut it’s not that simple. Consider a startling fact: While Maga champions an “America First” ideology, the UFC is a paragon of globalism. Of the 11 reigning UFC champions, only one is American — Kayla Harrison, thriving in an organization White once insisted would exclude women. Both Australia and Georgia (the country) boast twice as many champions as the UFC’s home country. The only belt firmly held by US fighters is the unofficial ‘BMF’ (Baddest Motherfucker) belt. White invented this to reward charismatic fighters who put on great shows. While it’s a clever way to encourage personality and panache, it also seems like a DEI program to ensure US fighters remain prominent in the UFC pantheon.\n\nSo the UFC roster is more global than ever. But UFC fighters have never fit neatly into categories.\n\nThis diversity was a hallmark of the reality show that broke the UFC into the mainstream, The Ultimate Fighter. The casts included cerebral chess players, devout Christians and someone who brought a compass to ensure that his bed would face north, and another who fled the show to reassure his girlfriend that rumors she saw online weren’t true.\n\nAnd the UFC evolved in ways that might be considered “progressive.” Cain Velasquez didn’t lose any noticeable fan support in 2010 when he sported a “Brown Pride” tattoo across his chest and admitted that his father had immigrated illegally. (Velasquez has since been sentenced to prison for issues unrelated to immigration.) \n\nAfter opposing the idea of female fighters for many years, White threw open the Octagon door to Ronda Rousey in a 2013 bout against Liz Carmouche, who was openly gay. White strongly supported Carmouche and even gave an impassioned plea to legalize gay marriage wherever it wasn’t already recognised — a position he stated well before a series of landmark US supreme court decisions upheld that right. \n\nFour years later, UFC fighter Jessica Andrade proposed to her girlfriend in her postfight interview in the Octagon. While the UFC sold Pride Month gear and gave proceeds to an LGBTQIA+ organisation in Nevada, outspoken Trump supporter Colby Covington emerged as one of the sport’s biggest villains.\n\nStill, the UFC’s primary demographic of young adult men proved to be a decisive force for Trump’s return to the presidency. This group overlaps significantly with the audience for UFC commentator Joe Rogan’s popular podcast, and Rogan — who felt ostracised by the left after touting scientifically unsound covid treatments — endorsed Trump last year.\n\nBut that was November. Fast forward to this summer, and this demographic has veered sharply against Trump. Rogan himself has broken with the president over tariffs, deportations, and the Epstein files. Last month, Rogan told podcast guest James Talarico, a Texas Democrat, that he should run for the White House. There’s a case to be made that if the Kamala Harris campaign had managed to get her on Rogan’s podcast last fall, we would have a different president today.\n\nSuch changes shouldn’t be a surprise. Rogan himself is always on the lookout for new ideas — if anything, he’s a little too receptive to some schools of thought and doesn’t push back or check facts. While older Americans are prone to adopting a party and sticking with it come hell or high water, Gen Z is fiercely independent politically. They’re also more diverse than previous generations, more likely to be non-white, LGBTQ+ or any other group that may feel aggrieved by Trump’s actions since reclaiming the presidency. Younger generations are also much more receptive to socialism than prior ones – after all, young men made enough of a fuss over Bernie Sanders to warrant the term “Bernie Bros.” \n\nSo Maga’s place in “bro culture” — and those who are MMA fans — is by no means secure. And one day, Donald Trump will be out of office. We’ve already seen that US conservatives are eager to abandon one trend for another. Today’s Maga supporters had a decidedly different message when the Tea Party reigned supreme. Two decades after calling Democrats “traitors” for opposing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they excommunicated the entire Bush family.\n\nTrump’s popularity may well be on the slide too. His approval rating has tanked, and his mutable responses to the Jeffrey Epstein saga have fractured his base. The UFC may well be losing as many fans as its attracts by aligning itself with Trump.\n\nThe UFC, meanwhile, is still a strong brand but perhaps not the hot property it was a few years ago. Last week’s Disney earnings report made a brief reference to “lower Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-view fees due to lower average buys per event.” The fight game tends to be cyclical, driven by big personalities like Rousey, Jon Jones and Conor McGregor, all of whom have either left the sport or gone through a prolonged period of inactivity. It’s tough to imagine current light heavyweight champion Magomed Ankalaev reaching the level of fame of Forrest Griffin, Rampage Jackson or Chuck Liddell. While we can’t really quantify the impact of the Trump lovefest on the UFC’s popularity, the organisation clearly can’t afford to alienate the 60% or so of the population that disapproves of Trump’s presidency thus far.\n\nPerhaps this is one reason why the UFC has just opted for a new media deal that breaks from their pay-per-view model in order to get wider exposure. “This shift in distribution strategy will unlock greater accessibility and discoverability for sports fans,” said the press release announcing the seven-year, $7.7bn deal. Some fight cards will be on network TV, and others will be free to subscribers of their streaming partner.\n\nThat streaming partner, though, is Paramount, which has also drawn the ire of many US viewers through a series of moves that appear to be a capitulation to the president’s desire to control the media. First, Paramount settled a lawsuit over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a lawsuit deemed by many legal scholars as rather simple for Paramount to win, at the same time that the media conglomerate sought government approval for a merger. Second, after TV host Stephen Colbert criticized his parent company for settling the suit, Paramount announced that his show will end in 2026, ostensibly for financial reasons even though it is the highest-rated late-night show. (Fox News Channel claims its show Gutfeld! has higher ratings, but it airs earlier than the traditional late-night window that starts at 11.30pm Eastern time.) \n\nStill, the decision to move away from the pay-per-view model can only be seen as a sign that the UFC feels the need to make its big tent a bit bigger as it faces the difficult challenge of keeping US fans interested in a sport in which American athletes are far from dominant. Typically, US sports broadcasters gravitate to events in which US athletes are faring well, which is why Olympic coverage focuses far more attention on swimming and snowboarding than, say, table tennis or biathlon.\n\nWhite and Trump were always an odd match. Trump was involved with Affliction, a rival MMA organization of the late 2000s that White fought with the venom of the Trump administration’s attacks on Harvard and the media. Trump has ridiculed veterans, dating back to when he said he didn’t consider John McCain a war hero because he likes “people who weren’t captured’ and continuing with Ice arrests of veterans in his second term and a recent awkward moment in which he turned attention to himself at a ceremony honouring Purple Heart recipients; White and the UFC are staunch supporters of the Wounded Warrior Project and other veterans’ groups. White is an affable philanthropist; Trump used funds from his own foundation on a portrait of himself and his presidential campaign.\n\nWe probably won’t see White publicly repudiate Trump, a move that wouldn’t sit well with a sizable portion of UFC’s audience. But over the years, White has shrewdly expanded the UFC fanbase, and he would dearly love for his sport to be the biggest in the world. White has already pronounced that his involvement with politics ends with Trump, telling The New Yorker last year that: “I’m never fucking doing this again. I want nothing to do with this shit. It’s gross. It’s disgusting. I want nothing to do with politics.” \n\nWhite has changed his mind about many things over the years. He brought in Kimbo Slice not long after denigrating his fighting skills. He brought women into the cage. But those moves were driven by popular uprisings, and White is almost always willing to give fans what they want. While much of the country watches in horror as Medicaid is slashed, Gaza’s suffering gets worse by the week, the economy teeters on the brink, and the White House is in crisis mode trying to deflect from the Epstein case, the clamour to make White reassert his position at Trump’s side will surely be muted.","summary":"The Octagon is more international than ever – so why is Dana White still tied to an administration that seeks to isolate large parts of its audience?","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/othersport/arid-41686089.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9478/4739178_10_seoimage1x1_GettyImages-2209369905.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 05:59:00","author":"Beau Dure,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Beau Dure","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.043},{"id":350593038,"title":"Kamala Harris slammed over insanely mean-spirited way she treated JD Vance's children","text":"JD Vance revealed that his family's transition into the vice president's residence was awkward, after Vice President Kamala Harris ignored the tradition of inviting his family to visit the property before the inauguration.\n\n'They had never seen this house and Usha really wanted to show them,' Vance revealed.\n\nHe said that he and his staff knew the politics of the situation could be uncomfortable, but proposed the idea of Usha and the kids visiting the home to Harris and her staff.\n\n'They were rebuffed,' Vance said.\n\nThe vice president's residence is a 9,000 square foot Queen Anne style home with 33-rooms, a wraparound porch, grand staircases and elegant turrets.\n\nModern vice presidents typically host the incoming vice president and their families to introduce them to the residence that is about two miles from the White House.\n\nVice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynn welcomed incoming Vice President Joe Biden in 2009 and the Bidens extended the same courtesy to the Pence family in 2016.\n\nThe Pence family didn't host Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff to the residence in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The coronavirus pandemic and the politically tumultuous environment surrounding Trump's challenge to the results complicated a meet-up.\n\nSources close to Harris at the time explained that she and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff were preoccupied with pressing matters—namely a canceled overseas trip and the wildfires in California, according to CBS News.\n\nBut some people view Harris' response to Vance as a snub, which the vice president addressed in an interview with the Katie Miller podcast.\n\n'Wow, Kamala’s already dodging basic courtesy?' wrote one user on social media, 'Refusing to let the kids see their future home is just petty.'\n\n'Very telling.

Gov. Eleni Kounalakis is smart and personable, and a competent lieutenant governor. However, there’s not much involved in that post other than serving on some state boards and being ready if the real governor becomes incapacitated. Kounalakis first won the job in 2018 with the help of a $9-million contribution from her developer father and won re-election in 2022.\n\nWe doubt many California voters have heard much about her even though she had thrown her hat in the ring for the 2026 governor’s race. But before that campaign really got going—and it’s starting to heat up now that former Vice President Kamala Harris declined to run—Kounalakis announced that she would instead run for treasurer.\n\nThat was a smart move. Recent polling showed her far back in a crowded field, with a meager 2.4% support. She was only slightly ahead of Stephen Cloobeck, the little-known first-time candidate and Los Angeles businessman who has been running anti-Trump ads on TV.\n\nKounalakis only has herself to blame. She ran for lieutenant governor on a rather generic liberal platform—building more housing, protecting the coast, increasing transparency, breaking the glass ceiling. She hasn’t become clearly identified with any policy agenda or accomplishments.\n\nThe main coverage of Kounalakis’ tenure involved a potential conflict of interest involving her real-estate holdings in downtown Sacramento—not a big deal given she vowed to put them in a blind trust if elected, but not the attention that’s endearing to voters.\n\nLike Harris, she deserves kudos for getting out early winnowing the field to candidates who are in it for the long run. It’s a weak field, so the earlier that the race gets going the better. As we’ve noted before, California faces serious challenges and desperately needs candidates with innovative ideas to address them.","summary":"Californians shrug as Kounalakis drops bid for governor","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/08/12/californians-shrug-as-kounalakis-drops-bid-for-governor/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OCR-L-GOVRACE-0803_96345a.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 04:33:18","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.256},{"id":350604188,"title":"Wild details of Taylor Swift's new album - leaked: Blake Lively and TRUMP diss tracks... Travis Kelce 'PR stunt' song... and a private 'dark chapter'","text":"No one does Easter eggs quite like Taylor Swift.\n\nThe singer's back catalogue is peppered with subtle(ish) nods to her lovers and friends - past and present - much to the delight of sleuthing fans who spend hours deciphering the meanings behind lyrics.\n\nSo it will no doubt be a relief to learn that Swift isn't planning to break from tradition when it comes to her new album, The Life of a Showgirl.\n\nAfter all, how could she? \n\nIn the months since releasing her last record, The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) - in April 2024 - her romance with Travis Kelce has been heating up; she has weathered claims that their union is nothing more than a PR stunt; she was accused of dropping music at the same time as her contemporaries to maintain her place at the top of the charts; she has been targeted by Donald Trump for endorsing Kamala Harris; and she suffered a cataclysmic fall out with her now-former best friend Blake Lively.\n\n'Taylor is in such a good space right now but there was an awareness that she couldn't ignore all the drama,' an insider tells the Daily Mail. 'There are Easter eggs [in the new album] about how she overcame the drama with Blake. And she does in her own way address people who believed her relationship with Travis was a PR stunt.'\n\nAmid her record-breaking Eras Tour last year, the Daily Mail previously reported that Swift was already writing new material barely two months after the release of TTPD.\n\nNow, our insider tell us she had been working on as many as 'three songs a days.'\n\nFast forward to Monday, and Swift shocked fans by announcing The Life of a Showgirl in a teaser for Kelce's In the Heights podcast, which drops on Wednesday.\n\nIt came after her website featured a countdown over a glittering orange background and the text: 'Expires August 12 at 12:12AM ET.'\n\n'So I wanted to show you something,' she says in the podcast, before pulling out a case with 'TS' emblazoned on the side. 'This is my brand-new album, The Life of a Showgirl.'\n\nShe held up the vinyl (which had been censored to obscure the cover art) as a proud Kelce shouted 'TS 12' (it will be her 12th album).\n\n'Some of the songs sound dramatic in terms of the instrumental, but the lyrical content on a few is romantic,' our source reveals of the new music.\n\n'It is absolutely inspired by Travis. Being loved by him has really helped her overcome some dark chapters in her life.\n\n'He is proof that there are kind men out there with good hearts and fans will hear how happy she is in the songs.'\n\nBut the album, which does not yet have a release date, will also address the drama and the slew of accusations Swift has come up against in the last year. \n\nWhen TTPD was released, it maintained the No.1 position on the Billboard 200 chart for 17 weeks. A double album edition titled The Anthology, with 15 bonus tracks, was surprise-released two hours after the first drop.\n\nMultiple other 'special' editions with bonus tracks followed, prompting some critics to suggest Swift's chart success was the result of periodic releases to keep sales and streaming figures high.\n\nDropping two of those 'special' editions the same day that Billie Eilish released her album Hit Me Hard and Soft was seen by some as a direct attack on the competition.\n\nThings were also exacerbated when Swift dropped special UK-only editions just as it was announced that Charli XCX was expected to land a No.1 debut for her album Brat, \n\nSome fans made a connection to The 1975 frontman Matty Healy, who Swift briefly dated before Kelce. Charli XCX is married to Healy's bandmate, drummer George Daniel.\n\nMonths later, Swift found herself dragged into Blake Lively's legal battle with actor Justin Baldoni, after he named the singer in legal documents and even temporarily subpoenaed her. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reported how Swift then cut Lively off, with the lawsuit drama ultimately severing their decade-long friendship.\n\nInsiders say Swift felt 'used' and 'exploited' by Lively, who allegedly tried to leverage Swift's more-famous name to bolster her case.\n\nAround the same time, Swift was pulled into the race for the White House.\n\nIn September, she endorsed Kamala Harris, prompting Trump to hit back saying he 'was not a Taylor fan' and declaring 'she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.'\n\nOur insider says the new album 'isn't a political record' but that Swift was 'motivated by the excitement around Kamala last year which is when she recorded some of the songs.' \n\n'Taylor has a point to prove and is ready to silence people who said her career has \"broke\" because she went \"woke\",' they said.\n\nWhen it comes to Lively, the insider added: 'She did write about Blake last year but it's no longer the focus of the album because she wanted it to be positive and feel-good.","summary":"Swift shocked fans by announcing The Life of a Showgirl late on Monday night.

In this interview by TAIWO AMODU, he says his party is not bothered by the sudden romance between former presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Mallam Abdullahi dismisses allegation of marginalisation, levelled against the ADC National Working Committee (NWC) by certain loyalists of the former LP candidate. Excerpts:\n\nThere is this internal dissension, threatening the ADC since the Coalition joined it. Some states chairmen have said the Coalition members came to hijack the party. Dumebi Kachikwu, your former presidential candidate has said the same thing. Why this crack?\n\nI don’t know the states chairmen being talked about, I don’t know how many of them because we have 36 states. But let me first address the Kachikwu issue. People keep talking about him. Was he an official of the party? Was he national chairman of the party? He was just a presidential candidate of the party . So, how can a presidential candidate say he doesn’t know what conversations happened towards building a relationship with other political parties or other politicians? He was just a presidential candidate of the party, someone who used the platform of the party. Once the election which he participated was over, his contract of dealing with the party was over. If you want to run again, you need to recontest again otherwise you are just an ordinary member of the party — just like every other ordinary member of the party in Abia or in Ibadan. He doesn’t have an official role to play.\n\nNumber two. It is on record that Kachikwu has been expelled from the party since 2022. So, there is no basis for him to claim that he wasn’t part of the coalition. You can see that in recent times, you don’t hear from him anymore. He must have been appropriately advised and his expulsion from the party was even at the last NEC meeting in Abuja here. So, that’s is that about that. \n\nNow, coming to the states chairmen, one of the initial moves that the national chairman, David Mark did was to invite all the states chairmen to Abuja. All the 36 of them were invited, they all came and the chairman assured them that we weren’t coming to sweep them away, that all states chairmen will keep their positions until the next Congress of the party unless any chairman is willing to resign his position. \n\nThese people you call chairmen that are raising issues now, they didn’t raise any issue. They attended the meeting, they signed attendance, they all said they were happy with the development. So at what point did they realise that the party has been hijacked from them?\n\n You see, it is the same hands of destabilisation, that have destroyed other opposition parties that is at work but they aren’t going to succeed with ADC, because the people that formed ADC were victims of the same machinations that destroyed their original political parties; that’s what drove them into this coalition. We took all time , we took all efforts, to ensure that all legal requirements were met , everything that needed to be done was done . So, we weren’t worried. After the two chairmen that you referred to, you see people coming and they will keep coming because it is a lucrative enterprise now to say you can destabilise the coalition.\n\nCan you speak in specific terms, these forces? PDP, SDP are all facing leadership crises. Does the Presidency has a hand in all these?\n\nYes, it is the Presidency, the ruling government! You see, what they wanted and I have always maintained, is to create chaos. They know that on their records of performance alone, Nigerians won’t vote for them. They have brought Nigerians to their knees, the rate of sufferings in this country today is almost unprecedented. So they knew what they have done and they know that based on their scorecard alone, Nigerians won’t vote for them. So, what they wanted to do was to foist on us a fait accompli so that by the time we arrive at 2027, no political party will be in a position to present a candidate or be in a position to challenge it for power . That’s what they are trying to do. I am not holding them entirely responsible for what has happened in the political parties, whether in PDP or SDP, or any of the political parties but there is no doubt of its involvement.\n\nThe President himself said it at the national assembly. He said, I can’t help you to fix your parties but I am enjoying what is happening to you.\n\nDon’t you think, he probably meant the problem is self-inflicted?\n\nYes, but if I were the President, I wouldn’t say that. If I were advising the President, you know what I will advise him to say: I would tell him that’s not what he should have said. Even if he wasn’t aware, if he had no hand in what is happening. A presidential of a country has a responsibility to protect democratic institutions. The President of Nigeria should have said, we note with concern, what is happening in other political parties and I will encourage them to put their acts in order as quickly as possible because our democracy is better when there are alternatives. I won’t help you to fix your problems because it isn’t in my interest to do so but I will encourage you to put your acts together because our democracy is stronger when there is competition. If the President has said that, his political ratings will go up, people will say, this is a democrat. But to say, I can’t help you to fix your problems, but I am in fact enjoying what is happening to you! So, it is clear where all these are coming from and what the agenda is.\n\nWith General David Mark as Interim chairman, some discerning Nigerians have formed the impression that the class of retired Generals have a hand in this coalition. To what extent does the ADC enjoy the blessings of General Obasanjo, Aliyu Gusau and Ibrahim Babangida?\n\nThe coalition has received tremendous supports, from every citizen who believes that Nigeria as a country is heading towards a disastrous plain . The coalition has been encouraged at every point in time. But I am not going to say more than that.\n\nThat means the class of retired Generals are giving their support?\n\nI just said everything Nigerian, including the people you have mentioned have supported the Coalition from the start, encouraged the Coalition, advised it from the start to ensure that Nigeria doesn’t end up as one party democracy; that it doesn’t end up as a one party state; that Nigeria is rescued from the hands of these people who appear set to bring the country down. So, we have been encouraged at one time or the other by every citizen of goodwill that believes that Nigeria needs to be saved from the APC disaster. I am not going to say more than that.\n\nWhat will you be telling Nigerians who are cynical about the capacity of gladiators in ADC to bring the desired change? They look at chieftains of the PDP that governed for 16 years and the APC that has ruled for 10 years as drivers of the ADC. How do you intend to convince them?\n\nWho are these individuals?\n\nYou want me to mention names?\n\nALSO READ FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE: Cautious optimism as INEC braces up for CVR exercise\n\nThe likes of the former ex-SGF who was accused of a financial scandal?\n\nHas he been convicted? Look, anybody can allege anything. He is one of the most respected Nigerian today. I have worked very closely with him and I know him to be one of the best human beings I have met in my life. So people can sit in one corner and pass judgment on people. So, have you asked them questions? The very first day I met him, I asked him and I understood exactly what happened because it could have been easy for anybody to fall into that error. So he has my respect any day.\n\nYou see, they started by saying the coalition was dead on arrival . That it won’t succeed. Then we unveiled. Then the argument moved to look at the caliber of people there. But like I have repeatedly maintained, when APC came on board in 2014, was it not the same caliber of people? Was there an angel that came from heaven to lead the APC at the time? Was it not the same people? Nasir El-Rufai that they love to demonize today. ? Was he not the one leading the campaign of APC? Baba Oyegun was the national chairman of APC now in the coalition? Is he one of the people being referred to? This same Babachir Lawal, was he not a leading member of the APC at the time?\n\nSo, you see, this kind of conversation seems to suggest that it is either people are hypocritical. People saying that are hypocritical or trying to distract our attention from the issues.\n\nThis idea of attacking the person rather than focusing on the issues is a stratagem that won’t work . 2027 is going to be a referendum on the performance of the APC government under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. It isn’t going to be about profiling individuals. It is going to be about whether you have put food on the tables or make the lives of Nigerians better than it was before you took over power. It is going to be about you promising 24 hours electricity and swearing that we shouldn’t vote for you again if you weren’t able to deliver. It is going to be about whether Nigerians are safer today than they were before you came on board. As I speak to you today, every single day till the first quarter of 2025, 30 Nigerians are killed every single day, by bandits and criminals– in one quarter alone, 3,500 Nigerians have been killed . The reports are there. Those are the questions. The people can no longer sleep in their homes in Zamfara. These are issues that will determine whether Nigerians will vote for them or not.\n\nNow, be that as it may, what is ADC going to offer? We are offering alternatives. If Nigerians arrive at 2027, and they look at APC and they say, “oh this government has failed us,” they should have alternatives. It is dangerous when people don’t have options. When you leave people with no options, you leave them with no choice . People can say, I am happy with the performance of APC government and I want to vote for them again. Good. But when they say, we aren’t happy, they should find alternatives and that credible alternative is what ADC represents. In the coming weeks, we are going to roll out our plans for governance, our own agenda for governance. We are going to roll it out to Nigerians and let them make their choice.\n\nWhere will the ADC be picking its presidential candidate in 2027?\n\nI have told you earlier, ADC isn’t having that conversation now. The party is focused on issues that matter to Nigerians. It is the elite that are having conversation about where the President will come from. The man from Kano doesn’t buy fuel from a fuelling station different from the man from Umuahia, it is the same poverty that afflicts the man from Ilorin that afflicts the man from Damaturu. So, Nigerians want people who can solve their problems. ADC is committed. You see, this issue of where the President will come from is a recent development in Nigeria. We are old enough to know that even as recent as 1999, at the turn of this republic were there conversation about where the President will come from? Nobody cares. . The weaponisation of regions, of religion, of ethnicity, is a recent affliction of Nigerian politics that this APC government has taken to a new level. I listened to one of them few days ago, describing Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as an 80 year old Muslim Northerner! And they aren’t ashamed to say that. In a civilised society, that person will be arrested, will be sanctioned for profiling and individual. You see, the APC, their rhetoric is an affliction on Nigeria, they no longer have boundaries. They say anything!\n\nIn the second republic, who cared for the candidate of the UPN. You knew if you voted UPN, you will get free education; it was only the party people who cared who the candidate will be. The issue of the candidate of the party is the internal decision of the political party. After Biden had that disastrous debate with Trump, the Democratic party elite said now, we can’t contest with this man and they brought Kamala Harris. So, it is an internal arrangement of a party. If you field the wrong candidate, the people will punish you. If you want to win elections, you field the right candidate. So, when does the issue of where a party zones its presidential candidate become a issue of national referendum? If you aren’t a member of our party what is your business with where we pick our candidate? That’s a reflection of where Nigerian politics is today and how far it has degenerated. The APC people are doing everything to turn this election of 2027 into issues of regionalism, about ethnicity, about what religion you speak.\n\nLet me ask you this hypocritical question: what if a northerner emerges as your presidential candidate and the average southerner say, the ADC is about to short change us?\n\nIt is our problem! Don’t you get?!! It is our problem to fix!!!. You said it is hypothetical, right? It is our problem, it is our problem to now convince Nigerians, why they should vote for us, inspite of that choice that we have made. Don’t you see? Why are they taking panadol over another person’s headache?\n\nThere was a report recently that the Labour Party former presidential candidate, Peter Obi, dropped a hint last week that the PDP has opened discussions with him. Do you really think he is sincere about joining the ADC?\n\nOn a personal note, I like to take people for their words. If you tell me anything, it is what you tell me I will hold on to. Just like I will want you to hold on to whatever I say.\n\nPeter Obi hasn’t told us anything other than what he told us the last meeting he attended. That he is part of the Coalition, and that the leadership should give him time to go and fight his election in Anambra. That once it is done, he is back. That was why at the unveiling you saw him sitting at the high table with other leaders.\n\nI believe that if his position has changed, he will come back and tell us his position has changed. As I speak to you, he hasn’t come back. So, we aren’t disturbed in any way. We believe Peter Obi is a man of honour and that if he is going to do anything other than what he has told us he will do, he will have the courage to come back and tell us. Any other thing, we aren’t going to pay attention to it.\n\nYou mean the party isn’t taken aback by the report that he has opened discussions with PDP?\n\nHas he told us? What I am saying is that anybody can talk to anybody. But if he comes back to us as party leaders to say see oh, what I told you the last time, my position has changed. Has he told us that? The answer is no. So, we will wait for Peter Obi to come and tell us that he is no longer part of the ADC. But he hasn’t done that and we are confident that he is solidly part of this Coalition; his nominees are in the hierarchy of this party, the leadership of the party. So, we aren’t bothered. You see, PDP is PDP. They are looking for a poster boy to repair their battered image . In the order of opposition ranking, I saw a poll, do you know that LP ranked higher than PDP? PDP is now number four in the order of ranking ahead of NNPP. So why should we be bothered? Peter Obi knows the virus that has afflicted PDP has no cure.\n\nCould it be that he has weighed his chances in ADC? That he has no chance of picking your party ticket?\n\nI don’t think there is anything in ADC that would put him in a position to be afraid because the national chairman has said we are committed to one thing: building a party that will promote internal democracy. We aren’t desperate for power in 2027, our mission is to save this country from the trajectory it is heading. So we aren’t going to start undermining our own rules to force anybody and that’s why I said we aren’t having that conversation of presidential ticket now.\n\nTo those with perception that Atiku remains the candidate to beat in ADC, what are you doing to inspire confidence that there will be a level playing field at the presidential convention?\n\nWhat do they mean by he is the candidate to beat? Does it mean that he is the candidate designate? Yes, I have hears that before. How did they arrive at that conclusion? You know that the National Organising Secretary conducts internal elections in the party. Do you know who nominated the National Organising Secretary of the ADC? It is Peter Obi. Is that the move of a party that is predetermined or prejudiced against someone? So why will you give the most important influence or consequence for conducting party primaries in the hands of someone that you have decided wouldn’t be your candidate? So, all these is just talk.\n\nIt was a merger, orchestrated by the North that coalesced to form APC to dislodge Jonathan and the PDP. Ten years after, the region is at it again, against another sitting president from the South. To those with the refrain that Tinubu isn’t Jonathan, how formidable is the ADC?\n\nWhat you saw in 2015 is different from what is happening today. In 2015, when the APC merger was formed, did anybody care who the presidential candidate was? Was there conversation that it must be a Northerner? APC didn’t come talking about, our candidate must be a Northerner. \n\nThey did their internal calculation and convinced themselves that it was President Buhari that was best suited to contest that election and what happened? Because Nigerians were unified behind the message of change, the mood in the country at that time was that Jonathan must go—–whether it is in Calabar or in Anambra or in Oyo, in Kano, the mood was the same. Nigerians felt they have seen the worst. That Jonathan was bad. That was what they thought. Now, they know better.\n\nThey promised the country change and Nigerians believed in message of change and like you pointed out, ten years after, here we are.\n\nCan anybody, those of us who were part of it then, looked back today and say when we were shouting change in 2014, this is what we had in mind? Was this what we had in mind?\n\nThe APC formation at that time was a political strategy to take power by a particular section of the political elite who felt that the best way they could come to power is to bring themselves together and formed a merger as opposition party.\n\nBy the way, people who say Tinubu isn’t Jonathan are telling us something. They are telling us that if Jonathan had been as vicious, and as committed to destroy the opposition as this ruling party of APC is now, APC wouldn’t have come to power in 2015. If Jonathan hadn’t provided the liberal political atmosphere for APC to do, whatever they wanted to do at that time, APC wouldn’t have come to power . But Jonathan being the kind of person he is, who believe in democracy, who wasn’t desperate to cling on to power, who put the interest of Nigerians first, allowed the opposition to thrive . He faced the challenge they brought. He lost. And what did he do? He left power to them. But it is quite a grand irony of history that the very beneficiary of the liberal political atmosphere that Jonthan provided are the ones emasculating opposition today, are the ones who don’t want any opposition party to survive.\n\nTo go back to our point, I said APC was a product of a political strategy. ADC is a product of a political necessity. What has brought ADC together was the very existential threat that opposition parties are facing in the hands of the ruling party.","summary":"Tribune Online\n\nObi hasn’t told us he has dumped ADC for PDP —Bolaji Abdullahi\n\n\n Former Minister of Sports and Youth Development, erstwhile National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, is the incumbent National Publicity Secretary of the African Democratic Congress.

Discovery, and Fox Corp., but newer ones from the streaming and tech space, such as Netflix, Amazon’s Prime Video, and Apple.\n\nOne area within the company that will undoubtedly receive a lot of attention is CBS News, which became a focus of the merger approval process, and several questions remain about the organization.\n\nIn late 2024, the revered news organization, home of Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, CBS Sunday Morning, and 60 Minutes, came under the crosshairs of the then-Donald Trump campaign, which accused the network of “deceitful” editing during a 60 Minutes interview with former vice president and then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nOnce in office, the Trump administration continued with its scrutiny of the news outlet. And with the merger potentially hanging in the balance, the situation created pressure for Shari Redstone, the former non-executive chairwoman of Paramount Global, who reportedly sought to make settling the case a top priority. \n\nIn July, a $16 million settlement was reached, with the majority of the funds going towards Trump’s future presidential library. This agreement was similar to how ABC News settled a lawsuit with the president for $15 million in December 2024.\n\nAs part of the settlement, CBS News issued no statement of apology or regret for the 60 Minutes interview with Harris.\n\nHowever, the process of reaching that settlement came with enormous costs, with two key 60 Minutes executives, Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS News and Stations, and CBS Media Ventures, and Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes, departing.\n\nThe settlement, the departures of senior leadership, and the news that Skydance Media will install an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias or other concerns” and ensure “viewpoint diversity” at CBS News as part of the merger’s FCC approval process, have created uncertainty around what the news organization looks like moving forward.\n\nWhat happens now\n\nThus far, the new Paramount CEO has publicly given support to CBS News.\n\nEllison, alongside George Cheeks, who was named chair of TV Media of the combined company, reportedly toured the CBS News headquarters last Thursday morning, with Puck’s Dylan Byers writing that the Paramount CEO told staffers, “I believe in the legacy of CBS News and being in the trust business and the truth business.”\n\nPrior to the visit, Ellison also shared a companywide letter acknowledging the conclusion of the merger process. In it, he described CBS News as “home to one of the most storied American broadcast journalism legacies in America, including 60 Minutes, with a long tradition of impactful reporting led by seasoned journalists committed to accuracy, integrity, and public trust.” \n\nEllison also recognized the trying times CBS News faced during the merger process, saying it had been “a challenging period and we’re deeply grateful for your resilience, professionalism, and unwavering commitment to the news business.” \n\nHe went on to say the company is proud of the news organization while looking “forward to continuing to foster a newsroom culture where journalists are empowered, trusted, and equipped to do their best work.”\n\nWhen asked about CBS News’ future under Skydance, a rep for CBS News referred TVNewser to Ellison’s letter.\n\nStill, time will tell how the merger impacts the news organization. Reports suggest that former CBS News head David Rhodes may return, and there is a potential purchase of Bari Weiss‘s The Free Press on the horizon, but neither has come to fruition as of now.\n\nAdditionally, aside from the merger, CBS News has been undergoing several changes recently.\n\nIts relaunched evening news franchise, CBS Evening News, is still trying to find its footing, as it remains the No. 3 newscast in the ratings. Meanwhile, as a result of cost-cutting measures, CBS Mornings, which is still in third place in the morning show battles, is moving out of its Times Square studios back to the CBS Broadcast Center, its original home.\n\nPlus, 60 Minutes is under the guidance of a new leader, Tanya Simon, and how the franchise and its talent operate moving forward is still unfolding.\n\nUltimately, much about how CBS News will operate under Skydance Media remains to be determined. But if Skydance wants the organization to succeed, figuring it out should be … well … paramount.","summary":"What&#39;s CBS News Future Under Skydance

Soros, contribute $20M to groups funding protests against Trump’s DC crime crackdown ","text":"Several lefty, dark money organizations, including George Soros’, contributed more than $20 million to groups funding protests against President Trump’s crime crackdown in Washington, DC. \n\nFree DC, a “fiscally sponsored special project” of progressive nonprofits Community Change and Community Change Action, brought 150 demonstrators near the White House Monday to protest Trump’s plan to deploy National Guard troops in the district and federalize the city’s police department. \n\n“Do not obey in advance” and “Take up space” are among Free DC’s “guiding principles,” and the group urges supporters to “go outside at 8:00 PM and bang pots and pans, sing, chant, or make noise for five minutes” every night “of this occupation.” \n\nFree DC has scheduled multiple events since Monday’s anti-Trump protest, including a “Cop Watch Training,” suggesting further protests are planned amid Trump’s effort to make DC the “safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world” – by ramping up law enforcement efforts and removing homeless encampments from public places. \n\nCommunity Change and Community Change Action, the groups bankrolling Free DC’s activism campaign, have been the beneficiaries of millions of dollars in donations from hedge-fund tycoon George Soros’ Open Society Foundations and Tides Foundation, and the dark-money Arabella Advisors network, according to an analysis shared with The Post.\n\n“It is ironic that a protest to ostensibly ‘Free DC’ was hosted by Community Change, a group funded by massive amounts of outside dark money to push a pro-crime agenda,” Caitlin Sutherland, the executive director of nonprofit watchdog Americans for Public Trust, said in a statement. \n\n“DC is facing shootings, carjackings, and assaults, and yet progressive groups like The Pritzker Foundation, George Soros, and the Arabella Network all spend millions of dollars to manufacture protests that weaken our communities,” Sutherland added. \n\nIn 2023 alone, Community Change and Community Change Action received $4 million from Soros’ Open Society Foundations, $680,000 from the Arabella network, and $145,000 from the Tides Foundation, Americans for Public Trust found in publicly available financial disclosures. \n\nArabella Advisors, a Washington, DC-based consulting firm, manages several funds that finance left-wing groups, including the Sixteen Thirty Fund, Windward Fund, New Venture Fund, which have all given money to Community Change and Community Change Action since 2020. \n\nSimilarly, Soros’ Open Society Foundations and Tides Foundation and Tides Advocacy (part of the billionaires’ Tides Network) are far-left grantmaking organizations. \n\nBetween 2020-2023, Community Change and Community Change Action received $12.6 million from Open Society Foundation, $5.6 million from the Arabella network, and $1.9 million from the Tides network – under numerous grants labeled for such purposes as “civil rights, social action, advocacy” and “social welfare activities.” \n\nAdditionally, Community Change received $1 million across 2021 and 2022 from Future Forward USA Action, a Democratic Party-aligned super PAC affiliated with Future Forward PAC – one of the major political groups that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. \n\nIt’s unclear how much of this money has been directly used by Free DC, which says on its website it began organizing in 2023, in response to a congressional effort to block a controversial update to DC’s criminal code. \n\nFree DC and Community Change did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.","summary":"Free DC, a “fiscally sponsored special

that, as a Black woman, she doesn't believe more officers make communities safer—particularly in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Sanders-Townsend, who served as chief spokesperson and senior adviser to former Vice President Kamala Harris before joining MSNBC in 2022, spoke on President Donald Trump’s new initiative to stop crime in the nation’s capital. Trump announced Monday that he plans to deploy approximately 800 National Guard troops and assume oversight of the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle rising crime in Washington, D.C. The announcement caused shockwaves across media, but some, like MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, hinted that there may be some truth to Trump saying there is a crisis. \"There has been a problem in D.C. It’s not as bad as it was 2 or 3 years ago, but it’s not as safe as Manhattan. It’s not as safe as the nation’s capital should be. By the way, I’ve lived in D.C. for 32 years. I can go chapter and verse if you’d like me to,\" Scarborough said. CNN PANEL KNOCKS NATIONAL DEMOCRATS ON 'TONE-DEAF' RESPONSE TO TRUMP DC CRIME PLAN Sanders-Townsend appeared openly shocked at Scarborough’s words and pushed back, citing her experience as having lived in D.C. for the last 10 years and her husband running the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington. \"It is perceived violence amplified by some actual real acts of violence,\" she said before adding, \"the way I’ve heard D.C. being described this morning is like it’s a city under siege, like it’s a dangerous place, clutching your pearls, you’ve got to keep your bag under your dress when you leave the house. And that’s just not true.\" She said that the conversation is revolving around these instances of \"juvenile crime\" that Trump is using as a pretext for his \"authoritatrain overreach.\" Sanders-Townsend argued there is just barely enough real crime to make people think that Trump may have some legitimate reason to take such action, but all the while, people are \"ignoring the fact that more police officers on the street are not going to fix the issue of juvenile crime.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Scarborough urged her to clarify, asking, \"You don’t think more police make streets safer?\" \"No, Joe. I’m a Black woman in America,\" she said. \"I do not always think that more police make streets safer.

In July, the deal was approved by the Trump administration.\n\nIn Jobrani's mind, the axing of Colbert's show is no coincidence.\n\n\"I love Colbert — I get my news from Colbert — he makes the news fun,\" he told ABC News in a Melbourne interview last month, after landing from Los Angeles for the start of his latest Australian tour.\n\nThe tour across six Australian cities ended on Sunday, but Jobrani's been coming to Australia since 2008.\n\nHe says Melbourne, as home of the annual International Comedy Festival, has \"good comedy audiences\".\n\nColbert has vowed to continue speaking \"unvarnished truth to power\" and sharing \"what I really think about Donald Trump\".\n\nJobrani, who also regularly speaks out against Trump in his comedy skits — most commonly against the administration's deportation policies — says he intends to do the same.\n\n\"I thought Trump would maybe send the IRS out to audit them or something, just make their lives hard, because Trump unfortunately does not have a sense of humour, he doesn't know how to take a joke, which is what dictatorships usually are like.\"\n\nThe job of the comedian\n\nSince CBS announced the axing in June, there's been much talk in the US entertainment and media industry about how far the Trump administration might go in censoring free speech.\n\nJobrani has united with some of the biggest names in entertainment and late-night television to show support for Colbert, and to fight for free speech.\n\n\"The job of the comedian is to reveal the emperor has no clothes. I think we need to keep doing that — if we don't, we're going to lose our democracy,\" he said.\n\nJobrani has called on others in comedy and the wider entertainment and media industry to stand their ground.\n\n\"I always say the whole point of America is, I can make fun of the president in America. I couldn't make fun of the president of Iran, that wouldn't work,\" he said.\n\nJobrani's family left Iran for the US in 1978, when he was six years old.\n\nIt was just a year before Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fell to Islamist rulers, and his family, like many others at the time, made the decision to flee.\n\nIn our interview, he talks of how growing up as an Iranian in California at that time was a struggle.\n\nBut he says it framed the backdrop to much of his comedy, which focuses on the weird and often hilarious events that occur as a child of immigrants.\n\nWhile his parents hoped the UC Berkeley graduate would become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer, he had other plans.\n\nAnd now he's among several Iranian Americans showcasing Iranian culture on stages around the world, and making audiences laugh with Iranians, instead of at them.\n\nThis was something Jobrani never envisaged back in November 1979 — when 52 Americans were taken hostage in the US Embassy in Tehran and held for 444 days.\n\n\"[Being Iranian] has been a challenge, but it also obviously is giving me plenty of material because I have been able to try and present people from Iran and other people from that part of the world, hopefully in a positive light versus what you see when they show us in the news.\"\n\nA path for Iranian American entertainers\n\nJobrani's career took off in the post 9/11 era.\n\nHe had first toured with other \"brown comedians\", including Ahmed Ahmed, Aron Kader and Sam Tripoli, on a show called the Arabian Nights, which was aimed at showcasing the voice of Muslim/Middle Eastern people a year before 9/11 happened.\n\nBut as they toured under that name, they decided to change the title.\n\nAt that time, then-US president George Bush had called Iran, Iraq, and North Korea an \"Axis of Evil\".\n\nSo the trio settled on \"Axis of Evil Comedy Tour\" as the show's name.\n\nSince then, Jobrani has gained worldwide fame and in many ways paved the way for a new generation of comedians from Iranian backgrounds to make it to the world stage.\n\nOn his Australian tour, Jobrani was joined by another rising star, Iranian African American comedian Tehran Ghasri.\n\n\"Comedy is part of the Iranian heritage,\" Ghasri tells ABC News.\n\nJobrani says when he started out, being a comedian was frowned upon by the Iranian diaspora, including his parents.\n\nHe says he was an anomaly when he first started.\n\n\"Now 20-some-odd years later, there's Tehran and there's Max Amini, and there's Amir K … there's Melissa Shoshahi, and there's Peter the Persian, and there's Omid Djalili — and it really does make me happy to see all of these people in this business now.\n\n\"Once the next generations realise, 'Oh, you can make a living doing other things' or you should live your life doing what makes you happy, they start doing it.\n\n\"It's really something that's just great for our community … because until we're telling the stories, no-one's going to tell our stories the way we want to tell them. They're just going to keep making us the bad guy.\"\n\nComedy can 'humanise'\n\nIn recent years Jobrani's played a prominent role in diaspora activism against the Islamic Republic, particularly in the aftermath of the #Women, Life, Freedom protests spurred by the death in custody of Mahsa Jina Amini.\n\n\"I grew up in America, so I always say that I'm not in Iran, but Iran is in me. I feel an affinity towards the country of Iran. I feel an affinity towards the soccer team when they play,\" he said.\n\nJobrani says the various waves of massive protests inside Iran, the recent Israel–Iran war, and people's suffering under Iran's regime is \"heartbreaking\".\n\nHe points to the forced veiling of women, \"discrimination against women, the discrimination against the LGBTQ community, the discrimination against religious minorities like the Baha'i's and others\" as examples of that.\n\n\"I do feel that I want to support the people of Iran, and I do pray and hope for a day where Iran can become a functioning part of the world.\"\n\nJobrani fears Trump's America is becoming more like Iran's repressive regime.\n\nHe says comedy can be a unifying force and a way to fight rising antisemitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"I think that there's people out there that are waiting to pounce\" he said.\n\n\"Hate and hatred, it's easier to go that way and I think that comedy can counter that.\n\n\"Like when I do a show, I have people from all backgrounds, all religions in the room, we're laughing together and we're humanising each other. What war does is it dehumanises.\n\n\"You get a room where you have a Palestinian, and you have a Jew, and you have a Muslim — people from different backgrounds and we're laughing together — then people realise, 'Oh, he's human.

It’s terrible here,” Splendora said during an interview near her residence on Thomas Circle, just two blocks from the scene of a fatal shooting that took place Monday night. \n\nSplendora added that she’d witnessed groups of teenagers stealing from a nearby CVS more than once, though she said she herself was not targeted.\n\n“Security doesn’t do anything because they’re in a big group, and then they go cursing and being rude to the people in the stores,” she said. “They think they can do whatever they want because they feel like they’re in control of the situation, and they just run off. No one is going to say something.”\n\nSplendora no longer goes out at night out of fear, and cited comments from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledging that more law enforcement presence in local neighborhoods may be positive in fighting crime.\n\nBut Splendora is likely in the minority of local opinion.\n\nShashank Bharadwaj, who also lives near Thomas Circle, doesn’t feel the takeover is needed. \n\n“I’m worried about it encroaching on D.C.,” Bharadwaj said while walking his dog. “There’s no reason for their presence. Crime rates are down, so I don’t see any good reason to justify it.”\n\nBharadwaj hopes the deployment is as short as possible and said he does feel safe walking city streets. \n\n“That’s the problem with D.C., right?” said Bharadwaj, who has lived in Washington since 2022. “We don’t really have representation at the federal level, so there’s only so much [the city council] can do. It seems like Trump is allowed to just nationalize or federalize the city and take over the police department.”\n\nNew OPM director takes gentler approach to streamlining the federal bureaucracy\n\nA third D.C. local, Axol Campo, also opposes the move, though in far stronger terms.\n\n“I’m a non-binary person that is a D.C. resident,” Campo said. “I also have a last name that’s not traditionally white, so if I get stopped in the wrong area, I could get sent off to a concentration camp or sent to another country or disappeared.”\n\nCampo, who lives in the northern part of the city, described the deployment as a “complete fascist overreach” and was concerned because, “I don’t know where these Gestapo are going to pop up.”\n\nFor Campo, who has lived in Washington for 10 years, a lack of police on the streets beats the threat of a militarized force, and the plans to remove homeless people from the streets are also a concern.\n\n“I feel safe when there are unhoused people, because where the f*** are they going to go?” Campo said. As for Mayor Bowser, Campo wishes she would be much more aggressive in her interactions with the president and Washington’s police force. \n\n“Stand the f*** up,” Campo said. “She, for years, has been offering bigger bonuses to police, while choosing not to fund things that would actually support the community.”\n\nCampo declined to be photographed, citing safety concerns.","summary":"Washington D.C. residents are preparing for a federal takeover of local law enforcement as National Guard troops made their way to the District Tuesday morning.

Trump’s assault on free-market capitalism","text":"Unlike any leader of any free-market economy around the world, President Trump has seized control of private enterprise’s strategic decision-making and investment policies while invading corporate board rooms so that he may dictate leadership staffing, punish corporate critics, and demand public compliance with his political agenda. This is far more dangerous to capitalism than a city-run grocery store.\n\nMany free-market economists and business leaders who have long worshipped the free-market ideals of Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Ayn Rand, and Milton Friedman should be aware that their idols would be rolling in their graves right now, as rather than pursue standard laissez-faire conservative economic policies, MAGA has gone Marxist and even, increasingly, Maoist.\n\nAs Greg Ip warned this week in The Wall Street Journal, “The US marches toward state capitalism with American characteristics … President Trump is imitating [the] Chinese Communist Party by extending political control ever deeper into the economy.” Ip pointed out that in the past, crisis-driven government bailouts of the banking and automotive sectors, such as TARP, were acute, targeted assistance, with brief and bipartisan rescue aims. Similarly, government incentives to drive investments in chips manufacturing, oil exploration, space exploration, internet development, agricultural vitality, cancer detection, disease treatment, and clean energy were not ownership deals with preferred companies or corporate cronies. \n\nIndeed, Ip’s warnings mirror our own, as we were the first to accurately, presciently warn—over a year ago—that many of Trump’s economic positions more closely resemble communism than capitalism, as part of what we called “the coming MAGA assault on capitalism.” It certainly looks like MAGA is going Marxist if not even Maoist, especially across Trump’s vicious personal targeting of individual business leaders; government crackdown on business freedom of expression; weaponization of government powers; apparent extortion of businesses; and insertion of government into an unprecedented, outsized role in private sector strategic investment, capital flows and business decision-making.\n\nMarxism and Maoism were both, of course, expressions of the communist theory that spilled forth from Karl Marx’s pen in the 19th century, brought to life in the brutal one-party states of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China under its leader Mao Zedong, before it evolved into “capitalism with Chinese characteristics” starting in the 1970s, around the time of President Richard Nixon’s fateful visit to Beijing. \n\nBoth Marxism and Maoism claimed to champion “ordinary people” against corrupt or exploitative elites, while both targeted intellectuals, bureaucrats, and traditionalists, and purged institutions to enforce ideological purity, especially during Stalin’s “Great Terror” and Mao’s “Cultural Revolution.” Both centralized leadership to the point of creating a cult of personality, demanding intense loyalty and the glorification of the sole figure who could fix the country’s problems. Both prized loyalty over expertise, sidelining critics and dissenters in favor of a tightly controlled political narrative. Sound familiar?\n\nThe essence of market capitalism is that owners—shareholders and the management they appoint share in the profits. These deals give share of profits to government in return for favors. Friedman said that federal government should never own anything—that it should not run a surplus because it would have funds to invest in the private sector. What strategic decision-making rights would the government have in such deals, then?\n\nAssaults targeting individual business leaders\n\nTrump has a long history of targeting individual CEOs in highly vicious, personal terms for perceived offenses. This week, Trump called for the firing of Goldman Sachs’ renowned economist Jan Hatzius who accurately called the 2008 financial crisis over the economist’s concern regarding the tariff overhand on the US economy. He also attacked a top-performing financier, David Solomon, the non-partisan CEO of Goldman Sachs, telling him to quit and just be a disk jockey. (Solomon has a famous side hustle as an electronic dance music DJ, known as DJ D-Sol.)\n\nJust last week, many semiconductor industry observers expressed tremendous discomfort with Trump’s attacks on Lip-Bu Tan, the CEO of Intel, and Trump’s calls for his immediate recognition. Even those who are genuinely concerned by Tan’s documented history of CCP ties and his continuing investments in China, would have preferred that Trump express his views in a more subtle fashion which recognizes the widespread entanglements of the Chinese Communist Party in the largest Chinese businesses. Roughly one-third of the Chinese economy is controlled by CCP-owned enterprises with actual CCP monitors in their boardrooms. Instead of calling this out, the Trump administration appears to want to match such corporate oversight itself.\n\nVirtually any CEO doing business in China works with companies and schools that have ties to People’s Liberation Army of China, given China’s own authoritarian command economy. There has been great concern that such prominent Chinese businesses as Huawei, Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), China Telecom, China Mobile, and Hikvision have close ties to the PLA. Many state-owned enterprises with which most western enterprises do business even have militias with ties to the PLA. While this is concerning across political parties, how can President Trump justifying singling out Intel alone?\n\nTrump has similarly publicly called out and humiliated leading CEOs ranging from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan to Brian Moynihan of Bank of America to Doug McMillon of Walmart to Tim Cook of Apple to Matt Levatich of Harley-Davidson, among many others, when they speak the truth about issues ranging from trade policies to HR practices to diplomacy to environmental sustainability. \n\nThe unwarranted attack on Brian Moynihan and Bank of America—that they previously denied him as a customer—was particularly alarming as President Trump’s four bankruptcies were reasonable concerns when major banks were approached about lending to him. Bewilderingly, Deutsche Bank’s private wealth unit loaned Trump $48 million—following his default on a $640 million loan from Deutsche Bank’s commercial unit. Now regulators are being told by the Trump Administration to withdraw reputation risk as criteria for reviewing prudent banking practices.\n\nSuppressing business freedom of expression in favor of political obedience\n\nThe political right used to complain about the “political correctness of the left.” Similarly, Trump’s history of cracking down on businesses for exercising their freedom of expression resembles the purges of Maoist China far more than American democratic norms.\n\nFor example, when Merck CEO Ken Frazier resigned from Trump’s Manufacturing Councils in protest over Trump’s infamous response to the Charlottesville rally, claiming there were “fine people” on both sides, Trump lashed out at Frazier, mocking him by saying he’d now have “more time to lower ripoff drug prices”. Similarly, Trump has repeatedly attacked Jeff Bezos, claiming that Amazon was “stealing” from the US Postal Service in the aftermath of critical coverage by the Bezos-owned Washington Post.\n\nTrump FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson has publicly challenged woke ideology as a part of his antitrust remit, arguing that “In 2020, if you had a view on masks that was inconsistent with how big tech felt about masks, you weren’t allowed to talk about it. If you had a view on vaccines, couldn’t talk about it. But it wasn’t just big tech censorship. That was a huge problem. Consumers couldn’t go into a store without having political messages pushed in their face. And I’m sitting in 2020 working in the Senate going, gosh, if companies feel like they can alienate half their consumer base without suffering any real competitive consequences, we probably have a competition problem.”\n\nSimilarly, Trump FCC Chair Brendan Carr has argued that he would use DEI as a basis to block mergers, declaring that “if there are businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don’t see a path forward where the FCC could reach the conclusion that approving the transaction is going to be in the public interest.”\n\nAccordingly, to complete it acquisition of Paramount/CBS, David Ellison’s Skydance had to ensure review of its news reporting “to address bias and restore fact-based reporting” with a bias monitor as well as racial hiring practices which met the FCC’s standards under Carr.\n\nSeizing control of strategic investment and private enterprise decision-making\n\nAkin to Mao Zedong directing business decisions as a part of his wildly disastrous Great Leap Forward central economic planning initiative, Trump has plunged the US government headfirst into an unprecedented active role in directing private business decision-making and capital flows. Last month, he ordered Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey to replace cane sugar with other sweeteners that the firm uses, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting such a move and despite the fact that the CEO of Coca-Cola is accountable to his board and shareholders, not Donald Trump.\n\nThis even extends to the US government directly receiving equity stakes, golden shares, and royalties from business revenues, sometimes as a part of complicated negotiations with the US government and giving off the appearance, whether warranted or not, of drug deals. For example, leading chipmakers Nvidia and AMD were just forced to surrender 15% of the revenue flows from their sales to China to the U.S. government, apparently as a concession to be able to continue selling in that market.\n\nSimilarly, as a precondition to approving the dangerous takeover of US Steel by the Japanese, Trump extracted a “golden share” for the U.S. government with effective veto power over certain corporate decisions. Likewise, in his first term, Trump attacked Harley-Davidson for supposedly moving factories overseas when in reality 100% of its beloved motorcycles sold in the U.S. are actually made in the U.S. Out of sheer political spite, Trump proclaimed that American bikers should buy from Harley’s foreign competitors, ranting that Harley had “surrendered” and “betrayed” America while threatening “they will be taxed like never before.”\n\nLikewise, Trump wrongly accused Ford of robbing Detroit of jobs when it relocated an engine plant from Europe to Mexico, fortifying its North American supply chain. When one of us personally corrected Trump on that, he replied, “I don’t care, it’s working.” At the same time, the home appliances firm Carrier had a parallel experience with Trump-bashing them, despite being located in Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana.\n\nPolitical weaponization of government powers \n\nTrump targeted AT&T with a drawn-out antitrust suit as well as numerous personal taunts when it tried to merge with Time Warner, hoping to pressure CNN to become more friendly in its coverage. In stark contrast, Trump pal Rupert Murdoch received the white-gloves treatment through antitrust when he sold 21st Century Fox at around the same time, despite arguably more genuine antitrust concerns. \n\nIn fact, Trump antitrust chief Makan Delrahim expressed support for the AT&T-Time Warner combination as an academic but flipped 180 degrees to appease Trump once in office, holding up the deal for two years. Likewise, before his first term ran out, Trump personally drove a proposed deal that would have secured TikTok for his longtime supporter and friend Larry Ellison at Oracle, unusually inserting himself into every detail of the negotiation process.\n\nThe appearance of extortion and bribery\n\nAs prominent media commentators such as Oliver Darcy and Matt Belloni point out, some of Trump’s demands resemble extortion. There was the payment of $16 million to the Trump Presidential Library from CBS News’ 60 Minutes over the standard editing of an interview with Kamala Harris last summer. This occurred over the objections of its executive producer (who resigned in protest), and while FCC approval was pending of Paramount’s acquisition by Skydance.\n\nThis was followed by the cancellation of the modern “King of Comedy,” Stephen Colbert, whose revered late show suddenly had its deal abruptly canceled on the eve of Trump’s FCC merger approval, seemingly over its satirical criticism of the Trump administration. The explanation that the show was too expensive and lost money raised many eyebrows, particularly given the lack of attempts to trim the 200-person production staff.\n\nSimilar lawsuits initiated by Trump in office against private businesses give off a similar appearance of extortion and bribery, whether justified or not. These include Trump’s $100 million lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for reporting about a letter Trump wrote to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday; and Disney/ABC’s $15 million payment to the Trump Presidential Library to settle defamation claims against George Stephanopoulos.\n\nAcross each of these five dimensions, one can’t help but think MAGA is going Marxist or full Maoist. Adam Smith’s salute to the “invisible hand” of free markets in favor of the fist of government appears to be losing out in the Trump administration. as these unprecedented policies with no parallel in American history share much more in common with Karl Marx and Mao Zedong than Adam Smith and Ayn Rand. Many now wonder why the Business Roundtable remains missing in action, insulating itself with turgid knowledge, subtracting white papers and passive forums, piously genuflecting to President Trump’s assaults on free-market capitalism that make New York’s Mamdani look like John D. Rockefeller.\n\nThe Marxist-style oppression of free enterprise was echoed in assaults on the nation’s top law firms and universities through authoritarian blitzkriegs to suppress constitutionally protected American ideals of freedom of expression, a cornerstone of capitalism. Harvard University, like 60 other universities, has been threatened with a cutoff of foreign-born students and vital federal research funds under the false pretext of antisemitism, despite the Anti-Defamation League giving Harvard passing grades on its tests for antisemitism. Paul Weiss is one of many major law firms that the Trump administration threatened with having its security clearance and federal building access denied, merely by offering to represent independent citizen voices attacked by Trump for noncompliance with his thought police and MAGA political correctness. We have spoken in admiration of the hundreds of universities and law firms that have now unified to stop these totalitarian White House edicts. The legal and academic community remembered what the Business Roundtable and genuine traditional economic conservatives have forgotten, which was Benjamin Franklin’s admonition that “we must all hang together or surely we will hang separately.”\n\nThe authors would like to thank Steven Tian and Stephen Henriques from the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute for their research.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.","summary":"Many business leaders are horrified at the prospect of New York City turning socialist under Zohran Mamdani, but Trump's assaults on free-market capitalism make him look like John D.

Texas’ effort could move up to five U.S. House seats now controlled by Democrats into Republican hands.\n\nTo blunt those possible GOP gains in Texas, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has hinted Illinois might try to make his party’s dominance of the state’s 17-member congressional delegation even more lopsided through a new round of redistricting.\n\nHow or if that would happen remains to be seen. But given the way Illinois’ current map was drawn four years ago, eking out another Democratic district could be a tall order. Democrats hold a 14-3 majority in Illinois’ congressional delegation.\n\n“I don’t think anyone’s certain that it is [possible] at this point to add another Democratic district to the current map here,” said Ryan Tolley, executive director of CHANGE Illinois, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that has pushed for redistricting reform.\n\nDemocrats’ options with downstate districts now held by Republican U.S. Reps. Mary Miller and Mike Bost appear limited. They are generally not near any major, Democratic-rich urban areas, and Trump ran up 40 percentage point advantages in each over Democrat Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential election.\n\nThe third GOP district now occupied by U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood is still decidedly Republican but less one-sided. It skirts Democratic-friendly areas of Rockford, Peoria and Bloomington-Normal, and Trump’s advantage over Harris last year stood at about 23 percentage points.\n\nLast week, Pritzker did not rule out an effort to reconfigure those districts in response to Texas.\n\n“When Republican states are more often gerrymandering than Democratic states are, it seems like all bets are off,” the governor said. “We’ve got to consider all the options when they’re trying to take democracy away.”\n\nThe government reform group, Common Cause, gave Illinois’ last redistricting effort a failing grade, one notch below the D- it gave to Texas. The group faulted the congressional maps put into place by Illinois and six other states “due to egregious partisan and racial gerrymandering.”\n\nStill, Pritzker has accused Trump, in particular, of “cheating” with his open advocacy for Texas redoing its congressional boundaries to safeguard his power in Washington during next year’s midterm elections.\n\n“He knows he’s going to lose the Congress in 2026. That’s why he’s going to his allies and hoping that they can save him. And we’ve all got to stand up against this,” Pritzker said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “This is — it’s cheating. Donald Trump is a cheater. He cheats on his wives. He cheats at golf. And now he’s trying to cheat the American people out of their votes.”\n\nBut the window to do something in Springfield is narrow. Nominating petitions for the March 17, 2026, primary election already are circulating, and candidates begin filing their election paperwork with the state in late October.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told WBEZ she doesn’t think Pritzker has the political power to force it, noting Democratic supermajorities in the Legislature stymied a couple of his past legislative priorities.\n\n“If [Illinois House] Speaker [Emanuel Chris] Welch wants to do it, then it will be done,” she said of a possible redistricting effort.\n\nWelch’s office told WBEZ this week that it’s currently not on the table.\n\n“We have no[t] had any new conversations about new congressional maps in the House,” Welch spokesman Jon Maxson said.\n\nIf Pritzker and Illinois Democrats do answer Texas with a new round of redistricting aimed at Illinois Republicans, Tolley worries about the impact of a political tit-for-tat.\n\n“This fighting fire with fire? We’re just going to end up disenfranchising more and more people,” he said.\n\nAlex Degman is based in Springfield and covers Illinois government and politics for WBEZ.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2025/08/12/illinois-redistricting-jb-pritzker-texas-democrats-greg-abbott-remap","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/605ed62/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5187x3458+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F63%2F02f7ba894cf4a5e200e6a3f098e8%2Felect","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 22:16:37","author":"Alex Degman | Wbez,Dave McKinney | Wbez","authors":["Alex Degman | Wbez","Dave McKinney | Wbez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.508},{"id":350521006,"title":"Brown’s Reported Senate Run Leads to Shift in Ohio Race","text":"After weeks of speculation, former Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, is reportedly entering the race to run next year against Republican Sen. Jon Husted, who was appointed earlier this year to replace now Vice President JD Vance. Crystal Ball’s Larry Sabato already changed the state of the race from “Likely Republican” to “Lean Republican.”\n\nBrown was denied a fourth term when he was defeated by Sen. Bernie Moreno by 3.6 points last November. That flip helped Republicans regain control of the Senate.\n\nThe Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com “spoke with three Ohio labor leaders whom Brown has told directly of his decision to run for Senate, as well as other Ohio Democrats who have heard of Brown’s plans via members of his inner circle.”\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to Husted’s office for comment on the state of the race given the change from Crystal Ball. \n\nHusted’s political X account has reposted comments in support of his reelection from Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who serves as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as well as Sen. Eric Schmitt R-Mo. Both highlighted Brown’s loss from last year.\n\nWhoever wins next year’s U.S. Senate race in Ohio will be up for reelection in 2028, which is when Vance’s freshman term in the Senate would have ended. Moreno is up for reelection in 2030.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee also provided The Daily Signal with a statement: “Chuck Schumer and the Democrats are so desperate they’ve recycled a liberal loser,” said Nick Puglia, the committee’s regional press secretary. “Ohioans just rejected Sherrod Brown and they’ll do it again in 2026.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, reportedly met with Brown to encourage him to run to defeat Husted, with the former senator being seen as Democrats’ best hope. \n\nSenate Leadership Fund Chairman Cory Gardner also released a statement on Thursday. “Sherrod Brown has spent his entire career collecting a government paycheck, and now just eight months into retirement and after a date night with Chuck Schumer, he’s begging taxpayers for more,” said Gardner. “Ohioans firmly rejected Sherrod after he oversaw Biden’s disastrous inflation crisis as Banking Chairman, and they’ll gladly do it again. [The Senate Leadership Fund] stands strongly with Senator Husted and we look forward to seeing him re-elected.”\n\nA press release with Gardner’s statement also referenced examples of “Sherrod Brown’s Radical Record,” citing his positions on illegal immigration, transgender politics, race, and taxes.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity-Ohio likewise shared a statement about Brown’s reported run that focused on his record.\n\nAFP Ohio State Director Donovan O’Neil’s tied Brown to “the Biden/Harris Bidenomics playbook.” President Donald Trump beat former President Joe Biden in Ohio in 2020 and former Vice President Kamala Harris there in 2024, most recently winning the Buckeye State by 11.2 points.\n\nRepublican operative Jai Chabria explained why Crystal Ball changed the race to “Lean Republican,” telling The Daily Signal how Brown is “very capable” and an “institution in Ohio,” though he added that “people have lost faith” in the institution.\n\nChabria also spoke to how “there were tens of millions of dollars spent to define [Brown] as too liberal,” which he says “will continue to stick” and is “a brand [Brown’s] got to spend just to overcome in a state that’s moved red.”\n\nIt’s not merely what Brown has going against him, but what Husted has going for him. Chabria praised the current senator’s campaign as “very capable” and being a “tested campaign,” which he notes “makes it very challenging for Sherrod Brown.”\n\nChabria, a political advisor for Republican gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, also pointed to strength from the “top of the ticket” for 2026 as a plus for Husted.\n\nBrown was first elected as senator in 2006, when he defeated now Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, the incumbent at the time. Brown was comfortably reelected in 2012 and 2018 before Moreno beat him in the “Toss-Up” race. \n\nThe Daily Signal also reached out to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for comment.","summary":"After weeks of speculation, former Sen.
