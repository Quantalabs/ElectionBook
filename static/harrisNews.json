Now they’re doing the same thing for Renee Good — buzzing all their hair off because that somehow sticks it to the man.\n\n“These people are psychotic,” BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales says.\n\nAnd they’re also not the smartest. Sara plays a video of one woman participating in the head-shaving trend, dubbed “Shave for Renee,” except her social media caption reads: “We watched Renee Cook get brutally gunned down by ICE.”\n\n“This dumbass is shaving her own head over someone whose name she doesn’t even know,” Sara laughs.\n\nAnd to the people who are still perpetuating the narrative that Renee Good didn’t hit the ICE officer with her SUV, Sara corrects them: “He was actually struck by the vehicle and suffered internal bleeding to his torso, according to DHS.”\n\nA Fox News article confirms that Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Good, discovered in the hospital that he had internal bleeding — a stark contrast to Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey’s statement that Ross “walked away with a hip injury that he might as well have gotten from closing a refrigerator door with his hips.”\n\n“But please, keep shaving your heads so we know who all the Looney Tunes are. It’s actually a very good indicator,” Sara scoffs.\n\nTo see the head-shaving video protesting the death of “Renee Cook” and to hear more of Sara’s scathing commentary, watch the video below.\n\nWant more from Sara Gonzales?\n\nTo enjoy more of Sara's no-holds-barred takes on news and culture, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/shows/sara-gonzales-unfiltered/protesters-stand-with-renee-good-by-repeating-their-bizarre-ritual-from-trump-s-2024-victory","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=62815478&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C120","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 22:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":393326928,"title":"Harmeet Dhillon Is the DOJ&#8217;s Anti-Woke Crusader Behind the Refusal to Probe ICE Killing of Renee Good","text":"Welp. What appears to be an attempt to cover up a murder by the DOJ’s Civil Rights head is, unsurprisingly, just the tip of a very big anti-woke iceberg.\n\nAs we established earlier this week, Harmeet Dhillon sucks. After being hand-picked by Trump for the tongue-twisting position of U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division (CRT) and getting confirmed in a 52-45 vote in April, she has railed against “anti-white discrimination,” revised all of CRT’s mission statements, and, throughout it all, refused to shut up about how much she loves to “FAFO,” or, “fuck around and find out”—the latest maxim co-opted by Trump and his pals, previously reserved for cool kids and the chronically online.\n\nLast week, Dhillon refused to open an investigation into the death of Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent—despite her office’s key responsibility being to examine incidents where…a civilian is shot and killed by a law enforcement agent. Speaking to the Washington Post, Vanita Gupta, an Obama-era CRT official, called the decision “highly unusual.” Four top department officials have since resigned in protest.\n\nDo a quick Google search on Dhillon, and you’ll find a slew of monikers further reinforcing her right-wing prominence: the underrated vandal, a conservative firebrand; the MAGA Movement’s Lawyer. Speaking to Jezebel, Heidi Beirich, co-founder of Global Extremism, said she’s “radically unqualified to lead the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division.” But who exactly is the so-called MAGA darling—and how, exactly, did she slither her way up into the U.S. government? Let’s take a look.\n\nOff the bat, Dhillon has long called herself a “lawyer for the pro-life movement,” and has an extensive history of trying to roll back reproductive rights. She’s asserted that shield laws violate the U.S. Constitution; called trans-affirming care “global quackery”; and, once, attempted to file a defamation suit against Planned Parenthood. (That case was, hilariously, dismissed by the judge as “ridiculous.”) In 2022, she also published an op-ed on Fox News where she baselessly floated the idea of a “saboteur” or “activist law clerk” leaking the draft majority opinion to overturn Roe. In October, she also wielded the FACE Act, normally a law to protect abortion clinics from threats, to sue pro-Palestinian protesters who protested outside a New Jersey synagogue.\n\nSpeaking about her nomination, Assemblyman Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Calif.), said it felt like the “middle finger to the enforcement of civil rights in the country.” Prior to her confirmation, the Legal Defense Fund sent a letter to top Democratic leaders, writing, “Ms. Dhillon portrays herself as a civil rights lawyer who makes it her job to fight what she refers to as ‘the woke mob.’” In another letter, 65 national organizations, including the NAACP, Planned Parenthood, and Reproductive Freedom For All, urged the Senate to turn her down: “Throughout her career, Ms. Dhillon has threatened the very civil rights of many communities who the Civil Rights Division was created to defend.” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Ala.) was the only Republican to object to her nomination alongside every Democrat—though Murkowski will never get a thumbs-up from us.\n\nBorn in India, Dhillon’s family moved to London before settling in the U.S. As a classics student at Dartmouth University, she launched her right-wing reputation when she served as editor-in-chief of the school’s conservative newspaper. There, she oversaw a column that compared the plight of conservatives on campus to that of Jews in the Holocaust. (The piece also compared the school’s Jewish president to Hitler.) While the paper categorized the article as satire, Dhillon responded to backlash by saying the piece sought to compare “liberal fascism” with other forms of fascism. She added, “I’m very disturbed about the response to it. I’m very surprised, very very surprised.” She graduated in 1989 and then attended law school at the University of Virginia. \n\nDhillon accelerated to conservative stardom during the 2020 elections, and in a White House Social Media Summit in 2019, Trump titled her “one of the leading First Amendment lawyers in the country.” (Never a good sign, coming from him.) She’s used her namesake law firm (which she founded in 2006) and the far-right Center for American Liberty (which she founded in 2018) to file various lawsuits against Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) for his stay-at-home mandates during the pandemic; and defended villainous clients such as Tucker Carlson in a gender discrimination lawsuit; Elon Musk in a case against advertisers that did not want to associate themselves with Twitter; and, of course, Trump himself.\n\nDhillon ironically calls herself a “civil rights lawyer,” and most of her clients—as you surely have gathered—are the worst. Before nominating her, Trump bragged that she held an excellent track record on “taking on Big Tech for censoring our Free Speech,” but what he really meant was that she represented the Google software engineer who was fired after he circulated a memo suggesting there was a biological reason why women were underrepresented in tech.\n\nNaturally, Dhillon’s also an election denialist. She worked particularly closely with Trump in 2020 and became a co-chair of Lawyers for Trump—a group that proceeded to loudly challenge the results of the 2020 elections. As Biden swept battleground states on November 6, 2020, Dhillon went on Fox News to declare the conservative-packed Supreme Court would step in and “do something” about it. “Hopefully, Amy Coney Barrett will come through,” she said. \n\nDuring the 2024 presidential election, she criticized Kamala Harris for claiming her South Asian heritage. “Yeah, I think this is going to be a little brutal, but the reputation she has among the Indian-American community, is [that] she is Indian-American at an Indian-American thrown fundraiser, and that’s it.” Two days after Trump was shot, she hosted a Sikh prayer at the Republican National Convention. “Thank you dear god, for protecting his life.” She also defended Trump in 2023 after the Colorado Supreme Court ruled to remove him from their ballots for “[engaging] in an insurrection.”\n\n“Democrats are conspiring to commit the biggest election interference fraud in world history, right before our eyes, as government officials avert their eyes to the mockery of the constitution and our laws,” Dhillon tweeted in December 2023. “This is a low point in American history.” Crazy to think how much lower she’s dragged us! \n\nSpeaking of, she really, really loves Twitter. According to Democracy Docket, she tweets between her personal and DOJ accounts upwards of 100 times a day, often tweeting about ongoing litigation, criticizing federal judges and their decisions, or—infamously—picking fights with Newsom’s staffers. (She also appears unaware of the Hatch Act, as many of her tweets are openly partisan.)\n\nAnd with her—and Bondi—at the helm, it didn’t take long for DOJ employees to start quitting—some of whom had served decades before stepping down. In December, about 200 former DOJ employees wrote a letter on the “destruction of the DOJ’s” CRT, writing that Dhillon “focused her efforts on ‘driving [the CRT] in the opposite direction’ of its longstanding purpose.”\n\n“The [CRT] had already lost several staffers in the wake of Dhillon’s refocusing of the department to fighting ‘woke ideology,’ protecting abortion protesters who interfere with clinics, and other similar activities instead of protecting civil rights,” Beirich said. “Her time at DOJ has been disastrous for the division.”\n\nLike what you just read?

For example, when Ms. Bolger was asking questions about an AP article about Ms. Loomer dated September 11, 2024, Mr. Klayman stated the following:\n\nMr. Klayman: Objection. What's the relevancy of this? It's written by Associated Press … a Trump-hating organization, which the Israelis even had to bomb their building in Gaza because they were supporting Hamas.\n\nAs Ms. Bolger questioned Ms. Loomer about additional articles, Mr. Klayman improperly commented that the articles were from \"leftist Trump-hating publications\"; and \"ultra-leftist rags … [w]hich have no credibility at all.\" Mr. Klayman accused Ms. Bolger of \"pull[ing] out all your friends in the leftist media to try to smear [Loomer] on a public record?\" And he told Ms. Bolger that the articles \"will never come into evidence. You can have your fun right now, but that will be the last fun you have.\"\n\nMr. Klayman also improperly advised Ms. Loomer not to answer questions about whether the First Amendment protects her right to give her opinion or make jokes. Rule 30(c)(2) provides only three justifications for instructing a deponent not to answer a question—i.e., to preserve a privilege; to enforce a limitation imposed by the court; or to present a Rule 30(d)(3) motion. [Rule 30(d)(3) provides, in relevant part, \"At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. The motion may be filed in the court where the action is pending or the deposition is being taken. If the objecting deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to obtain an order.\" -EV] Here, Mr. Klayman did not raise any of these objections, nor did he move for a protective order…. [C]ounsel violates Rule 30(d)(3) by instructing a deponent not to answer questions but never moving for a protective order ….\n\nMoreover, Mr. Klayman violated his professional responsibility when he declined to restrain Ms. Loomer's patently improper conduct at her deposition. Objectively, Ms. Loomer was a difficult witness. She repeatedly argued with Ms. Bolger and went on tangents unrelated to any pending question. At one point, she told Ms. Bolger: \"I know what you're doing. I know what type of people you are. You're fucking Democrats: okay? You represent the filthiest fucking people in our country—Democrats scumbags.\" {The Court was also concerned by Ms. Bolger's response—which was in a taunting, patronizing tone—\"I thought you didn't like the word, \"fuck,\" Ms. Loomer? I thought you were offended by the word fuck.\"} Ms. Loomer accused Ms. Bolger of \"hat[ing] America.\"\n\nIncredulously, Mr. Klayman took no action to rein in this outrageous conduct. And on at least one occasion, he appeared to egg Ms. Loomer on when she was refusing to directly answer what she meant by her own tweet about Marjorie Taylor Green and the meaning of the phrase \"Arby's in your pants.\" Mr. Klayman asked, \"[w]here's the meat?\" and Ms. Loomer, who was laughing, quipped, \"[i]t's in her pants.\" As an officer of the Court, Mr. Klayman's complete failure to check Ms. Loomer's wildly inappropriate behavior was inexcusable.\n\nMs. Bolger was clearly frustrated by Ms. Loomer's failure to directly answer questions, some of which were bordering on the absurd. {For example, Ms. Loomer's testimony surrounding her own tweet about Marjorie Taylor Green and the meaning of the phrase \"Arby's in your pants\" is objectively ridiculous.} Unfortunately, in a few instances, Ms. Bolger lost her cool and took the bait. For example, when Ms. Loomer obfuscated about the meaning of a previous tweet she had made about Kamala Harris {\"I guess you would know a thing or two about trashy Montel Williams, given the fact that you dated and stuck your cock inside Kamala Harris many years ago. I've heard everything her infested snatch touches also dies a miserable, painful death.\"}, Ms. Bolger taunted Ms. Loomer to answer with statements like, \"I thought you were a First Amendment warrior who was fearless in what you say\" and called her a \"coward.\" There is simply no excuse for this name-calling.\n\nLikewise, when Ms. Loomer wouldn't directly respond to questions about whether the First Amendment protects her right to give her opinion or make jokes—and Mr. Klayman improperly instructed her not to answer—Ms. Bolger lapsed into unprofessional conduct.. Rather than seeking assistance from the Court, Ms. Bolger continued to repeatedly ask the same (or similar) question, and as she grew more exasperated even asked, \"Isn't it the case that, in the United States of America, the First Amendment express[es] a right to have opinions; and isn't that fucking fantastic?\" She repeatedly asked Ms. Loomer if she was going to take her lawyer's instruction and attempted to goad her into a response with jabs about being a \"free speech warrior.\" At one point, Ms. Bolger even stated, \"God. It's embarrassing that you, the free speech warrior, won't answer a simple question like that.\"\n\nSadly, the deposition transcripts are replete with countless other instances of unprofessional conduct. Rather than taking personal responsibility for their own misconduct, counsel largely points to the misdeeds of opposing counsel to somehow offset their behavior. However, \"[m]utual enmity does not excuse the breakdown of decorum\" that occurred at the depositions. The Court cannot, and will not, ignore counsel's unacceptable conduct….\n\nAccordingly, on or before December 18, 2025, Mr. Klayman and Ms. Bolger must show cause why, for the conduct described, they should not be sanctioned under the Court's authority to maintain standards of civility and professionalism. Sanctions may include, but by no means limited to: nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty to the Court; an order revoking special admission; a Local Rule 2.04 referral to a grievance committee; or some combination of these sanctions.","summary":"From an order today by Magistrate Judge Philip Lammens in Loomer v.

Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who’s leading a bipartisan group of lawmakers discussing ways to extend some of the subsidies. “Let’s take two years to actually deliver for the American people truly affordable health care.”\n\nDemocrats have heard that refrain before and argue Republicans have had 15 years to offer an alternative. They believe the options being discussed now, which largely focus on allowing Americans to funnel money to health savings accounts, do little to address the cost of health care.\n\n“They’ve had a lot of time,” said Rep. Steny Hoyer, the Maryland Democrat who was House majority leader during the ACA debate.\n\nAnd with that, welcome back to the health care debate that never seems to end.\n\nThe challenge of reaching consensus\n\nThe often-tortured dynamics surrounding health care have remained remarkably consistent. Obamacare dramatically expanded coverage but remains — even in the minds of those who crafted the law — imperfect and more expensive than many would prefer.\n\nAnd Washington seems more entrenched in stalemate rather than marching toward a solution.\n\n“People hate the status quo, but they’re not too thrilled with change,” Rahm Emanuel said as he reflected on the arc of the health care debate that he has watched as a top aide to President Bill Clinton, chief of staff to Obama and Chicago mayor. “That’s the riddle to the politics of health care.”\n\nMajor reforms inevitably run into a health industry — a broad group of interests ranging from pharmaceutical and health services companies to hospitals and nursing homes — that spent more than $653 million on lobbying last year, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks political spending.\n\n“Any time you try to figure out how to bring costs down, somebody thinks, ‘Uh oh, I’m about to get less,’” said Hoyer, who announced last week he won’t seek reelection after serving since 1981.\n\nWhen Obamacare was passed, opinion on the law was mixed, although views tended to be more positive than negative, according to KFF polling. But the law has steadily grown in popularity. A KFF poll conducted in September 2025 found about two-thirds of Americans have a favorable view of the ACA.\n\nThat’s put Trump and Republicans in a bind.\n\nTrump’s ‘concepts of a plan’\n\nSince the ACA’s passage, Republicans largely dedicated themselves to the law’s destruction. Trump issued social media posts calling for a repeal as early as 2011 and spoke in generalities during each of his presidential campaigns about delivering better coverage at lower cost. During his 2024 debate against Democratic rival Kamala Harris, he referred to “concepts of a plan.”\n\nUnder pressure to offer more specifics, Trump on Thursday outlined a proposal he dubbed “The Great Healthcare Plan.” The plan doesn’t repeal the ACA. But it would focus on lowering drug prices and providing options for Americans to send money directly to health savings accounts to bypass the federal government and handle insurance on their own. Democrats have rejected that as an insufficient way to cover high health care costs.\n\nThroughout his second term, Trump has criticized Obamacare as unfairly subsidizing insurers, a point that could’ve been addressed had the legislation created a public option that would’ve competed alongside the private sector. Republicans — and a sizable number of Democrats — objected to that approach, arguing it would give the government an outsize role in health care.\n\nBut in a reminder that the past is never really over, a small group of Democrats is aiming to revive the debate over the public option, even if the prospects in a Republican-controlled Congress are dim. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois last week introduced legislation that would create a public health insurance option on the ACA exchanges.\n\nLast year, a record 24 million people were enrolled in the ACA, though fewer appear to be signing up this year as the expired subsidies make coverage more expensive. The Supreme Court has upheld the law, and Republicans have failed to repeal, replace or alter it dozens of times. In the most famous example, Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, cast the deciding vote in 2018 to keep the legislation in place, underscoring the lack of an alternative by noting there was “no replacement to actually reform our health care system and deliver affordable, quality health care to our citizens.”\n\nDemocrats successfully turned the repeal efforts into a rallying cry in the 2018 midterms and see an opportunity to do so again this year with the expired subsidies. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who isn’t seeking reelection, has warned this moment could be even more perilous for Republicans because, unlike the subsidies, voters didn’t lose anything during the 2018 debate.\n\n“Us failing to put something else in place did not create this cliff,” Tillis said. “That’s the fundamental difference in an election year.”\n\nACA veterans acknowledge challenges\n\nEven those who crafted the ACA concede the health care system created in its wake has problems. Former Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who was among the bill’s architects as chair of the finance committee, acknowledged “nothing is perfect,” pointing to high health care costs.\n\n“Bending the cost curve, that has not bent as much as we’d like,” he said.\n\nThat’s in part why some Republicans have expressed openness to a deal on subsidies. They see it less as an endorsement of the ACA than a bridge that would give lawmakers time to address more complex issues.\n\n“We need to get to a long-term solution,” said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.\n\nVeterans of past health care negotiations, however, are skeptical that lawmakers can produce anything meaningful without the type of in-depth negotiations that led up to the ACA.\n\n“It takes a long time to figure all this out,” Baucus said.\n\nAsked whether he’s studied that history as he dives into the next chapter of health care talks, Moreno noted that he’s only been in Congress for a year.\n\n“I don’t know s—-,” he said. “What that means is I don’t have scars.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Ali Swenson in New York contributed.","summary":"The ongoing debate over health care in the U.S. remains as contentious as ever.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2026/01/15/health-care-politics/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump_37686-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 18:07:58","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.159},{"id":393333374,"title":"Kamala Harris returning to Chicago for MLK breakfast event","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris will return to Chicago on Friday for this year’s Martin Luther King Jr. Interfaith Breakfast, Mayor Brandon Johnson announced.\n\nHarris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, will deliver the keynote address at the annual event honoring the civil rights icon.

While talks of renewing Obamacare premium subsidies that expired at the end of 2025 appear to have stalled, there has been continued interest in passing the previously abandoned PBM legislation.\n\nThe “Great Healthcare Plan” does not include renewing the Obamacare premium tax credits. It instead calls for sending funds directly to patients but lacks a specific proposal for how to send them the money to buy insurance or healthcare services through a partially funded Health Savings Account, which Trump has supported in the past. \n\nOz said Trump “feels strongly that the money that we’ve been pouring into insurance has often disproportionately gone to insurance companies, not to the people themselves,” which the administration said has not worked in the past.\n\nThe “Great Healthcare Plan” would also require health insurance companies to publish the percentage of their revenues that are paid out in claims versus directed toward overhead and profit, as well as the rates of insurance claim rejections and the wait times for prior authorizations to receive needed care.\n\n“By empowering the American people to be able to use the money wisely on their own behalf, that flexibility would drive value into the system,” Oz said.\n\nOz said he and the president have spoken with insurance companies and that they are “optimistic” they will cooperate. \n\nTrump’s new plan comes as Republicans on the House Budget Committee announced earlier this week their intention to pursue a second budget reconciliation bill, a legislative maneuver that would bypass the 60-vote majority rule in the Senate.\n\nHowever, senior White House officials said they expect broad bipartisan support for the legislation, which would make the reconciliation process unnecessary.\n\n“Most Favored Nation drug pricing, lowering insurance premiums, maximizing price transparency, and holding big insurance companies accountable. That’s what the President wants Congress to consider,” Oz said. “Leadership has been debriefed. There will be ongoing conversations, and we hope to be able to support them with specific language for the legislation.”\n\nTrump’s plan, announced 10 months before November’s midterm elections, is a response to fears that Republicans could be undermined in the contests due to rising Obamacare health insurance premiums. \n\nOn Thursday, a senior administration official said Congress “delivering meaningful healthcare reform and [lowering care] prices as a top priority” for Trump.\n\nIn a separate video posted on social media, Trump added, “Instead of putting the needs of big corporations and special interests first, our plan finally puts you first and puts more money in your pocket. The government is going to pay the money directly to you. It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own healthcare.

You know what really pisses me off is the fact that they detain people, cuff ’em, and then still beat the shit out of ’em. They tell you it's immigrants, only immigrants—it's fucking anybody. I have friends that got detained and all they were doing was fucking driving home from work. What the fuck? I'm not fucking paid to be here lik e everybody fucking says. What the fuck is that? I gotta work in the goddamn morning, just like everybody else. I'm just here trying to stand up for community, dude.\n\nIn fact, many of the people getting beaten and arrested aren’t even protesters. They were just people caught in the wrong place at the wrong time who filmed the horrifying behavior of agents—as the First Amendment gives them the right to do. \n\nFor example, one woman said she was trying to get to a doctor’s appointment when masked ICE agents broke her car window, ripped her from her vehicle, and arrested her as she screamed.\n\nHere's how The Minnesota Star Tribune’s editorial board described what is going on in the city:\n\nHeavily armed and masked government agents are prone to confront any American they encounter in the street but especially people of certain colors, accents or styles of dress. The encounters are often violent. The federal agents operating under the insignia of Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Department of Homeland Security, functioning largely anonymously, have disrupted the life of large swaths of a state.\n\nDeploying the military in an American city already under siege by ICE and other federal immigration agents will do nothing but further inflame a volatile situation.\n\nBut that is exactly what Trump wanted all along. He relishes in seeing those who may not have voted for him suffer.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Harris had warned this chaos and violence was what Trump wanted.\n\n\"He considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will an enemy of our country,\" Harris said at an October 2024 rally in Pennsylvania. \"This is among the reasons I believe so strongly that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America, and dangerous.\"\n\nA few days later, she made that warning again.\n\n“Yesterday, we learned that Donald Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly, a retired four-star general, confirmed that while Donald Trump was president, he said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had,\" Harris said in a speech, referring to a then-recent report in The Atlantic. “He does not want a military that is loyal to the United States Constitution. He was a military that is loyal to him.”\n\nSadly, it is unlikely Minnesota politicians can stop Trump's invasion. Trump wanted this violence and chaos, and he is probably watching it unfold on cable news with glee as he sips a Diet Coke. \n\nBut there is hope for us yet.\n\nWhile Trump derives pleasure from the horrific images we’re seeing, Americans do not. Polls show ICE’s conduct is overwhelmingly unpopular. A Yahoo News/YouGov survey released on Tuesday shows that 54% of Americans think ICE’s actions have done more harm than good, while just 34% think ICE has done more good than harm. Overall, 54% view the agency unfavorably.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz gave a powerful speech Wednesday night, saying that \"[n]ews reports simply don’t do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities.\"\n\nBut Walz also tried to give residents hope and an action plan to combat the nightmare that we all knew was coming if Trump ever took office again. He implored residents to record ICE's actions \"to bank evidence for future prosecution.\"\n\n\"We will not have to live like this forever. Accountability is coming at the voting booth and in court,\" Walz said. \"We will reclaim our communities from Donald Trump. We will re-establish a sense of safety for our neighbors and we will bring an end to this moment of chaos, confusion and trauma. We will find a way to move forward and we’ll do it together. And we’ll not be alone.\"","summary":"The doomsday scenario former Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats warned about has arrived.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to sic the military on American citizens in Minnesota, which is already under siege by armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who are brutalizing citizens in the streets and even killing them in cold blood.\n\n\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump falsely accused Minnesotans—who have been racially profiled and violently beaten by immigration agents—of being paid protesters.\n\n\n\nTrump said that if Minnesota's leaders don't \"obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State.\"\n\n\n\nOf course, the protesters are not paid. \n\n\n\nHere's how one Minneapolis resident put it in an i","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2026/1/15/2363578/-The-nightmare-scenario-Democrats-warned-about-is-here?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1517891/story_image/AP26015113461124.jpg?1768490912","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 16:00:16","author":"Emily Singer","authors":["Emily Singer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.391},{"id":393286534,"title":"Stephen Miller Stupidly Claims ICE Agents Have Federal Immunity.

First of all, they’re wrong, according to virtually every legal expert who didn’t get their credentials from whoever sold Herschel Walker that police badge. Secondly, one might get the impression that the federal government is fully expecting police brutality to happen wherever they deploy agents, and it’s brazenly telling agents on live television that they won’t be held accountable for any number of violent offenses, including but not limited to killing people.\n\n“You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one—no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist—can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties,” Miller said. “The Department of Justice has made clear that if officials cross that line into obstruction, into criminal conspiracy against the United States or against ICE officers, then they will face justice.”\n\nYou might remember that when President Donald Trump was running for his second term in 2024, he stood on a stage and just before he suggested that former Vice President Kamala Harris was “mentally impaired, he mused that police officers across the nation should be allowed “one real rough, nasty day,” or “one rough hour” where they could presumably commit violent acts of police brutality freely and without fear of consequence.","summary":"Stephen Miller claims ICE agents have immunity from state prosecution while in the performance of their duties.","url":"https://newsone.com/6769392/stephen-miller-falsely-claims-ice-agents-have-immunity/","image":"https://newsone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2026/01/17684884800148.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024&crop=0,0,100,683px","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 16:00:00","author":"Zack Linly","authors":["Zack Linly"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":393261410,"title":"Kamala Harris buys $8.15 million Malibu mansion – a look at the luxurious seaside property","text":"Former vice president Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff have purchased a $8.15 million mansion in Malibu, California, reports the Daily Mail.About the luxurious Malibu mansionThe property includeds four-bedrooms, six bathrooms and sits in the exclusive Point Dume neighbourhood.

And in fact, that's exactly what failed presidential candidate Al Gore intended the film to do. Fortunately for him, he found a willing audience of Hollywood celebrities and left-wing media outlets to uncritically promote his ideology and activism. Unfortunately for him, 2006 is now far enough in the past that we can test some of the predictions, claims, and statements of fact he makes in that film. So that's exactly what we did. READ: Left Wing Media Outraged Funding For Climate Change Has Disappeared At the start of 2026, nearly 20 years after the film hit theaters and helped pave the way for Europe's delusional \"net zero\" policies, electric car mandates, and low-flow showerheads, OutKick rewatched \"An Incovenient Truth\" to see how well it held up over time. Spoiler alert: not particularly well! The film starts off as a glowing tribute to Al Gore himself, an unsurprising beginning given his obvious ego and hubris. Almost immediately afterward, it jumps straight into the propaganda. He references Hurricane Katrina as an example of more extreme weather events in the modern world. There's a \"Simpsons\" video with propaganda of \"global warming,\" remember, this is pre-rebrand to \"climate change,\" with a young girl seeing her ice cream cone melt. Gore talks about what got him into this field which is one professor who took some measurements of CO2, then made vague predictions of what would happen if we didn't make changes. He says we started measuring CO2 in 1958, which, of course, thoroughly discredits his activism. Assuming the latest estimate is accurate, the earth is billions of years old. It keeps growing by the year, but as of January 2026, it's 4.54 billion years. Sure, you can estimate CO2 concentrations for part of that past, but not all of it. Or even a sizable percentage of it. And making predictions and assumptions on such limited data is awful science. But ignoring the past and focusing on the future, one of his most concrete predictions of doom came regarding Mt. Kilimanjaro. In his discussion, he shows pictures of snow on the African mountain from decades ago, then images from the early 2000's with much less snow. He blames this on global warming, then ominously predicts, \"Within the decade there will be no more snows on Kilimanjaro.\" How'd that age? Gore's Predictions Prove Woefully Wrong Well, we're now two decades removed from this claim, and there continues to be snow on Kilimanjaro. In fact, one story from The Times of London published a few years ago specifically highlighted how wrong Gore's forecast was. Methley Swai, the owner of a trekking company for Kilimanjaro excursions, told The Times: \"Many people have made Kilimanjaro a bucket list priority because of the Al Gore deadline but when they get here they are pleasantly surprised to find lots of snow.\" Sure enough, the story also reported, \"There were also abnormally high snowfalls in 2018, which led to the highest recorded growth for the total snow depth on Tanzania’s inactive volcano, an aggregated increase of 1.2m.\" Whoops! We're not done there! His next example of declining snow is Glacier National Park. Gore tells a story about how he personally climbed it with his daughter in 1998, then shows pictures of less glacier activity in the mountains. Then, the kicker. A concrete prediction of what would happen to the park. \"Within 15 years this will be the park formerly known as Glacier,\" he says, to oohs and aah from the crowd. Here's how poorly this prediction has aged. Even CNN was forced to report in 2020 that \"Glacier National Park is replacing signs that predicted its glaciers would be gone by 2020,\" because unfortunately for Gore and his agenda, there continues to be plenty of glaciers remaining. Nailed it again, buddy. He mentions Argentina and Peru as countries where glaciers that are in danger of disappearing. Yet, as you'd expect, there are still glaciers in Argentina and Peru in 2026. In fact, one travelog from 2025 posted photos of the El Pertito Moreno glacier in Argentina, with the comment \"Just west of El Calafate, this frozen river is one of the few glaciers in the world still growing.\" Nailed it again buddy. Gore then uses a graph to show how our climate is warming, though, naturally, it's purposefully misleading. The warming period he demonstrates in the modern era barely reaches above 0.0, after decades of well below average weather. Essentially, we experienced decades of cooling, as immortalized in a Time magazine cover from the 1970's warning of global cooling, and the trend reversed. He also claims we can use ice in Antarctica to look back 650,000 years and show CO2 concentration at that point in time That's nice, but again, doesn't come close to covering 4.54 billion years of world history. He talks about Ice Ages, with zero acknowledgment that those Ice Ages ended without human intervention. He uses a prop lift to show that we have the highest CO2 levels yet, and within 50 years, or 2056, he expects the concentration of CO2 will be well over 750ppm, doubling in a matter of decades. It's currently around 420ppm. When the movie was made, two decades ago, it was 380ppm. At that rate of increase, it would take 185 years from when he made his prediction to reach 750ppm. Whoops. Oddly enough, after years of climate \"experts\" saying that weather isn't climate, meaning individual weather events or yearly outcomes aren't representative of changes in climate, Gore repeatedly references record warm temperatures in 2005 as \"proof\" of global warming. He specifically mentions the number of days over 100 degrees in western US cities to back up his fearmongering. Naturally, these trends have not been consistent. For example, in 2006 when this movie was released, Las Vegas had 86 days when temperatures reached 100 degrees. In 2025, there were 77. Gore Makes Hurricane Predictions, Drought Predictions, That Prove False Later on, Gore references hurricanes in the South Atlantic, once again using those as proof of increasing extreme weather, as if we have measurements of all hurricane activity in that ocean for 4.54 billion years. He claims that Katrina is yet more proof, using a graphic to show that it intensified because it went over warmer waters. These extreme storms will become more frequent, he says, because of warming temperatures. There is, of course, no evidence that this has happened. There were 14 hurricanes that made landfall from 2003-2005 in the United States. There were eight that made landfall from 2022-2024 in the United States. Just this past year, the NOAA predicted an above-average hurricane season in 2025, literally a few months in advance. They were completely wrong, as there was average to below-average activity, with no increase in hurricane strength. Every single time. Global warming causes more rain, but also more drought, Gore continues. He mentions extreme drought in middle Africa and Lake Chad evaporating to back it up. Here's what a quick search on Lake Chad reveals today: \"Despite historic shrinkage, satellite imagery from 2024 and 2025 indicates the lake has not continued to decline and has shown signs of replenishment since the early 2010s.\" Whoops again! He highlights the decline of Arctic sea ice, again saying it's rapidly diminishing. Except, current measurements for 2025-2026 show that sea ice extent is roughly in line with 2012-2013, just barely below the 1980-2010 average. Which is, of course, influenced by the period of colder weather that existed in the 1970's. Ironically, Gore then shows himself going on an airplane, after saying this is all the fault of human beings and their activity. Zero awareness. One of his biggest and most terrifying claims is that the ice sheet covering Greenland is in danger of melting. The audience once again reacts in horror as he shows simulations of oceanic sea rise that would cover much of The Netherlands, San Francisco, Florida, Beijing, Calcultta, Manhattan, and Shanghai in such a catastrophic scenario. Per the NOAA Arctic report card, here's how the Greenland ice sheet did in 2024: \"The Greenland Ice Sheet lost 55 ± 35 Gt of mass in 2024, the lowest annual ice loss since 2013. This occurred due to above-average snowfall and below-average melting.\" Temperatures didn't change either. \"We report monthly mean air temperatures measured at weather stations in Greenland. Air temperatures observed over the 2024 mass balance year were close to the 1991-2020 average.\" The 2025 report also found that the mass balance in the Greenland Ice Sheet showed \"less loss than the 2003-24 annual average. \"Above-average snowfall and below-average melt\" contributed to \"losing less mass this year.\" Additionally, a study published in January 2026 found that \"Prudhoe Dome, a 500-meter-thick ice cap on the northwestern Greenland ice sheet, was completely ice-free around 7,100 years ago with temperatures 3-5°C higher than they are today,\" per meteorologist Chris Martz. As he explains, it \"goes to show that these processes can happen naturally without any anthropogenic influence.\" Gore's Hypocrisy Is Evident Throughout As the documentary continues, he brings up the Aral Sea disappearing as a further example of the dangers of human intervention in our climate. Except the Aral Sea dried up in part because \"poorly thought-out irrigation strategies introduced by the Soviet Union in the 1960s-70s.\" Restoration efforts are underway to undue some of that damage, and as of 2025, \"the volume of water in the North Aral has increased by 42%.\" He appeals to authority, saying that peer-reviewed research unequivocally says global warming is factual and not up for dispute. Of course, this has changed over time, with plentiful new research contradicting his claim of consensus. To the point where Gore and his partners had to change their messaging to \"climate change\" to avoid dealing with many of their predictions not coming true. Without a hint of irony, he puts up a quote saying: \"It's difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him not understanding it.\" Precisely the critique leveled at \"global warming\" scientists who rely on government funding. No problem to solve? No funding. Gore himself benefits from this; no demand for his presentation? No gigantic speaking fees. He then says it's dishonest to say we need to make a choice between the economy and the planet, an incredibly inaccurate prediction considering the damage countries like Germany and the United Kingdom have done to their economies by producing less energy to satisfy Gore's ravings. Literally just this past week, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright made headlines by explaining that Germany has invested \"half a trillion\" in clean energy, doubled the capacity of their grid, yet produce 20% less electricity than they did before the half trillion dollar investment, and they sell it at three times the price.\" Coincidentally, Gore says \"If we do the right thing, then we're going to create a lot of wealth and a lot of jobs.\" Not only has the jobs part been proven false, but the \"wealth\" that's been created has mostly gone to people like Gore. Meanwhile, in the real world, California's \"Ivanpah Solar Power Facility,\" which cost $2.2 billion to construct, is shutting down after it never met its energy production goals, killed birds and harmed the desert landscape. Hard to be more wrong than that. He concludes by putting up a world map showing his travels to show his slideshow, again, completely ignoring the CO2 emitted by his paid travel. There's more charts, demanding higher mileage per gallon standards, saying that it wouldn't hurt car manufacturers. Sure enough, car manufacturers have lost billions upon billions chasing his goals, including by building electric cars that aren't actually less polluting when viewed in totality. Ford has shut down its \"Lightning\" truck after poor demand, and Porsche sent itself into a tailspin by investing in EV's, to the point where their CEO was forced to resign in 2025 after damaging the company. As just a few examples. He then extols the virtues of making choices to individually limit our carbon footprint. Excellent timing, considering his pal Kamala Harris just bought an $8 million mansion in Malibu. Surely a decision made to limit her carbon footprint, and in fear of losing her house to the sea level rise Gore warns about. \"Are you ready to change the way you live?\" the documentary asks over the credits. The answer, as demonstrated by Gore and his celebrity pals, is that absolutely none of them are willing to change anything about their lives in order to \"solve\" climate change. Because they don't actually believe in it, they just want a cause to signal their virtue. They want something to provide meaning to their lives. Gore gave them that, much in the same way he discusses a single college professor giving him meaning with global warming. The good news is that based on the track record of predictions in the documentary, they have nothing to worry about anyway.","summary":"","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/two-decades-gores-climate-documentary-key-environmental-predictions-prove-inaccurate","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2026/01/usatsi_22799475-scaled-e1768435448274.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 15:45:36","author":"Anderson Cooper","authors":["Anderson Cooper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":393255278,"title":"Washington Post Reporters Torch Jeff Bezos Over ‘Nauseating’ Move","text":"undefinedRead MoreundefinedSettingsundefinedFull Screen (F)undefinedPlay (SPACE)\n\nHours after news of the raid broke, Matt Murray, the executive editor of the Post, wrote to staff decrying “this extraordinary, aggressive action,” which he said “is deeply concerning and raises profound questions and concerns around the constitutional protections for our work.”\n\nIt was crickets from Bezos, though.

We fought a Civil War over that very mentality, and if I recall correctly, the people who tried to secede from the Union ended up losing that fight.\n\nWhat's happening in Minnesota, and what Democratic Party politicians have been doing for the better part of the year, is stochastic terrorism. Remember when that was the Left's favorite buzzword? They loved accusing LibsofTikTok of engaging in \"stochastic terrorism\" for simply sharing what Leftists themselves put online. They blamed her for death threats, bomb threats, and any act of violence they could find.\n\nMeanwhile, Tim Walz, Jacob Frey, and almost every other politician with a (D) after his name are calling ICE agents the Gestapo, Nazis, fascists, and domestic terrorists. They are urging their base to \"put their bodies on the line\" (as Minnesota Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan implored). It's already gotten one woman killed, and attacks on ICE have skyrocketed, so it's clear the Democrats are fine with a few more dead bodies.\n\nFor enforcing immigration laws that Democrats voted for, through an agency that once had the support of Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin. President Trump has now threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, and I hope he does it. I hope he sends Frey and Walz home with their tails between their legs, because the only way this insanity ends is by making an example of Minneapolis.\n\nThere really is a stark contrast between the Democratic Party and the rest of America. The Democrats value keeping violent, taxpayer money-stealing illegal immigrants in our cities, where they rape, murder, and maim innocents without consequence, and billions of tax dollars from hard-working Americans to support terrorists in Africa.\n\nThe rest of us value law and order, secure borders, and keeping Americans safe. And the rest of us won the election in 2024, so those are the values we hold dear. After all, the Democrats love democracy, right?\n\nAnd if it takes thousands of ICE agents descending on Minneapolis to make those values shared, so be it.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/01/15/frey-not-our-values-vip-n2669514","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2026/7/94e56893-9309-4e9c-a160-e1530cadcf43.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 15:00:01","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":393252756,"title":"Former college basketball coach unleashes anti-ICE rant, calls on Republicans to impeach Trump","text":"Former Notre Dame Fighting Irish women’s basketball head coach Muffet McGraw raged against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and President Donald Trump on Wednesday.

But nearly a year into Trump’s second presidency, Gen Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, are turning on him.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten announced shocking results from new polling, which showed Trump’s net approval rating among Gen Z at negative 32 percentage points. That is a huge dip from his plus-10 net approval rating with young people in February 2025, shortly after the start of his second term. \n\nEnten said Trump was “falling off that cliff” among Gen Z.\n\n“My goodness gracious. This is, I said, a very swinging group and it has swung very much away from Donald John Trump,” the data guru said.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Trump had 42 percent of the vote among Americans born between the 1990s and 2000s in the 2024 election. While this was still 13 percentage points lower than his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, he did better with this cohort than in previous years. \n\nIn his 2020 race against former President Joe Biden, Trump only got 35 percent of the vote among this cohort, and when he was up against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, he received just 25 percent. \n\nOne major issue that concerns Gen Z, like many other Americans, is the cost of living. Trump’s approval rating on the economy, one of the main issues he campaigned on during the 2024 election, has sunk. \n\nAn AP-NORC poll from last December found 67 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy, while just 31 percent approve. This gap was smaller in March, when 58 percent of people disapproved of the president’s job on the economy and 40 percent approved. \n\nDespite the polling, Trump bragged about the state of the economy during an annual appearance before the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. The president said the U.S. had experienced “the strongest and fastest economic turnaround in our country's history.”\n\nInflation held steady in December at 2.7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, but grocery prices remained high. Home sales in 2025 remained at a 30-year low amid high prices and mortgage rates, the Associated Press reported.","summary":"Trump won over more young voters in the 2024 election than in his two previous runs for president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-approval-rating-gen-z-poll-b2901200.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/14/22/26/GettyImages-2255277125.jpg?crop=5397,3598,x0,y1&trim=0,0,2,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V4GSdEB7-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-15 13:53:03","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":393254980,"title":"Analysis: Can Democrats take Senate? Here’s the math","text":"WASHINGTON (TNS) — Even with former Rep. Mary Peltola’s candidacy in Alaska, Senate Democrats still have a difficult path to the majority in November.\n\nThe fact that Democrats may need to rely on Alaska — a state where Republicans have a 9.4-point Inside Elections Baseline advantage, where Donald Trump finished ahead of Kamala Harris by 13 points in 2024, and where Democrats have won just one Senate election in 50 years — to flip the chamber is evidence that it will be tough for the caucus to get to 51 seats this year.\n\nSenate Republicans currently hold 53 seats, meaning Democrats would need a net gain of four seats to win control and bypass Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote. And other races could pose more challenging for Democrats than Alaska.\n\nNorth Carolina appears to be the easiest takeover opportunity for them, given the current political climate and the fact that it’s an open seat with Republican Thom Tillis retiring. But a flip is not guaranteed. Trump won the Tar Heel State in all three of his presidential bids, including a 3-point win in 2024. And Democrats have won only one Senate race in North Carolina in the past 25 years (Kay Hagan in 2008). The last Democrat to win before her was John Edwards in 1998.\n\nAs a Republican in a Democrat-leaning state, Maine Sen. Susan Collins is supposed to be vulnerable. But while she’s been a consistent target going back a quarter century, Democrats haven’t been able to unseat her. Collins has five Senate wins under her belt, with an average margin of victory of 18 points. It’s remarkable that defeating Collins is supposed to be one of the easier races for Democrats.\n\nWinning Alaska, North Carolina and Maine would still leave Senate Democrats one seat short of a majority, assuming they hold all of their own seats. But that’s not a guarantee either.\n\nGeorgia is a swing state that has voted Republican in almost all cases, except for Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential win, a pair of down-ballot statewide special elections last year, and three recent Senate races. Those more recent results are good news for Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is up for reelection this fall. But he can’t take his race for granted.\n\nDemocrats are also trying to hold Sen. Gary Peters’ open seat in battleground Michigan, which Trump won in 2024 as Republicans came within a half a point of winning the state’s other Senate seat. And the race to succeed Democrat Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire could get tighter, considering it was the closest state Harris won and Republicans might nominate a former senator with a famous last name.\n\nOhio looks to be the fourth-best takeover target for Democrats. Over the past decade, the Buckeye State has shed its swing-state status, and Republicans now have a 10-point Baseline advantage there. (Inside Elections’ Baseline metric measures a state’s political performance by combining all federal and state election results over the past four cycles into a single trimmed mean.)\n\nDemocrats are relying on former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost reelection by 4 points in 2024, to pull out a win. Such a feat is certainly possible under the current political environment, with voters dissatisfied with the status quo while Republicans are the party in power. But it will be yet another difficult race.\n\nOther targets\n\nIf Democrats lose one of their own seats — Georgia, Michigan or New Hampshire — or swing and miss in any of the races in North Carolina, Maine, Alaska or Ohio, they’ll have to win elsewhere to win the Senate majority.\n\nIowa, where Republican Joni Ernst is retiring, would be the next target. The most recent Democrat to win a Senate race in the Hawkeye State was Tom Harkin, when he secured a fifth term in 2008. But the party hasn’t won an open race there since John Culver in 1974. Ernst’s decision to not run again probably boosted Republican chances of winning now that they have Rep. Ashley Hinson in the race, while Democrats are wading through a competitive primary.\n\nWithout Iowa, the climb gets even steeper. Some Democratic strategists are so disinterested in investing in Texas and Florida yet again that they’d rather talk about their prospects in ruby-red Mississippi, where Democrats haven’t won a Senate race since President Ronald Reagan’s first midterm election.\n\nPast is prologue\n\nFlipping Senate seats in three states that voted for the other party’s presidential candidate just two years earlier looks like a daunting task on paper.But Senate Democrats can take some comfort in what Republicans did in 2010.\n\nWhile the GOP didn’t flip the chamber that year, they did notch a series of wins in states that had voted for Barack Obama two years earlier.\n\nFormer Sen. Dan Coats won in Indiana, which Obama had carried by a single point. Republican Patrick J. Toomey won in Pennsylvania, where Obama had finished ahead of John McCain by 10 points. Obama won Wisconsin by 14 points in 2008, and yet Republican Ron Johnson knocked off Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold two years later. And GOP nominee Mark S. Kirk prevailed in the president’s home state of Illinois, which had backed Obama by 25 points. And that doesn’t count Republican Scott P. Brown’s early 2010 special election victory in Massachusetts, just over a year after Obama had won the Bay State by 26 points.\n\nRepublicans might try to explain away the comparison for any number of reasons, but certain midterm dynamics are the same as they were 16 years ago. At the time of the 2010 elections, Obama’s job rating was underwater, according to Gallup, with 45% approving and 47% disapproving.\n\nTrump’s current standing is undeniably worse. Gallup’s most recent polling had 36% approving of the president and 59% disapproving.\n\nThere’s still time for things to get better for Republicans, but any improvement in Trump’s standing would likely be gradual. So simply saying, “There’s still time,” understates the challenge for Republicans as we march through the calendar.\n\nBut a lot of things would need to go right for Senate Democrats to win the majority.","summary":"Senate Republicans currently hold 53 seats, meaning Democrats would need a net gain of four seats to win control.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/nation/2026/01/analysis-can-democrats-take-senate-heres-the-math.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/Q52CNVPQEVAKNPJXAHUEWHCUKE.jpg?auth=dd386ebda8cf55d533209cc6fbc2fdc19a4d4cef42c89ae3c04a1a87d68e30a0&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 12:06:21","author":"Tribune News","authors":["Tribune News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.236},{"id":393206012,"title":"Obama wingman Eric Holder defended Walz's vetting — then Minnesota’s fraud scandal erupted","text":"Former Democratic Attorney General Eric Holder, who served under former President Barack Obama's tenure, played a key role in vouching for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as the Democratic Party's 2024 pick for vice president before a massive fraud scandal rocked the Gopher State. \"There's nothing that of any substance that was missed by our vetting team,\" Holder told CNN in an October 2024 interview as the federal election came down to its final days. Walz is in the midst of facing a sweeping fraud scandal involving alleged money laundering operations related to alleged fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers and Medicaid services that prosecutors say could total as much as $9 billion, Fox News Digital has reported. Dozens of individuals have been charged amid the investigations, most of whom are from the state's Somali community. The scandal led to Walz dropping his re-election bid to serve a third term as Minnesota governor. VANCE CALLS WALZ ‘A JOKE,’ CLAIMS MINNESOTA GOVERNOR ENABLED MASSIVE FRAUD Walz has said he is \"accountable for\" the scandal as the state's top elected official, but has accused Republicans and the Trump administration of sensationalizing multibillion dollar figures of alleged fraud. Walz bucked calls to step down as governor, declaring during a press conference Tuesday: \"Over my dead body will that happen.\" More than a year ago, Walz's run on the 2024 Democratic ticket catapulted his national name recognition after serving in politics for decades, including in the U.S. Congress from 2007 until 2019, before his election as governor. Ahead of his name being floated as a potential vice presidential contender, Walz was a relatively unknown name to everyday Americans. Then-Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Obama’s former attorney general to lead the vetting process of her potential running mates during the 2024 cycle. Holder is a longtime Obama ally and was one of the officials tasked with vetting Obama's potential running mates back in the 2008 election cycle before landing on then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden. Holder told the media in 2004 that Walz was not at the top of his list when vetting 11 candidates for Harris' running mate, but that he moved up the list of names as Holder reviewed his \"very impressive\" and \"significant\" work in Minnesota, including signing a law in 2023 for universal free breakfast and lunch for all K-12 students in the state, KSTP reported in November 2024 ahead of the election. \"As part of the process, the vetting process, I looked at almost every YouTube he’s ever been on,\" Holder told KSTP of Walz. \"Everything we could ever find about his media interactions and he’s a genuine nice guy. He’s got that Minnesota Nice thing.\" \"There was a chemistry that I saw, I actually saw that happen with Kamala Harris and with Tim Walz,\" Holder added at the time. \"So it was a combination, I think, of accomplishments and chemistry that propelled him to the number two spot on the ticket.\" A source with knowledge of Walz's vetting process told Fox News Digital that the fraud investigation was included in the vetting process, as details had already emerged during the governor's 2022 re-election race. \"Governor Walz's Department of Education had been in contact with the FBI regarding investigations into organizations diverting funds from child nutrition programs,\" the source explained. \"This issue was not a factor in the 2024 presidential campaign, nor did Kamala Harris's vice presidential choice ultimately prove to be a negative factor in the race.\" BLAGOJEVICH TELLS WALZ IF HE DIDN'T 'DO IT', GO DOWN FIGHTING: ‘MAKES ME THINK HIS HANDS ARE UNCLEAN' Walz’s emergence as the vice presidential pick quickly drew scrutiny over a string of past controversies, including allegations he exaggerated his military service, repeated misstatements about his presence during China's Tiananmen Square massacre, and questions about his handling of Minnesota’s 2020 riots — issues Republicans seized on as Democrats rushed to elevate him on the national stage. The 2024 election cycle was unprecedented for a multitude of reasons, most notably when then-President Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, 2024, amid mounting concerns over his health, and a pair of assassination attempts on then-candidate President Donald Trump's life. Holder joined CNN in October 2024 and defended the vetting process of Walz, calling him an \"authentic guy, a person with a great record as the governor of Minnesota and who I think will be a superb vice president.\" COMER SAYS WALZ 'RETALIATED' AGAINST WHISTLEBLOWERS WHO WARNED OF MINNESOTA FRAUD FOR YEARS \"He has resonated with the American people,\" Holder told CNN's Wolf Blitzer at the time. \"He has generated enthusiasm for the ticket. And I think that the slight exaggerations, misspeaking that he has done, and, again, for which he has, you know, taken responsibility, is not something that's going to ultimately hurt him,\" he said of Walz's past misstatements. Holder was pressed if he and \"your team of lawyers (missed) important information about him during the vetting process,\" considering the previous misstatements. Walz, for example, claimed in 2018 he had carried \"weapons in war,\" but had not been deployed to an active combat zone across his 24 years in the Army National Guard. \"No, I don't think we did,\" Holder responded about whether his team missed anything on Walz's record. \"I mean, I don't think that we were surprised by any of the things that he has said. And as what he has indicated is that sometimes he misspoke but he is — unlike Donald Trump, who lies like all the time Tim Walz has made some misstatements that he has said, you know, I was wrong in saying that, apologized for making the misstatements.\" Walz has been directly implicated in the Minnesota fraud schemes, though the Trump administration has pinned some of the blame on the governor. \"I think Tim Walz should resign,\" Vice President JD Vance told the media Thursday during a White House press briefing. \"Because it's very clear either that he knew about the fraud in Minneapolis, he knew about the welfare fraud, or at the very least, he looked the other way. I mean, this is not this is not like Lex Luther, right? This is not movie villain fraud. This is the lowest IQ possible fraud.\" ‘YOU DON’T GET A PROMOTION’: GOP RIVAL URGES PEGGY FLANAGAN TO QUIT SENATE RACE AFTER WALZ BOWS OUT Amid the fraud investigations, federal law enforcement converged on Minneapolis in January. A fatal shooting broke out in a residential area Jan. 7 when a woman allegedly attempted to use her car as a weapon against immigration officers in what the Department of Homeland Security called an \"act of domestic terrorism.\" The woman was shot and killed, sparking fierce condemnation from Democrats and Trump critics, including some lawmakers referring to the incident as a \"murder.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital also reached out to Walz's office and Obama's office regarding the 2024 vetting process considering the fraud investigations, but did not immediately receive replies.

Here's How To Tell.","text":"When people think about MAGA aesthetics, beauty often comes up first ― from the oft-criticized “conservative girl makeup” to the so-called “Mar-a-Lago Face” trend in cosmetic surgery. But style watchers say politics can also show up clearly in clothing.\n\n“When I look at fashion today, clothes become a kind of visual language,” Edith Chan, a celebrity stylist and image consultant, told HuffPost. “It communicates values, identity and sometimes politics without a single word being spoken.”\n\nOn one end of the spectrum are overt markers like MAGA hats, campaign T-shirts and slogan-heavy merch. Loud garments drenched in red, white and blue also carry a strong association with conservative politics in the modern age.\n\n“But what I find more interesting are the subtle signals, the ones that aren’t political on their own, but start to feel coded in certain contexts,” Chan said. \n\nBelow, fashion historians, stylists and cultural critics break down the pieces, brands and aesthetics most commonly associated with MAGA-coded style for women ― and why they’ve taken on this meaning today.\n\nOf course, none of these signals are hard-and-fast rules. People across the political spectrum wear the same brands, garments and materials. But in today’s hyper-polarized environment, fashion choices increasingly read as cultural shorthand, whether the wearers intend that or not.\n\nTweed jackets, dresses and Chanel‑adjacent silhouettes seem to have become staples of MAGA‑coded style ― perhaps fittingly so, given Coco Chanel’s complicated political history.\n\n“MAGA got super into searching ‘old money style’ during 2020 and never evolved past it ― mind you, people with old money are not Googling ‘old money style,’” said political commentator and social media personality Suzanne Lambert. “Their sustained hyperfixation seems to be the tweed dress with the buttons on each side, usually with a high collar that cuts off at the neck and makes it look too wide. I think those tweed dresses are becoming the equivalent of a MAGA hat.”\n\nThe irony, she noted, is that many of the icons behind this look ― including First Lady Jackie Kennedy ― were Democrats and part of a coastal elite establishment that MAGA politics publicly rails against. And many of today’s versions rely on mass-market or fast-fashion reproductions, a sort of “Shein Chanel,” if you will. \n\n“There are these really tragic Amazon dupes that are mostly polyester,” Lambert said. “But so many of these Republican staffers working on the Hill very much want to emulate that aesthetic. They don’t even really understand what they are trying to emulate. They just know that it seems aspirational.”\n\nAt higher levels of conservative politics, that tweed often comes with a heftier price tag, as seen in Attorney General Pam Bondi’s jackets or the Oscar de la Renta pieces favored by Fox News personalities. On the fictional side, the wealthy conservative “Gilmore Girls” matriarch Emily Gilmore sported many expensive tweed jackets. \n\n“It’s this classic look that we associate with conservatism today, very feminine and clean,” said public historian Einav Rabinovitch-Fox. “It’s signaling that these women are maintaining more traditional gender roles, like the Chanel suit is this very traditional, conservative, even sort of old look.”\n\nFormer first lady Nancy Reagan wore her fair share of tweed jackets and skirt suits, projecting a look that balanced softness with authority ― polished, feminine and firmly within traditional expectations of womanhood. That visual language continues to shape how conservative women in power dress today.\n\n“It’s a feminine iteration of the traditionally masculine garment ― the suit,” said Maureen Lehto Brewster, an assistant professor of fashion merchandising at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. “Women in politics have always had to straddle a double bind of gender and double bind of fashion. Do you wear a suit? If so, what kind of suit do you wear? A skirt suit?”\n\nRather than adopting overtly masculine tailoring, Lehto Brewster said many mainstream Republican women now opt for what critics have dubbed the “Republican Barbie” aesthetic.\n\n“It’s almost like a Fox News anchor look ― throwing out the suit entirely and dressing in this overtly feminine way to reassert patriarchal dominance,” she said. \n\nThat emphasis on masculine dominance is consistent with Trump administration policies and positions. Lehto Brewster also believes the old money aesthetic plays into the MAGA movement’s racial politics. \n\n“It’s all very class coded,” she said. “A lot of these young women express wanting to look ‘classy,’ but that’s also a very racially coded thing ― who gets to claim that, and who doesn’t.”\n\nOne of the most popular tweed dresses among D.C. conservatives is the $298 “Jackie” shift dress from Tuckernuck, a clothing and lifestyle retailer selling a preppy aesthetic that the founders describe as “classic,” “timeless” and “all American.”\n\nDespite leadership that appears politically liberal, the brand has become a staple among conservative women, from Fox News anchors to prominent figures in the Trump administration. The Daily Beast dubbed Tuckernuck “The Brand Dressing MAGA’s Leading Ladies ― Whether It Likes It or Not.”\n\n“I think Tuckernuck has entered the cultural conversation around MAGA fashion less because of overt politics and more because of what it visually represents,” said Chan. “The brand positions itself as ‘your one-stop shop for a fun, full life,’ and that life is clearly framed through an East Coast, upper-middle-class lens ― classic, heritage-inspired, preppy and aspirational.”\n\nEven the brand name is a nod to East Coast elitism: Tuckernuck is a privately owned island near Nantucket, the affluent New England destination where the founders summered as children.\n\nAlthough that coastal elitism might seem at odds with MAGA’s populist rhetoric, conservative figures appear drawn to the brand’s aesthetic of privilege, stability, femininity and reliability over trend or novelty.\n\n“Tuckernuck doesn’t promote MAGA ideology directly, but its aesthetic aligns closely with values often associated with modern conservatism ― tradition, respectability, family life and understated wealth,” Chan said. “In today’s polarized climate, fashion like this becomes read politically, whether the brand intends it or not.”\n\nLambert called Tuckernuck a “safe” brand that takes the guesswork out of fashion, and offers an ease and predictability that speaks to the conservative ethos. \n\n“I love Tuckernuck and actually wear a lot of it ― while also recognizing it’s definitely Republican-coded,” she said. “You might not look like the trendiest girl at the party in Tuckernuck, but the silhouettes and fit are consistent and modest, which is helpful particularly in a Hill setting.”\n\nShe also pointed to the jarring contrast between the brand’s “demure” image and the actions of some of its most visible wearers. Donning these “corporate feminine” looks are outspoken political figures who use their power and platforms to promote controversial policies that cause harm.\n\n“When you think about Tuckernuck and then you look at what the Trump administration is doing, it’s pretty obvious that Republicans wearing Tuckernuck is more about assimilation and distraction than curating one’s own style,” Lambert said. “There’s something particularly eerie about Kristi Noem wearing a number you might wear to a girl’s boozy brunch while also being someone who shot her own dog and stands by ICE murdering an American citizen.”\n\nLoud Luxury Handbags\n\nWhile old money style typically favors “quiet luxury,” the MAGA version seems to mix in conspicuous branding. \n\n“I’m going to dive in on Karoline Leavitt because right now, she is the person facing the public every day justifying the decisions of the Trump administration,” said style and cultural commentator Chelsea Perry. “Her White House style so far has favored a few of the big international luxury brands ― like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Jimmy Choo.”\n\nPerry joined other critics in noting that this affinity for European luxury designers seems to contradict the Trump administration’s “Made in America” policies and rhetoric.\n\n“They’re also designers that even people that don’t spend five hours a day on Pinterest would clock as expensive. Loud luxury,” Perry added. \n\nThe loud luxury vibe tends to show up in bag choices, particularly the logo-filled Louis Vuitton and Gucci pieces carried by several folks in the MAGA orbit, including chief of staff Susie Wiles and first lady Melania Trump.\n\n“People with old money choose high-quality logo-less clothes and try to blend in as much as possible,” Lambert noted. \n\nFormer congressional staffer Beverly Hart, who analyzes the political cues in fashion on TikTok, has called the Louis Vuitton Neverfull “screaming Republican — Trump Republican.” Other loudly branded choices like the pink Marc Jacobs Tote Bag also go into the Republican category for Hart. And for Christian Dior’s Book Tote, she said “It’s giving, definitely doesn’t vote but goes to events at Mar-a-Lago.”\n\nThe fascination with conspicuously branded luxury accessories among the MAGA establishment contrasts sharply with the economic reality many Americans face today. \n\n“To me, it reads as an attempt at signaling economic prosperity,” Perry said. “A sort of ‘Hey! The economy is fine. America is thriving. Our policy decisions are working. You can trust us.’ This becomes more apparent when you look to the daily beauty habits of the regular, working woman grappling with the cost-of-living crisis.”\n\nPointed-Toe Nude Heels\n\nLast year, Women.com published an article that branded nude pointed-toe heels as “The Bland Shoe Trend That’s Taking MAGA Women By Storm (& We’re Begging For A Style Upgrade).”\n\n“Like many of the aesthetic choices favored on the far right, the shoe feels stuck in a bygone era. At the very least, it reflects a preference for past over present,” the article states.\n\nNude pointed-toe heels certainly seem to fall into the category of predictability and traditional femininity that characterizes MAGA fashion. \n\n“The intention of the conservative look is just being seen as cleaner and more feminine to distinguish themselves from leftists ― kind of to say, ‘We’re not like those crazy lesbians or blue-haired liberal college girls or trans people,’” said Rabinovitch-Fox, who authored “Dressed for Freedom: The Fashionable Politics of American Feminism.”\n\nWhile liberal politicians like Rosa DeLauro, Jasmine Crockett and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez might make bold styling choices, conformity is the name of the game on the other side of the political aisle. \n\n“With conservative looks, the message is usually about tradition, stability and being put together,” said stylist Ariana Weisner. “There is a focus on neatness and modesty and nothing too experimental.”\n\n“I love a nude pump, but it very much lends itself to the way they want their fashion to be as mindless as possible,” Lambert said. “There’s no thought or creativity.”\n\nOne of Hart’s videos about footwear suggests liberals tend to be drawn to chunkier shoes, though she notes that the classic nude sandal style block heel enjoys bipartisan support. \n\n“That pointed-toe nude heel is classic and traditional,” Lehto Brewster said. “They don’t wear anything that undermines or undercuts traditional gender roles. By contrast, look at what Kamala Harris wore for her February Vogue cover ― Converse sneakers with a suit.”\n\nLarge Cross Necklaces\n\n“There’s a religious aspect to the look,” Rabinovitch‑Fox said, who pointed to one specific accessory in addition to general modesty. “You see these really big cross necklaces, which is kind of a clear marker.”\n\nOf course, Christians of all political leanings have worn cross necklaces, and crosses have also cycled through pop culture, appearing recently on decidedly not-conservative celebrities like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter.\n\nBut the decision to wear rather oversized or expensive versions ― especially when paired with tweed and traditional silhouettes ― gives this accessory a distinctly political resonance in recent years. \n\n“It’s a type of accessorizing that is aligning yourself with traditional values,” Lehto Brewster said. “There was a ‘conservative girl makeup’ video where someone made fun of Karoline Leavitt by doing her makeup and then putting on this giant cross made out of aluminum foil and this cream tweed jacket.” \n\nIndeed, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s affinity for large cross necklaces has sparked jokes and critiques, with many highlighting the juxtaposition between Christian values around honesty and the Trump administration’s tenuous relationship with the truth. \n\nPuffy Sleeves And Prairie Dresses\n\nStyle watchers say long dresses with puffy sleeves ― sometimes called gigot or leg-of-mutton sleeves ― have become another hallmark of MAGA-coded style, particularly with pastel palettes and soft florals. \n\n“There’s a strong visual nostalgia at play,” Chan said. “As Carolyn Bessette’s 1990s minimalism resurfaces with pencil skirts, tall boots and headbands, it sits alongside an even more idealized ‘trad wife’ look that borrows from the 1800s or 1950s ― pastel dresses, Southern femininity, and a lifestyle narrative centered on domesticity.”\n\nShe pointed to the rising demand for equestrian boots and knee-length skirts, which she sees as signaling “polish, tradition and control rather than rebellion.” Silhouettes are shifting with longer hemlines, buttoned-up shifts and modest proportions. It all mirrors “a broader cultural return to traditionalism,” Chan noted. \n\n“On social media, especially TikTok, aesthetics like trad wife, clean girl, coquette and old money amplify this look and repackage conservative values as aspirational and nostalgic, particularly for younger audiences,” Chan said. “What this really shows is how fashion has become a quiet but powerful way of expressing social and political alignment often without people even realizing they’re doing it.”\n\nIndeed, the move toward modesty coincides with the rise of tradwife influencers who promote traditional gender roles in a way that might not initially read as political ― but are deeply intertwined with right-wing cultural ideology. \n\nUsha Vance wore a puff sleeve midi dress from Tuckernuck to meet Pope Leo in May (though in the color black, per protocol for official meetings with the pontiff). \n\n“They LOVE a long dress with big puffy sleeves,” Lambert said. “When you look at the puffy sleeves and ditsy little patterns,” it’s very much like what you would dress a little girl in. It’s like those Lilly Pulitzer Mommy and Me dresses. It feels childish.”\n\nThis infantilizing element of today’s conservative fashion is echoed in Hart’s video breaking down the political signals in accessories, in which she notes that girlish headbands and “anything with a bow” reads as Republican today. \n\nBut Lambert also sees a coquettishness to the trend of long prairie dresses with puffy sleeves, particularly with the more “milkmaid-style” pieces. \n\n“They feel very much male gaze-coded,” Lambert said. “There’s nothing wrong with wearing a milkmaid dress, but it feels obvious why conservative women would ― they think it looks good for men.”\n\nIn that sense, MAGA-coded fashion isn’t just about looking conservative. It’s about signaling who power is for, who it centers and who it excludes.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maga-coded-clothing-style_l_695ebf03e4b05f1e1aab565c?origin=top-ad-recirc","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6968175b1700004664aacc6c.png?cache=tVZMlm48Ev&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 12:00:17","author":"Caroline Bologna","authors":["Caroline Bologna"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.377},{"id":393204762,"title":"Are You Wearing A MAGA-Coded Outfit? Here's How To Tell.","text":"When people think about MAGA aesthetics, beauty often comes up first ― from the oft-criticized “conservative girl makeup” to the so-called “Mar-a-Lago Face” trend in cosmetic surgery. But style watchers say politics can also show up clearly in clothing.\n\n“When I look at fashion today, clothes become a kind of visual language,” Edith Chan, a celebrity stylist and image consultant, told HuffPost. “It communicates values, identity and sometimes politics without a single word being spoken.”\n\nOn one end of the spectrum are overt markers like MAGA hats, campaign T-shirts and slogan-heavy merch. Loud garments drenched in red, white and blue also carry a strong association with conservative politics in the modern age.\n\n“But what I find more interesting are the subtle signals, the ones that aren’t political on their own, but start to feel coded in certain contexts,” Chan said. \n\nBelow, fashion historians, stylists and cultural critics break down the pieces, brands and aesthetics most commonly associated with MAGA-coded style for women ― and why they’ve taken on this meaning today.\n\nOf course, none of these signals are hard-and-fast rules. People across the political spectrum wear the same brands, garments and materials. But in today’s hyper-polarized environment, fashion choices increasingly read as cultural shorthand, whether the wearers intend that or not.\n\nTweed jackets, dresses and Chanel‑adjacent silhouettes seem to have become staples of MAGA‑coded style ― perhaps fittingly so, given Coco Chanel’s complicated political history.\n\n“MAGA got super into searching ‘old money style’ during 2020 and never evolved past it ― mind you, people with old money are not Googling ‘old money style,’” said political commentator and social media personality Suzanne Lambert. “Their sustained hyperfixation seems to be the tweed dress with the buttons on each side, usually with a high collar that cuts off at the neck and makes it look too wide. I think those tweed dresses are becoming the equivalent of a MAGA hat.”\n\nThe irony, she noted, is that many of the icons behind this look ― including First Lady Jackie Kennedy ― were Democrats and part of a coastal elite establishment that MAGA politics publicly rails against. And many of today’s versions rely on mass-market or fast-fashion reproductions, a sort of “Shein Chanel,” if you will. \n\n“There are these really tragic Amazon dupes that are mostly polyester,” Lambert said. “But so many of these Republican staffers working on the Hill very much want to emulate that aesthetic. They don’t even really understand what they are trying to emulate. They just know that it seems aspirational.”\n\nAt higher levels of conservative politics, that tweed often comes with a heftier price tag, as seen in Attorney General Pam Bondi’s jackets or the Oscar de la Renta pieces favored by Fox News personalities. On the fictional side, the wealthy conservative “Gilmore Girls” matriarch Emily Gilmore sported many expensive tweed jackets. \n\n“It’s this classic look that we associate with conservatism today, very feminine and clean,” said public historian Einav Rabinovitch-Fox. “It’s signaling that these women are maintaining more traditional gender roles, like the Chanel suit is this very traditional, conservative, even sort of old look.”\n\nFormer first lady Nancy Reagan wore her fair share of tweed jackets and skirt suits, projecting a look that balanced softness with authority ― polished, feminine and firmly within traditional expectations of womanhood. That visual language continues to shape how conservative women in power dress today.\n\n“It’s a feminine iteration of the traditionally masculine garment ― the suit,” said Maureen Lehto Brewster, an assistant professor of fashion merchandising at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. “Women in politics have always had to straddle a double bind of gender and double bind of fashion. Do you wear a suit? If so, what kind of suit do you wear? A skirt suit?”\n\nRather than adopting overtly masculine tailoring, Lehto Brewster said many mainstream Republican women now opt for what critics have dubbed the “Republican Barbie” aesthetic.\n\n“It’s almost like a Fox News anchor look ― throwing out the suit entirely and dressing in this overtly feminine way to reassert patriarchal dominance,” she said. \n\nThat emphasis on masculine dominance is consistent with Trump administration policies and positions. Lehto Brewster also believes the old money aesthetic plays into the MAGA movement’s racial politics. \n\n“It’s all very class coded,” she said. “A lot of these young women express wanting to look ‘classy,’ but that’s also a very racially coded thing ― who gets to claim that, and who doesn’t.”\n\nOne of the most popular tweed dresses among D.C. conservatives is the $298 “Jackie” shift dress from Tuckernuck, a clothing and lifestyle retailer selling a preppy aesthetic that the founders describe as “classic,” “timeless” and “all American.”\n\nDespite leadership that appears politically liberal, the brand has become a staple among conservative women, from Fox News anchors to prominent figures in the Trump administration. The Daily Beast dubbed Tuckernuck “The Brand Dressing MAGA’s Leading Ladies ― Whether It Likes It or Not.”\n\n“I think Tuckernuck has entered the cultural conversation around MAGA fashion less because of overt politics and more because of what it visually represents,” said Chan. “The brand positions itself as ‘your one-stop shop for a fun, full life,’ and that life is clearly framed through an East Coast, upper-middle-class lens ― classic, heritage-inspired, preppy and aspirational.”\n\nEven the brand name is a nod to East Coast elitism: Tuckernuck is a privately owned island near Nantucket, the affluent New England destination where the founders summered as children.\n\nAlthough that coastal elitism might seem at odds with MAGA’s populist rhetoric, conservative figures appear drawn to the brand’s aesthetic of privilege, stability, femininity and reliability over trend or novelty.\n\n“Tuckernuck doesn’t promote MAGA ideology directly, but its aesthetic aligns closely with values often associated with modern conservatism ― tradition, respectability, family life and understated wealth,” Chan said. “In today’s polarized climate, fashion like this becomes read politically, whether the brand intends it or not.”\n\nLambert called Tuckernuck a “safe” brand that takes the guesswork out of fashion, and offers an ease and predictability that speaks to the conservative ethos. \n\n“I love Tuckernuck and actually wear a lot of it ― while also recognizing it’s definitely Republican-coded,” she said. “You might not look like the trendiest girl at the party in Tuckernuck, but the silhouettes and fit are consistent and modest, which is helpful particularly in a Hill setting.”\n\nShe also pointed to the jarring contrast between the brand’s “demure” image and the actions of some of its most visible wearers. Donning these “corporate feminine” looks are outspoken political figures who use their power and platforms to promote controversial policies that cause harm.\n\n“When you think about Tuckernuck and then you look at what the Trump administration is doing, it’s pretty obvious that Republicans wearing Tuckernuck is more about assimilation and distraction than curating one’s own style,” Lambert said. “There’s something particularly eerie about Kristi Noem wearing a number you might wear to a girl’s boozy brunch while also being someone who shot her own dog and stands by ICE murdering an American citizen.”\n\nLoud Luxury Handbags\n\nWhile old money style typically favors “quiet luxury,” the MAGA version seems to mix in conspicuous branding. \n\n“I’m going to dive in on Karoline Leavitt because right now, she is the person facing the public every day justifying the decisions of the Trump administration,” said style and cultural commentator Chelsea Perry. “Her White House style so far has favored a few of the big international luxury brands ― like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Jimmy Choo.”\n\nPerry joined other critics in noting that this affinity for European luxury designers seems to contradict the Trump administration’s “Made in America” policies and rhetoric.\n\n“They’re also designers that even people that don’t spend five hours a day on Pinterest would clock as expensive. Loud luxury,” Perry added. \n\nThe loud luxury vibe tends to show up in bag choices, particularly the logo-filled Louis Vuitton and Gucci pieces carried by several folks in the MAGA orbit, including chief of staff Susie Wiles and first lady Melania Trump.\n\n“People with old money choose high-quality logo-less clothes and try to blend in as much as possible,” Lambert noted. \n\nFormer congressional staffer Beverly Hart, who analyzes the political cues in fashion on TikTok, has called the Louis Vuitton Neverfull “screaming Republican — Trump Republican.” Other loudly branded choices like the pink Marc Jacobs Tote Bag also go into the Republican category for Hart. And for Christian Dior’s Book Tote, she said “It’s giving, definitely doesn’t vote but goes to events at Mar-a-Lago.”\n\nThe fascination with conspicuously branded luxury accessories among the MAGA establishment contrasts sharply with the economic reality many Americans face today. \n\n“To me, it reads as an attempt at signaling economic prosperity,” Perry said. “A sort of ‘Hey! The economy is fine. America is thriving. Our policy decisions are working. You can trust us.’ This becomes more apparent when you look to the daily beauty habits of the regular, working woman grappling with the cost-of-living crisis.”\n\nPointed-Toe Nude Heels\n\nLast year, Women.com published an article that branded nude pointed-toe heels as “The Bland Shoe Trend That’s Taking MAGA Women By Storm (& We’re Begging For A Style Upgrade).”\n\n“Like many of the aesthetic choices favored on the far right, the shoe feels stuck in a bygone era.

The other vision—hers, as you might guess—is noble and pure.\n\nWarren’s account of the party’s internal divide is nonsensical demagoguery. Almost nobody in the Democratic Party—perhaps literally nobody—believes it should design its message to flatter selfish billionaires.\n\nBut the existence of an internal schism is quite real. And the fact that Warren, who has long styled herself as an intellectual and political leader of the party’s progressive faction, must resort to grotesque mischaracterization of her opponents within the Democratic Party is an indication of how poorly the argument has gone for her side over the past year and a half.\n\nThe actual claim moderates tend to make about why their party lost in 2024 is that Kamala Harris was unable to credibly separate herself from the toxic social-policy stances she adopted during her 2020 campaign—the highest-profile being her promise to support taxpayer-financed gender-reassignment surgeries for prisoners and detained migrants. She also did too little to distance herself from the Biden administration’s unpopular governing record.\n\nMany progressives reject that analysis, especially the first part, which implies that the party needs to abandon unpopular positions. They argue that the social views held by a majority of the electorate are (as one progressive strategist put it) “unacceptable.” Rather than compromise with the holders of those unacceptable beliefs, Democrats can simply focus public attention on the evils of the billionaire class, a message thought to be powerful enough to overcome the political drag created by any nonnegotiable social-policy stances.\n\nWarren’s speech articulates this strategy—though it might be more accurate to say that it carries out this strategy by ignoring or mischaracterizing the views of her internal Democratic Party critics and instead depicting them as puppets of the wealthy.\n\nIn her speech, Warren repeatedly argued that the moderate analysis of Democrats’ shortcomings is that they lost because they offended rich people and therefore failed to raise enough money. She decried “the temptation—in this moment of national crisis—to sand down our edges to avoid offending anyone, especially the rich and powerful who might finance our candidates.” She insisted, “A Democratic Party that worries more about offending big donors than delivering for working people is a party that is doomed to fail.”\n\nRevealingly, Warren did not cite any Democrat who holds this supposedly influential belief. Through insinuation, however, she tried to associate it with advocates of the abundance agenda. “Reid Hoffman is sending everyone he knows a copy of Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book on abundance and backing pro-abundance candidates,” she warned. “Running on small, vague ideas that may also raise costs for families—instead of on full-throated, economic populist ideas—is a terrible plan for winning elections.”\n\nIn fact, the abundance agenda is neither small nor vague, nor a plan for winning elections. It is not a political strategy but a set of policy arguments that have caught the attention of liberal intellectuals. The agenda, in short, argues that cities should permit more housing to be built, that the government should make building public infrastructure easier, and that the government has been too bound up by procedures and regulations that prevent swift action.\n\nThe abundance agenda is designed to make it easier for government to carry out the energetic work that progressives desire, which has inspired an earnest debate over its wonky particulars. Yet it has drawn withering fire from the left, perhaps because it points the finger at progressives themselves for tying up government in knots. In particular, it blames left-leaning interest groups for upholding well-intentioned rules that make governing costly and slow and that freeze the built environment in place. Progressives such as Warren believe in maintaining a firm alliance with the very groups that the abundance agenda blames.\n\nThe abundance agenda intersects with the political arguments moderates have made, because both the abundance proponents and the moderates decry the excessive influence of the groups. Many people who believe Democrats should move to the center also embrace the abundance agenda as a set of governing priorities. Despite their somewhat common set of targets, however, abundance proponents and moderates are not the same thing.\n\nThe biggest reason some progressives detest the abundance agenda seems to be that they, like Warren, genuinely adhere to the populist analysis of American politics, which takes it as axiomatic that every problem is caused by nefarious wealthy interests.\n\nAt one point in her speech, for instance, Warren claimed that Donald Trump “is trying to push out the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and complete his corrupt takeover of America’s central bank—so that it serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends’.” Is it true that Trump’s billionaire friends would benefit from undermining central-bank independence? The billionaires don’t seem especially excited about this aspect of Trump’s power grab. An alternate explanation for Trump’s behavior is that, rather than carrying out a clever plan to enrich his allies, he doesn’t understand monetary policy very well. To the populist monomaniac, however, there are no dumb ideas, only plots.\n\nThe abundance agenda, by contrast, is premised on the belief that at least some problems do stem from misconceived ideas, including the left-wing variety. The abundance proponents do not defend the role of the wealthy, nor do they imply that Democrats should steer clear of taxing the rich and regulating harmful business practices. (Most of the prominent advocates of the abundance agenda, including Klein and Thompson, favor such steps.) They simply call attention to the existence of some problems that are not entirely the fault of billionaires.\n\nIf you are unable to imagine any economic problem that is not the product of billionaire greed, then you naturally assume that anybody who sees the world differently is a tool of the rich. Yet the Democratic Party is completely unified on the merits of raising taxes on the rich and spending more on benefits for the poor and middle class. Its true divide concerns Warren’s fixation with wealthy interests as the source of all evils, and whether this political style offers the party a path to the majority.\n\nWe have three broad ways to measure the political appeal of Warren’s message. First, she has run for Senate three times. She has won those races. But because she is a Democrat in Massachusetts, one of the most overwhelmingly Democratic states in America, winning alone tells us little about her appeal. The election-data-analytics firm Split Ticket found that in 2018 and 2024, Warren ran 9.4 points and 10.8 points below the vote share that a generic Democrat would have attained—making her one of the party’s poorest performers each cycle. The database in that measurement does not include 2012, the year Warren first ran for Senate, but in that race she ran seven points behind Barack Obama in her state, even though Obama was facing Mitt Romney, the state’s well-regarded former governor, at the top of the ticket.\n\nSecond, Warren ran for president in 2020 and performed miserably. Lots of candidates ran in that cycle and failed to break through. Warren attracted huge amounts of donor support; the media covered her like a front-runner. Her problem was that the voters simply didn’t choose her. She finished third in Iowa, fourth in New Hampshire and Nevada, and fifth in South Carolina before dropping out after losing her home state. Her high-profile defeat did not inspire any obvious recriminations. Warren’s campaign memoir expresses bewilderment that her successful courting of progressive activists did not translate into votes among Black and Latino primary voters, without questioning whether those activists represented large numbers of real voters as opposed to just the progressive donors who funded their work.\n\nThird, and most revealingly, despite crashing and burning in the primary, Warren built enough prestige among Democratic Party elites to gain deep influence over both the staffing and the policy agenda of its ultimate victor. As the nominee and as president, Joe Biden adopted many of Warren’s campaign proposals, co-authored an op-ed with her, and frequently solicited her advice. “President Joe Biden is enlisting a small army of her former aides and allies to run his government,” reported Politico in 2021.\n\nHow did Warren’s speech process the humbling fact that her policy blueprint was implemented, and Americans rejected it at the ballot box? Mostly by ignoring the entire four years.\n\nThe moderates have blamed Harris for failing to separate herself from Biden—most infamously, when she told The View that she couldn’t think of a single policy on which she differed from him. In the speech, Warren’s only specific criticism of Harris’s relationship to Biden came when she attacked her for failing to pledge to keep Lina Khan, a Warren favorite, as head of the Federal Trade Commission. (Warren, of course, blames this decision on billionaires.)\n\nWarren’s speech also insisted that “we can’t rebuild trust by excommunicating Biden-administration law enforcers who, for the first time in decades, actually fought to hold corporations accountable for driving up prices.”\n\nExcommunication in general is a rather stringent penalty that ought to be employed only for serious offenses, and ideally by a church. Still, it is revealing that Warren’s only takeaway from the Biden administration is that the Democrats should bind themselves to keeping his staff in place indefinitely.\n\nWarren blithely credited the Biden aides with holding corporations “accountable for driving up prices.” But did this actually prevent inflation? Or did it at least make the public give Biden credit for fighting inflation? The answer to both is no. Yet this is the blueprint she demands the party follow into the future.\n\nIn the airtight world of populist logic, no evidence for Warren’s beliefs is necessary. Blaming corporations for any given problem is self-evidently correct, and failing to embrace this logic can be explained only by corruption. Warren has put Democrats on notice that if they resist her moral certitude, she will question their integrity.

In hopes of producing a balanced budget, at least on paper, Newsom is cutting back on spending for social welfare and health care services and college scholarships.\n\nThose steps alone are drawing criticism from many advocacy groups, but resistance is also heightened by his apparent unwillingness to fill in gaps caused by President Donald Trump’s cutbacks in federal support.\n\nThe reaction from left-leaning advocates was summarized well in a critique by Chris Hoene, executive director of the California Budget and Policy Center, an umbrella group of organizations that lobby for public services, especially those for the poor.\n\n“California’s state budget is a reflection of our shared values and our responsibility to care for one another,” Hoene said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the governor’s 2026-27 spending plan balances the budget by dodging the harsh realities of the Republican megabill, H.R. 1, and maintains state cuts to vital public supports, like Medi-Cal, enacted as part of the current-year budget.\n\n“Governor Newsom’s reluctance to propose meaningful revenue solutions to help blunt the harm of federal cuts undermines his posture to counter the Trump administration.”\n\nSome budget critics want new taxes to both cover the state’s deficits and offset federal reductions. To fill those gaps, any new levies would need to generate somewhere around $30 billion a year.\n\n“That means taking on corporations and billionaires, raising revenue instead of slashing budgets, and building a stronger California every step of the way,” the Legislature’s Progressive Caucus said in response to Newsom’s budget proposal.\n\nBoth of Newsom’s predecessors, Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger, supported new taxes to close multibillion-dollar shortfalls. However, Newsom has repeatedly rejected any broad tax increases to close deficits.\n\nUnions and other left-leaning groups are sponsoring two potential ballot measures to raise taxes. One would continue and expand a temporary tax hike on high-income Californians that Brown sponsored after returning to the governorship in 2011. The other proposal would levy a 5% tax on wealth of the state’s billionaires.\n\nNewsom has promised that when he revises the budget in May, just a few weeks before it must be enacted, he will both balance it for the next fiscal year and attack the huge deficits that will linger after his governorship ends. The chances of doing that without new taxes of some kind are — to put it mildly — almost nil.\n\nIf Newsom continues to reduce spending on services for the poor and resist new taxes, his lame-duck status could draw unaccustomed resistance in the Legislature. Likewise, his presidential hopes might face opposition from progressive groups both in California and states that are important to a 2028 campaign.\n\nAs both governor and likely presidential candidate, Newsom is snared in a political trap of his own making.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"He knows that being portrayed as a left-leaning cultural warrior from deeply blue California is potentially fatal.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2026/01/15/walters-how-newsoms-presidential-ambitions-complicate-his-last-budget-as-governor/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SJM-Z-COL-WALTERS-0115.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 11:45:39","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":393332492,"title":"Attacks on ICE reveal the Democrats&#39; true border strategy","text":"When it comes to illegal immigration, one essential truth must never be forgotten: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are in Minneapolis and so many other blue state jurisdictions today because of the damage caused by the disastrous open border policies of the last administration.\n\nAs a result of Team Biden’s catastrophic decisions over the course of one of the worst four-year periods in American history, President Trump was reelected to make America safe again, and that’s exactly what he is doing.\n\nMr. Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have promised the American people they will stop the invasion, secure the border, arrest criminals and deport those who have entered the country illegally. Radical leftists have lost their minds over these commonsense policies and the fact that heroic ICE agents are simply being allowed to do their jobs again.\n\nMake no mistake: A woman was recently fatally shot by an ICE agent she was attempting to run over in her SUV during an enforcement operation in Minnesota because of the rhetoric of unhinged Democratic politicians and crazed left-wing activists who don’t care about the law or public safety. The Justice Department and Congress must continue following the money to find out exactly who is funding and organizing these professional anti-ICE protests and hold people accountable.\n\nThe chief objective for Democrats these days seems to be to appear as deranged as possible so the woke mob can’t accuse them of being soft on the president. Irresponsible officeholders on the left at all levels of government are emboldening people to move against innocent ICE agents who are following the laws on the books.\n\nAlthough it’s tragic that a person’s life has been lost, what must be remembered is that protesters of ICE are in the streets because people in positions of power are actively encouraging them to fight. If this were still the Democratic Party of John F. Kennedy or Bill Clinton, federal immigration officials would be free to do their jobs in a noncontroversial manner without any violent resistance, and life would go on.\n\nThe inflammatory rhetoric coming from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is cowardly and completely lacking in leadership. Hours after the defensive ICE shooting was no time to raise the temperature and spew Trump-hating talking points; it was a time to cool things down, instruct people to go home and let ICE enforce the law, period.\n\nThe recent statement from the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association says it all: “Irresponsible, reckless rhetoric from political leaders attacking law enforcement has real and dangerous consequences for officers on the street. When officers are vilified, demonized, or used as political props, it fuels hostility, emboldens bad actors, and puts lives directly at risk.”\n\nBefore more lives are lost, Democrats, in addition to courageous Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, must step up and condemn the awful rhetoric emanating from the left.\n\nThe Democrats’ insane reaction to Mr. Trump’s successful illegal immigration crackdown is not only getting people killed but is also revealing. Why would a party make the decision to look so lawless, reckless and pathetic and so opposed to common sense in the eyes of tens of millions of Americans?\n\nWell, there is a good reason. The radical left is digging in with this dangerous position for the same reason it opposes ultra-popular voter ID laws and the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act: It must protect, as a matter of political survival, its yearslong investment allowing millions of illegals to enter America unimpeded.\n\nIt’s an arrangement conceived in hell. Illegal immigrants are told that if Democrats are in power, the welfare fraud gravy train will keep chugging, the drunken spending will continue, the social safety net will be at their disposal from cradle to grave, and the broken status quo will prevail eternally.\n\nIf ICE is successful in removing these illegals, then it would make it that much more difficult for a party out of innovative policies and ideas to win an election. It would also make it difficult for the party to count illegals in the census or use them to rig state congressional maps to favor Democrats.\n\nMr. Trump and Ms. Noem are right to stay focused, plow forward and support legality in America. We are a nation of laws, and the position of the Democratic Party on the issue of illegal immigration is, “We don’t care.” Never before have we seen federal law enforcement officers in our country systematically targeted, threatened and attacked for enforcing the law and doing their job to keep Americans safe.\n\nVice President J.D. Vance was exactly right last week when he said: “If the media wants to tell the truth, they ought to tell the truth that a group of left-wing radicals have been working tirelessly, sometimes using domestic terror techniques, to try to make it impossible for the President of the United States to do what the American people elected him to do, which is enforce our immigration laws.”\n\nAt the end of the day, Mr. Trump understands that America must have laws and a strong border or we will no longer have a country, and he is exactly right. We should thank God every day that he won the election in 2024 because Kamala Harris believes the exact opposite.\n\n• David N. Bossie is the president of Citizens United.

From the moment the South Africa native took over what was once called Twitter in 2022, the wealthiest human being on Earth has let neo-Nazi accounts flourish while repeating their insistence that white men are an endangered species as the world grows more diverse and minorities assume positions of power. In 2023, Musk accused South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa of “openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa” because political opponents sang an apartheid-era anti-Boer song during a rally. That same year, Musk posted, “You have said the actual truth,” to a user who claimed Jews supported unchecked migration in order to destroy Western — read, white — civilization. The mogul ended up apologizing for that babble, calling it the “dumbest post I’ve ever done.” That didn’t stop him from getting dumber ever since. Last year, X’s Grok feature pushed the white South African genocide claim to users on its own, then insisted the Freudian slip came from an “unauthorized modification” by a \"rogue employee\" that violated the chatbot’s “core values.” Who that could be, one can't say for sure. But then Musk opined in September that “relentless propaganda portraying white men as the worst human beings” is what leads some of them to transition into becoming female. All this garbage was prelude to this month, when Musk twice shared a post that stated nonwhite men “will be 1000x times more hostile and cruel when they are a majority over Whites.” Say this about Musk: He knows trends. And right now, the idea that white men are the most persecuted group out there is the Labubu of American conservativism. A widely read essay in the online magazine Compact labeled Gen Z white men “the lost generation,” adrift in a world where workplaces shun them in favor of minorities. The piece earned an endorsement by New York Times columnist Ross Douhat, who added that the “simple” way to not make young white men open to racial radicalization is by “just not discriminating against them” — whatever the hell that means. White men have fretted about their place in a changing America ever since Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1784 that a divine “revolution of the wheel of fortune” was “probable” against white people for their embrace of slavery. Fear of the sunset of white men has fueled lynchings, legal segregation, laws against immigration legal and not, lawsuits against affirmative action and so much more. Their supposed plight has been a major plank of Trump’s political career since his first term — but it has become an obsession of his second. His administration's social media accounts have regularly pushed posts lauding the days of Daniel Boone and Manifest Destiny while using the Ma and Pa American artworks of Norman Rockwell and Thomas Kinkade to push its noxious agenda. At the same time, as part of his deportation campaign, Trump has pushed the concept of forcing people who weren’t born in this country to go back to their birthplaces. But foreigners aren't the only ones bringing down the white man, according to this regime. In December, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Andrea Lucas released a video encouraging white men — not white women, tellingly — who felt they were victims of workplace discrimination to file a claim with her agency. Vice President JD Vance shared Lucas’ request on social media along with the Compact essay, noting in the post sharing the latter that DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) is a “deliberate program of discrimination primarily against white men.” Trump, for his part, told the New York Times this month that the Civil Rights Act — the 1964 law signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to help nonwhite American citizens fight decades of segregation and discrimination — “was a reverse discrimination” where “white people were very badly treated.” As a nongringo, I’m as amused as I am sad about this industrial-scale pity party thrown by some of the most powerful men, white or otherwise, on the planet. When Trump and his allies claim to have the interest of white men in mind, they don't really mean the sons of small-town Appalachia like Vance's ancestors; they're talking about white men like them: wealthy guys who want to get wealthier. They preach racial solidarity while gutting funding for SNAP benefits and healthcare, which will disproportionately affect poor people of all ethnicities. The Pew Research Center found that 51% of white Republicans with no college degree voted for Trump in 2024 — a significant drop from the 63% who did the same in 2016. No wonder the president and his allies are doubling down on painting minorities as usurpers of the white American Dream. “If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket,\" LBJ said. \"Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.” Personally, I can assure all white men — but especially the blue-collar guys — that the children of Latino immigrants I know don't plan to treat you all the way some of your grandparents treated our fathers when they migrated to this country in the 1960s and 1970s. Our parents didn't come for us to turn into chillones — crybabies — seeking revenge for past sins. In fact, many Latino men sadly did join their white counterparts in the grievance Olympics, as their drift toward Trump in the 2024 election proved. Cousins and friends who should have known better spent most of 2024 railing to me against trans athletes, Kamala Harris, unchecked migration from Central and South America, and other Fox News talking points when they weren't talking Dodgers and Raiders. None of them desired to be white, as wokosos insisted in postelection breakdowns of what happened; these rancho libertarians just wanted the fair shake that the colorblind policies would supposedly offer and thus cast their lot with Trump in a history-making decision. (Insert \"The Price Is Right\" losing horn sound here.) To see Trumpworld now limit male grievance to just whites threatens to destroy the Trump coalition in a year where they can't afford to lose much more support. Leave it to Grok to back me up on this. After Musk endorsed the post claiming nonwhite men will subjugate white men, a user asked the AI chatbot: \"@grok is this true\"? This is how Grok replied, edited for length but not the thrust of what it said: \"No, this claim aligns with the 'white genocide' conspiracy theory, which lacks evidence. ... It is speculative fear, not fact.\" Musk. Trump. Vance. Powerful white men.

Cooper was elected attorney general of North Carolina in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and then governor in 2016 and 2020. The Democratic presidential candidate at the top of the ticket lost in all those years but 2008. Peltola was the first Democrat since 2008 elected statewide in Alaska when she first won her at-large House seat three years ago. Brown lost his reelection contest in 2024, but received 47 percent of the vote in Ohio, compared to 44 percent for Kamala Harris. The Democrats also have a good plan to make Nebraska competitive. The party is standing down there while populist Dan Osborne makes a second run as an independent. He won 47 percent of the vote in 2024, well ahead of Harris’s 39 percent in the state. \n\nOkay, let’s not get overly optimistic here. Democrats would need to flip four seats to win control of the Senate, and they may not win any of these. Cooper is a great candidate, but Democrats almost always come close but narrowly lose presidential and U.S. Senate races in North Carolina. Alaska’s Peltola lost in 2024, and her two wins in 2022 may have been largely because the top Republican candidate was the very polarizing Sarah Palin. In Maine, even though Collins looks beatable, Governor Janet Mills has been very uninspiring on the campaign trail. Her Democratic primary opponent Graham Platner is untested and yes, used to have a tattoo of a symbol associated with the Nazis on his chest. And there is a good chance that the party’s left and center-left wings turn that race into a very divisive fight, making it harder for Maine Democrats to come together and defeat Collins in a general election. \n\nAlaska, Nebraska, Ohio, and even North Carolina may just be too pro-Republican to buck the party in a high-stakes Senate race. And Democrats have to hold onto seats in Georgia, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is strong but where the state leans red, and Michigan, where the retirement of Gary Peters has resulted in a very intense three-candidate primary that may turn ugly.","summary":"Democrats can’t ever seem to win federal races in North Carolina, but former Governor Roy Cooper is the strongest U.S. Senate candidate that the party has run there in a long time.

His legal team in Ghana has stated that the detention relates to the status of his stay in the United States, rather than any direct enforcement of Ghanaian charges.\n\nHe is scheduled to appear in a U.S. court on January 20, 2026, concerning his arrest.\n\nThe former minister left Ghana on January 4, 2025, departing from Terminal 3 of Kotoka International Airport in Accra aboard United Airlines Flight 997.\n\nHe was traveling on a Ghanaian passport with valid visas for the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.\n\nHis U.S. visa, however, was revoked in July 2025, according to the Attorney-General Dr. Dominic Ayine.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State reportedly gave Ofori-Atta until November 29, 2025, to depart the country.\n\nOfori-Atta is currently facing multiple charges of corruption and corruption-related offences in Ghana for his alleged role in the controversial SML scandal.\n\nThe National Democratic Congress government has formally requested his extradition.\n\nIn the same scandal, Ernest Darko Akore, born February 5, 1958, is also facing charges. Akore left Ghana on November 19, 2024, traveling to New York on Delta Airlines Flight 156, and remains in the United States on a ten-year passport valid until 2031.\n\nIn interviews last year, a source close to Ofori-Atta indicated that he had no intention of returning to Ghana to face trial, citing fears of public humiliation by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP).\n\nThe arrest by ICE, however, has placed him under legal constraints that may have implications for the extradition request.","summary":"On the morning of January 6, 2026, former Ghanaian Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Washington, D.C., marking a dramat...","url":"https://ghanaguardian.com/how-ken-ofori-atta-ended-in-u-s-detention-the-inside-story","image":"https://cdn.ghanaguardian.com/2026/01/ken-610x400.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 08:26:17","author":"Nana Yaw Prekoh","authors":["Nana Yaw Prekoh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.015},{"id":393094030,"title":"The health care debate is back in Washington.

On Tuesday, his interview with the president at a Michigan Ford factory attracted criticism for his failure to push back. \n\nTrump talked over Dokoupil and made a series of unchecked claims about the economy, while also telling Dokoupil that he wouldn’t have a job if Kamala Harris won the election in 2024. \n\n“You wouldn’t have a job right now. If she got in, you probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” the president told Dokoupil, before calling Ellison an “amazing guy.” \n\nMeanwhile, Dokoupil’s ratings steadily declined over his first four nights since his clumsy debut on Jan. 5, with viewership declining 11.4 percent overall.\n\nCBS News’s PR arm has touted that Dokoupil averaged 4.2 million viewers per night in his first week, “surpassing” the prior season-to-date averages.\n\nBut John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, who anchored the broadcast before departing the network last month, averaged 4.91 million viewers in their debut week in January 2025, according to Deadline.\n\nCBS said that the Monday broadcast delivered 4.2 million viewers, for a 5 percent increase compared to the 2025–2026 season-to-date averages.\n\nDokoupil railed against “legacy media” for taking “into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American” and putting “too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites, and not enough on you.”\n\nThe Miami-raised anchor, who shares a four-floor townhouse in one of Brooklyn’s most exclusive enclaves with his wife—MS NOW anchor Katy Tur—was educated at a $53,000-a-year prep school, and attended George Washington University and Columbia University.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Victoria Sunday/The Daily Beast/Getty Images/CBSHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries brutally compared watching new CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil to tuning into the MAGA TV network run by pillow magnate Mike Lindell.\n\nJeffries, 55, tore into Dokoupil, 45, on Wednesday for a short segment in which the freshman anchor presented responsibility for the Jan. 6 Capitol attack as a matter of partisan disagreement.\n\n“President Trump today accused Democrats of failing to prevent the attack on the Capitol, while House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused the president of, quote, ‘whitewashing’ it,” Dokoupil said last week, on his second day in the anchor seat handed to him by CBS News’ editor-in-chief Bari Weiss. \n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-coded-cbs-anchor-tony-dokoupil-brutally-compared-to-mypillow-tv-by-hakeem-jeffries/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/GL3LDJORRJHU7DEXI35PX3JQBU.jpg?smart=true&auth=518a61659dfc2fc8fc8646a248411bc62be368ce1742b87e5eee2ed01b4769ca&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 03:23:35","author":"Erkki Forster","authors":["Erkki Forster"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":393065348,"title":"Jeff Bezos Criticized by Countless Washington Post Readers Amid Silence on FBI Raid: ‘You Hastened the Death of Democracy’","text":"The comments section of the Washington Post’s website has been flooded with users criticizing the FBI’s raid of a Post reporter’s home and owner Jeff Bezos’ silence on the matter.

Apparently, the Horseshoe Theory — where each end of the political spectrum is separated by the distance between the ends of a horseshoe rather than at the ends of a continuum — is getting proven every day. \n\nThe latest example is best explained with a couple of recent quotes. OK, who made which of the following statements: President Donald Trump or California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the self-styled leader of the Trump resistance?\n\nA: “These investors are crushing the dream of home ownership and forcing rents too damn high for everybody else. I think it is shameful that we allow equity firms in Manhattan [to] become some of the biggest landlords here in our cities.”\n\nB: “I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes… . People live in homes, not corporations.”\n\nFor the record, A is Newsom and B is Trump, although it doesn’t really matter given the basic policy is the same — except perhaps that Newsom is unlikely to push the total ban advocated by Trump. Ironically, the president’s plan also mirrors the one from his presidential opponent, Kamala Harris. It was one of the examples conservatives used to depict her as an out-of-touch socialist.\n\nAt the time of Harris’ pitch, CNN offered some data: “While investors are still buying up U.S. homes, purchases in June fell to 80,000 units, according to CoreLogic. That represents a drop of nearly 50% from a peak of 149,000 in June 2021, reflecting a return to pre-pandemic levels. CoreLogic counts any individual or corporation that has three or more properties as an investor.”\n\nAnd CoreLogic’s metric probably overstates the size of corporate ownership. Mom and pop landlords often own three or more properties as investors, and many small investors create LLCs and therefore are technically corporations. According to an article in Dow Jones’ MarketWatch, truly large corporate buyers own around 2 percent of the nation’s housing stock. They have a larger footprint in some cities such as Atlanta, but it’s rarely above 10 percent.\n\nYes, when large buyers purchase properties they muscle out potential homebuyers, but corporate buyers are less likely to pay excessively high amounts than a buyer smitten with a fancy new kitchen. They aren’t hoarding properties, but putting them on the market as rentals. Some corporate purchases come in the form of REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), which are just a new take on the age-old model of small investors pooling their resources to buy real estate.\n\nWhen I used to invest in rental properties, I found it harder to snap up great deals on properties after big corporate investors entered the market, but so what? That’s how free markets work. People are free to buy and sell property or anything else. Competition ebbs and flows. As long as there’s a willing buyer and seller and no one is getting a special government-granted privilege, that’s the American way.\n\nTrump’s, Newsom’s, and progressive icon Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s attacks on corporate landlords are reminiscent of those local governments that banned Airbnbs because of short-term rentals’ alleged impact on housing supply. In that MarketWatch article, the Cato Institute’s Scott Lincicome called it “Populist Policy 101. Pick a villain and blame it for a real problem even though it is a minor, if not totally insignificant, player in causing it.”\n\nAnd here’s a similar explanation from CalMatters: “’It’s really hard to buy a house right now so people are looking for someone to blame for that, but I think (institutional investors) are more of a symptom of the affordability crisis than they are a perpetuator of it,’ said Caitlin Gorback, a University of Texas at Austin economist who has studied investors’ effect on local real estate markets.”\n\nThis scapegoating reminds me of Newsom’s approach to our state’s high gas prices: Blame Big Oil while ignoring that California’s highest-in-the-nation gas taxes, environmental regulations, and government-mandated special fuels formulation are the real villains. Gas prices in California will fall when the government loosens its grip and allows for greater supply, just as our nation’s housing prices will fall when government does the same thing.\n\nCertainly, any new competition for existing supply in an artificially constrained market could marginally increase prices. But the problem is not the new competitors, but the constrained market. California has the nation’s worst home-affordability crisis because it has made it inordinately expensive to build housing. The California Environmental Quality Act requires developers to produce voluminous Environmental Impact Reports for many proposed housing projects. CEQA also incentivizes litigation.\n\nThe California Coastal Act subjects housing along our coast (where the bulk of the population lives) to the edicts of another set of slow-growth bureaucrats. Local governments have, via legislation and initiative, enacted urban-growth boundaries and other growth controls. The courts have allowed localities to impose a punitive level of fees. Is it that hard to figure out why our median statewide home prices approach $900,000?\n\nAs I’ve recently explained for Governing magazine, California has passed multiple deregulation bills to promote construction, but they haven’t made a dent in the supply problem. That’s in part because the proposals target multi-family projects — and most Californians dream of owning a single-family home. Other states face similar challenges. But the problem in pricey, scenic towns in the intermountain west involve millionaire out-of-staters driving up costs, not corporations. Many of those communities have contributed to the problem with anti-growth policies.\n\nIt may be satisfying to blame Big Housing for our affordability problems and to seek easy solutions from our dear leaders, but usually the answer lies in the much harder and mundane work of implementing sensible regulatory reforms.\n\nSteven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute.

History is full of examples: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, along with Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Viktor Orban today. The list goes on.\n\nSo, where does US President Donald Trump fit in?\n\nIn our new podcast, The Making of an Autocrat, we asked six experts on authoritarianism and US politics to explain exactly how an autocrat is made – and whether Trump is on his way to becoming one.\n\nThis is the step-by-step guide Trump is following, tried and tested the world over by the strongmen Trump seeks to emulate.\n\nStep 1: hijack a party\n\nLike strongmen around the world, Trump’s first step was to take control of the Republican Party, explains Erica Frantz, associate professor of political science at Michigan State University.\n\nOnce a would-be autocrat dominates a party like this, they have a legitimate vehicle to begin dismantling a democracy. As Frantz explains:\n\nOur research has shown this is a major red flag for democracy. It’s going to enable Trump to get rid of executive constraints in a variety of domains, which he has, and pursue his strongman agenda.\n\nStep 2: recruit an architect\n\nEvery autocrat needs a clan of loyalists, strategists, masterminds – these are the figures behind the scenes pulling the strings. They’re unelected and unaccountable, yet they wield a huge amount of power. \n\nThis is the role Stephen Miller has played for Trump, explains Emma Shortis, a Trump expert and an adjunct senior fellow at RMIT University in Melbourne.\n\nI think what Stephen Miller demonstrates, and history has demonstrated over and over again, is that autocrats cannot rise to power by themselves. They often require a singular kind of charisma and a singular kind of historical moment, but they also need architects behind them who are able to facilitate their rise to power. \n\nStep 3: manufacture a crisis\n\nTrump has sounded the alarm that the United States is facing an “invasion” by dangerous gang members. He blames immigrants for the country’s economic problems and claims protesters are destroying US cities.\n\nHe is not the first would-be autocrat to manufacture a crisis to seize extraordinary powers. As Natasha Lindstaedt, an expert in authoritarian regimes at the University of Essex, explains, a strongman “loves a crisis”.\n\nA crisis is the way that they mobilise their base, the way that they can depict themselves as the saviour, as this messianic type of figure that is going to save people from this chaotic world.\n\nStep 4: beat the courts\n\nIn democratic systems, the courts are a vital check on a leader’s power. They have the ability to overturn laws and, in Trump’s case, the executive orders he has relied on to achieve his goals.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has targeted the judiciary with a vengeance. As Paul Collins, a Supreme Court expert from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, explains:\n\nIt’s all about presidential power. And that’s really significant because it’s going to enable the president to basically inject a level of politics into the federal bureaucracy that we frankly haven’t really seen before in the US. \n\nStep 5: suppress the people\n\nThe list of people Trump has punished or threatened since returning to office is long: James Comey, Letitia James, John Bolton, as well as members of the opposition, such as Adam Schiff, Mark Kelly and Kamala Harris.\n\nHe has gone so far as to call Democrats “the enemy from within”.\n\nAccording to Lucan Way, a professor of democracy at the University of Toronto, when a leader attacks the opposition like this, it’s a clear sign a country is slipping into authoritarianism.\n\nIt really has this kind of broader silencing effect that I think is quite pernicious.\n\nStep 6: co-opt the military\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has successfully expanded his power over his own party, the courts and the American people. Now, like many autocrats around the world, he’s trying to exert control over the military. \n\nJoe Wright, a political science professor at Penn State University, says:\n\nI am very concerned that getting the military to do illegal things will not only put US soldiers at more risk when they do engage in international missions in the future […] it’s a first step to using the military to target domestic political opponents. \n\nThat’s what really worries me. \n\nThis series was written by Justin Bergman and produced and edited by Isabella Podwinski and Ashlynne McGhee.

The Pentagon has since been testing the portable, backpack-sized device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy and contains components of Russian origin.The sources said Homeland Security investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of Havana Syndrome. The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment, and the CIA declined to comment.Here's what to know about the mysterious illness.\"My brain is broken\" The term Havana Syndrome is derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Cuba's capital. After the U.S. embassy opened there in 2015, media outlets started reporting on strange medical symptoms affecting U.S. embassy personnel working in the country: dizziness, fatigue, memory problems and impaired vision. Other symptom include nausea, migraines, head pressure, vertigo and ringing or popping sensations in the ears. Many people with Havana Syndrome describe hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location, with effects so severe for some that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs.\"My brain is broken,\" former CIA analyst Erika Stith told CBS News in 2022. \"We got this as a result of serving our country. And we deserve to be taken care of,\" she said.The U.S. government refers to the cases as \"anomalous health incidents,\" or AHIs, and officials have not confirmed what caused them. But \"60 Minutes\" has spoken with experts who believe the incidents involve targeted sonic or microwave attacks. Many of those affected believe that they were wounded by a secret weapon that fires a high-energy beam of microwaves or ultrasound. Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting the government for failing to provide enough support or access to specialized medical care.Who has been affected?More than 1,500 U.S. officials have reported experiencing the condition since 2016, including White House staff, CIA officers, FBI agents, military officers and their families. Cases have emerged in dozens of countries, and have even been reported in Washington, D.C.In 2021, a Havana Syndrome-style incident was reported in Vietnam shortly before then-Vice President Kamala Harris visited Hanoi. The U.S. embassy there said at the time that a \"possible anomalous health incident\" required at least one official to be evacuated for medical care, and it prompted Harris to delay her arrival. \"60 Minutes\" later learned that 11 people reported being stricken: two officials at the U.S. embassy in Hanoi and nine others who were part of a Defense Department team preparing for Harris' visit. While Harris was unharmed, some of the injured U.S. personnel were medevac'ed out of Vietnam.In another case, a State Department security officer who worked in the U.S. consulate in Guangzhou, China, told \"60 Minutes\" that he and his wife started having symptoms after hearing bizarre sounds in their apartment in 2017.The security officer, Mark Lenzi, described the sound as a \"marble\" circling down a \"metal funnel\" and said he heard it four times — always in the same spot at the same time of day: above his son's crib when he put him to bed at night. He described the sound as \"fairly loud\" and like nothing he'd heard before. He and his wife began to feel ill shortly after hearing the sounds. Lenzi said he believed he was targeted due to his work using top-secret equipment to analyze electronic threats to diplomatic missions. \"This was a directed standoff attack against my apartment…it was a weapon,\" he told correspondent Scott Pelley. \"I believe it's RF, radio frequency energy, in the microwave range.\"Questions about Russia's possible role \"60 Minutes\" reported in mid-2024 on a major development in the Havana Syndrome investigation: a suspected link between attacks in Tbilisi, Georgia, and a top-secret Russian intelligence unit, as well as evidence that a reliable source called \"a receipt\" for acoustic weapons testing done by the same intelligence unit.Lt. Col. Greg Edgreen, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who led the Pentagon investigation into these incidents, told \"60 Minutes\" at the time that he was confident that Russia was behind these attacks, and that they were part of a worldwide campaign to neutralize U.S. officials.\"If my mother had seen what I saw, she would say, 'It's the Russians, stupid,'\" Edgreen said.Read more: Havana Syndrome: Possible Russian role in attack on Americans, according to new evidenceU.S. assessmentsA U.S. intelligence assessment released in 2023 by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses — a conclusion reaffirmed in an updated review released a year ago. That review found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable. Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.In 2024, the House Intelligence Committee concluded in a report that the 2023 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \"lacked analytic integrity and was highly irregular in its formulation.\" The report said it \"appears increasingly likely that a foreign adversary is behind some cases of what officials refer to as \"anomalous health incidents.\"The Office of the Director of National Intelligence says it has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents and \"remains committed to sharing findings\" with the American public when it's complete.Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos said that \"a new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one.\"Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after he said he was stricken in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries. \"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"","summary":"Years after the first reports of Havana Syndrome emerged, U.S. officials have obtained and are testing a device​ that could be linked to the debilitating condition.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/havana-syndrome-device-what-to-know/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/14/359d19bc-ee3a-43e9-bbcb-5e5d434df0b5/thumbnail/1200x630/07273145ba6f2641ea8386b84cd77325/2026-01-05t181948z-1764470105-rc25viada705-rtrmadp-3-usa-venezuela-cuba-mourning.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 01:25:00","author":"Brit McCandless Farmer","authors":["Brit McCandless Farmer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.603},{"id":392969690,"title":"House GOP revisits Biden handling of Jan. 6 with new panel","text":"“My objective in this committee is to get the truth, without political bias, of what happened,” Loudermilk said during the hearing.\n\nThe stated focus of Wednesday’s hearing was the FBI’s handling of the pipe bombs placed outside the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on Jan. 6, devices discovered near then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’s route and rendered safe by Capitol Police. Federal authorities arrested 30-year-old Brian Cole Jr. in December, accusing him of planting the explosives.\n\nRepublicans have long argued that the pipe bomb investigation was sidelined while Democrats focused their attention on President Donald Trump and his supporters. More than 1,500 arrests of protesters were made during the four years of former President Joe Biden‘s term, including two federal criminal cases levied against Trump, all while the pipe bomber case remained unsolved.\n\n“The obsession with persecuting Trump supporters left no institutional impetus to get to the bottom of the pipe bomber mystery,” said witness John Nantz, a retired FBI special agent who now appears frequently in conservative media. \n\nDuring questioning by Loudermilk, Nantz went as far as to claim it was “likely” that the FBI knew Cole’s identity far earlier than the December arrest, pointing to cellphone data, license plate reader information, and financial records. He argued that leadership under then-Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray may have influenced investigative priorities.\n\nWatch as a 20 year veteran of the @FBI with a background in counter intelligence gives his opinion on whether or not he believes Wray's FBI identified the suspected pipe bomber. pic.twitter.com/roWkDTvfTB— Select Subcommittee on January 6th (@J6Select) January 14, 2026\n\n“I don’t think it’s just plausible,” Nantz said. “I think it’s likely.”\n\nSeveral Democrats on the committee countered that the hearing was premature, given the ongoing prosecution.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the ranking member of the eight-member panel and a former member of the original Jan. 6 select committee, called Cole’s arrest a “rare bright spot for federal law enforcement” under the Trump administration but said the GOP-led hearing risked interfering with an active criminal case.\n\nDespite the narrow topic, much of the hearing was devoted to a broader relitigation of Jan. 6 itself, including the legitimacy of the previous select committee, the conduct of federal agencies, and the delayed deployment of the D.C. National Guard.\n\nRep. Raskin: “There are some lingering questions. Most of them could be answered by Donald Trump, who’s never once testified under oath about what he did on January 6th, other than sit on his hands…while he watched the whole scene unfold on TV.” pic.twitter.com/c8U6yglXs1— The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) January 14, 2026\n\n“There are some lingering questions — most of them could be answered by Donald Trump, who’s never once testified under oath about what he did on Jan. 6,” Raskin said. “The truth is a resilient thing. We’re not going to put up with a pack of lies in this subcommittee and a bunch of conspiracy theories.”\n\nFormer DOJ attorney Michael Romano, who prosecuted Jan. 6 rioter cases, testified that some protesters had planned in advance to disrupt Congress, citing evidence such as an “Occupy Congress” image circulating before the attack. Romano also criticized claims promoted by the White House and conservative outlets that Capitol Police instigated the violence.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) attacked the legitimacy of the original Jan. 6 select committee, noting that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two of then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s Republican appointees — a move that led McCarthy to withdraw all GOP selections and left the panel without any Republican-appointed members.\n\n“The previous select committee established by Speaker Pelosi was a sham from the start,” Nehls said. “It was a total sham.”\n\nThe hearing drew an audience deeply tied to Jan. 6 controversies. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, whose sentence was commuted by Trump, sat in a reserved front-row section alongside Ivan Raiklin, a right-wing activist who supports Jan. 6 defendants. \n\nAt one point, Raiklin held up a piece of paper bearing the name of a Capitol Police officer previously accused by a conservative outlet of planting the pipe bombs.\n\nLegally, morally, and ethically.tune into https://t.co/ISoQ7doJ0Z now! pic.twitter.com/kxz8PZDbJc— Ivan Raiklin (@IvanRaiklin) January 14, 2026\n\nAlso present was Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer while attempting to enter the Speaker’s Lobby.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who is not a member of the subcommittee, observed the hearing and later said he remained unconvinced that the FBI had arrested the correct suspect in the pipe bomb case.\n\n“I was hoping to learn more details about the pipe bomb,” Massie said. “I think they’re going to just try to sweep this under the rug and say we got our guy and move on.”\n\nRaskin, meanwhile, raised the political implications of Cole’s prosecution, repeatedly highlighting Cole’s support for Trump and questioning whether Trump’s sweeping pardon for Jan. 6-related offenses could apply to the pipe bomb defendant if he is convicted.\n\n“Is it their position that the pardon extends to Mr. Cole?” Raskin asked, calling the possibility “unprecedented” and “corrupt.”\n\nDC PIPE BOMB SUSPECT SAYS HE SHOULD BE COVERED BY TRUMP JAN. 6 PARDON\n\nRaskin’s remarks come just days after Cole’s attorneys spoke to Fox 5 DC, indicating they plan to challenge the indictment against their client in novel ways, including by arguing that Trump’s broad pardon of the Jan. 6 protesters should apply to him.\n\nCole is still in the early stages of his criminal case and is fighting to obtain pretrial supervised release with his grandmother after a magistrate judge sided with prosecutors over their effort to keep him behind bars pending the trial.

Multiple federal courts have rejected parts of the order, including in a decision last week in Oregon.\n\nThe Trump administration is also suing 23, mostly Democrat-led states, as part of a separate DOJ effort to obtain sensitive voting data, a campaign that has set off alarm bells for privacy experts and Democratic lawmakers, who fear such information could be fed into the Trump administration’s deportation regime. \n\nThe president has used claims of fraudulent voting activity to justify his military-style crackdowns on mostly Democratic-led cities.\n\n“These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,” Trump wrote in a June post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump ally Elon Musk has sounded a similar note.\n\n“By using entitlements fraud, the Democrats have been able to attract and retain vast numbers of illegal immigrants,” Musk said in March on Sen. Ted Cruz’s podcast. “And buy voters. Basically, bring in 10, 20 million people who are beholden to the Democrats for government handouts and will vote overwhelmingly Democrat, as has been demonstrated in California.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump and JD Vance often claimed the Democratic Party was in league with non-citizen voters to fraudulently sway elections.\n\n\"A lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote,\" Trump said in September during one of the presidential debates. \"They can't even speak English.

What’s taking the House so long?","text":"On Tuesday, the Senate did something it rarely does: it passed legislation by unanimous consent. The DEFIANCE Act was inoffensive enough: a bill to ban nonconsensual deepfake sexually explicit images. \n\nMoreover, the bill was introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). It’s the latest sign that the lawmaker has grown her influence in a legislative body that once dismissed her as a firebrand but in which she’s now a power broker. \n\nThe idea of banning sexually explicit deepfake images without a person’s consent gained massive steam amid the proliferation of nonconsensual images of women and even underage girls on X via Grok, its in-house AI tool. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer warned its owner, Elon Musk, that it would take “fast action” to deal with the nonconsensual images. Indonesia and Malaysia become the first two countries to block Grok. \n\nAnd Ocasio-Cortez has some ostensible support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who voiced some support for the bill. \n\n“I'm certainly in favor of it,” Johnson told The Independent. “We've got to find the vote tally, but that should be a big bipartisan concern. We need to protect children online, and we need to stop these abuses. Is terrible. It's horrible.”\n\nAll of this would seem encouraging if the Senate had not passed the DEFIANCE Act during the last Congress, before it died in the House of Representatives. \n\n“I've spoken with Speaker Johnson. At that point, it's just about having those conversations to ensure that the legislation moves,” Ocasio-Cortez told The Independent. \n\nMusk remains an influential money man despite his rapid fall from grace in Trump world last year after running the Department of Government Efficiency and his venom toward President Donald Trump. \n\nThe two seem to have patched things up and Musk pledged to throw his support behind Republicans on New Year’s Day because “America is toast if the radical left wins.”\n\nAnd in December, the Pentagon announced that it would add Grok to its “AI arsenal.” \n\nOcasio-Cortez said she was not surprised by this.\n\n“I mean, they’re in business together,” she told The Independent. \n\nBut that doesn’t mean the legislation doesn’t have allies in the House, even from unexpected places. Rep. Nancy Mace, the anti-trans MAGA Republican candidate for governor of South Carolina, told The Independent she supports the bill.\n\n“I just had to have a Grok AI-generated image taken down,” she said. “It was sexually explicit, in my opinion, and disgusting.”\n\nAt the same time, Mace said that the problem did not stem from the technology. \n\n“It's the human who's prompting the technology to make these types of deep fakes,” she told The Independent. \n\n“I mean, I'm all over this sort of thing,” she said. “I've sponsored my own bills. I'm co sponsor of other bills. Like, we need to be moving fast on this.”\n\nThe legislation is a sign of how Ocasio-Cortez, who came to Washington after she knocked off House Democratic Chairman Joe Crowley in a surprise primary victory in 2018, has become a power broker and a leading messenger. \n\nDespite her ability to generate media headlines and earn the moniker “AOC,” she faced significant opposition from Democratic leadership. \n\nToward the end of Joe Biden’s presidency, she attempted to run for the ranking member spot on the House Oversight Committee, only to get bumped for a more senior member who ended up dying months into his tenure. \n\nBut she might have won the long-term war, given she joined the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which regulates two policies that matter to her: health care and renewable energy.

He has spent the past year bullying the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates faster. The campaign escalated on January 11, when Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chair, said the Department of Justice had served the central bank with subpoenas.\n\nMr Powell said he is now under threat of a criminal indictment relating to a long-running spat over the cost of renovating the central bank’s headquarters.\n\nThe Trump administration’s actions are the most striking assault on the independence of central banks in decades, in part because the Fed is the most important central bank.\n\nBut it is not just in America that politicians are encroaching on monetary policy. Around the world, a decades-old arrangement that has, on the whole, brought lower inflation and greater economic stability can no longer be taken for granted.\n\nThe modern version of central-bank independence emerged after the second world war. The “Treasury-Fed accord” of 1951 liberated America’s central bank from having to keep down the government’s borrowing costs, as it had done during the war.\n\nThe movement gained traction in the 1980s as theoretical and empirical research built the case for independence. Politicians, the argument goes, are tempted by self-defeating monetary policies in pursuit of high employment, inflated away debts and election victories.\n\nMr Trump is not the only populist in power with strong views on monetary policy. Takaichi Sanae, Japan’s prime minister since October, had previously decried interest-rate rises as “stupid”. Bond markets moved sharply on her appointment.\n\nDespite the Bank of Japan’s formal independence, what the government makes of monetary policy matters. In the 2010s the effort of Shinzo Abe, then prime minister, to end stubborn deflation included an accord with the bank, which hugely expanded its unconventional monetary stimulus.\n\nThat happened to be the right policy at a time of falling prices. Now Japan faces the opposite problem. In December inflation worries led the central bank to raise rates to a 30-year high.\n\nThough her rhetoric has softened in office, fiscal and monetary policy are increasingly at odds. Because Japan’s net debt stands at 130 per cent of GDP, further increases in interest rates will rapidly squeeze the government’s budget, demanding fiscal tightening, not loosening.\n\nElsewhere monetary populists are not in power but waiting in the wings. In Britain, both the populist-right Reform UK, which leads the polls, and the populist-left Greens object to the government’s high interest bill.\n\nBecause the Bank of England bought lots of bonds during the financial crisis, a big chunk of this bill now runs through its balance-sheet. Bond purchases were paid for with the creation of new money — in effect, new deposits at the central bank. The interest paid on these “reserves” has swollen correspondingly.\n\nScrapping interest on reserves, which both Reform and the Greens have suggested, would amount to a tax on lenders, depriving them of income while leaving them on the hook for interest on deposits.\n\nIt would turn the central bank into a cash machine for the government, which may push for more bond-buying to reduce its overall interest costs. That might not be a problem if the Old Lady kept her independence. Yet Reform says “everything should be up for debate” when it comes to the central bank, including government oversight of interest-rate decisions.\n\nThe euro zone suffers from a related threat. Independence of the European Central Bank (ECB) is guaranteed by treaty, making it better insulated from politics than any other major central bank.\n\nAlthough the euro zone’s overall debts are, at 88 per cent of GDP, just about manageable, the number is forecast to rise as governments shell out on defence and rapidly ageing societies while fending off populists who pan any budget cuts.\n\nThis is increasing the danger of another debt crisis in which the ecb must underwrite the most indebted governments. The central bank has already played this role, in the 2010s and again during the pandemic. In the 2010s it trod a fine line, guaranteeing to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro, while maintaining enough leverage to force governments to get their budgets in order. Low inflation early in the pandemic let the ECB justify bond-market interventions as necessary economic stimulus; it just so happened that this benefited the indebted countries most.\n\nTo the barricades\n\nIn today’s inflationary world, backstopping indebted countries is harder to justify. That might increase the central bank’s leverage over errant states, especially since nationalists in northern Europe would want less money-printing, not more. On the other hand, the most troubled country is now France, with debts of over 115 per cent of GDP and an annual deficit of 5 per cent of GDP.\n\nThe sheer size of the French economy — like that of Italy, another big debtor — would make it a formidable opponent in a game of chicken.\n\n“We won’t be able to avoid a discussion with the (ECB) about French debt,” Jordan Bardella, a presidential favourite from the hard-right National Rally, told The Economist last year. At a minimum, the bank would be caught in the middle of another political fight\n\nIn developing countries, the main recent case of backsliding has been Indonesia. Its government is not especially indebted, but is raiding the central bank’s balance-sheet anyway. In September the Bank of Indonesia announced it had agreed to “share the burden” of funding the government’s pet projects, by increasing the interest it pays on the deposits of the finance ministry.\n\nThe bank has been buying government bonds afresh, too, and owns about a quarter of the rupiah-denominated stock. In unreformed countries like Ghana, Turkey and Nigeria, central bankers have faced prosecution or other legal trouble in recent years.\n\nThat Mr Powell finds himself in a similar predicament is a sign of just how topsy-turvy things have got in America. Even a successful pushback, which began with the Fed chairman’s spirited video denouncing the renovation probe, may bring only temporary reprieve.\n\nMr Trump will soon name a replacement for Mr Powell, whose term as chairman ends in May. One of the favourites is Kevin Hassett. He has serious economic chops but is a paid-up member of team Trump. Even if the president picks a true technocrat, the prospect of personal reprisals like those against Mr Powell must send a chill down monetary policymakers’ spines.\n\nSo would a Supreme Court ruling to let the president sack Lisa Cook, a Fed governor accused of irregularities on past mortgage paperwork (which she denies). The judges will hear arguments in the case on January 21.\n\nYou might expect all this to freak out the bond markets. Yet America’s ten-year Treasury yield is more or less where it was before Mr Powell spoke out. This may reflect his newfound gumption, and newly voluble friends.\n\nSeveral Republican senators have said they would block Mr Trump’s nominations to the Fed until the case against Mr Powell is resolved. Mr Trump denied knowledge of the probe.\n\nAnother explanation for bond vigilantes’ quietude is the painful politics of inflation. One argument against the necessity of independent central banks is that inflation angers voters like little else. Jimmy Carter paid the price for it in 1980, as did Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nThe enduring “crisis of affordability” remains the bane of incumbents everywhere. One thing keeping Ms Takaichi from more meddling appears to be that looser monetary policy would weaken the yen, which is unpopular with a public fed up with expensive imports. Maybe. But relying on politicians’ restraint is a huge gamble. Sticking with independent central banks, which have proved themselves up to the job time and again, is by far the safer bet.","summary":"THE ECONOMIST: But can the public stomach higher inflation?","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/the-economist/the-economist-central-bank-independence-at-risk-as-inflation-and-populist-politics-threaten-global-economies-c-21313027","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-21313027/fe2e4d2e4be90645023826a440d40da4ed440cea-16x9-x0y0w3213h1807.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-15 00:18:26","author":"The Economist,The Economistth","authors":["The Economist","The Economistth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":393030314,"title":"What Trump’s War Against Wokeness Is Really About","text":"This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe most notable, and perhaps most effective, ad of the 2024 presidential campaign featured footage of the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, voicing her support for gender-affirming treatment for inmates in federal prisons. “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” the narrator concluded.\n\nThe spot was a crisp, 30-second encapsulation of one of the key Republican talking points of the cycle: that “wokeness” was sweeping the nation and upending established ways of life, and that Donald Trump would fight against it. Trump has since made clear that he wasn’t interested in just reining in what some people saw as excesses. He was interested in a wholesale rollback of bedrock civil-rights protections.\n\nDuring his recent interview with The New York Times, the president harshly criticized the legislation of the 1960s, which included the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin) and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (which bans racial discrimination in voting).\n\n“White people were very badly treated where they did extremely well, and they were not invited to go into a university or a college. So I would say, in that way, I think it was unfair in certain cases,” he said. “It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people—people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job.”\n\nTrump went on to say that the laws caused “reverse discrimination.” This idea that white Americans are suffering from widespread bias is a core belief of the revanchist right. In a Pew Research Center poll last year, 62 percent of white Republicans said that white people face some or a lot of discrimination. It’s not a mainstream view, though. Overall, fewer than 40 percent of Americans believe that white people face some or a lot of discrimination; roughly three-quarters say the same about Black and Hispanic people, and two-thirds about Asian people.\n\nThe idea that early-2020s “wokeness” went too far is more mainstream. Trump’s anti-woke campaigning appealed not only to the MAGA base but also to independents and even some voters who viewed themselves as left of center but felt that Democrats had overreached. The word woke was a useful tool because it had no clear definition—in one infamous moment in 2023, the author of a conservative book about “woke ideology” struggled to offer a simple explanation for what it was. This meant that people could interpret Trump’s rhetoric however they wanted—perhaps they were just looking for permission to not have to worry about anyone’s preferred pronouns. This anti-wokeness language helped Trump win back independents who had abandoned him in 2020, even as observers, including my colleague Adam Serwer, warned that this vagueness was a Trojan horse for attacking more popular equal-rights protections.\n\nAfter taking office, Trump did move to push back on DEI initiatives (in the federal government and in private universities) and transgender-athlete participation in sports; a veteran FBI employee claims that he was fired for displaying a Pride flag. But Trump has also gone much further than that, working to undermine structures that were in place long before DEI or woke became familiar terms. This broader project is one that keen observers of the plans laid out in Project 2025 would have known to expect—but that many voters may not have intended and may not endorse.\n\nIn April, Trump issued an executive order that throws out the theory of disparate impact, an approach that allows policies to be assessed not just on whether their intent is to discriminate but also on whether their effect is discriminatory. Disparate impact has been a core tool for civil-rights enforcement for decades. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division has been hollowed out (and has continued to bleed talent even this week) and has been reoriented around chimerical right-wing causes such as claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. Last month, the chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission posted on X to solicit complaints: “Are you a white male who has experienced discrimination at work based on your race or sex? You may have a claim to recover money under federal civil rights laws.” The administration is even trying to erode the foundational post–Civil War constitutional amendments.\n\nMeanwhile, the conservative wing of the Supreme Court, strengthened by three Trump-appointed justices, appears poised to demolish yet another pillar of the Voting Rights Act when it rules in Louisiana v. Callais. The case could allow states to eliminate majority-minority congressional districts, which some conservatives have argued is another instance of reverse discrimination against white Americans.\n\nAlongside these policy moves to undermine civil-rights protections, the administration has also resorted to old-fashioned racist rhetoric. The Department of Homeland Security has consistently published winking nods to core racist texts in its advertising materials, including the white-nationalist screed Which Way Western Man? My colleague David Frum reported earlier this week on a DHS post that alludes to a song popular on the far right. Quoting the song, the post read, “We’ll have our home again.”\n\nThe administration makes no pretenses about its demonization of immigrants; Vice President J. D. Vance admitted last year that he was happy to make up lies about migrants in Ohio. But Trump’s new frankness about the most basic civil-rights laws shows another way in which he hopes to restore MAGA’s sense of home: His administration is going to reclaim the pride of white people who believe that their country has left them behind, no matter who gets treated badly in the process.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nA Different Type of ‘Muscle Memory’\n\nBy Bonnie Tsui\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nRead.

But nearly a year into Trump’s second presidency, Gen Z, those born between 1997 and 2012, are turning on him.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten announced shocking results from new polling, which showed Trump’s net approval rating among Gen Z at negative 32 percentage points. That is a huge dip from his plus-10 net approval rating with young people in February 2025, shortly after the start of his second term. \n\nEnten said Trump was “falling off that cliff” among Gen Z.\n\n“My goodness gracious. This is, I said, a very swinging group and it has swung very much away from Donald John Trump,” the data guru said.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Trump had 42 percent of the vote among Americans born between the 1990s and 2000s in the 2024 election. While this was still 13 percentage points lower than his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, he did better with this cohort than in previous years. \n\nIn his 2020 race against former President Joe Biden, Trump only got 35 percent of the vote among this cohort, and when he was up against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, he received just 25 percent. \n\nOne major issue that concerns Gen Z, like many other Americans, is the cost of living. Trump’s approval rating on the economy, one of the main issues he campaigned on during the 2024 election, has sunk. \n\nAn AP-NORC poll from last December found 67 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy, while just 31 percent approve. This gap was smaller in March, when 58 percent of people disapproved of the president’s job on the economy and 40 percent approved. \n\nDespite the polling, Trump bragged about the state of the economy during an annual appearance before the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. The president said the U.S. had experienced “the strongest and fastest economic turnaround in our country's history.”\n\nInflation held steady in December at 2.7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, but grocery prices remained high. Home sales in 2025 remained at a 30-year low amid high prices and mortgage rates, the Associated Press reported.","summary":"Trump won over more young voters in the 2024 election than in his two previous runs for president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-approval-rating-gen-z-poll-b2900776.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/14/22/26/GettyImages-2255277125.jpg?crop=5397,3598,x0,y1&trim=0,0,2,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V4GSdEB7-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-14 23:29:42","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":393065362,"title":"The FBI’s Search of a Washington Post Reporter’s Home Crosses a Dangerous Line | Analysis","text":"When news broke on Wednesday that the FBI had searched Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s home, there was a “constellation of reactions” inside the paper’s newsroom, according to one staffer.\n\nSome Post employees were nervous, others angry. But the majority, the staffer said, had “questions about what are the practices that we all need to adopt in a world where the Trump administration can come take our computers.”\n\nIn conversations with TheWrap, Post journalists and First Amendment experts expressed alarm over the government taking the extremely rare step of executing a search warrant at a reporter’s home, a sign the Trump administration will bypass traditional ways of dealing with reporters in leak investigations and potentially stifle legitimate newsgathering. \n\nAnd even more worrying, if federal agents will storm into a journalist’s home and seize devices, can an arrest be far behind?\n\nComing on the heels of “other efforts to squelch freedom of the press,” said veteran First Amendment attorney Ted Boutrous, the search of Natanson’s Virginia home looks like an “effort to shield the government from scrutiny through brute force.”\n\nDuring his first year in office, President Donald Trump has personally sued the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and BBC; attacked journalists, including numerous female reporters; and overhauled the White House Press pool. Meanwhile, the Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, enacted press restrictions that prompted dozens of media outlets, including the Times, the Post, Associated Press, CNN and Fox News, to give up their credentials and exit the building. Others have sued over the revoking of press privileges.\n\nBut searching a reporter’s home, and seizing their devices, takes the administration’s assault on the press to a new and dangerous level. \n\n“This extraordinary, aggressive action is deeply concerning and raises profound questions and concern around the constitutional protections for our work,” Post executive editor Matt Murray told staff Wednesday in a memo. Though Natanson isn’t the target of the probe, which centers on a government contractor accused of accessing and taking classified documents, agents reportedly seized her phone, a Garmin watch, and two laptops, one personal and one issued by the Post. \n\nBoth Democratic and Republican administrations have subpoenaed journalists’ records in leak investigations, which, while troubling, still provides the opportunity to respond by legal means, potentially fighting back or narrowing a request. \n\nHowever, entering with a search warrant is not only “unusual,” says George Freeman, executive director of the Media Law Resource Center, but “unnecessary” given the more established practice of seeking documents through the courts. “You can’t help but think that it is meant to intimidate other journalists from getting involved in these areas,” he told TheWrap.\n\nNatanson had established herself as the Post’s “federal government whisperer,” as she put it an revelatory first-person piece last month about her dogged reporting on the Trump administration remaking the federal government and slashing its workforce — and the toll it took on her personally. Since taking on this critical beat last year, Natanson recalled amassing the contacts of 1,169 current and former federal employees “who decided to trust me with their stories.”\n\n“There’s great concern and alarm, both for Hannah individually and our reporting generally,” a second Post staffer told TheWrap. “She has been a star for us, stepping up bigtime after the departure of a lot of other writers through buyouts. She is both careful with sources and generous with colleagues.”\n\n“Our reporters have dominated coverage of the second Trump administration – in large part because of the deep connection between the publication and the Washington area’s federal workforce,” a third Post reporter said. “All eyes are now on company management and our owner [Jeff Bezos] to step up and aggressively defend Hannah and take a strong stance that we won’t be intimidated by the government.” \n\nBezos, the Amazon founder and executive chair, was once seen as a savior of paper, but his stewardship has come under increased scrutiny in recent years amid concerns that he’s tilting the paper — or at least its opinion pages — in a more rightward direction. He hired Will Lewis, a former top executive at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., as the Post’s publisher in 2023, and in the final weeks of the 2024 election, the paper spiked its endorsement of Kamala Harris. Bezos sat behind Trump at his inauguration last year, along with other tech and business moguls, and the Post reshaped its opinion section to advocate for free markets and personal liberties.\n\nMurray said in his memo that “the Washington Post has a long history of zealous support for robust press freedoms” and the “entire institution stands by those freedoms and our work.”\n\nIn a separate memo on Wednesday evening, Murray said that “what we have seen today reinforces the always-present need for proper source and reporting practices as we talk about in trainings and as Hannah has demonstrated.” Murray added, “We are working to schedule some refresher sessions for early next week.”\n\nSeveral Post colleagues praised Natanson on social media throughout the day and took issue with the FBI’s “incredibly disturbing” action.\n\nInside the newsroom, colleagues discussed other ways to support her, such as organizing a DoorDash gift certificate, in an effort to “make her feel valued and appreciated on a day when she’s under such judicial and national scrutiny,” the first staffer said.\n\nThe search warrant executed on the Post report also drew rebukes among competitors. David McCraw, deputy general counsel for the New York Times, said in a statement that that “raiding the home of a journalist and seizing her electronic devices are deeply concerning and portray a stark threat to free press rights in this country.”\n\n“Reporting and newsgathering enjoy protection under the U.S. Constitution,” McGraw added. “Law enforcement intimidation like this imperils the transparency provided by independent media.”\n\nThe Trump administration defended its methods on Wednesday. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the request to search Natanson’s house came from the Defense Department and the DOJ and FBI executed a search warrant. She didn’t name Natanson, but said the Post journalist “was obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information from a Pentagon contractor.”\n\nAnd FBI director Kash Patel similarly said the Post reporter “was found to allegedly be obtaining and reporting classified, sensitive military information from a government contractor — endangering our warfighters and compromising America’s national security.” \n\nTo be clear: there is nothing illegal about a reporter obtaining and reporting on classified information. \n\nNeither official named the contractor, who has been identified in news reports as Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator accused of accessing and obtaining classified intelligence documents. A DOJ official told TheWrap that “the focus should be” on the contractor, who the department said “was actively communicating with the reporter on his mobile device, and in this chat, there was classified information.”\n\nAs the Post noted in its story, “the criminal complaint filed against Perez-Lugones does not accuse him of leaking classified information he is alleged to have taken.” The Post also received a subpoena Wednesday related to the contractor, the paper reported.\n\nLast year, Bondi rescinded a Biden-era policy protecting journalists in leak investigations, noting that the new policy “contemplates the use of subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to compel production of information and testimony by and relating to members of the news media.” \n\nStill, she noted, “members of the news media are presumptively entitled to advance notice of such investigative activities, subpoenas are to be narrowly drawn, and warrants must include protocols designed to limit the scope of intrusion into potentially protected materials or newsgathering activities.”\n\nJameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, said in a statement Wednesday that Bondi “has weakened guidelines that were intended to protect the freedom of the press, but there are still important legal limits, including constitutional ones, on the government’s authority to use subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists.”\n\nBoutrous, who has represented journalists like Jim Acosta and Brian Karem during the first Trump administration, and is serving as counsel for the Times in its suit against the Pentagon, told TheWrap that the search of Natanson’s home is “truly an over-the-top intrusion on newsgathering and freedom of the press under the First Amendment.”\n\nHe pointed to Congress’ passage of the Privacy Protection Act in 1980, which provided additional protections to journalists in the wake of the Stanford Daily losing a Supreme Court case two years earlier after its newsroom was searched. The act, Boutrous said, “creates extraordinary hurdles and makes it unlawful for search warrants to be executed except in extremely narrow circumstances.”\n\nGiven what’s currently known, Boutrous doesn’t believe this search meets the criteria. “So it is very, very troubling,” he said. \n\nIt is indeed, and underscores the persistent challenges journalists have faced covering Trump as we enter the second year of his second term. Even as he has made himself more accessible than previous presidents, such as inviting Times reporters into the Oval Office last week for a two-hour sit-down, Trump has also shown a frightening willingness to control, intimidate and bully those who rely on freedom of the press.\n\nCorbin Bolies contributed reporting","summary":"Journalists and First Amendment experts express alarm over the government’s action, which one suggests is “meant to intimidate” the press\n\n\nThe post The FBI’s Search of a Washington Post Reporter’s Home Crosses a Dangerous Line | Analysis appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/commentary-analysis/columns/washington-post-fbi-press-freedom-analysis/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wapoimage.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 23:22:51","author":"Michael Calderone","authors":["Michael Calderone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":392912550,"title":"JD Vance&#039;s Chances of Beating Harris, Newsom in 2028 Election: Poll","text":"Vice President JD Vance leads Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom but trails former Vice President Kamala Harris in a potential 2028 presidential election matchup, according to a new poll from Zogby Analytics. Why It Matters As anticipation of the 2028 U.S. presidential election grows, early polls and betting odds signal a potentially fierce competition between Vance, Harris, Newsom and other top contenders. These preliminary surveys offer insight into evolving voter sentiment, candidate recognition and potential outcomes, even as most major candidates have yet to formally launch their campaigns. The competitive landscape may reflect party dynamics following President Donald Trump’s 2024 victory and a national search for new leadership, with many Americans reportedly undecided on their 2028 preference. What To Know The poll shows Vance with 42.1 percent of the potential vote compared to Harris' 48.5 percent, with 9.4 percent not sure. The survey also shows in a potential head-to-head with Newsom, Vance has 44.6 percent of the vote compared to Newsom's 41 percent, and 14.3 percent are not sure. The poll surveyed 891 likely voters in the U.S. from January 1 to January 7 and has a margin of error of 3.3 percent. The poll also surveyed likely voters on a potential matchup between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Newsom, Harris and Pennsylvania Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro. Newsom leads Rubio in the hypothetical race, 41.7 percent to 39.9 percent, with 18.4 percent of voters not sure. Rubio holds a slight lead over Shapiro, with 35.9 percent versus 35.3 percent, and 28.9 percent not sure. Harris is narrowly ahead of Rubio, 43.4 percent to 43.1 percent, the poll shows, with 13.5 percent of likely voters not sure. Another recent poll by CNN in December shows Newsom and Vance leading the top of the ticket for their respective parties as potential 2028 candidates. What People Are Saying Columbia University professor Robert Y. Shapiro, to Newsweek on Wednesday: “It is much too early to be comparing Democratic versus Republican candidates in the 2028 general election. What is interesting though too far from determinative is how Vance fares against Rubio for the Republican party nomination, since Trump has cited both of them as possible successors. Both surely want the nomination, as had Biden and Clinton as the possible successors to Obama. In that case Obama supported Clinton and not his Vice President. We see a comparable match-up now for the Republican nominations. Will Trump forsake his own Vice President as Obama did?“ Trump, in August when asked if Vance is the successor to MAGA: “Well, I think most likely in all fairness, he's the vice president. I think Marco [Rubio] is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form. I also think we have incredible people, some of the people on the stage right here, so it's too early obviously to talk about it but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point.“ What Happens Next The 2028 presidential race remains fluid, with major contenders on both sides yet to declare their intentions officially. Historically, most candidates announce their bids after the midterms, when the political landscape becomes clearer.

The United States’ kidnapping of Nicolás Maduro and occupation of Venezuela. The Iranian regime’s brutal massacres of thousands of citizen protesters. Minneapolis’ rallies against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents occupying the city after killing Renee Nicole Good. Yet, Dokoupil added, CBS had also “walked into not one, but two exclusive newsmaking conversations” on Tuesday, citing the episode’s preceding segments with GM CEO Mary Barra and, for an interview that was much lengthier and had earned more advance hype, President Donald Trump.\n\n“You may not agree with everything you hear on this broadcast, but we trust you to listen, and we trust you to decide for yourself,” Dokoupil concluded, parroting a favorite line of his before previewing the next stop of his 10-cities-in-10-days editorial excursion: the great city of Chicago, which he would be flying to via a corporate-chartered private jet.\n\nIndeed, if this Detroit stop offered any clue as to how the rest of the tour will go, it’s likely to live up to CBS’ initial promise to grant the Evening News’ upstart anchor an opportunity to “meet Americans face to face.” Tuesday night’s episode was dominated by Trump, who stood for his talk with Dokoupil amid the din of the GM factory, taking up nearly half of the half-hour broadcast. The CBS host merely alluded to conversations he’d had with plant staffers and other Detroiters, but none were shown or given due credit on camera. (Not even the autoworker who’d called Trump a “pedophile protector” earlier that day, earning both the president’s middle finger and a company suspension in response.) The “newsmaking” prowess of the chat—which saw Trump boast about “no inflation” and “ending eight wars” sans pushback from the interviewer—manifested primarily in headlines about how much time Trump took up, how uneventful the interview was (in spite of Dokoupil’s pledges to “ask the questions that weren’t being asked before”), and how Trump managed to get in a jab at Dokoupil about the reason he’s even here. (“If [Kamala Harris] got in, you probably wouldn’t have a job right now. Your boss, who’s an amazing guy, might be bust.” Perhaps the most truthful thing Trump said that day!)\n\nNot the most ideal takeaways from a segment where Dokoupil clearly wanted to get one particular confirmation from Trump: whether the U.S. would “get involved if Iran started killing protesters.” Horrific and barbaric as the carnage fostered by the regime has been, Dokoupil’s ethos of supposedly speaking for everyday Americans was belied by this push for “involvement,” considering that an overwhelming majority of U.S. residents do not want their country to take military action against Iran, even in light of the mass slaughter of Iranian citizens. Something even odder: During his closing monologue, Dokoupil vaguely cited “reports” that “as many as 12,000 protesters have been killed by Iran’s government and as Trump weighs intervention.” The primary report in question delivering this shocking figure is … CBS News itself, in an article whose authors admit they have “not been able to independently verify the massive death toll indicated by the source,” and which repeatedly presses a case for U.S. “action” in Iran. (Activists within the country, along with a U.S.-based human rights group, have estimated a death toll of at least 2,500—still a morbid and record-breaking number, but nowhere near the CBS figure.)\n\nIn fairness to Tony, this wasn’t the end of dubious reporting affixed with the imprimatur of the broadcaster’s brand. On Wednesday, CBS News’ official social media accounts posted a “BREAKING” update that the ICE agent who’d killed Renee Nicole Good had “suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident”—even though Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that he’d been “spending time with family” soon after a reported hospital visit.\n\nIf one thing has become clear at this point, it’s that you can’t expect any editorial improvement, or solid journalistic value, at Bari Weiss’ CBS News. As my colleague Derreck Johnson pointed out on social media, Weiss had personally seen to it that 60 Minutes should drop its much more elaborate, fact-checked report on the El Salvador gulag where the Trump administration illegally renditioned many immigrants—yet this anonymous, thin story for an ICE agent’s “internal bleeding” gets approved straightaway. (See also: the dropped 60 Minutes segment from veteran Anderson Cooper regarding Trump’s exclusive asylum welcome for Afrikaner “refugees.”) The Free Press, the ostensibly “completely editorial independent” website that’s also owned by Paramount-Skydance, ran a rant from Weiss’ wife defending the decision to drop the El Salvador piece.\n\nThe CBS News EIC’s recent memo to her staff, delivered on the eve of Dokoupil’s cross-country tour, laid out that she expects less for her outfit to “deliver the news” than to “*be the news*” through segments with “viral potential.” Setting aside the moral bankruptcy inherent to running a public service whose focus is intended to be all about itself, the only “viral potential” stems from the extent of Weiss’ efforts to give CBS a far more journalistically shaky ethos. At Sunday’s Golden Globes, host Nikki Glaser made a quip about the channel as “BS News” right in front of Paramount-Skydance CEO David Ellison. The legendary David Letterman, who started the Late Show franchise that was very likely canceled last year in order to make the Paramount-Skydance merger happen, eviscerated CBS News’ new leadership for “trampling” and “pissing on” the “integrity of CBS News.” George Clooney called out Weiss for “dismantling CBS News as we speak,” eliciting only a weak clapback from the EIC in response as she invited the actor to visit the studio.\n\nTo quote Sky Ferreira, everything is embarrassing. CBS hoped a “Whiskey Fridays” setup for Tony Dokoupil would earn a sponsorship from Jack Daniel’s, only for the liquor’s parent company to flatly deny that it would ever do such a thing. The stumbling and bumbling that characterized Dokoupil’s first day at CBS Evening News reportedly happened in part because Weiss was revising the script up until it was time to broadcast—keeping with her purported affinity for late-night-editing Free Press staffers’ pieces to her liking. (Per a former Wall Street Journal contributor, Weiss also tended to rewrite bits of book reviews when she worked there as an editor, in a manner that gelled with her ideological preferences.) And if you thought Dokoupil’s Tuesday interview with Trump was strange enough, take a look at the way CBS “sanewashed” the president when he spoke with 60 Minutes (post–Paramount merger approval) in November.\n\nMeanwhile, ratings have not been swell for CBS Evening News, Weiss’ first “town hall,” or even for the heralded 60 Minutes. But a Canadian rip of the yanked 60 Minutes El Salvador segment racked up some hefty viewership online, as have articles about all the leaks from infuriated CBS News staffers. Meanwhile, Tony Dokoupil’s trust with the American public remains quite low.

In a Dec. 26 text exchange, he allegedly told his date that Vance would be traveling to Ohio for a few days before heading to Florida the following weekend. \n\nHe also sent photographs from inside secure locations—including images taken aboard Air Force Two—along with messages indicating when the vice president would be landing.\n\nOne of the most serious breaches involved a photo Escotto sent of the vice president’s motorcade during an overseas trip, including an image showing President Donald Trump’s convoy at Emirates Palace during a visit with United Arab Emirates Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Multiple images Escotto shared also contained location metadata, including one showing the exact location of the presidential helicopter at JFK Airport.\n\nThose actions appear to directly violate the Secret Service’s code of conduct, which states that employees may not divulge classified or sensitive information related to protective operations.\n\nFollowing the release of the video, U.S. Secret Service Deputy Director Matthew Quinn told The Daily Beast that Escotto’s security clearance had been revoked and that he had been suspended from access to secure facilities and systems pending an internal investigation.\n\n“The U.S. Secret Service has no tolerance for any behavior that could potentially compromise the safety, privacy, or trust of our protectees,” Quinn said in a statement. He added that Escotto had been placed on administrative leave and that all personnel will be required to retake the mandatory anti-espionage training.\n\nThe video also showed Escotto expressing personal political opinions that went well beyond professional boundaries. Escotto, who worked as a Secret Service agent for former Vice President Kamala Harris, told the undercover reporter that he voted for Joe Biden and voiced hostility toward the current administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.\n\n“I hate that sh-t,” he said, referring to ICE raids under President Trump. “I don’t understand why they’re covering their face,” he added, saying he did not agree with the tactics being deployed by the agency.\n\nEscotto also complained about assignments involving the vice president’s children, telling the reporter that agents “go to school with them” and “follow them everywhere.” He joked that he felt more like a “babysitter,” adding that agents sometimes ask, “What the f— is this?”\n\nIn another exchange shown in the video, Escotto texted the reporter updates on his movements—including going from the West Wing to pick up the vice president’s wife at a location redacted by O’Keefe to avoid further security risks. Escotto ended the revealing message with a laughing emoji. \n\nQuinn apologized directly to the Vance family in a statement, calling the incident a “violation of their trust and privacy.”\n\n“The faith our protectees place in this agency is not something the U.S. Secret Service takes lightly,” Quinn said. “We are committed to taking the necessary actions to ensure that a similar breach does not occur again.”","summary":"Alex Wong / Getty ImagesVice President JD Vance is changing up his Secret Service detail after one of his agents was caught spilling sensitive security information with a Tinder date who turned out to be an undercover reporter.\n\nThe agent, Tomas Escotto, was placed on administrative leave on Wednesday after a 14-minute undercover video published by reporter James O’Keefe showed the agent casually divulging details about the Vice President’s travel plans and internal shift operations.\n\nO’Keefe said the woman Escotto met through the dating app Tinder in October was working undercover for O’Keefe Media Group.

Warren warns Democrats to deflect &#8216;too progressive&#8217; label","text":"BOSTON — Sen. Elizabeth Warren warned this week that Democrats can’t rebuild after 2024 by succumbing to political pressure from billionaires, urging a “big tent” rooted in bold affordability and economic populism.\n\nDuring an address at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Warren said Democrats were “wiped out in 2024” and can only win by committing to an aggressive affordability agenda and breaking with what she described as an increasingly powerful faction of billionaire donors pressing the party toward deregulation and caution.\n\nWarren attributed rising costs to Republican governance under President Donald Trump, citing tariffs, health care cuts and attacks on the Federal Reserve. But she also pivoted inward, arguing Democrats’ defeat in 2024 sparked a flawed postmortem driven by elite voices wrongly insisting the party had become “too progressive.”\n\nAccording to Warren, “too progressive” has become shorthand for opposing any agenda that meaningfully shifts resources toward working people. She said wealthy donors and party influencers are urging Democrats to water down policies on affordability and regulation in exchange for financial support, a strategy she warned would alienate voters rather than attract them.\n\nDemocratic megadonor Reid Hoffman argues that Democrats have alienated key sectors like Silicon Valley by attacking crypto and imposing heavy regulations, urging the party to adopt more innovation-friendly, business-oriented policies — lessons, he says, drawn from Republican-led states. \n\nWarren singled out Hoffman in her speech, saying he’s trying to influence Democrats to “stand with the billionaires for higher costs.” \n\n“Revising our economic agenda to tiptoe around that conclusion might appeal to the wealthy, but it will not help Democrats build a bigger tent, and it definitely will not help Democrats win elections,” Warren said. “A Democratic Party that worries more about offending big donors than delivering for working people is a party that is doomed to fail — in 2026, 2028, and beyond.”\n\nShe added: “What does it mean to focus our agenda on an aggressive economic vision? At its core, the goal is simple and easy to measure. It means boosting pay and making life more affordable for working people, building more affordable homes and cracking down on corporate landlords, increasing the size of Social Security checks, providing universal child care, passing price gouging laws with real teeth, guaranteeing the right to repair your own cars, machines and business equipment, strengthening unions, building universal health care, taxing the wealthy and giant corporations, increasing the minimum wage. We are not short on good ideas, and to win, every Democrat should be proposing concrete plans for lowering costs.”\n\nWarren ran for president in 2020, dropping out of the Democratic primary after losing across the map on Super Tuesday, including coming in third in her home state of Massachusetts with 21% of the vote.\n\nWarren said some affluent donors support higher taxes, stronger regulation and social investment, but said many use their influence to slow-walk popular policies, weaken enforcement and protect profits.\n\nThose donors, she said, exert power through super PACs, lobbying, media ownership and emerging industries like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.\n\nWarren placed special emphasis on the party’s internal debate over “abundance,” a policy framework popularized by a book by the same name by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson that emphasizes boosting supply — housing, infrastructure, clean energy and technology — by reducing regulatory and bureaucratic barriers. Supporters say it could revitalize the Democratic Party and make government more effective, while some progressives worry it glosses over environmental and labor protections in the rush to streamline projects. \n\nWarren warned that the concept is increasingly being used to launder corporate-friendly arguments under the guise of reform.\n\n“Abundance has become a rallying cry,” she said, not just for policy reformers, but for wealthy donors seeking to steer Democrats toward “making Democrats more favorable to big businesses.”\n\nWarren pointed to Hoffman as a case study. Citing reporting, she said Hoffman donated $7 million to support Vice President Kamala Harris while publicly pressuring her campaign to fire Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, who had made aggressive antitrust enforcement central to the administration’s affordability push.\n\n“Lina Khan is…a person who is not helping America,” Hoffman told CNN in July 2024, “I would hope that Vice President Harris would replace her.” He said Khan had been operating “outside the scope” of her job at the FTC. “Antitrust is fine…Waging war is not.”\n\nWarren said Khan enjoyed broad support from Democratic lawmakers, while Hoffman has ties to companies under FTC scrutiny, including Microsoft and Facebook. Although Harris did not promise to fire Khan, Warren said the campaign later narrowed its affordability proposals after pressure from corporate allies — a retreat that she said preceded Democrats’ loss to Trump, who campaigned relentlessly on lowering costs.\n\nCiting reporting from Axios, Warren said Hoffman is now promoting the abundance framework and backing candidates aligned with it, including arguments against regulations that could slow data center construction, even as families face rising utility costs.\n\nWarren also used the speech to revisit past Democratic failures that have fueled voter skepticism, such as the party’s inability to raise the federal minimum wage despite controlling Washington. \n\nDemocrats, Warren said, must choose between “politely nibbl[ing] around the edges of change” or throwing themselves fully into a fight over making working class people’s lives more affordable.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session after the speech, Warren sidestepped a question about whether Democrats should compromise on social issues, such as abortion or gun rights, to broaden their coalition. She brought the conversation back to affordability as people’s primary concern. “I want to be where the American people are right now,” she said.\n\nWarren’s team released a statement Monday afternoon that Trump called her after she delivered the speech.\n\n“I delivered this same message on affordability to him directly. I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it. I also urged him to get House Republicans to pass the bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support and would build more housing and lower costs,” she said in the statement.","url":"https://gazettenet.com/2026/01/14/sen-warren-warns-democrats-to-deflect-too-progressive-label/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/gazettenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/9ba2f1ee-de75-40b0-b7a0-c3c18c6211d6.jpg?fit=743%2C500&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 21:40:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":393110752,"title":"The Making Of An Autocrat: Podcast Out Now","text":"So, where does US President Donald Trump fit in?\n\nIn our new podcast, The Making of an Autocrat, we asked six experts on authoritarianism and US politics to explain exactly how an autocrat is made – and whether Trump is on his way to becoming one.\n\nThis is the step-by-step guide Trump is following, tried and tested the world over by the strongmen Trump seeks to emulate.\n\nLike strongmen around the world, Trump's first step was to take control of the Republican Party, explains Erica Frantz, associate professor of political science at Michigan State University.\n\nOnce a would-be autocrat dominates a party like this, they have a legitimate vehicle to begin dismantling a democracy. As Frantz explains:\n\nEvery autocrat needs a clan of loyalists, strategists, masterminds – these are the figures behind the scenes pulling the strings. They're unelected and unaccountable, yet they wield a huge amount of power.\n\nThis is the role Stephen Miller has played for Trump, explains Emma Shortis, a Trump expert and an adjunct senior fellow at RMIT University in Melbourne.\n\nTrump has sounded the alarm that the United States is facing an“invasion” by dangerous gang members. He blames immigrants for the country's economic problems and claims protesters are destroying US cities.\n\nHe is not the first would-be autocrat to manufacture a crisis to seize extraordinary powers. As Natasha Lindstaedt, an expert in authoritarian regimes at the University of Essex, explains, a strongman“loves a crisis”.\n\nIn democratic systems, the courts are a vital check on a leader's power. They have the ability to overturn laws and, in Trump's case, the executive orders he has relied on to achieve his goals.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has targeted the judiciary with a vengeance. As Paul Collins, a Supreme Court expert from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, explains:\n\nThe list of people Trump has punished or threatened since returning to office is long: James Comey, Letitia James, John Bolton, as well as members of the opposition, such as Adam Schiff, Mark Kelly and Kamala Harris.\n\nHe has gone so far as to call Democrats“the enemy from within”.\n\nAccording to Lucan Way, a professor of democracy at the University of Toronto, when a leader attacks the opposition like this, it's a clear sign a country is slipping into authoritarianism.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has successfully expanded his power over his own party, the courts and the American people. Now, like many autocrats around the world, he's trying to exert control over the military.\n\nJoe Wright, a political science professor at Penn State University, says:\n\nThis series was written by Justin Bergman and produced and edited by Isabella Podwinski and Ashlynne McGhee.

Two to go. The longest, most miserable month of the year is almost halfway over. Almost. Hang on just a bit longer, folks. Slowly but surely, we're getting there. Luckily, the #content well has shown no signs of drying up … yet. It's coming. Believe me, it's coming. But, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. For now, it's still firing on all cylinders. We do need to brace for no football until Saturday, which will undoubtedly be a shock to the system, but … we still get three straight days of football this weekend. Sure, the national title game and Saturday's 49ers-Seahawks game should absolutely trade places, but whatever. Beggars can't be choosers, I reckon. Welcome to a Hump Day Nightcaps – the one where Florida pumps out yet another hot congresswoman because that's just what we do. It's called leading by example, Libs. Look it up! What else? I've got Trump's viral middle finger triggering the holier-than-thou lefties, Lia Anthony stops by class, and I cannot get enough of these insufferable dummies on Capitol Hill hemming and hawing over the ‘men in women’s sports' debate right now. It's amazing. Dan Z talked to some lunatic yesterday that I can't stop thinking about. These people are NUTS. Incredible. Grab you a hot pastrami sammy for National Hot Pastrami Sandwich Day, and settle in for a Hump Day 'Cap! Trump dusts off an oldie! I actually had a hot pastrami on rye a few weeks ago for the first time in years, and I gotta say … it holds up. Throw a little thousand island on that bad boy to Rachel it up, and you've got yourself a big few minutes. I have nothing bad to say about them. No real hot takes to add, either. It's just a solid all around sandwich. Now, let's get started. I can't get enough of Trump flipping off the snot-nosed Ford worker and telling him ‘F--k you’ yesterday. The Libs are currently in a meltdown over it. MSNBC (or MS Now, as it's now stupidly called) put together an actual PANEL to break it all down: Amazing. And by the way, the #FreeSpeechWarriors who want to play \"GOTCHA!\" now that this idiot's been suspended have no legs to stand on here. He was suspended because he did this WHILE ON THE CLOCK! You lose your right to free speech when you're on your employer's dime. I'm a firm believer in that. A free speech violation, in my mind, would've been if this lunatic tweeted out that Trump was a \"pedo protector\" during non-work hours, and THEN got suspended by Ford. That would've been silly. But if you're gonna be dumb enough to shout at a sitting president while working, you have to deal with the fallout. PS: The insufferable #MOB not only started a GoFundMe (!!!) for this idiot, but it's since raised more than $300,000. If that doesn't tell you EVERYTHING you need to know about the Libs, I can't help you. PPS: Weirdly, the Dems were largely silent back in 2020 when Joe Biden went on absolute rampage whilst on the campaign trail. Odd how they didn't freak out over this: What a day for the Libs on Capitol Hill Look at a young and SPRY Joe Biden! The damage done to that man between 2020 and 2024 will need to be studied. He could barely move by the end of his term. Incredible. Personally, I advocate for both approaches. I'm so tired of the whole \"bring decency back to the White House\" line the Libs try to sell me all the time. Get outta here with that. This is 2026. It's a different world. Politics ain't what it used to be. It's eat or be eaten. If you can call someone Hitler for years, try to kill him, and then call him a pedo protector … I personally think a middle finger and a \"f--k you\" is your BEST possible outcome as far as consequences go. Could've been way worse. Cry harder, Libs. But don't you dare lecture us. Speaking of lecturing … the word-salad in these two clips from the tree-hugger and the fake scientist would make Kamala Harris PROUD: Sydney, Steve, Kristin & Catalina! Just amazing. Dan Z asks this dude a simple question, and he literally will not answer it. Just won't do it. Neither will the dummy inside the building. And that's because they can't. Here we go class. You ready? \"They don't believe ANYTHING they say.\" Ever, ever, ever. They know it's a BS argument and a ridiculous thing to be defending, but the Libs simply cannot admit it. They can't. They won't. So, instead, we get pivots to climate change and posturing. It's been 14 months since they got drubbed in the election, and they STILL haven't learned. How lucky are we? OK, let's rapid-fire this Hump Day into a Hump Night. First up? I didn't know the Ravens' owner was a mob boss. Did you? This dude is NUTS: This dude is incredible. I can't believe I'm stuck with insufferable John Henry, who has run the Red Sox into the ground while he counts his Libs dollars from the Boston Globe, while the Ravens have this demon running the show. I've talked about \"F-U money\" in this class before. This, boys and girls, is someone who has \"F-U money.\" Love this animal. Speaking of my Red Sox … at least we have Lia Anthony: Good to see Roman Anthony's sister is having a nice offseason while the Sox continue to act like the Tampa Bay Rays. Welcome back to class, Lia! You might have to play third base for us this season at this point. Poverty organization. Next? Last week, I asked you guys for a new show to watch with the First Lady. Nobody said \"Euphoria.\" Maybe you should've said \"Euphoria.\" So, apparently, Sydney Sweeney's character arc this upcoming season includes her starting an OnlyFans. I would imagine we'll get some decent #content out of that. Just a hunch. As for the show you DID recommend … Better Call Saul easily – and I mean EASILY – won. From Ben W: BCS is a masterpiece. I wish I could watch again as a new viewer. It is better than BB. Ryan N: Yes, Better Call Saul is a great show. Highly recommend. I personally liked it better than Breaking Bad. Dom Z: Better Call Saul IS better than Breaking Bad. I know, MIND BLOWN. Trust me. Jeff N: Great show. Amazing show! WATCH IT!!!!!! Rick N: Better Call Saul is definitely the right move. I'm sure it's a minority opinion, but Breaking Bad simply isn't very good. OK! I got it! I'm gonna watch it. Rick N. saying Breaking Bad isn't very good was stunning to read. That's crazy talk. But, I get it. We're gonna watch it … … right after we watch this new Netflix show my wife found, and is now forcing me to watch with her. \"His & Hers.\" There is no stopping this train. She's all in. So, Better Call Saul is on deck for now. But, we're on it. Two more on the way out, starting with Kristin Cavallari debuting her new black leotard for … some reason: Welcome back to class, Lia … and welcome back to class, Kristin! First cameo of 2026 for Kristin. Won't be the last. Not with #content like this. OK, that's it for today. Good Hump Day.

But at one point Trump derailed the interview to insist that Dokoupil likely wouldn't be helming the news show if not for his big victory.\n\n \"Tony, we have now the hottest country in the world. A year and a half ago, our country was dead,\" Trump told the anchor, referring to his predecessor Joe Biden's presidency. \"We had a dead country. You wouldn't have a job right now.\"\n\n \"If she got in, you probably wouldn't have a job right now,\" he reiterated. \"Your boss, who's an amazing guy, might be bust, okay?\"\n\n Dokoupil, who seemed confused by the president's remarks, asked him to clarify.\n\n \"That's how bad — might be bust,\" the president continued. \"I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn't have this job. You wouldn't have this job, certainly whatever the hell they're paying you.\"\n\n Trump's words alluded to Larry Ellison, a friend of the president and one of the world's richest people, whose family now controls CBS after acquiring its parent company, Paramount Global, last year.\n\n Since taking possession of the network, the Ellison family has gotten flack for implementing sweeping changes, including hiring controversial former New York Times journalist Bari Weiss to overhaul CBS News. Weiss, who was named editor-in-chief in October 2025 despite having no broadcast experience, has since faced criticism accusing her of deference to the Trump administration. Amid several programming changes, Weiss tapped Dokoupil to step up as a new anchor for CBS Evening News.\n\n Towards the end of his Tuesday conversation with Trump, Dokoupil pushed back on the president's claims, responding, \"For the record, I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.\"\n\n Trump retorted, \"Yeah, but at a lesser salary.\"\n\n Dokoupil's interview with the president comes amid his travels across the U.S., where he has been visiting major cities in his first month as the CBS Evening News anchor. Dokoupil has had a rocky start in his new position, including having an on-air flub during his very first broadcast.\n\n Hanging over Dokoupil's appointment is Trump's complicated history with CBS. Last year, Paramount Global agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The outcome of the legal dispute has sparked concerns about the precedent Paramount has set for media companies giving in to the demands of the president.\n\n Another concerning development soon followed. A month before the Paramount-Skydance merger took place, the Late Show franchise was canceled after 33 years on the air. Its host, Stephen Colbert, has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration. Though CBS insisted that the cancellation was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" skeptics have blasted the move as a conciliatory effort at appeasing Trump's FCC in the midst of the merger.\n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n Such criticisms were clearly on Dokoupil's mind before he signed on to his new role. In his recent New Year's Day message at the start of Evening News, the anchor asked its audience to hold him and the legendary CBS show to high journalistic standards.\n\n \"Today and every time you see me in this chair: You come first,\" Dokoupil said. \"Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS. I report for you.\"","summary":"The moment occurred during an awkward on-air interview this week.","url":"https://ew.com/trump-says-tony-dokoupil-would-not-have-job-if-kamala-harris-were-president-11885439","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/oPucsHGCgrxzPRV1znCevvUL23I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/donald-trump-Tony-Dokoupil-011426-3713b2421e484a19a70fae2a08d95dc8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 20:13:50","author":"Shania Russell","authors":["Shania Russell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":392989470,"title":"Markey, Pressley renew push to end qualified immunity after ICE shooting death","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Six days after 37-year-old Minneapolis mother Renee Good was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, Massachusetts congressional lawmakers Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley on Tuesday reintroduced legislation first filed in 2020 that would end qualified immunity for federal law enforcement officers. \n\nThe federal legislators unveiled their “Qualified Immunity Abolition Act of 2026,” which is a more developed version of a 2020 bill they filed in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis. That bill never passed.\n\nThe theory of qualified immunity has given officials a legal shield from wrongdoing or misconduct in their positions for decades. If the updated legislation filed by Markey and Pressley were to pass, it would ensure that not only state and local officials, but also federal officials, could be sued by victims for civil rights violations.\n\nThe two legislators said that the measure will help defend families who are being “abused” by law enforcement, including ICE agents.\n\n“When masked ICE agents are allowed to kill and harm people with impunity, we have crossed a dangerous threshold in our nation,” Markey said in a statement. “All too often, the flawed and judge-made doctrine of qualified immunity shields law enforcement officers from liability, even when they commit egregious misconduct or use excessive force.”\n\nMarkey said the updated act seeks to abolish this unjust defense in cases against federal law enforcement officers, allowing victims their rights in court.\n\n“With ICE agents trampling over our laws, our rights and our communities, we must demand justice and hold wrongdoers accountable,” he said.\n\nPaul Collins, a professor of legal studies and political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has a focus on bias and the legal system, gave some insights into the history of qualified immunity.\n\n“Qualified immunity is a controversial topic. On the one hand, some view it as desirable since it enables government actors — including police — to do their jobs without great fear of legal liability,” Collins said. “On the other hand, others view it as undesirable since it makes it difficult to hold government actors accountable for harmful actions, including killing another person.”\n\nHe said that qualified immunity was introduced to protect police officers, but doesn’t appear in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSince 1871, the law of the land has been that officials can be tried for their actions. In its passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, also known as the “Ku Klux Klan Act,” Congress allowed individuals to sue government officials, including law enforcement officers, who violate civil rights.\n\nThat changed in 1967 when the Supreme Court, in Pierson v. Ray, introduced the concept of qualified immunity, ruling that police could be protected if they acted in “good faith” with probable cause, even if mistaken. Since then, immunity has expanded over the decades.\n\n“The court further clarified qualified immunity in 1982, when it established the current rule, which holds that police have immunity as long as their conduct ‘does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,'” Collins said. “In short, qualified immunity is a judge-made doctrine that makes it exceptionally difficult to hold police accountable for actions that violate individuals’ constitutional rights, including instances of police killings.”\n\nBoth Markey and Pressley have been on the front lines tackling qualified immunity since 2020 when Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is currently serving a more than 20-year sentence, murdered Floyd.\n\nFollowing Floyd’s murder, Markey joined Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, then-Sen. Kamala Harris, then-Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass, and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (NY-12) in introducing the “Justice in Policing Act” to increase data collection on police violence and improve police training.\n\nIn May 2025, ahead of the fifth anniversary of Floyd’s death, the two reintroduced their “Ending Qualified Immunity Act,” a measure that died in the Senate.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Pressley said, “We cannot stand idly by while rogue federal agents — emboldened by the Trump White House — ravage our communities, brutalize families and kill our neighbors on the street in cold blood. Our bill sends a powerful message to everyone in America — citizen or not — that when ICE agents break the law, they should and will be held accountable. For Renee Good, Keith Porter, Nenko Gantchev, and every death at the hands of federal law enforcement, Congress must end qualified immunity.”\n\nPorter and Gantchev were also ICE victims. On New Year’s Eve 2025, Porter was killed by an off-duty ICE agent in Los Angeles. Gantchev died in late 2025 while in ICE custody at the North Lake Processing Center in Michigan, with natural causes being ruled the official cause of death.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Jim McGovern is also backing the bill.\n\n“I fully support the Qualified Immunity Abolition Act of 2026. Americans do not want to live in a police state,” he said. “And despite this administration’s absurd and outrageous claim that federal law enforcement agents have absolute immunity — whatever the hell that means — wearing an ICE uniform does not give you permission to shoot an unarmed, innocent mother in the face.”\n\nMeanwhile, in Minneapolis on Tuesday, federal officers dropped tear gas and sprayed eye irritant at activists during another day of confrontations while students miles away walked out of a suburban school to protest the Trump administration’s bold immigration sweeps.\n\nThe government’s immigration crackdown is next headed to a federal court where Minnesota and two mayors are asking a judge to immediately suspend the operation. No hearing has been set on the request.\n\nWith the Department of Homeland Security pledging to send more than 2,000 immigration officers into Minnesota, the state, joined by Minneapolis and St. Paul, sued Trump’s administration Monday to halt or limit the surge.\n\nThe lawsuit says the Department of Homeland Security is violating the First Amendment and other constitutional protections by focusing on a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants.\n\n“This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities in Minnesota, and it must stop,” state Attorney General Keith Ellison said.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, “What we are seeing is thousands — plural — thousands of federal agents coming into our city. And, yeah, they’re having a tremendous impact on day-to-day life.”\n\nDozens of protests or vigils have taken place across the U.S. to honor Good since the 37-year-old mother of three was killed, including last weekend locally. In Franklin County, demonstrations have been held in Orange, Greenfield and Montague.\n\nHomeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down. Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, responding to the lawsuit, accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety.\n\n“President Trump’s job is to protect the American people and enforce the law — no matter who your mayor, governor or state attorney general is,” McLaughlin said.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly defended the immigration agent who shot Good, saying he acted in self-defense. But that explanation has been widely panned by Frey, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and others based on videos of the confrontation.\n\nMaterial from the Associated Press was used in this report.","url":"https://recorder.com/2026/01/14/abolish-qualified-immunity-act/","image":"https://recorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/795b2f43-27b3-430e-ac4e-20533fe69ef9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-14 20:07:09","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.377}]}
