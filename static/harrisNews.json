The source claimed that both her presence at Sirius XM and her massive popularity have irked the radio legend, 71.\n\n“It’s completely turned Howard’s world upside down,” the source claimed. “He’s been in radio 40 years, and this change has really shocked everyone.”\n\n“Alex and Joe Rogan, these massive podcasters, have traditional radio guys stunned,” they added. The insider said Cooper is “female, she’s the next generation.”\n\n“That’s the future,” they explained. “iHeartRadio is desperately trying to find someone like that.” \n\nReps for Stern and Cooper did not immediately return Page Six’s requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate insider told the outlet that Stern is upset by Andy Cohen’s success at the network. “Andy’s interviews are regularly promoted by Sirius, while you just don’t hear much about Howard’s interviews these days.”\n\nThe outlet previously reported on Tuesday that the Sirius XM shock jock — who has been with the network since 2006 — may not return after his contract expires. “Stern’s contract is up in the fall, and while Sirius is planning to make him an offer, they don’t intend for him to take it,” an insider divulged to the outlet.\n\n“Sirius and Stern are never going to agree on the money he is going to want. It’s no longer worth the investment.”\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper’s star has continued to rise, as she’s interviewed nearly every relevant culturally relevant celebrity from Chappell Roan to Kamala Harris on her podcast.\n\nHer two-part documentary “Call Her Alex” — which follows her rise to prominence — dropped on Disney+ and Hulu in June.\n\n“I wanted you guys to see where I came from,” she said at the premiere, per a press release. “I think this was really a way for you to get to know me as Alex Cooper from Pennsylvania.”","summary":"\"He hates that this young bubbly woman is the big new thing,\" an insider told the Sun.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/08/09/celebrity-news/howard-stern-reportedly-cant-stand-fellow-siriusxm-host-alex-cooper/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/109410895.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/M46rUMMt-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-09 22:01:05","author":"Audrey Rock,mliss1578","authors":["Audrey Rock","mliss1578"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":349669032,"title":"LIFE:  How to make the Trump revolution permanent and save America","text":"Special to WorldTribune.com\n\nCommentary by Wayne Allyn Root, August 8, 2025\n\nFirst, let me start by pointing out that President Donald Trump keeps having “the best week ever” every week!\n\nHow great are things going for President Trump nowadays?\n\n— Trump-hating HBO TV host Bill Maher is apologizing and admitting he was wrong about Trump’s tariffs.\n\n— Trump-hating New York Times columnist Bret Stephens admits Trump is having more success than he ever imagined possible.\n\n— Trump-hating liberal TV host Chris Cuomo just gave Trump a grade of “A” for the start of his presidency.\n\n— And CNBC’s liberal TV host Jim Cramer was so shocked when he heard about Trump’s trillion-dollar EU trade victory that he dropped the F-bomb on live television.\n\nIf voter photo ID isn’t passed before the 2026 midterms, then the GOP has no interest in winning elections. Period.\n\nThings are THAT good!\n\nTrump has now blown by Ronald Reagan to become the most successful and consequential conservative president of all-time.\n\nBut as wonderful and fantastic as all this Trump success is, it won’t guarantee GOP control of the U.S. government for years to come — simply because Democrats cheat, rig and steal elections.\n\nIf Trump wants to be remembered as the greatest president ever, and the president who made America great again, he needs to set the GOP up to win for years to come, if not decades to come, and make his achievements permanent, and his legacy lasting. Here is the way to do it:\n\n1. PASS VOTER PHOTO ID FOR ALL FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\nThis is how the ball was dropped the last time Trump was president. The GOP Congress had the ability to pass anything they wanted from 2016 to 2018. Yet they never passed voter photo ID for all federal elections. That was the missed opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nThat was why the GOP lost the midterms in 2018 and then Trump lost the 2020 presidential election. Democrats stole both elections with mail-in ballots, ballot harvesting and ballot drop boxes. They beat us with fake ballots, all built around no voter ID.\n\nAnd so far, the GOP is repeating the same mistake. This GOP Congress can pass anything it wants for another 18 months.\n\nIf voter photo ID isn’t passed before the 2026 midterms, then the GOP has no interest in winning elections. Period.\n\n2. PASS CENSUS REFORM THAT PERMANENTLY BANS THE COUNTING OF NONCITIZENS.\n\nThis is another way Democrats are stealing elections. They count millions of illegal aliens for the census, thereby awarding dozens of extra congressional seats and electoral votes to blue districts and blue states — all based on counting people who illegally broke into our country, and don’t belong here.\n\nThis is how Democrats are stealing elections, stealing billions in federal funding, and stealing our entire country.\n\nNot only should we be banning illegals from being counted for the census, but President Trump should immediately order a new census because the current one is a complete fraud based on counting noncitizens. With a new census, based only on a count of U.S. citizens, Democrats would lose 30 to 50 U.S. House seats and dozens of electoral votes.\n\n3. DEMAND PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP FOR VOTING IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\nYes, Trump already issued an executive order for this, but executive orders only last as long as the GOP controls the White House. If the next president is a crazy, radical communist like Barack Obama or Kamala Harris, or a brain-dead puppet like Joe Biden (who is controlled by crazy, radical communists), all of Trump’s EOs are reversed.\n\nBut presidents can’t reverse a law passed by Congress.\n\nWhy would the GOP Congress hesitate to pass this law banning noncitizens from voting? This is the way to stop massive Democrat voter fraud that steals seats from the GOP.\n\nAs wonderful and fantastic as all this Trump success is, it won’t guarantee GOP control of the U.S. government for years to come — simply because Democrats cheat, rig and steal elections.\n\nRight now, with control of both Houses of Congress, the GOP can pass this law. But if we lose the midterms, the opportunity is gone forever. And of course, passing this law and voter ID is the way to guarantee we win the midterms.\n\n4. PROSECUTE OBAMA, HILLARY, BRENNAN, CLAPPER, COMEY, MCCABE AND ALL OTHER KEY FIGURES FOR TREASON, FOR THEIR ROLES IN RUSSIAGATE (AND GEORGE SOROS FOR FUNDING IT ALL).\n\nThis was treason. We don’t have a nation of laws moving forward if any politician can commit treason and be given a free pass. All 77 million Trump voters demand justice. You want to excite and motivate all 77 million Trump voters to come to the polls for the midterms? Indict Obama and Hillary Clinton and watch the greatest GOP landslide victory ever.\n\n5. PASS PRESIDENT TRUMP’S CAMPAIGN PLEDGE OF “NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR SENIORS.”\n\nThis idea was my creation. I’ve been fighting for it, and lobbying for it, and shouting from the highest mountaintops for it, for a decade. I wrote about it in the spring of 2024, sent it to President Trump, and Trump adopted it during his presidential campaign.\n\nThe Big Beautiful Bill included a new $6,000 tax deduction for seniors, but it’s not a replacement for “No Tax on Social Security for Seniors.” Congress could not include this idea in the “Big Beautiful Bill”- because by law there can be no changes to Social Security in a reconciliation bill.\n\nThere are over 60 million seniors in America. Seniors vote in the highest percentage of any group in America. If the GOP wants to win elections, pass this law before the midterms. The GOP will lock up the senior vote for decades to come.\n\nThose are my “Big 5” that will result in not only GOP landslides in 2026 and 2028 but permanent GOP majority control of the United States federal government.\n\nPresident Trump has checked a record number of boxes, but this, my friends, is a CHECKMATE.\n\nWayne Allyn Root recently published “The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.” He is host of the nationally syndicated “Wayne Allyn Root: Raw & Unfiltered” on USA Radio Network, daily from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST.\n\n LIFE: How to make the Trump revolution permanent and save America\n\nLIFE: How to make the Trump revolution permanent and save America added by Editor One on August 9, 2025\n\nView all posts by Editor One →","summary":"LIFE Special to WorldTribune.com Commentary by Wayne Allyn Root, August 8, 2025 First, let me start by pointing out that President Donald Trump keeps having &#8220;the best week ever&#8221; every week!

This is a national crisis - and the PM's silence isn't good enough","text":"Several weeks ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger – the former actor and governor of California – was invited on to leading US chat show The View. A few days earlier, Los Angeles had been gripped by serious disorder following attempts by Immigration And Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to arrest suspected illegal migrants.\n\nAs a migrant himself, what did he think about the raids, and the reaction to them, Schwarzenegger was asked.\n\n‘We got to do things legal. That is the important thing, you know?’ he replied, to the evident surprise and disappointment of his host Whoopi Goldberg. ‘You got to do things legal. And those people that are doing illegal things in America, they’re the foreigners, they are not smart. Because when you come to America, you’re a guest. And you have to behave like a guest.’\n\nIt would be wrong to describe Schwarzenegger as a classical progressive. He was elected as a Republican and holds conservative economic views. But on social issues, and the issue of immigration, he is relatively liberal. He has frequently attacked Donald Trump. At the last election he endorsed Kamala Harris. And in the wake of the 2021 Capitol riot, he issued a powerful video in which he compared the attack to Kristallnacht.\n\nOver the past seven days the arguments over links between immigration and crime here in the UK have also been intensifying.\n\nIn Warwickshire, Police and Crime Commissioner Philip Seccombe called for urgent national guidance after his local force was accused of failing to release details of two Afghan asylum seekers facing prosecution for an assault on a 12-year-old girl.\n\nOn Monday Nigel Farage courted further controversy by claiming ‘an Afghan male has a 22 times more likely chance of being convicted of rape than somebody born in this country’. He was swiftly followed by Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick, who claimed 40 per cent of sexual crimes in London last year were committed by foreign nationals.\n\nBut within government there was silence. Even though ministers were spending the week making strenuous efforts to promote their new ‘one-in, one-out’ asylum strategy, they studiously avoided engaging in the spiralling debate about criminality, migration and race. Save for a bland intervention from Keir Starmer, in which he said he wanted greater transparency on offending stats.\n\nAnd on one level this reticence is understandable. There is a clear danger of stoking existing community tensions through intemperate and inaccurate statements that scapegoat minorities. As illustrated by the tweet sent by Rupert Lowe – the increasingly preposterous MP for Great Yarmouth – who set members of the public, coastguard and police chasing after a group of illegal migrants, only for it to emerge they were actually a team of charity rowers raising funds for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.\n\nBut there is an urgent need for balance. Because by remaining silent, ministers and the liberal Left are creating a vacuum that could be exploited by agitators operating outside of the political mainstream. And, at the moment, the balance between these two dangers is not being struck.\n\nIn any contentious debate, the only safe haven is provided by\n\nthe truth. And though unpalatable, the truth as it relates to crime and migration status is clear. Some immigrant groups are disproportionately represented in the crime statistics when set against the indigenous population.\n\nIn the wake of Farage’s claim, Sky News conducted a fact-check of his figures. They found he had grossly overestimated actual offending rates among Afghan men, something that was immediately seized upon by his opponents.\n\nBut according to Sky’s analysis, ‘our estimates conclude that Afghans are actually three times more likely to be convicted of a sexual offence than someone born in the UK’.\n\nThat still represents a material, and disturbing, difference.\n\nThe Guardian conducted a similar analysis of Jenrick’s claim. Citing his figures as ‘muddled’, the paper pointed out his analysis was based on proceedings brought, rather than successful prosecutions, and inaccurately assessed the demographics of the London population.\n\nThe paper also stated that Jenrick’s figure reflected an FOI submitted by the Centre for Migration Control, which is run by a former Reform activist.\n\nBut the raw figures provided by the Metropolitan Police are clear. Between 2018 and 2024 there were 7,798 arrests in the capital characterised as ‘violence against the person’ or ‘sexual offences’ which led to further action being taken. Of these, 4,631 were British nationals, 358 were of ‘unknown nationality’ and 2,809 were identified as ‘foreign nationals’.\n\nAgain, the precise scale of the problem may have been exaggerated. But these are still significant and shocking statistics.\n\nIt’s imperative Starmer and his ministers now openly acknowledge this. Not least because, if they don’t, the narrative that they are creating – or at least masking – a system of ‘two-tier justice’, is going to become embedded.\n\nOver the decades, Labour politicians have consistently spoken out against crimes they claim have deeper social significance. Attacks on ethnic minorities. Violence against women. Low-grade sexual intimidation, such as wolf-whistling.\n\nRightly. So now they cannot be seen to simply turn a blind eye to the concerns of those saying the influx of asylum seekers is having a detrimental impact on their communities. Especially when the crime statistics show those fears are not groundless.\n\nYes, Keir Starmer, Yvette Cooper and their colleagues are trying to prioritise action over rhetoric. Yes, it’s easy for Nigel Farage, Robert Jenrick and others to point to the problem without providing any practical, concrete solutions.\n\nBut bland managerialism in the face of a mounting national crisis is not enough.\n\nWhen are we at least going to see the Prime Minister or Home Secretary visit one of the communities selected to host asylum seekers, and directly address local residents’ worries?\n\nOr see Starmer use the weight of his office to echo Schwarzenegger and state: ‘If you come to our country seeking sanctuary you are a guest. We will not tolerate any breaches of our laws. Entry to the UK is a privilege, not a right.’\n\nThe Left cannot let opposition to migrant crime become the preserve of the Right. Especially when every offence doesn’t just impact the victim but every other migrant seeking to enter Britain in genuine pursuit of sanctuary, or a new life.\n\nDeflection such as ‘it’s only a small number of migrants’ or ‘the people pointing to this issue are just peddling hate’ isn’t just counterproductive, it’s offensive. In what other context would you hear a liberal breezily declare: ‘It’s only a handful of sexual assaults – let’s focus on the things that matter’?\n\nThe time has come for the Prime Minister to speak out about the link between migration and crime. Because the vacuum he is creating over the issue will not stay a vacuum for long.","summary":"Several weeks ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger - the former actor and governor of California - was invited on to leading US chat show The View.

Given his core nature and personality, Trump’s attacks on prominent Black Americans have recently become even more explicit and direct. \n\nFirst, he accused former President Barack Obama of “treasonous” behavior for launching an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But that was not the end of it. On Monday, following a criminal referral from Trump’s Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered federal prosecutors to open a grand jury investigation into the baseless accusations. Multiple investigations, including two led by Republicans, and other reporting have repeatedly shown that Russia did, in fact, seek to meddle in the election in favor of Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by launching a social media disinformation campaign using Russian bot farms, and by hacking the Clinton campaign’s emails. \n\nNo such conspiracy on Obama’s part exists. But with Trump’s consolidation of power and lack of traditional guardrails, he has the full power of the state at his command to advance his authoritarian campaign against Obama, Clinton and other people and groups that he has already targeted — or will soon be targeting — for “treason” and other “crimes.”\n\nIn the meantime, Trump has placed other prominent Black people in his sights. \n\nLast week, Trump targeted Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, Al Sharpton and others with claims they were part of a conspiracy in which they were paid to endorse his rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. “IT’S NOT LEGAL!” he posted on Truth Social. “For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,’ this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system.” Trump said he would soon “call for a major investigation.”\n\nAgain, no such conspiracy exists.\n\nOn Aug. 1, Trump called radio personality Charlamagne tha God, who is a Black man, a “low IQ individual” and a “racist sleazebag” because he dared to question the president’s policies and behavior. On Fox News’ “My View with Lara Trump,” Charlamagne tha God said “the least of us are still being impacted the worst” and was critical of Trump’s response to the Epstein scandal. \n\nThen, in a Truth Social Post on Monday, Trump criticized CBS journalist Gayle King, who is also Winfrey’s best friend. “Gayle King’s career is over. She should have stayed with her belief in TRUMP. She never had the courage to do so. No talent, no ratings, no strength!!!” \n\nBut the president still was not finished with his bigoted tirade. On Tuesday, he escalated his racist appeals, telling CNBC in a phone interview that “inner city” people — a not-so-subtle code for Black Americans — are lazy. “Illegal aliens” — meaning Hispanics and Latinos — are strong and have a natural talent for physical labor, he said. “[P]eople that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They’re just not doing that work, and they’ve tried, we’ve tried, everybody tried, they don’t do it…These people do it naturally, naturally.”\n\nThese are all — Trump’s slur that Winfrey, Beyoncé and other Black celebrities are basically crooks, and that Black people are inherently lazy — are centuries-old white supremacist tropes. His comments are part of a much larger pattern of behavior where he has repeatedly insulted Black people, specifically Black women, as being dumb or stupid or “low IQ.”\n\nThis is the same white racist “logic” used to justify Black chattel slavery and over 100 years of American apartheid and racial tyranny in the South, and other parts of the country, under the period of Jim Crow and into the post-civil rights era and beyond. \n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture explains the origins of the stereotype that Black people are somehow inherently “lazy” as compared to white people and other “races” as:\n\nMany of the stereotypes created during the height of the trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and were used to help commodify black bodies and justify the business of slavery. For instance, an enslaved person, forced under violence to work from sunrise to sunset, could hardly be described as lazy. Yet laziness, as well as characteristics of submissiveness, backwardness, lewdness, treachery, and dishonesty, historically became stereotypes assigned to African Americans.\n\nTrump’s racist tirade merited media attention. But it did not receive the in-depth coverage it deserved. As Bill Kristol, Andrew Egger and Jim Swift of The Bulwark observed of this chilling trend, “You might expect it to be big news. And yet it faded into the background almost at once. How far through the looking glass are we, that this sort of thing reads to so many as a ‘dog bites man’ story?…”\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nIn a searing essay, former MSNBC host and author Joy Reid captured the moment:\n\nI guess we Blacks can just hang it up, at this point. Companies have effectively been told they’re not allowed to hire us anywhere…Presumably, the regime envisions whatever Black people, brown people, women and LGBTQ people who aren’t deported, working as maids in white Christian homes, like in the ‘good old days’ when America was great…\n\nFilmmaker Kevin Willmott put it another way in The Nation: “The Confederacy has gobbled up the Union…The entire nation is capitulating to the new Confederate States of America.”\n\nThe mainstream media’s failure to consistently connect Trump’s racism and authoritarianism to the nation’s worsening democratic crisis is not a mere “failure of imagination.” It is an act of complicity that further normalizes racism and authoritarianism in the Age of Trump. Further, as media critics like Dan Froomkin and Mark Jacob have argued, it is actually a willful refusal to understand how racism and authoritarianism intersect and amplify the other’s power to erode human freedom, dignity, agency and flourishing across racial lines.\n\nThe normalization of Trump and the MAGA Republicans’ authoritarianism (if not naked fascism), racism and general hostility towards Black and brown people is not abstract. Such values and policies have significant negative health, emotional, material and other detrimental outcomes. This is not a coincidence or accident. It is the predictable and de facto desired outcome and goal.\n\nPhilosopher and public intellectual Cornel West has described Black Americans as historically existing in a state of being “unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, and hated for who they are.” Psychologists and other experts described the sum effect of these forces as causing “racial battle fatigue” — a form of collective post-traumatic stress disorder — among Black people and other non-whites in America and across the West. For example, public health and other experts have demonstrated how racial fatigue shortens the lives of people of color because of how chronic stress from navigating a society where racial discrimination profoundly shapes life outcomes. To that point, racial battle fatigue has been shown to lead to premature aging through epigenetic processes.\n\nHow much longer will Black Americans and the heirs to other great freedom struggles keep sacrificing for a country that is choosing self-destruction — for a nation accelerating toward fascism? What will happen then if those who are the conscience of the nation decide to turn their backs on it? \n\nWhat is the cost of loving a country that does not love you back?\n\nI don’t pretend to have an answer. But I do know this: If those Americans who are the conscience of the nation turn away from it, the consequences for the country’s future will be nothing short of existential.","summary":"Failure to connect his comments to our worsening democratic crisis is an act of complicity","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/08/09/trump-escalates-his-racist-attacks-on-black-americans/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2220598276-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 10:45:46","author":"Chauncey Devega","authors":["Chauncey Devega"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.448},{"id":349579186,"title":"Walters: Deepfakes pose obvious political peril, but state’s bans amount to censorship","text":"A few weeks ago, a video popped up on YouTube, purporting to be a verbal clash between Sen.

The problem is it was fake, created with video snippets of both politicians and a voiceover describing what supposedly happened.\n\nThe video, which has since vanished from YouTube, is a fairly crude example of how technology can be manipulated to depict seemingly real events.\n\nMore sophisticated examples of artificial intelligence, known as deepfakes, can literally put words in political figures’ mouths or even create seemingly real persons.\n\nLast year, Christopher Kohls, going by the name “Mr. Reagan” on social media, posted a video in which Kamala Harris seemingly acknowledged that she had been the “ultimate diversity hire” when Joe Biden chose her as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nKohls said it was a parody, but Elon Musk posted it on his social media platform X, drawing criticism from Newsom and a vow to outlaw such material. It was one of many clashes with Musk, the billionaire electric car and rocket tycoon, after he became a Donald Trump ally.\n\nWithin weeks, Newsom signed two bills aimed at either regulating or banning AI-generated political videos. Kohl, later joined by other content creators, sued, contending that they violate free speech.\n\nThis week John Mendez, a federal judge in Sacramento, struck down one of the measures, Assembly Bill 2655, carried by Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat. He ruled that the federal Communications Decency Act protects X and other sites from liability for material posted by third parties, such as Kohl or Musk.\n\nAB 2655 would have barred internet sites from posting deceptive political material during campaign seasons. “They don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to,” Mendez said.\n\nNotably, Mendez indicated that he will also reject the second measure, Assembly Bill 2839, carried by Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat. It would prohibit anyone from “knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election communication … that contains certain materially deceptive content.”\n\n“I think the statute just fails miserably in accomplishing what it would like to do,” Mendez said, adding “It’s become a censorship law and there is no way that is going to survive.”\n\nAs the country’s political polarization deepens, voters become more willing to believe allegations that those on the other side of the divide are evil, corrupt and power hungry. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence makes political deepfakes ever more sophisticated and capable of fooling gullible voters into believing their lies.\n\nExaggeration, selective facts and downright lies have always been evident in political campaigns, but historically held in check, at least partially, by newspapers and other political media.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the mainstream media have fallen on economic hard times and have become less capable of policing political discourse. Meanwhile, X, YouTube, podcasts and other digital media have exploded as alternative sources but they tend to drive polarization rather than counteract it.\n\nThe bills that Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor enacted last year were clearly aimed at crippling media on the other side of the ideological divide but, as Judge Mendez ruled, violate free speech.\n\nCensorship cannot be the answer. The approach that Newsom and legislators took is a slippery slope that would invite retaliation from their political rivals, thus deepening the already yawning political divide.\n\nIt is, however, a genuine quandary. Unfettered use of AI-driven deepfakes in political campaigns present an obvious peril, but so does any effort to prohibit free speech, no matter how distasteful.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"California legislators' AI regulations are a slippery slope, risking retaliation from their political rivals and heightened polarization.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/09/walters-deepfakes-pose-obvious-political-peril-but-states-bans-amount-to-censorship/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SJM-L-SCHOOLZONES-0328-4.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 10:15:27","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":349579198,"title":"Barabak: In hard-fought congressional district, voters agree — release Epstein files","text":"When it comes to President Donald Trump, Angie Zamora and Phaidra Medeiros agree on very little.\n\nZamora, a 36-year-old Army veteran, has nothing good to say.\n\n“The laws. All the rights taken away from women. The stuff with ICE,” Zamora said, ticking off her frustrations as she stopped outside the post office in the Central Valley community of Los Banos. “Why are they going after people working on farms when they’re supposed to be chasing violent criminals?”\n\nMedeiros, by contrast, is delighted Trump replaced Joe Biden. “He wasn’t mentally fit,” Medeiros said of the elderly ex-president. “There was something wrong with him from the very beginning.”\n\nDespite all that, the two do share one belief: Both say the government should cough up every last bit of information it has on Jeffrey Epstein, his sordid misdeeds and the powerful associates who moved in his aberrant orbit.\n\nChange the subject\n\nTrump “did his whole campaign on releasing the Epstein files,” Zamora said. “And now he’s trying to change the subject. ‘Oh, it’s a ‘hoax’ … ‘Oh, you guys are still talking about that creep?’ And yet there’s pictures throughout the years of him with that creep.”\n\nMedeiros, 56, echoed the sentiment.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans “put themselves into this predicament because they kept talking constantly” about the urgency of unsealing records in Epstein’s sex-trafficking case — until they took control of the Justice Department and the rest of Washington. “Now,” she said, “they’re backpedaling.”\n\nMedeiros paused outside the engineering firm where she works in the Central Valley, in Newman, on a tree-lined street adorned with star-spangled banners honoring local servicemen and women.\n\n“Obviously there were minors involved” in Epstein’s crimes, she said, and if Trump is somehow implicated “then he needs to go down as well.”\n\nYears after being found dead in a Manhattan prison cell — killed by his own hand, according to authorities — Epstein appears to have done the near-impossible in this deeply riven nation. He’s united Democrats, Republicans and independents around a call to reveal, once and for all, everything that’s known about his case.\n\n“He’s dead now, but if people were involved they should be prosecuted,” said Joe Toscano, a 69-year-old Los Banos retiree and unaffiliated voter who last year supported Trump’s return to the White House.\n\n“Bring it all out there. Make it public.”\n\nCalifornia’s 13th Congressional District, where Zamora, Medeiros and Toscano all live, is arguably the most closely fought political terrain in America. Sprawling through California’s midriff, from the far reaches of the San Francisco Bay Area to the southern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, it’s farm country: flat, fertile and crossed-hatched with canals, rail lines and thruways with utilitarian names such as Road No. 32 and Avenue 18½.\n\nThe myriad small towns are brief interludes amid the dairy and poultry farms and lush carpeting of vegetables, fruit and nut trees that stretch to the hazy-brown horizon. The most populous city, Merced, has fewer than 100,000 residents. (Modesto, with a population of around 220,000, is split between the 5th and 13th districts.)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Gray was elected in November in the closest House race in the country, beating the Republican incumbent, John Duarte, by 187 votes out of nearly 211,000 cast. The squeaker was a rematch and nearly a rerun. Two years prior, Duarte defeated Gray by fewer than 600 votes out of nearly 134,000 cast.\n\nNot surprisingly, both parties have made the 13th District a top target in 2026; handicappers rate the contest a toss-up, even as the field sorts itself out. (Duarte has said he would not run again.)\n\nThe midterm election is a long way off, so it’s impossible to say how the Epstein controversy will play out politically. But there is, at the least, a baseline expectation of transparency, a view that was repeatedly expressed in conversations with three dozen voters across the district.\n\nZachery Ramos, a 25-year-old independent, is the founder of the Gustine Traveling Library, which promotes learning and literacy throughout the Central Valley. Its storefront, painted with polka dots and decorated with giant butterflies, sits like a cheery oasis in Gustine’s four-block downtown, a riot of green spilling from the planter boxes out front.\n\nInside, the walls were filled with commendations and newspaper clippings celebrating Ramos’ good works. As a nonprofit, he said, “we have to have everything out there. All the books. Everything.”\nEpstein, he suggested, should be treated no differently.\n\n“When it comes to something as serious as that, with what may or may not have taken place on his private island, with his girlfriend” — convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell — “I do think it should all be out in the open,” Ramos said. “If you’re not afraid of your name being in (the files), especially when you’re dealing with minors being assaulted, it should 100% be made public.”\n\nEd, a 42-year-old Democrat who manages a warehouse operation in Patterson, noted that Trump released the government’s long-secret files on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., even though King’s family objected. (Like several of those interviewed, he declined to give his last name, to avoid being hassled by readers who don’t like what he had to say.)\n\nWhy, Ed wondered, shouldn’t the Epstein files come to light? “It wasn’t just Trump,” he said. “It was a lot of Republicans in Congress that said, ‘Hey, we want to get these files out there.’ And I believe if Kamala (Harris) had won, they would be beating her down, demanding she do so.”\n\nHe smacked a fist in his palm, to emphasize the point.\n\n‘Release it all’\n\nSue, a Madera Republican and no fan of Trump, expressed her feelings in staccato bursts of fury.\n\n“Apparently the women years ago said who was doing what, but nobody listens to the women,” said the 75-year-old retiree. “Release it all! Absolutely! You play, you pay, buddy.”\n\nEven those who dismissed the importance of Epstein and his crimes said the government should hold nothing back — if only to erase doubts and lay the issue to rest.\n\nEpstein “is gone and I don’t really care if they release the files or not,” said Diane Nunes, a 74-year-old Republican who keeps the books for her family farm, which lies halfway between Los Banos and Gustine. “But they probably should, because a lot of people are waiting for that.”\n\nPatrick, a construction contractor, was more worked up about “pretty boy” Gavin Newsom and “Nazi Pelosi” — “yes, that’s what I call her” — than anything that might be lurking in the Epstein files. “When the cat is dead, you don’t pick it up and pet it. Right?” He motioned to the pavement, baking as the temperature in Patterson climbed into the low 90s.\n\n“It’s over with,” the 61-year-old Republican said of Epstein and his villainy. “Move on.”\n\nAt least, that would be his preference. But to “shut everybody up, absolutely, yeah, they should release them,” Patrick said. “Otherwise, we’re all going to be speculating forever.”\n\nOr at least until the polls close in November 2026.\n\nMark Barabak is a Los Angeles Times columnist. ©2025 Los Angeles Times.

The audience laughed its way through the performance I attended last month, and I’m pretty sure I wasn’t the only one who left humming the song “Better Keep Away.”\n\nThe plot’s transposing was par for the course for Northern Sky Theater, in Fish Creek, Wisconsin. At a time when many companies are undergoing identity crises or struggling to connect with audiences, this one endures by programming original musicals anchored in local history, institutions, archetypes and customs.\n\nFor regional audience members, the company’s artistic director Molly Rhode said, a Northern Sky show “is not just sort of about me — it’s really about me.”\n\nDespite being decidedly not from the area, I very much enjoyed this summer’s three offerings, which are running in repertory through Aug. 23. Along with “No Bones About It,” the company is presenting “Something in the Water,” set in early-20th-century Waukesha, when that city was ending an unlikely run as a tourist hot spot popularized by mineral springs, and “Dairy Heirs,” which has a subplot involving a soothing hybrid of provolone and pepper jack called projack.\n\n“The joy and silliness that perfumes the entire air of Northern Sky is something that I think a lot of theater is missing right now,” said Ava Giorgione, a rising junior at New York University who is playing Julie in the Shakespeare spoof.\n\nTechnically speaking, Northern Sky, located in scenic Door County, was born in 2015. But its story goes back to 1970. More on that later, so please keep reading for a tale so ingrained in Badger State lore that it deserves its own musical.\n\nA certain kind of storytelling\n\nIn the summer, the company presents its productions in a 748-seat outdoor amphitheater in the heart of Peninsula State Park, which juts out into Lake Michigan. In the fall it moves indoors to the 248-seat Gould Theater, which opened in 2019. (This year, “The Bachelors,” about a pair of immature Madison men, runs from Aug. 29-Oct. 25; there’s usually also a holiday show.) Encouragingly, attendance has almost recovered from the pandemic, when Northern Sky was limited to a virtual season. “Prior to 2020 we hovered between 25,000 and 30,000 attendees in the park,” the managing director Holly Feldman said. “This year we are projecting closer to 23,000 in the park and 10,000 in the Gould.”\n\nWith a budget of just $2 million, the company leans on mutually beneficial relationships with local donors and businesses. Its staff of eight swells to 56 in the summer, and is supplemented by a pool of about 200 volunteers.\n\nAnd when it comes to finding playwrights, Northern Sky has long recruited contributions from its very audiences. For example, consider the journey of Matt Zembrowski, a Milwaukee native who wrote “Something in the Water.”\n\nAs a kid, Zembrowski and his family used to camp in Peninsula State Park, and in 1995, they saw “Bone Dance.” He was only 12, but was instantly hooked. As his love for musicals expanded, he remained enthralled by the company’s productions. “There’s kind of an ownership because you saw shows about people that you know, Midwesterners,” Zembrowski said. “I connected to that far more than I did a lot of the Broadway shows I was listening to.”\n\nAt a postshow gathering around a fire ring, a gregarious patron named Jerry Pomprowitz told Zembrowski that he loved another of his musicals, “Dad’s Season Tickets.” In that “King Lear” riff, three daughters vie for their father’s Green Bay Packers tickets — “and in the end it worked out that everybody gets to share them,” Pomprowitz said. Unlike Shakespeare, Northern Sky believes in happy endings.\n\nPomprowitz and his wife, Lynn, both in their early 70s, regularly drive about an hour to the theater from their home in Green Bay. Fish Creek has other theater companies, including Peninsula Players (“America’s oldest resident summer theater,” it boasts), but the couple especially enjoy Northern Sky. “The shows are funny, they have character, they have heart and they are family friendly,” Jerry Pomprowitz said. “It’s very nice that they do it that way.”\n\nIndeed, the audience is filled with multigenerational groups. It’s also not rare for multiple family members to be involved with the company. Rhode’s sister Alissa wrote the music for “Dairy Heirs,” for example, and when I went to the White Gull Inn for a fish boil, the owner mentioned her years as a house manager at the theater. Her sister acted in “Northern Lights” in 1997. Another sister cowrote the musical “Victory Farm” (2012), about German POWs working in one of the area’s cherry orchards in 1944.\n\nIt’s in their DNA\n\nHistory-inspired shows are popular at Northern Sky, which loves good yarns. And one happens to be attached to its birth. The company’s ethos can be traced back to Robert E. Gard, a Madison professor who promoted the interconnection of local roots and culture. (With research financed by the National Endowment for the Arts, he published a 1966 study-cum-call to arms, “The Arts in the Small Community: A National Plan,” that deserves to be rediscovered today.) One of Gard’s colleagues, Dave Peterson, spotted the amphitheater while camping and thought it would be a perfect place to present his revue “Song of the Inland Seas.” It ended up kick-starting the Heritage Ensemble, in 1970.\n\nAn early fan was Fred Heide, currently Northern Sky’s artistic adviser. “It was songs of the Great Lakes sailors, the lumberjacks, the early immigrant farmers,” he said of the show. “They were authentic folk songs, but Dave arranged them with complex Broadway harmonies. And he combined them with interesting bits of our history and humorous things he had pulled out of books. There was a tremendous depth to these songs, and power and universality to the stories they were telling.”\n\nHeide joined the Heritage Ensemble in 1972, and performed in and wrote many shows. In 1990, he rebooted the troupe as American Folklore Theater with Gerald Pelrine and Fred Alley — the latter a tireless director, performer and writer whose hits with James Kaplan, “Lumberjacks in Love” (1996) and “Guys on Ice” (1998), have been produced around the country and are regularly revived at Northern Sky.\n\nBeing multi-hyphenate is as much a part of the company’s DNA as the shows’ subject matter. As production interns (they are paid and receive housing), Giorgione and her “No Bones About It” co-star Owen Foulds, who plays Ronny, also help put up and take down sets, prep for meals and more. Giorgione said she found internships “to be very invaluable when it comes to learning the tricks of the trade and what I need to know outside of acting.”\nFoulds said he loved the need to “commit to everything 110 percent.”\n\nAnother busy multitasker, Jeff Herbst, started collaborating with the company in the 1980s and became artistic director in 1993. He would preside over the Northern Sky rebranding in 2015.\n\n“All of the musicals that we were writing were really not folklore,” said Herbst, who stepped down from the artistic directorship last year but continues to direct and appear in the company’s productions. “So I wanted a name that I could pitch to people around the country and would also resonate more fully with the demographic that was starting to come to Door County — a lot more affluent people have found their way up here for second homes.”\n\nThe population changes may explain why Door County, which had been a bellwether in presidential elections since 1996, went for Kamala Harris by a slim margin last year. Northern Sky navigates political waters gingerly, and by gingerly I mean it avoids them. Besides localism, the throughline is that the shows are, as Pomprowitz said, “family friendly,” though Feldman, the theater’s managing director, appeared chagrined that to some the term translates to a specific type of “family values.” (“What keeps us up at night is not the occasional email about something we had on our stage,” she said, “but our outdoor season being impacted by erratic weather from climate change.”)\n\nThis does not mean the company is stuck in place, either. A key program is NOVA (Nurturing Original Voices and Artists), which since 2021 has welcomed 62 playwrights from around the country to workshops and writing circles, both physically and virtually. Its director, Lachrisa Grandberry, was in the original production of “Dairy Heirs,” in 2018, for which she also learned to play the stand-up bass. (“People collect skills when they come to us,” Molly Rhode said, laughing.)\n\nGrandberry and two others set out to write “Sunflowered,” a musical about a camping trip to Peninsula State Park that premiered in 2022 at Northern Sky. In parallel, she developed initiatives inspired by a workshop for writers of color, and those led to NOVA.\n\n“Northern Sky is a very unique theater that only produces new works so it felt like there should be a place or a program within it that cultivates them,” Grandberry said. As a Black woman in a predominately white area, she said, “I know for a fact that I would not have been able to write for Northern Sky without first working there. I would not have understood the culture of Door County and of this theater. The challenge we have as a company is trying to cultivate new voices and make room for them in our space.”\n\nAll told, Northern Sky has about a dozen shows in various stages of development. Looking at the slate, one feels that the company will evolve while holding on to its identity and values in a world roiled by uncertainty. After all, Grandberry said, “Northern Sky is really good at creating stories that feel like home.”","summary":"FISH CREEK, Wis. — Here they are again, those enamored youths hiding their passion from their feuding families in Verona.

In the months since, their admonitions have grown only more pointed.\n\nTheir calculus is simple. Despite campaign promises to improve working people’s lives, and Mr. Trump’s appeal among the rank and file, top union officials do not view the president, whose signature policy law benefits the wealthy, as a true ally of organized labor. And if Democrats regain the ground they’ve lost with blue-collar voters, many of whom are union members, it could help leaders with their own struggles, including flagging membership and criticism that they are losing touch with everyday workers.\n\nBut it is not likely to be easy.\n\nThe shift toward Mr. Trump among blue-collar voters last year was the culmination of a trend in recent elections: Democrats gained votes in wealthy, white enclaves, while Republicans earned new support in working-class regions and among Hispanic and Black voters, raising questions about Democrats’ longstanding identity as the defender of working people.\n\nUnion leaders, who mostly endorsed Kamala Harris even as many of their members scoffed at her candidacy, now find themselves trying to strike a delicate balance, maintaining support for Democratic candidates while not alienating members who voted for Mr. Trump.

Maura Healey warmly welcomed them as though they were illegal immigrants.\n\nBut if politicians really want to know about gerrymandering congressional districts to gain power, they all should study Massachusetts.\n\nWe invented it.\n\nOr, I should say, Gov. Elbridge Gerry did. He was governor of Massachusetts when he signed a bill in 1812 that created a partisan state Senate district that looked like a mythological salamander (lizard) to benefit his party.\n\nAn enterprising reporter from the Boston Gazette took Gerry’s name and fused it with “mander” from salamander and, hence, the word gerrymander, with all its negative implications, was born.\n\nIt has been with us ever since. It also has given Gov. Gerry a bad rap. While he is credited, or discredited, for the practice of gerrymandering, all his other accomplishments have been forgotten.\n\nHe was a Founding Father, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a diplomat, a governor and vice president under President James Madison.\n\nBut he is remembered for gerrymandering. That’s history for you.\n\nRedistricting of the states’ 435 U.S. House seats follows the once-in-a-decade population count by the U.S. Census Bureau. States with growing populations (illegal immigrants) gain seats at the expense of states with declining populations.\n\nThere is no stipulation that prevents states from redrawing districts in the middle of the decade, like Texas is doing now.\n\nAt President Donald Trump behest, the Republican controlled state Legislature in Texas is withdrawing its district lines to better enhance the election of five more Republicans since Trump carried the state in 2024 by 56 per cent over 42 per cent over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump got 36 per cent of the vote in Massachusetts but that is not going to make any difference to the state’s Democrat controlled political makeup.\n\nMassachusetts is such a gerrymandered Democratic one-party state that it just as well put up signs at the state border warning Republicans to stay away or reading NRA —No Republicans Allowed.\n\nIt is a state that is more welcoming of illegal immigrants than it is of Republicans.\n\nAnd if there is any doubt of that, just check the more than $1 billion a year progressive Democrat Gov. Maura Healey is shelling out to pay for the care and well-being of illegal immigrants from around the world who have flocked to Massachusetts to partake of its overly generous welfare benefits.\n\nDemocrats have gerrymandered the state’s congressional districts to the point that all nine Massachusetts members of the U.S. House are Democrats.\n\nExcluding the fluke election of Republican Scott Brown to the U.S. Senate in 2010 — who was quickly ousted by radical leftist Democrat Elizabeth Warren–there has not been a Republican elected to the U.S. House from Massachusetts in almost thirty years.\n\nThe last Republicans to hold a congressional seat in Massachusetts were Peter Blute of Worcester and Peter Torkildsen of Danvers. Both were elected in 1992, defeating a pair of troubled Democrats—Joe Early and Nick Mavroules.\n\nAnd then both were ousted in 1996 by Democrats James McGovern, who still hold the seat, and John Tierney, who was later defeated by fellow Democrat Seth Mouton.\n\nThere has not been a Republican elected since. And don’t look for another to be elected anytime soon—if ever.\n\nSo, let’s hear it for Gov. Eldridge Gerry, and Maura Healey, too.\n\nVeteran political reporter Peter Lucas can be reached at: peter.lucas@bostonherald.com","summary":"If politicians really want to know about gerrymandering congressional districts to gain power, they all should study Massachusetts.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/09/lucas-gerrymandering-a-home-grown-political-play/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25217692049654.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 07:24:09","author":"Peter Lucas","authors":["Peter Lucas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":349539968,"title":"Why the American right turned on Israel","text":"So much has shifted in US politics during the six months Donald Trump has been in the White House that it is easy to forget the origins of those changes. It is easy to see the upheaval as unprecedented and unexpected. It is also easy to see it as largely serendipitous. Rather than Trump being the result of entirely novel historical forces that he has unleashed into the world, it could well be that he stumbled into the presidency for a second time simply because woke sentiments appalled decent people, Joe Biden was faltering, and Kamala Harris arrived too late to the race. Likewise, if Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor of New York in autumn, it might well be not so much because left populism has come into its moment, but because his rivals, Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams, are even more inadequate than Harris was. To paraphrase a Russian proverb, for a hungry electorate, even a half-baked loaf tastes good.\n\nThe same might apply to what appears a sea change among the right with regards to Israel. For generations, the standard perception goes, the right has stood behind Israel through thick and thin. Today, more and more Democrats, appalled by the war crimes in Gaza, seem to have turned against Israel. Meanwhile, the right, in a weird convergence of usually polarised sentiment, is doing the same. Most recently, the prominent political scientist, John Mearsheimer, appeared on Tucker Carlson’s podcast, declaring that the Zionist project was racist and about ethnic cleansing from the beginning.\n\nLeave aside that the Zionist project, which has now, in the hands of Benjamin Netanyahu and his executioners, arrived at a racist and potentially genocidal dead end, was not racist and potentially genocidal from the beginning. There was absolutely nothing surprising about Mearsheimer’s assertion, or about Carlson’s openness to it. Mearsheimer was merely reprising one of the themes of The Israel Lobby, a sensationally controversial book that he published with Stephen Walt in 2007, and which grew out of an essay by both men that had appeared in the London Review of Books the previous year.\n\nThis is not the place to examine that book’s thesis and the reaction to it, though my own belief is that the book was factually impoverished and inaccurate in its argument that pro-Israel factions in Washington were responsible for what Mearsheimer and Walt saw as the US’s self-defeating allegiance to the Jewish state. The Cold War had been the cause of America’s allegiance to Israel. (Just as the greed of American oil men pushed America to invade Iraq, not, as Mearsheimer and Walt maintained, the far less remunerative Israel lobby.) Now though, 18 years further along in the post-Cold War period, and nearly two years into the slow extermination of the Palestinians from Gaza, the two authors’ fundamental premise seems correct.\n\nMearsheimer and Walt took particular aim at the neoconservatives, whom they accused of an attachment to Israel’s interests that undercut American ones. But the neoconservatives were one branch of the conservative movement, the one that happened to prevail among and draw closest to power. But there were also, as they were known at the time, the “paleoconservatives”, on the hard right of US politics. That term now seems quaint, for the simple reason that the extreme right wing of the party that it represented has become its dominant wing. Compared to their Dick Cheney-era pomp, the neocons have to share office space with the kind of Tea Party figures they once arrogantly dismissed as fruitcakes.\n\nUnlike the mostly Jewish neoconservatives, the hard right hailed The Israel Lobby as “an extraordinary accomplishment”. At least that was the judgement of the American Conservative, a paleoconservative magazine founded by one of the fathers of American right populism, Pat Buchanan. It was Buchanan who made the once notorious remark about “the Israeli Defence Ministry and its amen corner in the United States”, which was attacked as anti-Semitic, though his perception was accurate. It might still have been anti-Semitic. No one could say for certain. What has always haunted modern Jews is that no one can say for sure whether, in any given instance, an anti-Zionist is also an anti-Semite. “Everybody hates the Jews,” as the late, great Tom Lehrer once sang. Is it true? Is it more true now than it was pre-Gaza?\n\nThe hard right’s enthusiasm for The Israel Lobby seemed less grounded in conscientious agreement with the book’s premises – which, of course, was possible – than in an instinctive expression of an animosity towards Jews on the right that dated back to the anti-Semitic Catholic priest (later defrocked) Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s. Afterward, Senator Joseph McCarthy continued the hard right’s anti-Semitism, with the large majority of his victims in the anti-communist hearings of the 1950s being Jewish. Indeed, McCarthy seems to have created the template for Trump’s own simultaneous courting of anti-Semitism on the right and his disingenuous “defence” of Jewish university students. Even as McCarthy was winking at the Jew-hating right in his persecution of mostly Jews, he was vociferously accusing critics of his hatchet man – the Jewish Roy Cohn, later Donald Trump’s mentor – of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe radical right, especially the Catholics among them, had always been rife with anti-Semitism. The so-called father of modern conservatism, William F Buckley, spent years associating with virulent anti-Semites, even as he gradually distanced himself from them – a ritualistic radical right double motion – as well as opposing Israel, until he later very publicly denounced anti-Semitism in 1991. In light of America’s conflict with the Soviet Union, he became an ardent supporter of Israel.\n\nThese days, the fractured feelings on the right with regard to Jews are no less intense. Tucker Carlson invites Nazi apologists on his podcast, Laura Loomer lashes out at Muslims in the name of Jews, Candace Owens calls Israel a “demonic nation”, the National Review defends Israel’s actions in Gaza, Joe Rogan denounces Israeli actions in Gaza and calls Jews “greedy”. In my home state of New Jersey, the Maga candidate for governor, Jack Ciattarelli, is an ardent defender of Israel, while his Democratic rival, Mikie Sherrill, called what Israel is doing in Gaza “genocide”, then played her remarks down.\n\nWhat is clear is that, because the radical right has become mainstreamed and has all but engulfed conservatism’s moderate strains, it should not come as a surprise that the anti-Semitism that was always a central element of the radical right should also be in the process of being mainstreamed. This is accompanied by a whole new set of phenomena. One is that, despite Trump’s occasional gestures of impatience, he will keep America behind Netanyahu whatever the Israeli leader does in Gaza, merely nudging him from time to time to appear moderate in order to soften Israel’s critics. The other is that, as Trump well knows, such criticism of Israel as he occasionally emits will gratify those anti-Semites on the hard right whose anti-Zionism is seamless with their anti-Semitism.\n\nAnother feature of this new status of Jews is the right’s manipulation of what they pretend is the pro-Palestinian fervour sweeping the left and constituting a basis for a left populism. That is a red herring. Palestine, even the atrocity and torment of Gaza, plays little role in Americans’ moral imagination. Vietnam unified the left 60 years ago; Americans are not dying in Gaza, and American liberals will not be drawn away from their differences by a foreign conflict that has no real consequences for them. What the right does achieve, though, by pretending that the pro-Palestinian passion on the progressive left is a threat to its own populist success, is two-pronged. The first is to saddle the left with the appearance of anti-Semitism. The second is to feed the growing anti-Semitic wing of Maga the red meat of making Jews seem at the heart of every foreign and domestic turbulence. No Israeli war crimes in Gaza, no pro-Palestinian outrage unifying the right.\n\nThe Jews are slowly being positioned by the right as a kind of Skinnerian stimulus meant to provoke one sort of reaction or another among the electorate. The most dangerous aspect of Trump to Jews, and to Israel, is his seeming philo-Semitism. He will not abandon Netanyahu. He will abet Netanyahu in his atrocities and then use him to titillate the Jew-hatred on the right, all while protesting undying love for Israel and for the Jews. It is hardly a coincidence that Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is Trump’s ambassador to Israel. Many evangelicals are in thrall to “dispensational millenarianism”, in which, simply put, Jews who do not accept Christ in the end time will be destroyed during a seven-year “tribulation”. A new book, Antisemitism in the End Times by Olivier Melnick, coming out this autumn, makes this very case. As the dispensationalists would have it, fighting anti-Semitism is vital as a path to either the mass conversion, or the collective destruction, of the Jews, which is a precondition for the arrival of the messiah.\n\nIn this sense, both the attachment to Israel and the anti-Zionism on the right are the perfect complements to the rising anti-Semitism on the right. This complicated right-wing death hug of Israel is lightyears away from the neoconservatives’ unrealpolitik embrace of Israel. As with so much else, Trump is not inventing anything new. He is taking what was once unspeakable – witness his public support of Poland’s new president, a Holocaust revisionist – tossing it into the chaotic maelstrom he has created, and making it central, and vital.\n\n[See also: Letter from Gaza: “What I feel isn’t just hunger.

That has grown every year since, and by 2024, almost 80% of those events involved white supremacists.\n\nIn the future, it will be more difficult to obtain data on white supremacist violence because the Trump administration has cut or scaled back federal programs collecting such data and countering such domestic terrorism. Naturally, that is a boon to the movement.\n\nIt probably isn’t a coincidence that the most visible instance of political violence with white supremacist overtones was the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. That insurrection was led by pro-Trump forces and initiated by Trump as a way to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. At the beginning of his second term, Trump pardoned many of the offenders, thereby sanctioning their violent acts.\n\nEchoing the white supremacist movement, Trump has repeatedly sought to erase gains made during the historic Civil Rights movement. His administration has purged acknowledgement of milestone accomplishments by Black, Latino, and LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nAs part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s attack on government agencies, racists loyal to Trump benefactor Elon Musk were installed and supported in the administration. Most notably, as part of Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been deployed to engage in street-level thuggery to harass, manhandle, and abuse migrant populations and the communities that support them.\n\nIn one of the more open endorsements of the type of white supremacy that groups like Aryan Freedom Network espouse, Trump has gone about restoring statues and military base names meant to honor pro-slavery Confederates.\n\nThe administration’s allies are on a neo-Nazi kick as well. Musk has allowed pro-Nazi content to flourish and thrive on his social media site, X, formerly Twitter. Musk has expressed support for Nazi-affiliated parties around the world, including the extremist Alternative for Germany party.\n\nOn Fox News, host Greg Gutfeld recently argued that conservatives should tell each other “What up, my Nazi? Hey, what up, my Nazi?” to mock Americans’ sensitivities to racism. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, one of the biggest Trump backers in media, posted a meme on Wednesday that argued “We Are ALL Hitler” after Musk and Trump were criticized for making Nazi-style salutes.\n\nThe affiliation between Trump and the neo-Nazi right was a topic of concern raised by then-Vice President Kamala Harris during her presidential campaign last year.\n\n“I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people,” Harris said last September.\n\nNow the tragedy has come to pass.","summary":"Neo-Nazi groups are praising President Donald Trump for bringing their bigoted ideas and rhetoric into the mainstream of American politics. Over the years, multiple Democratic leaders have warned about this possibility.\n\n\n\nReuters reported on Friday that the Aryan Freedom Network, a Texas-based white supremacist group, is pleased with the direction that Trump has taken the country in. Co-leader Dalton Henry Stout told the outlet Trump has “awakened a lot of people to the issues we’ve been raising for years” and described the head of the Republican Party as “the best thing that’s happened to us.”\n\n\n\nThe white supremacists told Reuters they love Trump’s repeated praise of “Western values,” his attacks on DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives, and his opposition to immigration.

The state swung back into the Democrat camp in 2020, then went Republican again in 2024.\n\nDemocrat Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., are both up for reelection—the former next year; the latter in 2028.\n\nShapiro will be campaigning in a state that went for Trump in 2024 by 120,000 votes over Democrat Kamala Harris. The Pennsylvania Democrat won his first term in 2022 by more than 14 points, although that double-digit landslide win was likely due at least in part to a less than stellar GOP opponent.\n\nShapiro may find himself in a bind if state Republicans succeed in passing a bill that would ban males from participating in girls and women’s sports in Pennsylvania public high schools and public universities. The legislation passed the state Senate with bipartisan support, but is currently languishing in the Democrat-controlled state House. \n\nShapiro drew sharp criticism this week after joining a lawsuit to block Trump from placing prohibitions on juvenile gender surgeries and for criticizing supporters of that state Senate bill that would ban men and boys from competing in female sports, Fox News reported.\n\nShapiro is widely seen as having 2028 presidential ambitions, but has faced criticism in the Philadelphia Inquirer in recent weeks for bolstering his communications staff at Pennsylvania taxpayer expense. The governor has also been scrutinized over how he handled a sexual harassment claim against one of his aides. The governor’s office used $295,000 of taxpayer funding to settle the claim.\n\nShapiro also vetoed school choice legislation, despite having endorsed the concept on the campaign trail. \n\nFetterman could face a Democrat primary in 2028. Conor Lamb, the former Pennsylvania congressman who unsuccessfully challenged Fetterman back in 2022 for the Democrat nomination in the Senate race, was profiled in Politico on Thursday about his recent tour around the state listening to voters’ concerns. Fetterman has received praise from the right for his stalwart support of Israel at the same time that some left-wing Democrat activists have criticized him for being insufficiently critical of President Trump.\n\nLamb also criticized his former Democrat primary opponent in the Politico piece. \n\n“But [a 2028 Senate bid is] three years away, and to be honest, when I started this, I thought John would maybe adjust and start acting like a better senator, and start speaking up for the people that he used to promise he was going to fight for, raising the minimum wage and all sorts of issues,” the former congressman was quoted as saying. \n\nThe 2026 midterms will also see the entire Pennsylvania delegation in the House of Representatives up for reelection. Some Republicans, among them Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Brian Fitzpatrick, are in vulnerable districts. Fitzpatrick voted against the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” that the Trump administration used as a vehicle to pass his Make America Great Again priorities, including more funding for the border and defense and a no tax on tips provision. Bresnahan received good news in June: His 2024 Democrat rival, now-former Rep. Matt Cartwright, would not seek to reclaim Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District seat.","summary":"The 2026 election year is set to be a big one for Pennsylvania with significant races at the gubernatorial and congressional level, and two years...

Her suit was the most militant lawfare I encountered during my year of investigative research for the book.\n\nAs I noted earlier this week:\n\nLetitia “Tish” James is a partisan Democrat who ran and won her race for New York Attorney General specifically to try to destroy Trump. She is one of the most open and public practitioners of lawfare featured in the book. She once told a group of New York Democrats that “I look forward to going into the office of the Attorney General every day, suing [Trump], and then going home.” She uses the law to advance political goals, and she doesn’t hide that fact. Despite rising crime in New York during her tenure as state AG, she seems entirely fixated on getting Trump.\n\nHere are eight clear examples that prove James had no intention of ever affording President Trump equal protection under the law.\n\n1. Targeted Prosecution\n\n“We’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass. He’s going to know my name personally.” That’s what James said when assuming office, on video. She didn’t take long to make good on that promise. “We will use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family as well,” she stated a month after the election. This is the definition of a witch hunt.\n\nIn fact, James barely even paid lip service to addressing the rising criminality in New York so that she could stay narrowly focused on Trump (and hosting drag story hour read-a-thons).\n\n“The number one issue in this country is defeating Donald Trump. Nothing else matters,” James said.\n\nThat’s saying the quiet part out loud.\n\n2. She Prosecuted a Victimless (Non-)Crime\n\nThe crux of James’s suit against the Trumps was that they undervalued properties to gain better rates on loans, insurance policies, and tax rates. Who was the victim here of the evil Trump Organization? Apparently, it was corporations, specifically multibillion-dollar financial institutions that loaned money to the Trump family.\n\nSo, what did these corporations say when they filed complaints about Trump? Ah! But there were no complaints. The supposedly victimized banks and lenders liked working with the Trump Organization, so far as I can tell. It was James who brought the case on behalf of financial institutions that never claimed for a moment to be harmed.\n\nThe only harm in a business transaction is financial harm, and representatives of these institutions got onto the witness stand and under oath said they were not harmed and did not suffer.\n\nThis was literally unprecedented. It was the first time in state history that someone was accused of fraud even though no one believed that they had been harmed.\n\n3. Blatantly Undervaluing Mar-a-Lago to Justify Abuse\n\nMuch of the case hinged on the valuation of Trump’s legendary Mar- a-Lago property in Florida. The resort and club, which is a National Historic Landmark and has been Trump’s primary residence since 2019, was assessed a value in the range of $18 million to $28 million between 2011 and 2021. The court insisted these weren’t his figures, but the valuation of a basic Palm Beach assessment. The appraiser’s office is tasked with assessing property value for taxation purpose. Trump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million, according to the suit, which the judge declared was “an overvaluation of at least 2,300%, compared to the assessor’s appraisal.” Trump, on the other hand, testified that he believed the property is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\nOne-acre properties in the area routinely hit the real estate market in the $40 million price range, and two-acre homes in the area often are priced between $150 million and $200 million. Mar-a-Lago isn’t merely a unique historic landmark; it is 17 acres of beachfront property. Despite the sheer magnitude and the historical significance of the location, James and company advanced the opinion it was worth only a fraction of properties a tenth its size.\n\nThe court’s valuation of Mar-a-Lago was perhaps 1/50th its actual worth. This is “criminal” in the figurative sense, perhaps the literal sense too.\n\n4. Illicit White House Visits\n\nPublicly available records show that Tish James visited the Biden White House several times during the investigation and trial. First, on April 8, 2022, for a celebration of Ketanji Brown Jackson; then on July 18, 2022, to meet with Kamala Harris along with other attorneys general; and then on August 31, 2023, for an event honoring black women. It is possible but unknown at this time if she discussed Trump’s trial during these visits.\n\nI spoke to President Trump about these visits, and he is of the belief that she was coordinating with the Biden White House about the case.\n\nThis ought to be a major focus of the DOJ’s investigation.\n\n5. A Criminal Trial in Civil Court\n\nOne of the dead giveaways that Tish James was not even attempting to play fair was that she carried out the case as if it were taking place in a criminal court and the Trump family were crooks—despite the fact that the case was filed in civil court.\n\nThere are several distinctions between civil and criminal law, but the most relevant here is that most criminal cases are prosecuted by officials who represent a state, country, or some other jurisdiction. Civil cases are typically brought by an aggrieved party who believes that they are the victim of some wrongdoing. In this instance, the chief law enforcement officer for New York brought a civil case, not a criminal one, against Trump.\n\nShe did that because there was no criminal wrongdoing alleged.\n\nThe banks regarded Trump as a “whale,” an ideal business partner. He made every payment on time. He paid every dollar owed. The financial institutions made every nickel they expected to make from their dealings with him. Trump told me he even had a tendency to pay back loans early, even if he incurred penalties, ensuring that banks were happy with their relationship.\n\nYet Tish James took the position that Trump had conned them. The tenor of the suit suggested that he was an evildoer and needed to be punished.\n\n6. Creating a New Crime to Get Trump\n\nTish James was essentially creating a law out of whole cloth. She relied on New York Executive Law §63(12), which gives the authority broad power to investigate and prosecute civil fraud against consumers. It was typically used to go after con men who swindled sweet little grannies out of their savings, not real estate developers who sign agreements with sophisticated banks — banks who then told the court that they received every dime they were due on time and that they would do business with Trump again.\n\n“They tried me on a statute like it was consumer fraud, like I stole a refrigerator,” Trump told me in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe law was applied uniquely—and more harshly—than ever before.\n\n7. Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\nTrump was initially assessed a $464 million fine for this victimless (non-)crime. This is not just confiscatory, it’s appallingly excessive.\n\nThe New York Supreme Court Appellate Division—the intermediate court in New York— reduced his bond to $175 million. As of March 2025 (when I last interviewed President Trump), they still had his money.\n\nTrump ought to pursue the appeal all the way to our nation’s top court. At a minimum, I expect the Supreme Court to rule that penalizing him half a billion dollars for a victimless violation violates the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause. “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted,” the amendment reads. Notice how the language does not specify whether the excessive fine is related to a criminal or a civil matter, so Trump’s attorneys can certainly use this argument.\n\nNo other president in U.S. history could have survived this type of penalty. It is the definition of cruel and unusual.\n\n8. Election Interference\n\nThe fact that this case was allowed to go on is outrageous. The fact that it took place during the middle of a presidential election is a national disgrace.\n\nThis New York attorney general has always sought to destroy Trump and is clearly abusing her power to do so. (The judge in this juryless case does not seem to be operating on a rational plane. More on that in my book.)\n\nAs I concluded in Breaking the Law:\n\nThe most powerful law enforcement officer in a massively powerful state used her power to target and attempt to character-assassinate one of the state’s most successful residents on naked political grounds. It wasn’t merely excessive; this was a low moment for our country.\nJustice must be served, and Trump must win his appeal.\nThen Tish James ought to be prosecuted for conspiracy against rights.\n\nI’m heartened to learn that the DOJ intends to hold James accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nThe investigations should then extend far beyond James and Jack Smith. Only then can we begin to dismantle the lawfare superstructure.\n\nAs Tish James is fond of saying herself, “[N]o one is above the law.”\n\nThis article was adapted from portions of Breaking the Law.\n\nBreaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, which has been hailed by President Trump as a “must read” book, is available in hardcover, eReader format, and as an audiobook read by the author himself.\n\nAlex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, and the host of “The Alex Marlow Show” podcast produced weekdays by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

It is collapsing right in front of you.”\n\nAbrams brought up the subject by playing a clip of Carville on his show in February, where he declared that the Trump administration was “collapsing” and would be falling apart within 30 days.\n\nAbrams asked the strategist Thursday if he still stood by the prediction. \n\nCarville replied, saying he was “a pretty smart guy in February.”\n\nHe defended the months-old prediction, stating, “You look at what’s happening, and you look at the current stuff that’s coming in – the public has revulsions against this.”\n\nHe pointed to Democratic candidates leading in upcoming elections, like the governor’s race in Virginia, saying that proves Trump’s demise is underway.\n\n“Do you know how much we’re going to win by in Virginia?” he asked. \n\n“Do you have any idea?”\n\n“No, I don’t,” Abrams responded. \n\n“It’s gonna be a lot,” Carville declared. \n\n“It’s not going to be close.”\n\nA recent Virginia Commonwealth Poll from July has Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears at 37% and Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger at 49%. \n\nStill, Abrams wasn’t convinced. \n\n“But you said that you thought that this administration was in the midst of a collapse.”\n\n“I think it is. Yes, I do,” Carville shot back.\n\n“And you think you were right?” Abrams asked. \n\nCarville didn’t back down, stating, “Yes. I think there are — they’re somewhere about 37% or 40% approval. Their economic numbers are terrible, are just terrible. And I think we’re running away with every election we’ve had. We’re going to run away with Virginia. We’re going to win New Jersey. We’re starting to recruit every candidate that we want.”\n\nAbrams continued pushing, mentioning polling showing that Trump isn’t exactly in the midst of collapsing.\n\n“I pulled up the recent approval polling from The New York Times and Real Clear Politics, and the aggregation puts Trump’s approval between 44 and 45.8, with 53 and 51.4 disapproval, as of August the 6th. That’s not a collapse. That’s basically a little bit above where he was.”\n\nCarville dismissed the numbers, saying the polling for upcoming elections “in no way reflect that.” \n\n“I don’t want to get into saying this poll, that poll, this aggregate poll; but I look at like the UMass Amherst poll, I look at Gallup, I look at people like that. I see something completely different. I’m very, very, very confident that this administration is going to be widely rejected in the elections coming up; and they’re gonna be particularly widely rejected in the elections in 2026,” he said.\n\nOne of Carville’s more recent predictions didn’t go so well. \n\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, the political veteran was so convinced that Kamala Harris would win, he wrote a column for the New York Times titled, “Three Reasons I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Win.”\n\nCarville’s column slammed Trump as a “repeat electoral loser” and claimed “This time will be no different,” while heaping praise on the Democratic nominee.","summary":"Democratic strategist James Carville claims he was right in predicting that the Trump administration would collapse within 30 days of President Donald Trump’s second term.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/08/media/james-carville-doubles-down-for-predicting-trump-admin-collapse-says-its-happening-now/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/109372306.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7JUYqxS7-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-08 21:35:42","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":349701598,"title":"In America's hardest-fought congressional district, voters agree — Release the Epstein files","text":"LOS BANOS, Calif. — When it comes to President Donald Trump, Angie Zamora and Phaidra Medeiros agree on very little.\n\nZamora, a 36-year-old Army veteran, has nothing good to say.\n\n“The laws. All the rights taken away from women. The stuff with ICE,” Zamora said, ticking off her frustrations as she stopped outside the post office in the Central Valley community of Los Banos. “Why are they going after people working on farms when they’re supposed to be chasing violent criminals?”\n\nMedeiros, by contrast, is delighted Trump replaced Joe Biden. “He wasn’t mentally fit,” Medeiros said of the elderly ex-president. “There was something wrong with him from the very beginning.”\n\nDespite all that, the two do share one belief: Both say the government should cough up every last bit of information it has on Jeffrey Epstein, his sordid misdeeds and the powerful associates who moved in his aberrant orbit.\n\nTrump “did his whole campaign on releasing the Epstein files,” Zamora said. “And now he’s trying to change the subject. ‘Oh, it’s a ‘hoax’ ... ‘Oh, you guys are still talking about that creep?’ And yet there’s pictures throughout the years of him with that creep.”\n\nMedeiros, 56, echoed the sentiment.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans “put themselves into this predicament because they kept talking constantly” about the urgency of unsealing records in Epstein’s sex-trafficking case — until they took control of the Justice Department and the rest of Washington. “Now,” she said, “they’re backpedaling.”\n\nMedeiros paused outside the engineering firm where she works in the Central Valley, in Newman, on a tree-lined street adorned with star-spangled banners honoring local servicemen and women.\n\n“Obviously there were minors involved” in Epstein’s crimes, she said, and if Trump is somehow implicated “then he needs to go down as well.”\n\nYears after being found dead in a Manhattan prison cell — killed by his own hand, according to authorities — Epstein appears to have done the near-impossible in this deeply riven nation. He’s united Democrats, Republicans and independents around a call to reveal, once and for all, everything that’s known about his case.\n\n“He’s dead now, but if people were involved they should be prosecuted,” said Joe Toscano, a 69-year-old Los Banos retiree and unaffiliated voter who last year supported Trump’s return to the White House. “Bring it all out there. Make it public.”\n\nCalifornia’s 13th Congressional District, where Zamora, Medeiros and Toscano all live, is arguably the most closely fought political terrain in America. Sprawling through California’s midriff, from the far reaches of the San Francisco Bay Area to the southern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, it’s farm country: flat, fertile and crossed-hatched with canals, rail lines and thruways with utilitarian names such as Road No. 32 and Avenue 18½.\n\nThe myriad small towns are brief interludes amid the dairy and poultry farms and lush carpeting of vegetables, fruit and nut trees that stretch to the hazy-brown horizon. The most populous city, Merced, has fewer than 100,000 residents. Democratic Rep. Adam Gray was elected in November in the closest House race in the country, beating the Republican incumbent, John Duarte, by 187 votes out of nearly 211,000 cast. The squeaker was a rematch and nearly a rerun. Two years prior, Duarte defeated Gray by fewer than 600 votes out of nearly 134,000 cast.\n\nNot surprisingly, both parties have made the 13th District a top target in 2026; handicappers rate the contest a toss-up, even as the field sorts itself out. (Duarte has said he would not run again.)\n\nThe midterm election is a long way off, so it’s impossible to say how the Epstein controversy will play out politically. But there is, at the least, a baseline expectation of transparency, a view that was repeatedly expressed in conversations with three dozen voters across the district.\n\nZachery Ramos, a 25-year-old independent, is the founder of the Gustine Traveling Library, which promotes learning and literacy throughout the Central Valley. Its storefront, painted with polka dots and decorated with giant butterflies, sits like a cheery oasis in Gustine’s four-block downtown.\n\nInside, the walls were filled with commendations and newspaper clippings celebrating Ramos’ good works. As a nonprofit, he said, “we have to have everything out there. All the books. Everything.”\n\nEpstein, he suggested, should be treated no differently.\n\n“When it comes to something as serious as that, with what may or may not have taken place on his private island, with his girlfriend” — convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell — “I do think it should all be out in the open,” Ramos said. “If you’re not afraid of your name being in (the files), especially when you’re dealing with minors being assaulted, it should 100 percent be made public.”\n\nEd, a 42-year-old Democrat who manages a warehouse operation in Patterson, noted that Trump released the government’s long-secret files on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., even though King’s family objected. (Like several of those interviewed, he declined to give his last name, to avoid being hassled by readers who don’t like what he had to say.)\n\nWhy, Ed wondered, shouldn’t the Epstein files come to light? “It wasn’t just Trump,” he said. “It was a lot of Republicans in Congress that said, ‘Hey, we want to get these files out there.’ And I believe if Kamala (Harris) had won, they would be beating her down, demanding she do so.”\n\nHe smacked a fist in his palm, to emphasize the point.\n\nSue, a Madera Republican and no fan of Trump, expressed her feelings in staccato bursts of fury.\n\n“Apparently the women years ago said who was doing what, but nobody listens to the women,” said the 75-year-old retiree. “Release it all! Absolutely! You play, you pay, buddy.”\n\nEven those who dismissed the importance of Epstein and his crimes said the government should hold nothing back — if only to erase doubts and lay the issue to rest.\n\nEpstein “is gone and I don’t really care if they release the files or not,” said Diane Nunes, a 74-year-old Republican who keeps the books for her family farm, which lies halfway between Los Banos and Gustine. “But they probably should, because a lot of people are waiting for that.”\n\nPatrick, a construction contractor, was more worked up about “pretty boy” Gavin Newsom and “Nazi Pelosi” — “yes, that’s what I call her” — than anything that might be lurking in the Epstein files. “When the cat is dead, you don’t pick it up and pet it. Right?” He motioned to the pavement, baking as the temperature in Patterson climbed into the low 90s.\n\n“It’s over with,” the 61-year-old Republican said of Epstein and his villainy. “Move on.”\n\nAt least, that would be his preference. But to “shut everybody up, absolutely, yeah, they should release them,” Patrick said. “Otherwise, we’re all going to be speculating forever.”\n\nOr at least until the polls close in November 2026.\n\nMark Z.

That effort is on pause as Democratic legislators left the state to deny a quorum for a vote. But other states, led by Democrats and Republicans, could follow suit.What To KnowSome Republicans have criticized states like California and New York mulling redraws but have not commented on Texas. But at least three Republican members of Congress have voiced opposition to Texas' redistricting efforts while also criticizing Democratic states' efforts to redraw their maps.Representative Kevin Kiley, CaliforniaKiley has introduced a bill that would prohibit any state from engaging in mid-decade redistricting.During an interview with WBUR, Boston's NPR affiliate, on Friday, Kiley voiced opposition to the Texas efforts.\"I don't think gerrymandering is a good thing. I think it's a problem wherever it occurs, whether it's in a Republican state or a Democrat state, and I especially think it's bad when it's happening in an unscheduled way, as we're seeing right now,\" Kiley said.When asked about whether it is appropriate for Texas Democrats to be pressured to return—whether by threats to remove the lawmakers who left the state from office or have the FBI locate them—Kiley said people watching the redistricting battle are thinking, \"This is nuts.\"\"This is not the way that the process is supposed to work,\" he said. \"This is not the way politics and representative government is supposed to work, and I think the whole spectacle just underscores the need to have a return to sanity here.\"If California redraws its map, Kiley's district could be redrawn to take in more Democratic areas. Trump carried the district by about four points last year, though Kiley won reelection by about 11 points.Representative Mike Lawler, New YorkLawler is another Republican whose district could be at risk of becoming more Democratic if New York redraws its map. He already represents a district won by former Vice President Kamala Harris last November and is a top target for Democrats as they try to reclaim a House majority.He has introduced a bill to end partisan gerrymandering nationwide as well as mid-decade redistricting.He told CNN this week that he believes what Texas is doing is \"wrong.\"\"The problem is that across the country, gerrymandering has been happening after each successive census, and it's created less competitive districts,\" he said. \"There's very little room in terms of trying to pick up seats.\"Representative Blake Moore, UtahMoore has also spoken out against the redistricting efforts by Texas.\"I do not agree with state efforts to redistrict mid-decade. It undermines established norms and gives blue states a glaring green light to do the same,\" he told local news station KSL. \"Partisan gerrymandering is clearly done by both sides, but to allow this wildfire to spread mid-decade is a step too far.\"When reached by Newsweek, a Moore spokesperson referred to that statement.Newsweek also reached out to Kiley's and Lawler's offices for comment via email.Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, shared a meme about the redistricting battle, comparing Texas Democrats leaving the state to Republicans leaving Washington to avoid a vote on legislation to compel the release of the Epstein files.What People Are SayingHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told Fox News: \"California has a problem. They've got to amend the state Constitution, as I understand the law out there, to do it. We have to fight for every inch of ground in the country. We are in an era of very small margins, as you said, because of gerrymandering and redistricting. But they have to follow the law. I'm convinced the red states will, and we will probably have a few more seats out of that, of course, and that's good news for me.\"New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said during a press conference on Monday: \"If Republicans are willing to rewrite these rules to give themselves an advantage, then they're leaving us no choice; we must do the same. There's a phrase, 'You have to fight fire with fire.' That is a true statement of how we're feeling right now. And as I've said, another overused but applicable phrase, 'All is fair in love and war'— that's why I'm exploring with our leaders every option to redraw our state congressional lines as soon as possible.\"What Happens NextOn Friday, Republicans in Texas were again denied a quorum to pass their redistricting effort. GOP leaders in the state have been considering expulsion of members who left the state, and the FBI could locate the lawmakers. How other states' redistricting efforts play out remains to be seen.","summary":"Some GOP lawmakers have criticized the mid-decade effort by Texas Republicans to redraw the state's congressional boundaries.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-lawmakers-speaking-out-redistricting-battle-2111089","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699466/rep-kevin-kiley-redistricting.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e8e0a1b39573ad2d7ed3f4fe788fdcad","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 21:24:39","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":349446198,"title":"Three years after Mar-a-Lago raid, a powerful Trump looks to settle scores","text":"“This is a stark reminder of a dark time in our country’s history when political enemies of President Trump disgustingly weaponized the justice system to go after him,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said as the anniversary arrived. “The American people saw right through the lies and President Trump was completely vindicated as he overwhelmingly won the 2024 election in historic fashion.”\n\nThe Aug. 8, 2022, raid of Mar-a-Lago was one of many events that Trump described as lawfare in between his first and second terms, including the prosecution of hundreds of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot participants, numerous court cases in multiple states against Trump himself, and even a conviction on 34 felony counts in New York.\n\nWhile some of those later events, in particular Trump’s first indictment in Manhattan in April 2023, were credited with fueling his comeback over GOP rivals such as Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), the raid came before he announced he was running again.\n\nRepublican strategist Dave Carney said that Trump was going to be a force to be reckoned with, no matter what, in the 2024 election cycle, but the raid jump-started his incredible comeback.\n\n“It was a catalyst for the validation of the entire argument that Trump had been making up to that point about criminalization, politicization, and lawfare,” Carney said. “It just proved how desperate [President Joe] Biden’s team was.”\n\nTrump had already returned some records to the National Archives in January of 2022, after the agency identified records from his first term that were not in its possession.\n\nBut the raid came unannounced, while Trump was in another state, leading to outrage among the then-former president and his supporters.\n\n“These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump said in a statement that night, claiming agents even “broke into [his] safe.”\n\n“Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before,” Trump continued. “After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024.”\n\nRequests for comment sent to the FBI and Justice Department were not returned. \n\nThree months after the raid, Trump announced his third run for president at the same Mar-a-Lago mansion where the FBI executed its search warrant. Initially, there was some doubt about Trump’s viability against younger upstarts, but he quickly showed his strength and was boosted by the continuation of various court cases against him.\n\n“The decline of America is being forced upon us by Biden and the radical left lunatics running our government right into the ground,” Trump said the night he announced his third run. “This decline is not a fate we must accept.”\n\nAccording to the FBI’s search warrant, agents were directed to seize from the resort “any government and/or Presidential Records created between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021,” as well as “any evidence of the knowing alteration, destruction, or concealment of any government and/or Presidential Records, or of any documents with classification markings.”\n\nAmong the items that the FBI reportedly obtained were Trump’s executive grant of clemency for Roger Stone, information pertaining to the “President of France,” two binders of photos, a handwritten note, and other documents marked confidential, secret, or top secret.\n\nBiden’s staff insisted that he was not aware of the raid and “not briefed” beforehand, but that didn’t stop Trump from attacking him over the issue, especially when classified documents were later foundat Biden’s own Delaware home.\n\n“[The raid] was a hugely gigantic political blunder by the Democrats,” Carney said.\n\nTrump later sued the Justice Department for $100 million in damages in August of 2024, arguing that the search was an “intrusion upon seclusion, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.”\n\nIn the end, the raid was not enough to keep Trump from re-entering the White House, while Biden was forced to drop out of his own reelection bid in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter retaking office, Trump had all of the documents flown back to Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 28, 2025, the same day as his famous blowup with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. \n\nThe boxes were loaded onto Air Force One that evening in full view of reporters ahead of a flight from Washington to Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump spent the weekend playing golf.\n\nDuring the flight, Counselor to the President Alina Habba told reporters that the search was never justified and that items were taken from Barron Trump’s closet and from first lady Melania Trump’s closet.\n\n“It is truly an honor and full circle to be on this trip,” Habba said. “The boxes are going back, and frankly, this was a hoax, as we knew. … They went into drawers they shouldn’t have. They made a mockery of our justice system, and this is a perfect example.”\n\nHabba said the raid looked like something from a “third world country,” adding that, “In America, you do not get to go to somebody’s home, raid their children’s, their wife’s, their personal belongings… we don’t operate that way in this country.”\n\nNow, with Kash Patel installed as FBI director, many agents involved in the raid have been let go as Trump reworks the federal bureaucracy to fit his vision. \n\nThe Mar-a-Lago raid also led to the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who led the investigation into the Trump classified documents case and into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. But Smith himself is now under investigation, with the tables of power now turned against him and Trump ready to bring what he sees as accountability to the people who engaged in lawfare between his presidential terms. \n\nOther examples of that phenomenon include the Biden autopen investigation, a grand jury investigation to weigh “Russiagate” conspiracy charges against former Obama administration officials, and even subpoenas for Bill and Hillary Clinton as part of an investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIronically, Trump’s own court victories could now help shield Clinton and Obama, as the Supreme Court ruled that presidents enjoy some immunity from prosecution related to their official acts, a fact now weighing in favor of Trump’s Democratic predecessors. \n\nIn any case, the Mar-a-Lago boxes are back in Florida, and Trump now says that they will eventually be displayed in his presidential library. And while it appears that Trump will have the last laugh in the matter, that doesn’t mean that Trump and his team will ever let it go lightly.\n\nTrump to appoint adviser Stephen Miran as Fed governor\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said that the raiders themselves were trying to cover up evidence of their own wrongdoing.\n\n“The Mar-a-Lago raid was a perpetuation and continuation of this same conspiracy,” Miller said. “They went and searched in hopes of trying to recover the documents that would implicate their own criminal conduct. The entire raid was a perpetuation of this same criminal scheme.”","summary":"Three years ago, the FBI raided former President Donald Trump&#8216;s Mar-a-Lago home, taking away 26 boxes that officials said included documents with classified markings.

New poll finds crowded field","text":"A new poll finds Democratic former congresswoman Katie Porter leads a crowded field in the 2026 California governor’s race, after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced last month she would not launch a bid for the state’s highest office.\n\nBut with Harris taking herself out of the race, and possibly eyeing another presidential campaign, a significant segment of likely voters remains undecided when it comes to who should replace Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nPorter, a favorite among progressives who represented Orange County in the U.S. House of Representatives until this year, leads with 18% of voters, up from 12% in April, according to the poll by Emerson College.\n\nThe poll comes as Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, the first woman elected to the office, announced Friday she is dropping out of the race and launching a campaign for state treasurer. She had just 3% support in the poll.\n\nConservative political commentator Steve Hilton, the leading Republican candidate, came in second with 12%. He’s followed by Republican Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 7%, former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5% and billionaire Los Angeles real estate developer Rick Caruso, a Republican-turned-Democrat who has yet to officially jump into the race, at 4%.\n\nThe poll, taken earlier this month, found 38% were undecided, down from 54% in April.\n\nJack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College, said that while the early results are good news for Porter, who lost to Adam Schiff in a bid for U.S. Senate last year, he expected the numbers to move significantly between now and Election Day.\n\n“If I were running one of the campaigns in the low single digits, I’d say we have a lot of room to grow,” he said.\n\nIn a fundraising email Friday, the Porter campaign said the poll showed she is the “clear Democratic frontrunner, with a 13-point lead over the next closest Democrat.”\n\nOn the social media platform X, meanwhile, the Hilton campaign sought to frame the results as confirming a “two-horse race for California governor: Katie Porter v. Steve Hilton.” The state’s last Republican governor was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who held the position from 2003 to 2011.\n\nCalifornia will hold a gubernatorial primary election, including candidates from all parties, on June 2, 2026. The top two vote-getters from the primary will then face off in the general election on November 3, 2026. Newsom, a likely contender for president in 2028, is termed out.\n\n“At this moment, I believe I can make the greatest impact by focusing on California’s financial future,” Kounalakis said in a statement.\n\nPitney said her departure may free up donors who would have backed Kounalakis, a former real estate developer, to support more conservative candidates.\n\n“She had a reputation as a more centrist, business-friendly Democrat,” he said.\n\nThe poll also found that Newsom leads California’s possible contenders in a Democratic presidential primary with 23%. He’s followed by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg at 17%, former Vice President Kamala Harris at 11% and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 9%.\n\nOn the Republican side, 40% support Vice President JD Vance, 10% support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy and 9% support Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nNewsom holds a 44% job approval rating, with 38% disapproving, according to the poll.\n\nOn Friday, the governor hosted Texas Democrats who fled the state in an effort to block redistricting efforts there aimed at electing more Republicans to Congress in next year’s midterm elections. To counter Republicans in Texas, Newsom has floated putting a measure on the statewide ballot allowing California to update its congressional map to benefit Democrats.\n\nThe Emerson poll found 33% support Newsom’s proposal, while 25% oppose and 42% are unsure.\n\n“Support to redraw the state’s congressional map ahead of the Midterm Elections is strongest among Democrats by a 23-point margin, 42% to 19%, and opposed by an eight-point margin among Republicans, 36% to 28%. A majority of independent voters are unsure, while 25% oppose and 23% support,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a statement.\n\nThe poll also found the economy remains the top issue for 30% of California voters, though down from 40% in April. Next came housing affordability at 19%, immigration at 15%, threats to democracy at 13% and health care at 8%.","summary":"The poll comes after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced she would not launch a bid.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/08/california-governor-porter-newsom/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OCR-L-PORTERGOV-0312-10.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 20:14:03","author":"Ethan Varian","authors":["Ethan Varian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":349445942,"title":"GOLDBERG: Kamala Harris won’t cure what’s ailing the Democratic Party ","text":"It’s not all Harris’ fault.

McEntee, 35, drove interest on social media with Gen Zers, the first digital native generation.\n\nIt was a perfect union. MAHA was being covered in the New York Times, New York Magazine and Wall Street Journal. Debono was on Fox News. Date Right Stuff was followed on social media by millions.\n\nThen, it all went off the rails.\n\nNow, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Debono spills the tea about her former boss and claims 'Make America Hot Again' is now hotter than ever – without him.\n\n'If I wanted to,' Debono tells the Daily Mail, 'I could destroy John's life.'\n\nMcEntee first splashed onto the political scene during Trump's 2016 campaign as the president's body man. Then, he became a top personal aide to the president in the first Trump White House.\n\nBut in March 2018, McEntee suddenly left the administration. He was fired by White House Chief of State John Kelly for failing a security clearance check related to a reported gambling habit and he was allegedly escorted out of the West Wing.\n\nWhen reached by the Daily Mail, McEntee did not address these claims.\n\nMcEntee was, however, rehired by Trump's team in 2020 to lead the presidential personnel office, where he reportedly hired 'the most beautiful 21-year-old girls you could find and guys who would be absolutely no threat to Johnny in going after those girls,' according to a November 2021 profile in The Atlantic.\n\nTwo years after that, after leaving public service again, McEntee launched Date Right Stuff with ex-Trump staffers Isaac Stalzer and Dan Huff and financial support from billionaire Peter Thiel.\n\nThe app gained immediate traction, in part, due to McEntee's social media persona. Date Right's official TikTok and Instagram accounts – which currently boast a combined 4.8 million followers – are filled with videos of McEntee sounding off on political and cultural issues from transgender women in sports to illegal immigration to abortion laws and the odd hot take.\n\n'I always keep this fake Hollywood money in my car, so when a homeless person asks for money then I give them a fake $5 bill,' he said in a Tik Tok clip in 2021. 'I feel good about myself, they feel good — and then when they go to use it they get arrested. So I'm actually helping clean up the community, you know, getting them off the streets.'\n\nThe post drew some online outrage. It wasn't lost on critics that in May 2020 Minneapolis man George Floyd was murdered during a struggle with police after he was detained for passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store.\n\nThen, in September 2024, Wired reported that McEntee was accused of sending inappropriate messages via Instagram to two 18-year-old women in late 2023.\n\nBoth women claimed they received messages from Date Right Stuff's official Instagram account – and, initially, they did not know that they were communicating with the company's founder.\n\nThey alleged that McEntee offered to fly them to meet him in Los Angeles. One woman alleged that the conversations were 'sexual from day one' and that he propositioned her to 'hook up.'\n\n'He kept making comments about my age and how hot it would be to sleep with someone who was my age,' she reportedly claimed.\n\nWhile Debono says McEntee was always outwardly kind to her, she tells the Daily Mail: 'I’ll just say I’ve seen his DMs.'\n\nShe did not, however, reveal what exchanges she reviewed.\n\nEight months later, after working for Date Right Stuff for a year, Debono left – and took her burgeoning brand with her.\n\n'I lost faith in the vision,' says Debono, who believes the 'true conservative' way to meet your match is by way of real-life meetups. 'Dating apps are dead,' she says.\n\nMcEntee, however, tells the Daily Mail that Debono 'was fired because she wasn't doing a good job.' (He did not comment on any other allegations reported in this article.)\n\nBut at the time of Debono's exit, the buzz about 'Make America Hot Again' had reached fever pitch.\n\nA New York Magazine cover trumpeted that the young Republicans embodied the 'cruel kids table.' The Washington Post called them 'MAGA fashionistas.' Photos from one of the ticketed soirees were printed in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nNow, it's a much different picture.\n\nThe content on McEntee's social media accounts have seemingly dried up. His most recent TikTok post is from December 2024. The latest Instagram Reel was posted in March.\n\nDebono says she was never told why McEntee seemingly stopped posting on social media, but she claims his relative radio silence contributed to a significant decline in Date Right Stuff users.\n\nWhile she could not provide an exact figure, she says that numbers she viewed while working at the company 'plummeted.'\n\nThe Debono-McEntee split could have easily spelled the end of 'Make America Hot Again' - but a determined Debono says she is, in fact, now doing better than ever before.\n\nAttendance at MAHA events that she is staging on her own are, she claims, soaring 'like crazy.' More than 200 people attended her most recent party in New York City forcing her to book a bigger venue for the next event, DeBono says. Other events have been held in Washington DC.\n\nHer success, she believes, is fueled by her authenticity.

A black-and-yellow banner covering a billboard on the 91 Freeway in Corona boldly states: \"Proud Boys Love Sydney Sweeney,\" according to a photo that one Corona resident shared with ABC7. The banner, which uses the neo-fascist group's signature colors, also references the hot-button American Eagle ad. \"She has the best blue genes,\" the banner says. Note \"genes,\" not \"jeans.\" It's worth remembering that President Trump during a 2020 presidential debate ordered the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" when pressed about condemning right-wing violent extremists. It's unclear who put up the banner bearing the far-right group's name, according to ABC7. A representative for Sweeney did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment on Friday. Earlier this month, jeans retailer American Eagle dropped a string of commercials for its latest campaign featuring the \"Euphoria\" star. In one advertisement, the Emmy-nominated actor who is blond says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue,” she says. Posters for the American Eagle campaign also featured the totally innovative, never-before-seen wordplay on \"jeans\" and genes.\" A slogan reads, \"Sydney Sweeney has great genes,\" with the final word crossed out and replaced with \"jeans.\" Sweeney, who seems to have a penchant for odd marketing opportunities, and the ads quickly faced criticism on social media, with users alleging the campaign leaned into the language of eugenics. Eugenics is a discredited practice that essentially touted the idea of improving the human race through selective breeding. It gained traction in the early 20th century and was used as a justification for Hitler's Nazi Germany to wipe out millions of Jewish people, and U.S. authorities to forcibly sterilize more than 60,000 people in California and more than 30 other states. In an attempt to quell the ire, American Eagle posted a statement stating that its campaign \"is and always was about the jeans.\" Sweeney and the American Eagle campaign notably found support among the conservative crowd — it wasn't the first time for the 27-year-old \"Immaculate\" actor. Days after the ad dropped, public records revealing her most recent voter registration history resurfaced, unveiling she registered as a Republican in June 2024. Trump found that irresistible to post about on his Truth Social platform. “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there. It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.’ Go get ‘em Sydney!” he posted Monday. In an earlier version of his post, Trump misspelled the actor's name as \"Sidney Sweeney.\" He also used the post to diss brands he claimed used \"woke\" marketing, including Jaguar and Bud Light. Trump also couldn't resist throwing shade at pop star Taylor Swift, who openly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election. Amid the fashion fracas and social media discourse, it seems neither Sweeney nor American Eagle had anything to lose. Sweeney shrugged off her latest bout of controversy last week as she was spotted doing karaoke with some \"Euphoria\" co-stars in Santa Monica. She also hit the red carpet on Monday to promote her latest film, \"Americana,\" from writer-director Tony Tost. American Eagle, on the other hand, saw its stock surge this week.","summary":"As Sydney Sweeney remains mum on the backlash to her American Eagle jeans ad, a defaced billboard in SoCal claims she has new supporters: neo-fascist group the Proud Boys.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-08-08/sydney-sweeney-proud-boys-socal-billboard","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/595b5a1/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5349x3565+0+0/resize/1486x990!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9d%2F2d%2Fbe65bb794afa99a6ba2db1ab6f06%2Fknicks-nets-basketbal","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 18:49:34","author":"Alexandra Del Rosario","authors":["Alexandra Del Rosario"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.25},{"id":349412786,"title":"Dem ‘Blueprint’ Promised By Hakeem Jeffries Still Nowhere To Be Seen At Self-Imposed Deadline","text":"House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries pledged to roll out a plan articulating Democrats’ policy agenda — explicitly not about President Donald Trump — by August 8, but appears likely to miss his self-imposed deadline.\n\nJeffries committed to unveiling a “blueprint for a better America” that would specify what Democrats stand for within 100 days of delivering an address on April 30. Though Jeffries and House Democrats have continued to beat the drum torching the president and his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the caucus has largely steered clear of rolling out any policy proposals reminiscent of a “blueprint” — and appears likely to miss his Friday deadline of specifying any policy details. (RELATED: Dem Admits Party’s Epstein Files Attack Line Is ‘Bulls*it’)\n\n“Over these next 100 days House Democrats are going to lay out a blueprint for a better America. And you will see a vision for this country’s future that isn’t about Donald Trump. It’s all about you,” Jeffries said to applause during an address slamming the president’s first 100 days. “These are the questions we are thinking about each and every day.”\n\nOn July 23, day 84 of Jeffries’ 100-day timeline, a reporter asked for a status update about the blueprint during a press conference Jeffries hosted shortly before the House adjourned for the August district work period.\n\nJeffries replied that he planned to share more with the media in the future, before qualifying that the policy details may not come until Democrats retake the House majority.\n\n“We look forward to sharing those ideas with the American people consistent with what I’ve talked about in terms of our focus on making life more affordable for everyday Americans and driving down the high cost of living,” Jeffries said, while also referring to Democrats’ focus on healthcare issues and Social Security.\n\n“We’ll have a lot more to say about the actions that we would take as soon as we have the opportunity to govern in the majority,” Jeffries added.\n\nThough the lead House Democrat has organized multiple “days of action” highlighting Democrats’ focus on different topics, including Medicaid and veterans, they have centered their opposition to Trump in their messaging, rather than putting forth policy details.\n\nRepublicans have consistently hammered Jeffries and House Democrats for letting their resistance to the president’s agenda dominate the party’s messaging while sharing few policy details about how they would govern.\n\n“Hakeem Jeffries has no blueprint, no plan, and no clue,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement. “After 200 days of President Trump delivering for the American people, Democrats can’t outline a plan because their real agenda is too toxic to say out loud: open borders, sky-high taxes, handouts for illegal immigrants, men in women’s sports, defunding the police, and socialist control.”\n\n“Hakeem is steering the Democrat Party straight into oncoming traffic, and acting like it’s a parade,” Marinella added.\n\nHouse Republican Conference chairwoman Lisa McClain echoed a similar sentiment Wednesday while slamming Democrats’ fear-based messaging regarding Medicaid.\n\n“They have to fearmonger because they have no plan, no vision and no leader,” House Republican Conference chairwoman Lisa McClain told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Wednesday. “All they have is lies.”\n\nVice President Kamala Harris came under similar criticism during her 2024 presidential campaign for releasing few details about how she would govern if elected to the presidency.\n\nA spokesperson for Jeffries did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

During an appearance on journalist Dan Abrams’ podcast, Carville doubled down on his prediction when Abrams suggested that he got it wrong. \"I think it’s collapsing now,\" Carville told Abrams, who found it amusing. \"30 days – 180 days, okay. It is collapsing right in front of you.\" TRUMP PENS LETTER TO GRIEVING MOTHER OF SLAIN CONGRESSIONAL INTERN: 'HELD IN MY HEART' Abrams brought up the subject by playing a clip of Carville on his show in February, where he declared that the Trump administration was \"collapsing\" and would be falling apart within 30 days. Abrams asked the strategist Thursday if he still stood by the prediction. Carville replied, saying he was \"a pretty smart guy in February.\" He defended the months-old prediction, stating, \"You look at what’s happening, and you look at the current stuff that’s coming in – the public has revulsions against this.\" FOX NEWS CHANNEL DOMINATES ALL OF TELEVISION IN JULY, CNN HITS ROCK BOTTOM AMONG KEY DEMO He pointed to Democratic candidates leading in upcoming elections, like the governor’s race in Virginia, saying that proves Trump’s demise is underway. \"Do you know how much we’re going to win by in Virginia?\" he asked. \"Do you have any idea?\" \"No, I don’t,\" Abrams responded. \"It’s gonna be a lot,\" Carville declared. \"It’s not going to be close.\" A recent Virginia Commonwealth Poll from July has Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears at 37% and Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger at 49%. Still, Abrams wasn’t convinced. \"But you said that you thought that this administration was in the midst of a collapse.\" \"I think it is. Yes, I do,\" Carville shot back. \"And you think you were right?\" Abrams asked. Carville didn’t back down, stating, \"Yes. I think there are — they’re somewhere about 37% or 40% approval. Their economic numbers are terrible, are just terrible. And I think we’re running away with every election we’ve had. We’re going to run away with Virginia. We’re going to win New Jersey. We’re starting to recruit every candidate that we want.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Abrams continued pushing, mentioning polling showing that Trump isn’t exactly in the midst of collapsing. \"I pulled up the recent approval polling from The New York Times and Real Clear Politics, and the aggregation puts Trump’s approval between 44 and 45.8, with 53 and 51.4 disapproval, as of August the 6th. That’s not a collapse. That’s basically a little bit above where he was.\" Carville dismissed the numbers, saying the polling for upcoming elections \"in no way reflect that.\" \"I don’t want to get into saying this poll, that poll, this aggregate poll; but I look at like the UMass Amherst poll, I look at Gallup, I look at people like that. I see something completely different. I’m very, very, very confident that this administration is going to be widely rejected in the elections coming up; and they’re gonna be particularly widely rejected in the elections in 2026,\" he said. One of Carville's more recent predictions didn't go so well. In the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, the political veteran was so convinced that Kamala Harris would win, he wrote a column for the New York Times titled, \"Three Reasons I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Win.\" Carville's column slammed Trump as a \"repeat electoral loser\" and claimed \"This time will be no different,\" while heaping praise on the Democratic nominee.

Ashley Aune cited her state’s presidential vote results in warning of possible Republican-driven redistricting efforts there.\n\n“Fifty-eight percent of Missouri voted for Trump, but they want to send an 87% representation to Congress,” said Aune, a Democrat.\n\nIt’s actually fairly common for a state’s congressional delegation not to align with statewide presidential vote results.\n\nIn 41 of the 44 states with more than one congressional district, the party of the winning presidential candidate had a larger share of the state’s congressional seats than its share of the presidential vote, an Associated Press analysis found. In most cases, it was a much larger share, a gap of at least 10 percentage points.\n\nHere’s a comparison of the congressional delegations and presidential vote results in a sampling of states, including some of those considering a redraw of their congressional boundaries after Texas called its special session.\n\nCalifornia and Illinois\n\nIn remarks to CNBC, Trump pointed to California and Illinois as justifications for redrawing the Texas map in Republicans’ favor.\n\n“You notice they go to Illinois for safety, but that’s all gerrymandered,” he said in reference to the Texas Democrats who relocated to the Chicago area to block, at least temporarily, the Republican redistricting efforts.\n\n“California’s gerrymandered. We should have many more seats in Congress in California,” he said.\n\nHe’s right about Illinois: Democrats have gerrymandered the lines so they hold 14 of the 17 House seats. Not so in California.\n\nDemocrats there do have an outsized majority, holding 43 of the state’s 52 House seats, about 83%. Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, received about 59% of the November vote. But that’s not because of Democratic gerrymandering. A ballot initiative took the process away from state lawmakers and gave it to an independent citizens commission.\n\nCalifornia’s lopsided map is due in part to the way like-minded people cluster: California Democrats tend to live in and near major cities that get more congressional districts because of their population.\n\nRepublican Gov. Ron DeSantis scored a legal victory in July when the state Supreme Court upheld his congressional redistricting plan redrawing a district with a large Black population. That plan resulted in Republicans holding about 71% of the state’s 28 U.S. House seats. Trump carried the state in November with 56% of the vote.\n\nDeSantis later indicated there may be more “defects” in the map that need to be addressed before the next census.\n\nRepublicans held an 18-7 advantage over Democrats in Florida’s House delegation after the 2000 census. Democrats slowly narrowed the gap, reaching 13 seats to Republicans’ 14 after the 2018 election. But Republicans reestablished their advantage after the redistricting that followed the 2020 census, when they reached the 20-8 split they hold today.\n\nDemocrats have long enjoyed an advantage at the New York ballot box in presidential and congressional elections. Harris received nearly 56% of the vote in 2024, while Democrats hold 73% of the state’s 26 House seats.\n\nWith Democratic advantages in both chambers of the state Legislature, New York might have been a ripe target for Democrats looking to offset Republican redistricting gains in Texas and elsewhere. But they would need to amend the state constitution to conduct a new round of redistricting before the next census. That constraint means the earliest Democrats could enact a new map would be for 2028.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina, among the most closely divided states, has been embroiled in its own redistricting drama.\n\nState Republicans implemented new House boundaries in 2023 that turned a 7-7 congressional delegation into one in which Republicans took a 10-4 advantage with the 2024 elections. Several districts are now the subject of a federal lawsuit, with Democrats alleging Republicans illegally diluted Black voting power.\n\nNorth Carolina has been among the most competitive states in the last several presidential elections. While Trump carried the state in November with about 51% of the vote, it has elected Democrats as governor and attorney general and to other statewide offices.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama narrowly edged Republican John McCain with 49.7% of the vote. The congressional delegation at the time mirrored that with an almost even split, with Democrats holding seven seats and Republicans six after the 2010 midterms.\n\nBut following rounds of Republican-controlled redistricting after the 2010 census, Republicans held a 10-3 or 9-4 advantage in the congressional delegation for the rest of that decade.\n\nAfter the 2020 census, a Democratic-majority North Carolina Supreme Court threw out a Republican-drawn plan and permitted elections under a map adopted by trial judges that produced the 7-7 split. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the boundaries to be used in the 2022 elections.\n\nAfter flipping to a Republican majority in 2023, the state Supreme Court ruled partisan gerrymandering wasn’t outlawed by the state constitution, allowing GOP lawmakers to redraw a congressional map in use today that led to their party’s 10-4 majority.\n\nMinnesota is the state where the congressional breakdown most closely matches the 2024 presidential result. Harris received 51% of that vote, compared with Trump’s 47%. Democrats and Republicans split the state’s eight House seats with court-imposed maps.\n\nNevada, where a Democratic Legislature drew the lines, is the only state where the party of the winning presidential candidate is outnumbered by the other party in the state’s congressional delegation. Trump received 51% of the vote in Nevada, but Democrats hold three of the state’s four House districts.\n\nAssociated Press writer Leah Willingham in Boston contributed to this report.","summary":"It's not always because of partisan gerrymandering.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/08/redistricting-representation/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Election_2026-Texas_Redistricting_94024_5bdf60-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 17:52:45","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":349415476,"title":"How closely do congressional delegations reflect how people vote?

Not very","text":"By ROBERT YOON, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Constitution makes it clear: “The People” get to pick those who’ll represent their interests in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBut just how closely do those choices reflect the overall political leanings of the people? The question is at the heart of a power play in Texas, where Republicans are trying to reshape the state’s congressional boundaries to help them maintain control of the House in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nIn many cases, a state’s congressional delegation doesn’t align very closely with what would seem to be the will of the voters, although that’s not always because of partisan gerrymandering.\n\nEvery state decides how to draw its own congressional boundaries. Some, like California, rely on independent redistricting commissions, while most leave it to the state Legislature and the governor to hammer out a plan. It’s states where one party controls all the levers of government where redistricting dramas like the one in Texas often play out as the majority tries to maximize its power.\n\nRegardless of the process, the resulting maps often produce congressional delegations much more lopsided in favor of one party than the state’s partisan demographics might suggest.\n\nA state’s presidential vote result isn’t a precise tool for measuring what its congressional delegation ought to look like, but it can provide a compelling point of comparison. Politicians frequently cite it when decrying partisan redistricting practices they think are unfair.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who’s pushing Texas and other GOP-controlled states to redraw their maps, said this week Republicans were “entitled to five more seats” in Texas based in part on the size of his win there in November. Trump won 56% of the Texas vote, but Republicans already hold 65% of the state’s congressional delegation — which would rise to 79% if the GOP’s new maps are adopted and past voting patterns hold in the next election.\n\nDuring an event with Texas Democratic lawmakers in Boston, Missouri state Rep. Ashley Aune cited her state’s presidential vote results in warning of possible Republican-driven redistricting efforts there.\n\n“Fifty-eight percent of Missouri voted for Trump, but they want to send an 87% representation to Congress,” said Aune, a Democrat.\n\nIt’s actually fairly common for a state’s congressional delegation not to align with statewide presidential vote results.\n\nIn 41 of the 44 states with more than one congressional district, the party of the winning presidential candidate had a larger share of the state’s congressional seats than its share of the presidential vote, an Associated Press analysis found. In most cases, it was a much larger share, a gap of at least 10 percentage points.\n\nHere’s a comparison of the congressional delegations and presidential vote results in a sampling of states, including some of those considering a redraw of their congressional boundaries after Texas called its special session.\n\nCalifornia and Illinois\n\nIn remarks to CNBC, Trump pointed to California and Illinois as justifications for redrawing the Texas map in Republicans’ favor.\n\n“You notice they go to Illinois for safety, but that’s all gerrymandered,” he said in reference to the Texas Democrats who relocated to the Chicago area to block, at least temporarily, the Republican redistricting efforts.\n\n“California’s gerrymandered. We should have many more seats in Congress in California,” he said.\n\nHe’s right about Illinois: Democrats have gerrymandered the lines so they hold 14 of the 17 House seats. Not so in California.\n\nDemocrats there do have an outsized majority, holding 43 of the state’s 52 House seats, about 83%. Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, received about 59% of the November vote. But that’s not because of Democratic gerrymandering. A ballot initiative took the process away from state lawmakers and gave it to an independent citizens commission.\n\nCalifornia’s lopsided map is due in part to the way like-minded people cluster: California Democrats tend to live in and near major cities that get more congressional districts because of their population.\n\nRepublican Gov. Ron DeSantis scored a legal victory in July when the state Supreme Court upheld his congressional redistricting plan redrawing a district with a large Black population. That plan resulted in Republicans holding about 71% of the state’s 28 U.S. House seats. Trump carried the state in November with 56% of the vote.\n\nDeSantis later indicated there may be more “defects” in the map that need to be addressed before the next census.\n\nRepublicans held an 18-7 advantage over Democrats in Florida’s House delegation after the 2000 census. Democrats slowly narrowed the gap, reaching 13 seats to Republicans’ 14 after the 2018 election. But Republicans reestablished their advantage after the redistricting that followed the 2020 census, when they reached the 20-8 split they hold today.\n\nDemocrats have long enjoyed an advantage at the New York ballot box in presidential and congressional elections. Harris received nearly 56% of the vote in 2024, while Democrats hold 73% of the state’s 26 House seats.\n\nWith Democratic advantages in both chambers of the state Legislature, New York might have been a ripe target for Democrats looking to offset Republican redistricting gains in Texas and elsewhere. But they would need to amend the state constitution to conduct a new round of redistricting before the next census. That constraint means the earliest Democrats could enact a new map would be for 2028.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina, among the most closely divided states, has been embroiled in its own redistricting drama.\n\nState Republicans implemented new House boundaries in 2023 that turned a 7-7 congressional delegation into one in which Republicans took a 10-4 advantage with the 2024 elections. Several districts are now the subject of a federal lawsuit, with Democrats alleging Republicans illegally diluted Black voting power.\n\nNorth Carolina has been among the most competitive states in the last several presidential elections. While Trump carried the state in November with about 51% of the vote, it has elected Democrats as governor and attorney general and to other statewide offices.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama narrowly edged Republican John McCain with 49.7% of the vote.

The president charged that Duncan was \"never able to get anything done, all he ever did was complain. We didn’t want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I’m told he became a Democrat. Good riddance Geoff. You don’t even have a chance!!!\" Asked about the criticisms, Duncan told Fox News Digital in an exclusive national interview hours later, \"I think he's making my case for me that the Republican Party no longer wants to love their neighbor.

But I'm proud to not be a Republican, especially with him at the tip of the spear,\" Duncan highlighted. In announcing his decision, Duncan cited several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, including health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and poverty. He wrote that his time in office taught him the best way to \"love my neighbor\" is through public policy. Duncan told Fox News, \"I find it easier to love my neighbor as a Democrat It's not a perfect landing spot, but it gives me a better opportunity each day when I wake up to love my neighbor.\" GEORGIA GOP EXPELS FORMER LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN FROM PARTY, CITING ALLEGED DISLOYALTY Duncan, a former health care executive and minor league baseball player, served in Georgia's legislature for four years before running and winning election as lieutenant governor in 2018. He decided against seeking re-election in 2022. After leaving office, Duncan – who was a vocal GOP critic of Trump's repeated efforts to reverse his razor-thin November 2020 election defeat in battleground Georgia to former President Joe Biden – worked towards what he said was \"healing and rebuilding a Republican Party that is damaged but not destroyed.\" Duncan endorsed Biden in the 2024 presidential race and later supported Vice President Kamala Harris after she replaced Biden at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket. Duncan spoke in a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last August. The Georgia Republican Party expelled him from the GOP earlier this year. \"Neither party is hitting it out of the park. You don't have to look any further than the stats to see that Republicans have their issues. Democrats certainly have their issues,\" Duncan told Fox News. \"I've tried this reform thing before on the Republican side, and Donald Trump has sucked the life and future out of the Republican Party, in my opinion.\" Duncan's old boss, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, is term-limited and cannot seek re-election next year. Duncan confirmed to Fox News that he's considering a 2026 run for governor. \"My family and I are certainly not ready to make that big of a decision right here, right now. But it is something that we're considering for sure. I mean, my phone has continued to ring for months on end, from Democrats, independents and even some folks on the right that want us to consider this,\" Duncan said. Asked about his timetable, Duncan said \"2026 is coming like a freight train. And certainly, if this is a decision that we go forward with, it'll have to be within, within a few months.\" Duncan emphasized that \"if Democrats, especially in Georgia, want to be successful, they're going to have to live in the middle and not the fringes. They're going to have to have a moderate slate of candidates that are able to use common sense to provide their leadership. And I think there's a gravitational pull in that direction.\" Nearly half-a-dozen Democrats in Georgia have already launched gubernatorial campaigns, including former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who later worked in the Biden administration. Pointing to the two leading Republicans running for governor, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and state Attorney General Chris Carr, Duncan said \"I hope we're able to sit back and find a Democratic candidate that can win the governorship and not allow a governor Trump to show up for four years in the state, because that's exactly what's going to happen.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The Republican slate is going to be dominated by whoever Donald Trump endorses, and that person is going to be a sock puppet for Donald Trump,\" Duncan argued. \"And no Georgian wants that. No Georgian wants the inconsistencies of Donald Trump to manage how their kids are educated, how their streets are kept safe and how government interacts with those that need it the most.\" Looking ahead to next year's elections, when Georgia will once again be in the national spotlight, Duncan said \"Georgia is going to continue to be the political center of the universe, as we watch the Senate race shape up. As we watch this governor's race shape up. I do think Georgia has an opportunity to lead the rest of the country, and I hope we take advantage of that.\" Fox News' Landon Mion contributed to this report.","summary":"Former Georgia Republican Lt.

She ultimately lost every swing state in November and garnered about 2.3 million fewer votes than her Republican opponent.What To KnowAn Emerson College poll of California voters released Friday shows Harris at 11 percent, trailing California Governor Gavin Newsom at 23 percent and former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg at 17 percent in a potential 2028 Democratic primary. Harris is, however, ahead of New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is at 9 percent.On the Republican side, 40 percent support Vice President JD Vance, 10 percent support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, and 9 percent support Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.The poll of roughly 1,000 California voters was conducted August 4 to 5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.The results differ from a national Emerson poll in June, when Buttigieg led the Democratic pack with 16 percent followed by Harris at 13 percent, Newsom at 12 percent, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both 7 percent, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 5 percent, and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker at 3 percent. Twenty-three percent were undecided.However, that poll took into account U.S. voters and not just those from California.Camille Mumford, communications director for Emerson College Polling, told Newsweek via email on Friday that directly following the 2024 election, their November poll found Harris front of mind for Democratic voters who named her as their top choice for the nomination in 2028.\"Eight months later, voters appear to be looking for a new face as the nominee, and Harris has fallen into the pack of potential candidates,\" Mumford said. \"Harris performs strongest among Black Democratic primary voters nationally, 30 percent of whom supported her in June; and those in the Midwest and South, 16 percent of whom support Harris, compared to 9 percent of those in both the Northeast and West.\"Harris, who has a history in California as former district attorney, attorney general and U.S. Senator, lacked a strong home base in the 2020 Democratic primary, Mumford noted.In Emerson's September 2019 poll, Biden, Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren led the primary with Harris trailing in fourth place. She then dropped out in December of that year, ahead of the deadline for taking her name off of the California primary ballot.California Governor RaceNow that Harris has said she won't run for California governor, it's allowed other familiar faces in the state to garner more attention.Per the new Emerson poll, California voters find former Democratic Representative Katie Porter leading the primary for California governor with 18 percent, followed by Republican political commentator Steve Hilton at 12 percent, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 7 percent, and former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5 percent. About 38 percent remain undecided.What People Are SayingSpencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, in a statement: \"With Kamala Harris officially out of the race, Katie Porter has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, increasing her support from 12 percent to 18 percent since the April Emerson poll.\"Harris, in a statement released on X on July 30: \"Over the past six months, I have spent time reflecting on this moment in our nation's history and the best way for me to continue fighting for the American people and advancing the values and ideals I hold dear.\"I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their governor.

Maine—which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by seven points—and North Carolina—which voted for Trump by only three points—are viewed as Democrats' top targets. However, no other Harris or single-digit Trump states are up for grabs, so they are looking at races in states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio and Texas as potential opportunities.What to KnowA new Data for Progress poll released on Friday suggested Alaska could be competitive if Peltola jumps into the race. Peltola represented Alaska's at-large Congressional seat from 2022 to 2025 and narrowly lost to GOP Representative Nick Begich III in November.She has not made her plans clear for 2026 but has been floated as a potential candidate in either the Senate or gubernatorial race.The polling memo wrote that Peltola is \"uniquely popular,\" being viewed positively by 52 percent of Alaskans despite the state's conservative bent.If she were to challenge Sullivan in the Senate race, the incumbent would hold only a one-point lead at this point in time, the poll found. Forty-six percent of respondents said they would vote for him, while 45 percent said they would cast their ballots for Peltola. An additional 5 percent said they would not rank either candidate, while 4 percent were still unsure.The survey was taken July 21 to 27 and polled 678 likely voters in Alaska using SMS and web panel respondents. The poll's margin of error associated with the sample size is ±4 percentage points.Notably, Alaska uses a ranked choice voting system. In the primary, the four candidates who receive the most support advance to the general election, regardless of their party. In the general, voters rank their candidates based on preference. Candidates are eliminated one-by-one until one reaches 50 percent support.Peltola, meanwhile, held a lead over Republican candidates in a hypothetical poll of the governor race. On the first round of ranked choice, 54 percent of respondents said they would vote for her.Trump carried Alaska by about 13 percentage points last November.What People Are SayingElisa Rios, a former campaign manager for Peltola, told The Alaska Beacon in July: \"It's really just where she can make the greatest impact for Alaskans. She is going to make that decision on her own time.\"Jason Katz-Brown, of Data for Progress, told The 19th News on Friday: \"The policies that she spent her whole last two years running on, especially on fisheries policy, are really, really popular things in Alaska, and the policies of the Republican governor are extremely unpopular. All that's combined, I think, really backs up the people in the state who really want to see a Peltola governorship.\"What Happens Next?The Cook Political Report classifies the Alaska Senate and gubernatorial race as being \"Solid Republican.\" Sabato's Crystal Ball lists the Senate race as Solid Republican, but the gubernatorial race as Likely Republican.","summary":"A new poll pointed to a competitive race in the traditionally conservative race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mary-peltola-chances-defefating-dan-sullivan-alaska-2110886","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699223/mary-peltola-senate-poll-alaska.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=416db964fc9421af9849b1f3c3632496","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 16:56:01","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":349405494,"title":"CBS TV chief breaks public silence on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' cancellation","text":"The CBS television chief broke his public silence about the decision to cancel \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" echoing company talking points Thursday that the program will be shuttered for purely economic reasons. Paramount Chair of TV Media George Cheeks spoke about canceling Colbert’s show during a press conference following the close of a long-planned merger that put CBS’ parent company under new ownership. Cheeks, one of the few executives from the previous regime to stick around after the Skydance Media merger, oversaw all of CBS when the decision was made to cancel the program. \"We are huge fans of Colbert, we love the show. Unfortunately, the economics made it a challenge for us to keep going,\" Cheeks told reporters in his first public remarks about Colbert since it was revealed the program would end in May 2026 and the \"Late Night\" brand would be retired. CBS CANCELS 'THE LATE SHOW,' STEPHEN COLBERT TO END PROGRAM IN MAY 2026 \"The challenge in late night is that the advertising marketplace is in significant secular decline,\" Cheeks continued. CBS said it was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night\" when announcing the surprising plans last month. \"The Late Show,\" which Colbert took over from David Letterman in 2015, famously leaned into liberal politics in the Trump era and became a major platform for Democratic politicians. Colbert had been outspoken with his criticism of Paramount settling President Donald Trump's lawsuit against the company over CBS' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the run-up to the election. Paramount settled the lawsuit last month, and the FCC approved the long-planned, $8 billion merger with Skydance shortly after.

He told WSB-TV a decision on his political future could come “in the next few weeks or months.”\n\n“I think Georgians want people who can speak truth to power in the middle,” Duncan remarked. Duncan has not indicated which role he might pursue; some expect he could run for governor in 2026, when Kemp’s tenure ends due to term limits.\n\nDuncan held a seat in the Georgia House from 2013 to 2017. Notable candidates already in the race for governor include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who served in the Biden administration, and Republicans Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and state Attorney General Chris Carr.\n\nIn an op-ed published Tuesday in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Duncan wrote that his transition to the Democrat Party began before President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He cited differences with the GOP over health care, Medicaid expansion, gun control measures, immigration policy, and programs for low-income families.\n\n“My journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia,” Duncan explained. “My decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.”\n\nDuncan criticized recent cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as well as mass deportation policies under the Trump administration. He expressed support for securing the border, deporting individuals convicted of felonies, and providing a path to citizenship for other undocumented immigrants.\n\nHis shift comes after the Georgia Republican Party expelled him earlier this year, citing his endorsement of President Joe Biden in the 2024 election, his later endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, and his opposition to certain GOP candidates, including Jones and 2022 Senate nominee Herschel Walker. Duncan also spoke at the Democratic National Convention in support of Harris.\n\nGeorgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon responded to the announcement by telling WSB-TV, “Geoff Duncan has finally said out loud what any person with eyes has known for years: He is a Democrat.”\n\nTrump reacted on Truth Social, calling Duncan a “total loser” and saying, “We didn’t want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I’m told he became a Democrat.

Instead, we get Mayor Pete appearing on a Substack Live with Aaron Parnas, a Gen Z Lib plant, where the politician tried to play both sides of the aisle. \"I think in order to bring people together on this, we also have to take everyone seriously, including parents who have questions,\" Buttigieg told Parnas. \"People who have questions or wonder what this means ... they’re going to have questions about how to make sure that’s fair, and we should take those questions seriously and face those together,\" Pete continued. Dude, you're just making this harder and harder on yourself. You know it's wrong. You know biological males shouldn't be running track against women. You know biological males shouldn't be smoking volleyballs at women. You know a biological male shouldn't be dominating men's and women's darts. \"I see this issue being used to divide. I see it being used to hurt people,\" he said. \"It's especially hurtful for trans people and people with transgender members of their family who witness themselves or people they love being used as a political football,\" Pete added. What about the biological females, Pete? Here's the simple question that Pete, who has a son and daughter, needs to answer: Would you have a problem if your daughter lost a sporting event to a biological male?

Duncan has detailed his decision for this switch in an op-ed for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \n\nDuncan’s decision was not very well accepted by Donald Trump as he took to Truth Social to post about Duncan, saying, “Failed former Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan, of Georgia, is a total loser.”\n\nHis post further added, “Was never able to get anything done, all he ever did was complain,” Trump wrote. “We didn’t want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I’m told he became a Democrat.

He criticized GOP claims that the best path to health insurance is through employment, pointing out that many working families still lack coverage due to job types that do not provide insurance or affordable options. \n\nHe mentioned, “So, the reality is they have a job, just the wrong job.” Duncan also condemned recent cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which he believes harm families and children, saying these policies conflict with his Christian values.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nDuncan’s disillusionment with the GOP started with Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, a move Duncan openly criticized. He described the Republican Party as being “decimated and destroyed” under Trump’s influence, likening the party to a cult. \n\nIn an interview and public statements, Duncan said, “Donald Trump has destroyed it and created a cult-type atmosphere around it.” He expressed doubt that the GOP could recover its previous identity in the near future, emphasizing the moral and political costs of what he sees as the party’s direction. \n\nThe Georgia Republican Party expelled Duncan earlier this year, citing his endorsement of Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, as well as accusing him of undermining Republican officials, including current Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones. \n\nMy journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia.\nMy decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.https://t.co/1SPSRzUlYo\n— Geoff Duncan (@GeoffDuncanGA) August 5, 2025\n\nDuncan’s public support for Harris, including speaking at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, further cemented his break with the GOP. He stood as a vocal critic not only of Trump but also of the Republican Party’s embrace of conspiracy theories, handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and rejection of foundational governance principles. \n\nRegarding immigration, Duncan criticized the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation policies as lacking compassion and effectiveness. He called these actions “a lesson on how not to love your neighbor,” arguing that immigration policy should balance border security and felony deportation with pathways to citizenship for law-abiding migrants. \n\nFormer GA Republican Lt.

Gov. Eleni Kounalakis drops out of governor's race, pivots to run for treasurer","text":"The field of candidates for California governor expanded rapidly this year as a growing number of politicians entered the race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, but now it's starting to shrink. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a major Democratic donor and the first well-known candidate to formally launch a campaign for governor in April 2023, said Friday morning that she is dropping out of the governor's race and will instead run for state treasurer. Her announcement is the second big development in the governor's race in the last two weeks. Last Wednesday, former Vice President Kamala Harris said she would not run, creating a vacuum other Democrats in the race are rushing to fill. Kounalakis said in a statement that as treasurer, she can \"make the greatest impact by focusing on California's financial future.\" The state treasurer manages California's assets and serves on powerful boards that oversee the state employee pension systems and award financing for affordable housing and infrastructure projects. That role, Kounalakis said, would allow her to focus on \"fiscal responsibility, economic opportunity and strategic investment in our state's priorities — from affordable housing and clean energy to infrastructure and education.\" \"This work is critical and I am prepared for the challenge,\" Kounalakis said. Kounalakis is the former U.S. Ambassador to Hungary and the daughter of a wealthy real estate developer from Sacramento. In 2016, Kounalakis was a California co-chair of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, helping raise money and advising on foreign policy. Her family has deep ties to the well-heeled world of Bay Area political donors and power brokers, including U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) who gave Kounalakis a nod on TV last week after Harris decided not to run for governor. Her exit from the governor's race creates an opening for other candidates to build relationships and secure contributions from those donors, some of whom were waiting to give until Harris made a decision. The other Democrats in the race include Toni Atkins, a former Assembly speaker and Senate president pro tem; Xavier Becerra, former California attorney general and Biden Cabinet secretary; Stephen Cloobeck, a philanthropist and businessman; Katie Porter, a former congresswoman from Orange County; Tony Thurmond, the superintendent of public instruction; Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles; and Betty Yee, the former state controller. There are two prominent Republicans running: former Fox News commentator Steve Hilton and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco. Early polling showed Kounalakis in the top half of the gubernatorial field, but most voters also said they haven't made a decision yet and don't know the candidates. Kounalakis had raised millions of dollars in her race for governor, most of which her campaign said she will be able to transfer to her race for treasurer. She will face several other longtime California politicians in that race, including state Sen. Anna Caballero (D-Salinas); the former mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf; and Tony Vazquez, a member of the state Board of Equalization. Kounalakis was first elected lieutenant governor in 2018 and was reelected in 2022. The office is a largely ceremonial post that has been a launchpad for the governor's mansion in the past: Both Newsom and former Gov. Gray Davis previously served as lieutenant governor.","summary":"Her exit from the governor's race creates an opening for other candidates to build relationships and secure contributions from well-heeled Bay Area donors.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-08-08/lt-gov-eleni-kounalakis-drops-out-of-governors-race-pivots-to-run-for-treasurer","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d8df11/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2F00%2Fc0af144c4b1dbcbf4c701aa65f19%2F1508550-pol-me-cadem-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 14:38:13","author":"Laura J.

Yes. Almost inadvertently, I’d say. ABC News has the same problem so many leading cultural institutions do in America: A lack of viewpoint diversity… It is no secret. There are hardly any people who supported Donald Trump at ABC News — or the other corporate/legacy/mainstream news networks. And this is bound to impact coverage, not so much out of malevolent bias (that’s the cartoon version peddled by Trump, Brendan Carr, and online MAGA), but more out of what is a kind of deafness. The old news divisions don’t hear many of the voices of the country, because those voices aren’t in the newsroom. Yes, news teams go out with a microphone and a camera and accost people at Trump rallies; but to me that often comes off as weirdly anthropological and inaccurate, kind of like trying to understand nature by visiting a zoo. You don’t really see a tiger at the zoo, just a version of a tiger.\n\nWhadda load of crap.\n\nHe says the bias isn’t “malevolence,” even though he worked at ABC News for nearly 30 years and the hiring practices never changed. Choosing to hire only leftists is, yes, a choice. Over Moran’s four decades, a deliberate choice was made by the network to not hire those who disagree with Democrats or those with enough empathy and experience outside the bubble to recognize Republicans as fellow human beings. We’re seen as so weird, so bizarre, so different, and such others at ABC News that Moran admits we’re treated like zoo animals.\n\nOf course that’s deliberate. What else could it be? I can understand a few years of insularity before someone says, ‘Wait a minute, we’re sitting here discussing abortion/gun control/taxes/immigration/global warming, and no one disagrees. This is wrong. We’re too bubbled. We need outside voices.’ We’re all human. We can all get too comfortable. I get that. But 30 years?!?!? No, that’s not only deliberate, it is a deliberate abuse of the publicly-owned airwaves.\n\nABC should lose its broadcast license.\n\nAll I can say to the regime media, Moran, and Kessler, is keep it up… Don’t ever change. These mercenary admissions-after-it-matters, the blatant hate hurled at Trump and his supporters under the guise of news, the arrogant and trolling refusal to admit bias… It’s killing y’all, and it’s killing a Democrat Party that has no clue how to operate in an environment where 1) nobody trusts their media allies, and 2) New Media and social media can now get the truth out.\n\nLet’s just hope Kessler is 100 percent accurate about — tee hee — this:\n\nBut now, working at The Post feels like being on the Titanic after it struck an iceberg — drifting aimlessly as it sank, with not enough lifeboats for everyone. The Carpathia (i.e., Bezos) appears too far away and too distracted to help. And the captain is shouting commands that the solution is a different ship.\n\nBurn, baby, burn…\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

Mad Vlad named the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a potential location for the summit with the Orange Manbaby. The Russian dictator said: \"We have many friends who are willing to help us organise such events. One of our friends is the president of the United Arab Emirates.\" The proposed peace talks will be the first meeting between US and Russian leaders since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva back in June 2021. The Kremlin said earlier today that the talks are set for the \"coming days\". After JD Dunce's official business has concluded at Chevening House, he will head for the Cotswold for some time off with his family. However, the VP was warned he could drive residents in a tiny Cotswolds town round the bend by clogging up the streets with his security. Trump's deputy has reportedly rented a country cottage in Charlbury for a break with his wife and three children. A local business owner said: “It’s the talk of the town. They’ve locked our local website forum so people can’t say any more about it. “I’m just worried about the parking, all those secret service cars! “Good luck to him - getting round these roads is no joke. They’ll have some fun with these lanes, getting around in a big car.” Charlbury has hit the headlines in recent weeks after a string of celebrities were spotted visiting the desirable village. It comes after Kamala Harris was seen having lunch in the local Bull pub last week during Steve Jobs’ daughter Eve’s society wedding.

However, even as an official peace agreement is not expected to be signed, the meeting is still viewed as a major win for not only regional stability, but for Trump as well. \"I believe they've had a significant position in this whole process,\" Matias Perttula, director of Save Armenia, told Fox News Digital. \"We just returned from Armenia over the last week [where] we had several government meetings, including with the national security advisor, the president of Armenia and a couple other ministries, and from what we can tell the engagement from the Trump administration has been a lot more robust than the Biden administration.\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan are each expected to meet with Trump prior to signing a pledge for peace between the two nations, which have been embroiled in, at times, brutal conflict since the late 1980s. The conflict largely centered around the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a mountainous area in Azerbaijan with a majority-Armenian population, but which declared independence in 1991. While Armenia, along with the international community, never formally recognized the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as an independent state, it became its chief financial and military backer. The territory assumed a de facto role in Armenia until Azerbaijani forces overwhelmed the republic in a swift campaign in September 2023, prompting mass evacuations of ethnic Armenians before it was then dissolved on Jan. 1, 2024. This region is expected to remain a major issue in the ongoing negotiations. ARMENIA'S PRIME MINISTER URGES SWIFT BORDER AGREEMENT TO AVOID CONFLICT WITH AZERBAIJAN Though both nations announced in March that they had reached a consensus on finalizing a peace deal, several factors surrounding the mountainous area have prevented a finalized agreement from being reached, as witnessed in the July meeting between the leaders when they met in the UAE but failed to find a resolution. Chief among Azerbaijan’s demands is that Armenia should amend its constitution and remove all references to the Nagorno-Karabakh territory. Though this demand is not a simple request that just Pashinyan can agree to as it would require a national referendum. \"There's no legal consequence whatsoever,\" Perttula told Fox News Digital, explaining that both Armenian and American legal experts have refuted the demand as inconsequential, and therefore should not serve as a precursor to reaching a formalized peace deal. \"There needs to be a real consideration for the right of return for the 120,000 Armenian Christians that were forced off the lands of Nagorno-Karabakh that has been their ancestral homeland for centuries,\" Perttula added. \"I think that needs to be a key point in terms of formalizing this whole peace agreement.\" \"We want peace at the end of the day,\" he added. \"We want peace and normalization.\" NETANYAHU SURPRISES TRUMP WITH FORMAL NOBEL PEACE PRIZE NOMINATION DURING HISTORIC WHITE HOUSE MEETING Trump, while on the campaign trail, highlighted the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and accused then-Vice President Kamala Harris of doing \"NOTHING as 120,000 Armenian Christians were horrifically persecuted and forcibly displaced.\" Trump said he would \"work to stop the violence and ethnic cleansing, and we will restore PEACE between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\" Trump has repeatedly championed his push to end conflict across the globe and in June celebrated a peace agreement that the U.S. helped broker between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda with an Oval Office signing. \"In a few short months, we’ve now achieved peace between India and Pakistan, India and Iran, and the DRC and Rwanda, and a couple of others, also,\" Trump said during the event.

In a February meeting with Netanyahu, Trump said, \"They will never give me a Nobel Peace Prize. It’s too bad. I deserve it, but they will never give it to me.\" The White House last week lobbied for the president to win the award come December when White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"It’s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\"","summary":"Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev meet with President Donald Trump to address decadeslong conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh territory.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-host-armenia-azerbaijan-leaders-ahead-peace-pledge-white-house-eyes-nobel-peace-prize","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/armenia-and-azerbaijan-conflict-comes-to-an-end.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376685391112","publish_date":"2025-08-08 13:30:38","author":"Caitlin McFall","authors":["Caitlin McFall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.144},{"id":349342092,"title":"Danica Patrick sets pulses racing as she shows off stunning physique while on vacation in Ibiza","text":"Danica Patrick sets pulses racing as she shows off stunning physique while on vacation in Ibiza\n\nMORE: DailyMail+ Power List ranks NFL coaches from $30m flop to sideline saint \n\nBy JAMES COHEN, SPORTS REPORTER\n\nPublished: 14:11 BST, 8 August 2025 | Updated: 14:30 BST, 8 August 2025\n\nMotorsports legend Danica Patrick has set pulses racing after pulling on a blue bikini and showing off her recent travels in an Instagram post. \n\nThe retired race car driver has spent the last month on a European vacation and shared her latest update with followers on Thursday afternoon. \n\nPatrick, 43, posted a series of photos from her trip to the Spanish island of Ibiza as she kicked back and relaxed in a swimsuit on the beach.\n\nThe former IndyCar and NASCAR driver struck a pose by a wooden cabin before later enjoying paella at a beach club as she showed off her incredible physique.\n\nThe caption to Patrick's post read: 'Beautiful Ibiza'.

Like I am here in this picture… and where I wish I still was!'\n\nAs well as being a racing legend, Danica is best known these days for being a vocal supporter of Donald Trump and the Republicans. \n\nThe 43-year-old was on the campaign trail for Trump throughout late 2023 and all of 2024, attempting to garner support that led to his election victory over Kamala Harris.\n\nIn June, she recounted her conversation with the president on Instagram after joining him aboard Air Force One, with the former IndyCar driver revealing his one-word answer to a question she had.\n\n'I asked @realdonaldtrump on the flight home from the last rally in Michigan... what is the most important quality of being in office was, and he said..... courage,' she said on Instagram.\n\nPatrick's support of Trump has been fiercely loyal, including when she backed his decision to bomb Iran after years of condemning America's involvement in Middle Eastern wars.\n\nSome inside the MAGA camp did not approve, but Patrick stood by Trump in a series of patriotic online posts following the controversial attack.\n\nPatrick later shared another series of photos from vacation with the caption: 'Wild Ibiza'\n\nThe 43-year-old threw on a sleek red dress as she visited the biggest nightclub in the world\n\n'Thank you to all that keep America safe and strong,' she captioned one of the posts, which showed her driving a speed boat with the US flag flapping away in the background.\n\nShe also recently weighed in on Sydney Sweeney's controversial American Eagle ad - and admitted she's not sure why people are upset with the brand's latest campaign. \n\n'Can anyone tell me what’s wrong with the new AE ads?!

That’s precisely what Donald Trump endured in the Season 27 premiere of the long-running animated series. Sources say the president was “seething.” But will Trump strike back? Can he? And more importantly, should he?\n\nWhile Trump has aimed late-night critics like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon (recently declaring in a press briefing that they “have no talent” and hinting they could be next to disappear), South Park remains untouched for now.\n\n“I’m sure Trump could move some mountains to damage the South Park name and potentially get it cancelled,” said Adrienne Uthe, founder and strategic advisor at Kronus Communications, in an interview with the Irish Star.\n\nBut Uthe believes he probably won’t. “It wouldn’t be a good look. (…) You’ve got to be able to laugh at yourself, and needing to silence voices only shows weakness in this instance. South Park is consistent in that they make fun of everyone — let them cook.”\n\nDonald Trump’s latest meltdown reportedly stemmed from South Park’s premiere episode titled “Sermon on the Mount.” \n\nThe savage half-hour lampooned the president with a particularly surreal sequence: a n-ked Trump stumbling through a forest with Satan as his reluctant guide. If that wasn’t enough, the episode included an AI-generated PSA that comically praised Donald Trump while also mocking his physique and legal quagmire.\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone, who’ve helmed the irreverent show since 1997, didn’t back down when asked about the blowback during San Diego Comic-Con. Their response? A deadpan “We’re terribly sorry,” which was dripping with sarcasm and perfectly on-brand for two men who’ve never met a sacred cow they didn’t grill.\n\nWhite House insiders weren’t amused.\n\nOne source told Deadline that the president was furious and called the episode “childish” and “vulgar,” while also noting that the White House had even received a warning about the episode’s contents. It was possibly due to South Park’s ties to Paramount+, which is involved in the pending $8 billion Skydance-Paramount merger awaiting FCC approval.\n\nParamount has officially agreed to merge with Skydance. pic.twitter.com/8OavnXeLTz\n— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) July 8, 2024\n\nAs Trump continues to hint that more shows could be in danger (especially ones that mock him), fans are watching closely.\n\nThe recent surprise cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert sparked rumors that politics, not just ratings, were at play.\n\nCBS exec George Cheeks tried to douse the flames, saying: “The challenge in late night is that the advertising marketplace is in significant secular decline.” But that didn’t fly with fans on social media.\n\nOne user on X (formerly Twitter) posted: “He mentions Colbert has better ratings than Kimmel or Fallon… and yet Colbert gets canned because of ‘his ratings’ and not the fact that he called the network out for paying a bribe to Trump in a baseless lawsuit.”\n\nThe lawsuit they’re referring to? In July, CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, agreed to settle a $16 million lawsuit with Trump over a 60 Minutes segment featuring ex-US Vice President Kamala Harris. The timing (plus the Colbert cancellation) is suspicious. \n\n🚨BREAKING: After CBS’s 60 Minutes posted the unedited version of its October interview with Kamala Harris online, President Trump has doubled the value of his lawsuit against them from $10 billion to $20 billion.\nCBS is cooked! 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/rRI8qruI1N\n— I Meme Therefore I Am 🇺🇸 (@ImMeme0) February 9, 2025\n\nStill, South Park as a cultural institution is ruthlessly bipartisan in its mockery.\n\nWhether you’re Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, or Donald Trump, South Park is an equal-opportunity offender. And despite his paper-thin skin, Trump might know that silencing South Park would only bolster its legend.\n\nAs one user on X summed up: “I’ve never heard a President so intent on trashing people in entertainment!

If you have not already subscribed for free, please consider doing so here. \n\nA group of teenage jackals attempted to carjack DOGE staffer Edward Coristine, known in this neck of the woods as “Big Balls,” on Sunday in the nation’s capital. \n\nIt was a savage attack and left Coristine bloodied. \n\nBut that night Coristine earned his nickname, a moniker that comes with big responsibility. \n\n Ex-DOGE staffer nicknamed ‘Big Balls’ left bloodied after savage DC carjacking attempt by 10 juveniles https://t.co/8eeBskyQV3 pic.twitter.com/lptDo5hHVI — New York Post (@nypost) August 6, 2025\n\nAccording to the police report, Coristine was with a female companion. As the carjackers approached them, Coristine thought on his feet and pushed the lady into the car before taking the whole brunt of the beating by himself. \n\nCoristine was not only brave; he was incredibly smart. Had the girl been left out in the open, who knows what could have happened? And whatever would have happened would not have been good. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nI have two takeaways from this story. \n\nWe should all aspire to act like Big Balls if, Heaven forbid, we find ourselves in such a hellish scenario. Unless he was Liam Neeson from Taken, he was never going to fight off all of his attackers, even if they were teenagers. But he did what was most necessary: protect the damsel at all costs. \n\nThe second takeaway is more political. \n\n A few days ago, a gang of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in DC. A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her. It is time to federalize DC. pic.twitter.com/RPHKj7J3ti — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 5, 2025\n\nLeft-wingers hate Big Balls and people like him. \n\nCoristine broke into government service at DOGE without having to suffer through the left’s credentialing machine. He didn’t have a bogus degree or some fluffy think tank internship on his resume; he won on merit. The liberal press also mocked him for his lack of experience. However, if I were looking to hire someone to pull the levers of government, I’d sooner take a teen who thinks fast in a life-threatening situation than any middling wannabe bureaucrat. \n\nThey also loathe Coristine because he is a normal white man who proved their entire narrative wrong. The far-left wants everyone to believe white men are villains responsible for every problem in the world. But, as it turns out, Coristine is a selfless hero, not just for his contributions to DOGE and the American taxpayer.\n\nAnd let’s be real. How would a liberal react in Coristine’s situation? Your average D.C. resident probably would have tried to reason with the carjackers and mention that they voted for Kamala Harris. \n\nWe all know how that would’ve ended…","summary":"Justice for Big Balls!","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/08/08/mr-right-doge-big-balls-carjacking-dc-democrats/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2217854935-scaled-e1754486001277.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 13:13:06","author":"Mr. Right","authors":["Mr. Right"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.445}]}
