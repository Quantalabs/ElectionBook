Minnesota's firebrand Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has questions of her own to answer after Somali daycare scandal, writes TOM LEONARD","text":"With her motto – ‘I am America’s hope and the president’s nightmare’ – framed on the wall of her office, firebrand Left-wing Congresswoman Ilhan Omar displays plenty of ambition, though perhaps not modesty.\n\nAnd with her stirring tale of fleeing war-torn Somalia to build a new life in the American Midwest, she and her supporters have prided themselves on her message of hope providing a compelling counterpoint to Trump.\n\nOmar has said she came to the US when she was 12, knowing only two English phrases: ‘hello’ and ‘shut up’. Since then, she’s found plenty more to say.\n\nTeeth-grindingly self-righteous and uber-woke, she is one of the four members of the so-called ‘Squad’ – along with New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – a cabal of racially diverse, ultra-Left-wing Democrat Congresswomen who inspire devotion from their Gen Z followers and irritation or plain contempt from just about everybody else.\n\nIncluding moderates in their party who believe that, with Trump having won a landslide in large part due to his rejection of Biden-era wokery, the Squad’s endless sniping about America and obsession with ‘progressive’ policies is electoral suicide.\n\nRepublicans seem to regard Omar in particular as the most toxic of the Squad and have pounced on any controversy – including long-standing allegations that she married her brother so he could come to the US, an unsubstantiated claim she has rejected as ‘absolutely false and ridiculous’.\n\nCritics also deride her as a shameless hypocrite, spouting Marxist politics while wearing expensive Jimmy Choo and Prada sunglasses. And who claims to be a devout Muslim but who – according to his ex-wife – conducted an affair with third husband Tim Mynett (her former campaign adviser) while he was still married.\n\nNow Trump has Omar, a 43-year-old mother of three, in his sights as never before amid an unfolding series of dizzying fraud scandals – amounting to more than $1 billion in stolen state funds – which have captivated America and which were largely perpetrated by Minnesota’s Somali community, whom Omar represents and with whom she closely identifies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump exploded on social media: ‘Much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90 per cent, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia.’ He went on: ‘“Congresswoman” Omar, an ungrateful loser who only complains and never contributes, is one of the many scammers.’\n\nOmar has publicly condemned the various frauds – which include fake claims for feeding children during the pandemic, assisting schoolchildren to cope with autism and housing homeless people. And, although she did know some of those who’ve been prosecuted, there’s no evidence she was directly involved in any of the schemes.\n\nGiven this, Trump appears to be referring to a more recent controversy that, for Omar, is rather closer to home.\n\nThe politician who has previously claimed that she barely has any money now appears to be wealthy, and possibly very wealthy indeed. She has been accused of failing to follow congressional procedures covering the disclosure of her assets and potentially wildly under-representing her husband’s investments.\n\nHer most recent financial disclosure forms to the federal government suggest she and husband Tim Mynett are worth at least $6 million (£4.5 million)and as much as $30 million (£22 million). A mere two years ago, the couple said they had no more than $158,000 (£117,000).\n\nOmar, who is paid a congressional salary of $174,000 (£129,000), has accused the US media of misrepresenting her wealth. However, Washington insiders insist she’s to blame for being intentionally opaque about her finances.\n\nOmar’s most recent compulsory disclosure shows that Mynett has a stake in a venture capital firm valued at between $5 million and $25 million. Her 45-year-old husband, a political consultant-turned-venture capitalist, is also part-owner of a California winery worth up to $5 million.\n\nThat does not necessarily mean the couple are worth $30 million, which she has flatly denied. Her office has stressed that the sums on the disclosure form reflect the full value of the businesses rather than her husband’s personal stake.\n\nShe’s angrily insisted that Mynett is one of ‘several’ partners in the two firms. However, according to California records, Mynett is just one of two partners in the winery – though others could conceivably have joined since then.\n\nCritics say the Congresswoman – while not accused of wrongdoing – has ensured the waters remain muddied by failing to disclose simply and clearly her husband’s stake.\n\nMeanwhile, Mynett’s venture capital firm, Rose Lake Capital – set up in 2022 with business partner Will Hailer – has (if Omar’s financial statements are correct) enjoyed similarly astronomical growth in the past two years.\n\nShe said it was worth less than $1,000 in 2023. Now it’s valued at between $5 million and $25 million. According to the New York Post, in recent months the firm ‘quietly scrubbed’ the names and biographies of nine of its executives and advisers – including two Obama-era US ambassadors – from its website. ‘By not reporting the value of Mynett’s stakes, Omar is effectively hiding the extent of her wealth from the public,’ says the Washington Examiner newspaper.\n\nA conservative watchdog, the National Legal and Policy Center, said this week it is now scrutinising Omar’s finances.\n\nPaul Kamenar, the organisation’s lawyer, said: ‘There’s a lot of strange things going on. She was basically broke when she came into office and now she’s worth perhaps up to $30 million… she needs to come clean on these assets.’\n\nAnd Mynett’s investments are causing headaches for him and his wife in other ways. The wine business, called eStCru and based in Santa Rosa, California, was accused in 2024 of defrauding investors, one of whom alleged Mynett and his partner had failed to honour a pledge to pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Mynett has denied the allegations, calling it a contractual dispute.)That Mynett is investing in wine is also perhaps surprising given that, according to Omar’s own spokesman, the couple married ‘Islamically and legally’ in 2020.\n\nSince strict Sunni Islam, to which the hijab-wearing Omar adheres, forbids a Muslim woman from marrying a non-believer, some suspect Mynett must have converted. And Muslims, of course, are strictly forbidden from producing, selling or drinking alcohol.\n\nOmar insists she has no involvement in her husband’s business affairs but, given she frequently cites her faith as a guiding star in her political career, some observers have called for her to break her public silence on his wine business.\n\nInterest in any potential financial irregularities in the Omar household has inevitably been sharpened by the epic level of fraud that has recently been exposed within Minnesota’s sprawling Somali community – estimated to number around 80,000 and concentrated in the city of Minneapolis which Omar represents.\n\nThe latest scandal, focusing on empty children’s day care centres handed millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, has helped Trump to push Somali fraudsters near the top of the US news agenda and has led to demands for the resignation of Minnesota governor Tim Walz, the hapless running mate of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nCritics have blamed Minnesota’s ‘bleeding-heart bureaucracy’ – for which Omar is a front-rank cheerleader – and a cynical policy of accusing anyone who questioned the endless, unchecked handouts of racism.\n\nThis week, Minneapolis resident Cain Pence, a disabled whistleblower who helped expose a massive Somali-run fraud scheme in the city, told the Daily Mail: ‘There’s a unique reason why [fraud was so prevalent in] Minnesota. We have more social services. We have a liberal political culture and generous welfare systems... and then a group of people exploited that. At the same time the whole George Floyd thing happened [in 2020] and you literally couldn’t say one word against a Somali. So it all worked together to create a tsunami of fraud.’\n\nWalz and other Democrat leaders of the Midwest state – who pride themselves on the generosity of their benefits system – have come in for intense criticism since journalist Nick Shirley released a YouTube video a few days ago that showed empty or abandoned day care facilities were still receiving enormous sums of public money.\n\nHe filmed himself standing outside one of them, the ‘Quality Learning Center’ in Minneapolis, with a large sign showing its name spelled incorrectly as ‘Learing’. Shirley pointed out that the premises were empty at midday on a weekday during the school year.\n\nHe also filmed two other day care centres that had received millions of dollars despite being seemingly devoid of children (but not Somali ‘staff’, who sent him packing).\n\nIn light of the video, which has garnered tens of millions of views and after which Shirley has received a number of death threats, the US Department of Health and Human Services paused $185 million in aid to Minnesota – home of the world’s largest Somali community outside Africa.\n\nOpponents have long accused Trump of racism over Somali immigrants, not least for his encouragement of supporters to chant, ‘Send them back!’ at rallies.\n\nTrump has now said he doesn’t want any Somali migrants at all in the US, and agents of his Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) department are reportedly planning an operation in Minneapolis targeting the community. But although some 40,000 Minnesota residents were born in Somalia, the majority of ethnic Somalis have US citizenship or permanent residency. (Omar became a US citizen when she was 17.)\n\nEven fellow conservatives have pointed out that the real\n\nissue isn’t immigration but rampant government benefits fraud that is rife across the US (up by 242 per cent since 2020), and particularly in handout-happy Democrat states.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that most Somali-Americans are law-abiding citizens, the sheer scale of the fraud in Minnesota and the inescapable truth that this community was deeply involved in it have made it hard for Democrats to dismiss the kerfuffle as politically expedient race-baiting.\n\nFederal charges have already been filed against 98 people in Minnesota, and at least 60 have been convicted. According to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, 85 of the defendants accused of embezzlement of public funds are ‘of Somali descent’, while Minnesota’s Republican House Speaker, Lisa Demuth, claims what has so far emerged ‘is probably the tip of the iceberg’. Last week, Assistant Attorney Joseph Thompson announced that more than $9 billion in federal funds allocated to childcare programmes in Minnesota may have been stolen.\n\nThe cases stretch back to 2022 – during the Biden administration – when Minneapolis prosecutors charged 47 defendants with stealing at least $250 million from a child nutrition programme set up during Covid. Those charged claimed they had opened centres that were inundated with hungry children. Instead, they were submitting entirely false child rosters.\n\nA small halal grocery claimed to be feeding thousands of children every day. Its Somali-American owner was convicted of pocketing nearly $1 million which he spent on a honeymoon in the Maldives, a $64,000 pick-up truck and $30,000 in jewellery from Dubai.\n\nThe cases expanded to include fraud in Minnesota’s housing and autism-services programmes, again with the accused taking large sums of money for non-existent services. They splashed out on properties in Kenya and top-of-the-range Mercedes and BMWs. A lot of the money went into banks and companies in China, where investigators will find it almost impossible to identify the recipients.\n\nMost shocking of all, the Treasury Department is investigating a report by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, which alleged that millions of dollars in stolen funds from Minnesota were sent to Somalia and ended up with Al-Shabaab, the Somali branch of Al-Qaeda. (Federal investigators told CBS News there’s no evidence for this claim.)\n\nOpponents say Omar is partly to the blame for these benefits scandals as she introduced the 2020 MEALS Act which relaxed oversight of children’s meal schemes during the pandemic.\n\nIf the crisis ends up claiming the career of Minnesota’s most famous Somali migrant, Republicans (and not a few Democrats) will not be too distraught.\n\nAdditional reporting: Dana Kennedy in Minneapolis","summary":"LEONARD: With her motto - 'I am America's hope and the president's nightmare' - framed on the wall of her office, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar displays plenty of ambition, though perhaps not modesty.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15427801/Trumps-socialist-nemesis-fraud-scandal-Minnesotas-Congresswoman-Ilhan-Omar.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/01/23/105165259-0-image-m-42_1767308853678.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 23:40:18","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.01},{"id":390619164,"title":"Ilhan Omar Faces Scrutiny Over Her Stance Against Trump","text":"In her office, a framed motto reads, “I am America’s hope and the president’s nightmare,” encapsulating the bold ambitions of Ilhan Omar, a prominent Left-wing Congresswoman. Known for her assertive presence, Omar doesn’t shy away from making a strong impression.\n\nHer inspirational journey from fleeing war-torn Somalia to establishing a new life in the American Midwest is a narrative that she and her supporters cherish. It stands as a hopeful contrast to the rhetoric associated with former President Trump.\n\nOmar recounts arriving in the U.S. at the age of 12 with only two English phrases in her vocabulary: “hello” and “shut up.” Since then, she has added considerably to that repertoire.\n\nOmar is known for her vocal activism and is a key member of the “Squad,” a group of four racially diverse, progressive Democrat Congresswomen, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York. They have become icons for Gen Z followers, while often drawing criticism or disdain from others.\n\nThis includes moderate Democrats who argue that the Squad’s persistent critiques of America and focus on progressive policies could be detrimental in elections, particularly after Trump’s significant victory attributed to backlash against such ideologies.\n\nAmong Republicans, Omar is often viewed as the most controversial member of the Squad. They have seized upon various controversies, including the persistent but unverified claim that she married her brother to facilitate his immigration to the U.S., a rumor she has consistently denounced as “absolutely false and ridiculous.”\n\nCritics also deride her as a shameless hypocrite, spouting Marxist politics while wearing expensive Jimmy Choo and Prada sunglasses.

He said minority voters’ interest in Trump was “temporary” and that he had underperformed on the economy.\n\n“Trump’s redistricting efforts are facing headwinds and, even in Texas, may not yield all he had hoped,” Brace said.\n\nRedistricting efforts in Texas spawned a retaliatory plan in California aimed at getting five more Democratic seats. Other states have leapt into the fray, with Republicans claiming an overall edge of three potential seats in proposed maps.\n\nCuban-born Jose Arango, chair of the Hudson County Republican Party in New Jersey, said immigration enforcement has gone too far and caused a backlash at the polls.\n\n“There are people in the administration who frankly don’t know what the hell is going on,” Arango said. “If you arrest criminals, God bless you. We don’t want criminals in our streets. But then you deport people who have been here 30 years, 20 years, and have contributed to society, have been good people for the United States. You go into any business in agriculture, the hospitality business, even the guy who cuts the grass — they’re all undocumented. Who’s going to pick our tomatoes?”\n\nAs immigration arrests increase this year, a growing share of those detained have no criminal convictions.\n\nRelated | How Democrats—and Trump—turned 2026 into a potential blue wave\n\nNew Jersey’s 9th Congressional District, which includes urban Paterson, went from a surprising Trump win last year to a lopsided victory this year for Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill. Trump won the district last year by 3 percentage points and Sherrill won by 16 points. The district is majority-minority and 39% immigrant.\n\nThere was a similar turnaround in Miami, a majority-immigrant city that elected a Democratic mayor for the first time in almost 30 years. Parts of immigrant-rich Northern Virginia also shifted in the governor’s race there.\n\nIn the New Jersey district, Billy Prempeh, a Republican whose parents emigrated from Ghana, lost a surprisingly close 2024 race for U.S. House to Democrat Nellie Pou, of Puerto Rican descent, who became the first Latina from New Jersey to serve in Congress.\n\nPrempeh this year launched another campaign for the seat, but withdrew after Sherrill won the governor’s race, telling Stateline that any Republican who runs for that seat “is going to get slaughtered.”\n\nPrempeh doesn’t blame Trump or more aggressive immigration enforcement for the shift. He said his parents and their family waited years to get here legally, and he objects to people being allowed to stay for court dates after they crossed the border with Mexico.\n\n“We aren’t deporting enough people. Not everybody agrees with me on that,” Prempeh said.\n\nParts of Virginia saw similar voting pattern changes. Prince William County, south of Washington, D.C., saw support for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger jump to 67% compared with 57% for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris last year. The county is about 26% immigrant and 27% Hispanic.\n\nRelated | Here's how Virginia Democrats will combat Texas' map-rigging\n\nAsian American and Hispanic voters shifted more Democratic this year in both New Jersey and Virginia, said J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, expanding on a November post on the subject.\n\nHowever, some of those Virginia voters might have sat out the governor’s race, Coleman said.\n\n“I do think there is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year,” Coleman said. “There were many heavily Asian and Hispanic precincts in Northern Virginia that saw this huge percentage swing from Harris to Spanberger, but also saw relatively weak turnout.”\n\nThe pattern is “hard to extrapolate” to Texas or other states with new maps, Coleman said, “but Democrats are probably liking what they saw in this year’s elections.”\n\nHe said one of the redrawn districts in Texas is now likely to go to Democrats: the majority-Hispanic 28th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and South Texas. And the nearby 34th Congressional District is now a tossup instead of leaning Republican, according to new Center for Politics projections.\n\nThe pattern in New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District this year was consistent in Hispanic areas statewide, according to an analysis provided to Stateline by Michael Foley, elections coordinator of State Navigate, a Virginia-based nonprofit that analyzes state election data.\n\nNew Jersey Hispanic precincts “swung heavily” toward Sherrill compared with their 2024 vote for Harris, Foley said in an email.

The actor, who is an outspoken Trump critic, notably urged former President Joe Biden to drop out of the race in an op-ed. \n\n“Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,” Trump wrote. “Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!), who is now fighting it out with the worst governor in the Country, including Tim Waltz [sic], Gavin Newscum, for who is going to lead the Democrats to their future defeat.” \n\n“Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,” Trump continued. “He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nIn a statement responding to Trump’s post, Clooney said: “I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again. We’ll start in November.”\n\nThe pair’s war of words comes after Clooney recently told Variety that he and Trump used to be friendly prior to the latter’s entry into politics. \n\n“I knew him very well,” Clooney told the outlet. “He used to call me a lot, and he tried to help me get into a hospital once to see a back surgeon. I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.”\n\nIn addition, Clooney criticized ABC News and CBS News for settling lawsuits filed by Trump last year for $16 million each. \n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f**k yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” he said. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\nClooney also condemned CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss for “dismantling” the network. Weiss has since responded to Clooney, reportedly inviting him to “learn more” about her work and visit the CBS newsroom.\n\nClooney’s decision move to France follows the “Jay Kelly” star praising the country and the lifestyle it offers his family. In an interview with the French broadcaster RTL earlier this month, he said that he planned to raise his kids on a farmhouse in France that they loved.\n\n“Here, they don’t take photos of kids. There aren’t any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That’s No. 1 for us,” he explained. “We also have a house in the United ​States, but our happiest place is ​on this farm where the kids can ​have fun.”\n\nClooney has previously stated that he grew up on a farm and likes the idea of his twins growing up away from the noise and spotlight of Hollywood.","summary":"The president called the actor's decision to move to France \"good news\" before attacking him for his support of Kamala Harris in the 2024 election\n\n\nThe post George Clooney Claps Back at Trump&#8217;s NYE Rant: &#8216;We Have to Make America Great Again.

Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), announced her intention to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats — or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive — many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned or announced their intent to not run for reelection. With only two exceptions — Republicans in 2018 and 2020 — this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members.\n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI). Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC).\n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on.\n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, (R-NC), mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies.\n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats — nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation — are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates.\n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one.\n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House.\n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.","summary":"By Charlie Hunt, Associate Professor of Political Science, Boise State University. \n\nThe midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run — 43 in the House, plus 10 senators.

Hardly","text":"The fallout from that moment more than three years ago could not have been easier to predict. Democrats experienced an infusion of energy, the kind that comes from suddenly becoming the underdog. But that was not the source of the surprise. Once the dust settled, it became apparent that the Republican Party and the pro-life movement as a whole were not quite ready for a post-Dobbs world. Then a stunning, nagging question began to emerge: Is the GOP still the party of life? \n\nThe post-Dobbs GOP\n\nThe black and white nature of politics naturally leads to the assumption that if one side is for something, then the other side is against it. This template fits well over many issues. But when it comes to abortion, the decades-old equation no longer works very well. And it’s not because the Democratic Party has become sympathetic to the plight of unborn souls. On the contrary, Democrats are as consistently anti-life as they’ve ever been. It is the Republican half of the equation where the fervor has noticeably diminished, and the staunchly held ideals have waned. Once upon a time, support for unborn life served as a guiding principle for the Right. Now, the main criteria is whether such a principle will “harm” Republicans at the polls. \n\nIt is a dispiriting evolution, to say the least. And it has been heavily, perhaps even fully, induced by a GOP dominated by personalities above all else. \n\nA main feature of Donald Trump‘s 2016 campaign for president was the promise that he would appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court. Every candidate in the crowded field understood what was at stake with the vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February 2016. Trump’s pledge to bring an end to Roe, combined with the kind of temperament that welcomes a fight, ignited hope. Republicans would finally come out on top in the decadeslong battle between the pro-life and pro-choice crowds, at least at the Supreme Court. It was the kind of victory that pointed to the GOP’s ability to do what had previously felt impossible: push back against leftist cultural domination. \n\nNot long after Roe and Casey were overturned, the sinking reality of a post-Dobbs world was quickly felt. Anyone who believed a pro-life win at the highest court in the land would magically transform the United States into a pro-life nation was singularly naive. Dobbs would not bring an end to abortion or the debate surrounding it. \n\nWith the issue sent back to the states, laws around the country would span the spectrum from restrictive to permissive, and everything in between. This seemed to catch some off guard. Furthermore, the Democratic Party’s collective loss awakened a long-dormant sense of urgency. For years, abortion proponents had coasted on the existence of Roe. Overnight, that comfort was gone. In its place was a renewed effort to protect abortion and make Republicans pay.\n\nBack to the states\n\nLess than five months after the Dobbs decision, Americans went to the polls to vote in the 2022 midterm elections. Historically, the party in power does rather poorly during midterm elections. But this time, the “red wave” prediction of a Republican sweep did not come true. While the GOP took control of the House, Democrats expanded control in the Senate. Around the country, Democrats flipped governorships and legislatures. The deleterious effect the 2022 midterm elections had on Republican power has colored the pro-life agenda since then. \n\nThe 2022 midterm election autopsy pointed to the Dobbs decision as a major reason for the upsets. But instead of admitting that a post-Dobbs world, while difficult, was still worth it, far too many Republicans in both leadership and at the grassroots level have behaved as if the opposite were true. This is disgraceful. And it’s proof the “party of life” is more concerned with power than unshakeable virtues. \n\nIn early December, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) unveiled a new pro-life group called Love Life Initiative. According to its site, the group’s goal is “thoughtful, far-reaching advertising campaigns that promote the sanctity of life, advance referendums that protect life, and identify and defeat harmful proposals in statehouses across the nation.”\n\nWhat did the Trump administration have to say about this? A source told Axios the following: “Clearly, Senator Hawley and his political team learned nothing from the 2022 elections, when the SCOTUS abortion ruling [overturning Roe v. Wade] resuscitated the Democrats in the midterms.” Is the guiding force no longer what’s morally correct but what’s politically expedient? It’s hard to come to any other conclusion. It’s almost as if Trump and his team are embarrassed and/or annoyed when Republicans do something so “antiquated” as maintain their pro-life creed. \n\nAnd this is the continuing aftermath of one of the biggest pro-life victories of all time? \n\nThis reaction to Hawley is not the only indication the “party of life” has morphed into a shell of its former self. \n\nIn August 2024, during his third run for president, Trump posted on Truth Social: “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights.” This is the kind of language the pro-abortion Left uses when talking about the issue. It’s fair to say Trump wanted to present himself as appealing to women during his run against then-Vice President Kamala Harris. But announcing you’d be great for women and so-called reproductive rights is clearly at odds with the pro-life agenda. Protecting both women and the unborn should be the goal. His post ignored the unborn completely. \n\nIVF Betrayal\n\nAlso during his third campaign, Trump promised to completely cover the cost of IVF for Americans who wished to go that route. But there is nothing pro-life about in vitro fertilization if you look at the human cost required to bring about a successful pregnancy. During the IVF process, multiple embryos are “created” in a laboratory. Some are used and implanted, some are miscarried, and still others are discarded or frozen. If pro-life Americans are horrified by the destruction of human life during abortion, they should also be concerned about the same result when it happens during IVF. \n\nIn February, Trump signed an executive order meant to help reduce costs and remove barriers to IVF. Lila Rose of Live Action and Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life were vocal about their opposition to the order. But influential, longtime groups such as the National Right to Life and SBA’s Pro-Life America either remained silent or weakly reacted to it. This is just one example showing that pro-life organizations are scared to hold Trump accountable, even on the issue that defines their missions. It is allegiance to a temporary politician over a foundational issue. It is pure cowardice. \n\nThe weakness further extends to Trump’s appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to the position of HHS secretary. Kennedy is an abortion-supporting Democrat and has been for years. That hasn’t changed despite assurances to pro-life senators during his nomination hearings. Kennedy continues to refuse a review of the chemical abortion pill mifepristone. Through his organization, Advancing American Freedom, Former Vice President Mike Pence called Kennedy out as a “progressive wolf in pro-life sheep’s clothing” and demanded his removal. \n\nThese examples pile on top of the uncritical support that too many Republicans have for the president. In their minds, there is simply no room for criticism of him or his agenda. This holds true even when his words, actions, and nominations are at odds with long-standing values. Those values, protection of unborn life and support for politicians who refuse to bend on the issue, are no longer in the foreground. They no longer dominate nor direct what was once known as the “party of life.” \n\nWinning well\n\nWhen it comes to abortion, Republicans have to collectively decide whether they want to just win or win well. The former is nothing more than beating your opponent on Election Day. The latter is not only getting more votes but doing so while maintaining and promoting the principles that undergird American conservatism. These are the kind of ideals that are non-negotiable and don’t shift based on what ideological enemies do. I dare say that “winning well” should be the ultimate goal. But for far too many years now, crossing the finish line first is all that has mattered. \n\nCHINA TEACHES TRUMP TWO LESSONS ON TAIWAN\n\nAt present, it’s difficult to imagine a return to a time when pro-life principles stood at the center of the GOP’s identity. The party now appears publicly uncertain about what matters most, and worse, largely untroubled by the fact that it has drifted from what it once defended without hesitation. Holding fast to these values requires an unapologetic approach that ignores the changing tides of political popularity. To care about these issues is to anchor oneself to what is right rather than what is convenient. And that’s a risk an unsettling number of Republicans, voters and leadership alike, no longer seem willing to make.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And, yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS,\" Dokoupil said. \"I report for you.\"\n\n The remarks arrive as CBS News faces continued scrutiny over editorial independence amid a number of significant leadership and strategic changes happening behind-the-scenes with the network and its parent company, the recently formed Paramount Skydance.\n\n Last year, prior to his re-election and prior to Skydance Media's acquisition of Paramount Global, President Donald Trump sued CBS over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Paramount later paid $16 million to settle the lawsuit without an admission of wrongdoing — leading many to speculate the payout for Trump's case was simply an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration and the FCC ahead of the Paramount-Skydance merger.\n\n That skepticism only increased in December, CBS News' new Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss landed in the hot seat by pulling a 60 Minutes story hours before air, claiming the piece — focused on Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvado — needed further reporting.\n\n Against that backdrop, Dokoupil framed his debut as an effort to rebuild trust with viewers of what CBS bills as America’s longest-running broadcast.\n\n “A lot has changed since the first person sat in this chair,” Dokoupil said in his prepared statement. “But for me, the biggest difference is people do not trust us like they used to. And it’s not just us. It’s all of legacy media.”\n\n Dokoupil said those concerns have followed him for more than two decades of reporting across the country, from conversations with neighbors in West Virginia to those in New York City.\n\n “Sometimes people wanna talk to me about our coverage of NAFTA or the Iraq War,” he said. “Other times, it’s all about Hillary Clinton’s emails or Russiagate. Or more recently, COVID lockdowns, Hunter Biden’s laptop or the president’s fitness for office.”\n\n “The point is on too many stories the press has missed the story,” he continued. “Because we’ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American.

They faced a bloodbath defeat in what had been a low-profile Iowa race, serving as a glaring warning for the GOP as they look ahead to 2026. \n\nDemocrats achieved a historic win on Tuesday night, electing Renee Hardman to the Iowa state Senate with 71.5 percent of the vote. This landslide victory resembled a presidential rout more than a downballot race. \n\nHardman’s win not only embarrassed the Republican candidate but also prevented the party from securing a supermajority in the chamber. Such dominance could make opposing voices nearly irrelevant. Additionally, Hardman made history as the first Black woman elected to the Iowa state Senate. \n\nThe magnitude of the win was surprising as Hardman’s 71.5 percent was 27 points higher than Kamala Harris’s performance in Iowa in 2024. This striking turnaround is something Democrats will highlight as evidence that changes are happening in areas Republicans typically view as secure.\n\nIn the context of Trump’s second term, this outcome fits into what Democrats have begun to label the “Trump effect.” This concept suggests that voter fatigue, backlash, or the sheer exhaustion from ongoing conflicts is driving people toward alternatives, even in traditionally GOP regions. \n\nRenee Hardman overperforms Kamala Harris by 27 points in the Iowa State Senate 16 Special Election. pic.twitter.com/fwU7WAjIPP\n— The Political HQ (@ThePoliticalHQ) December 31, 2025\n\nThe Iowa rout did not occur in a vacuum because other recent Democratic victories indicate that dissatisfaction may be spreading beyond the usual battleground states. These include gubernatorial wins by Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, along with several downballot flips and strong performances in places where Republicans usually feel confident. \n\nEarlier this year, Democrats made significant gains in Erie County, Pennsylvania, which had narrowly supported Trump in 2024. They also ousted a long-serving Republican incumbent in Virginia’s 66th state House district. In Georgia, Democrats achieved two statewide wins for public service commissioner, marking their first nonfederal statewide victories since 2006. Even in Mississippi, Democrats ended the Republican supermajority in the state Senate by flipping three seats, removing the GOP’s ability to override the governor’s veto and easily make constitutional changes. \n\nWhat makes the Iowa result particularly painful for Republicans is its symbolism. A late-year election is expected to be quiet, a minor event that party operatives don’t dwell on, not a headline-grabbing defeat. Yet, this election revealed a significant shift in political sentiment, showing a vivid blue response. \n\nWhile national races may feel far removed, a big win in a small local election can signal that voter dissatisfaction is increasingly resonating in local communities, especially as people grapple with issues of affordability and a government struggling to resolve conflicts abroad or lower costs at home. \n\nIt’s another overwhelming loss for the GOP, which struggled with infighting and bad poll numbers in 2025. Serving as the last vote of the year, Republicans are reportedly already preparing for huge losses in the midterms with Trump facing the potential of a lame-duck presidency if the Democrats get a majority in Congress.","summary":"A quiet end-of-year race turns into a brutal warning sign for Republicans as Democrats rack up a historic win.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/gop-candidate-gets-steamrolled-in-iowa-election-bloodbath","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GOP-Candidate-Gets-Steamrolled-by-Renee-Hardman-in-Iowa-Election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 18:30:21","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":390577564,"title":"Big New Year Dreaming: Kamala Harris Wants a Trump-Style Comeback","text":"Kamala Harris has launched a brand-new political action committee called Fight for the People. She presents it as a mission-driven effort to travel, speak out, and elect Democrats. I read the announcement twice. I kept waiting for the part where she acknowledged reality. It never arrived.\n\nThat moment sums her up pefectly. Kamala treats politics like a vision board exercise. She stacks slogans together, sprinkles in a nervous laugh, and acts as if every failure proves she’s secretly destined for greatness later. Voters didn’t gradually drift away. They sprinted.\n\nThis PAC doesn’t read like leadership. It reads like refusal to accept the verdict. Kamala never persuaded, nor was she inspirational. She didn’t connect. So, of course, the next move is to launch something new, slap the word “fight” on top, and hope everyone forgets what already happened. But the stench of great defeat doesn’t disappear just because the logo looks fresh.\n\nAnd speaking of fresh ideas, Kamala has been wandering around on that book tour like it’s supposed to prove she’s still a force in national politics. The book didn’t reset anything. I mean, who writes a book about how you lost a presidential bid and then expects applause and purchases? The book didn’t make people think, you know what, maybe we misjudged her. It landed with a thud and a polite shrug.\n\nBut in classic Kamala fashion, the lesson wasn’t, maybe this isn’t working. The lesson was, let’s level up the delusion. I can’t win a presidential race or sell a narrative people actually want to read. So of course, the next move is to start a PAC. You just need to slap a heroic title on it and pretend it signals destiny instead of denial.

But Trump has never been one to let sleeping dogs lie. \n\nIn May, Trump insisted that Swift is “no longer ‘HOT’” in a post on Truth Social. \n\n“I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,” he wrote. \n\nThe singer has been noticeably silent this year—even in the wake of the Department of Homeland Security using her music in an ICE video. \n\nBruce Springsteen \n\nTrump might be using “Born in the USA” less when he’s walking out on stage now. During his latest tour, Springsteen called Trump “treasonous,” among other things\n\n“In my home—the America I love, the America I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years—is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” he said on stage in May. \n\nBut according to Trump, Springsteen is “Highly Overrated” and “not a talented guy—Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK.”\n\n“This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country,” he added.\n\nQueen Bey and Springsteen actually have something in common: Trump calling for an investigation after they endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024. \n\n“HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN’T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? …AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???” \n\nApparently in Trump’s America, celebrity endorsements are a crime.\n\nGeorge Clooney\n\nTrump already wasn’t a fan of Clooney when the movie star backed former President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the 2024 race. When Clooney later called for Biden to drop out in a New York Times op-ed, Trump called Clooney a “fake movie actor” who “never came close to making a great movie.”\n\nAnd then when Clooney appeared on “60 Minutes” in March, criticizing the Trump administration for its efforts to “make journalists smaller,” Trump jumped on Truth Social yet again.\n\n“Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total ‘puff piece’ on George Clooney, a second rate movie ‘star,’ and failed political pundit,” Trump wrote. “He fought hard for Sleepy Joe’s election and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog.”\n\nClooney responded pretty plainly: “I don’t care.”\n\nTrump blasted Hanks after his scheduled award appearance at U.S. Military Academy West Point was unexpectedly canceled. \n\n“We don’t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!!” Trump wrote via Truth Social. “Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice. Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!”\n\nHanks was set to win the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award, but it was canceled without clear explanation. He has also been inducted as an honorary member into the U.S. Army's Ranger Hall of Fame. \n\nGiven that Hanks has won multiple Emmys, whereas Trump hasn’t even secured one—despite his incessant complaining about it—this one seems personal.","summary":"If there is one thing that President Donald Trump is good at, it’s beefing online—especially with celebrities.

Trump also questioned George Clooney’s political judgement and acting career, turning a celebrity citizenship update into a broader political attack. The episode comes as France tightens immigration rules, highlighting the irony of Hollywood stars navigating bureaucracy.

These Nasty Primary Battles Could Get In The Way","text":"Democrats are seeking to retake control of Congress in November’s midterm elections, but a swath of cutthroat primaries in districts they seek to flip could blunt the party’s momentum.\n\nIn swing seats across the country, establishment Democrats are facing off against candidates hailing from the party’s far-left flank. The growing number of intraparty battles has sparked concerns that nominating left-wing candidates could complicate Democrats’ efforts to flip GOP-held seats in 2026. (RELATED: Michigan Senate Race Could Be GOP’s Best Midterms Offense Play, Poll Shows)\n\nSome Democratic strategists have cited Tennessee Democratic candidate Aftyn Behn’s loss in December as a prime example of the risk of nominating a staunch progressive to run in a Republican-leaning district.\n\nThough Behn kept the special election race within single digits — in a district President Donald Trump had carried by 22 percentage points in 2024 — some Democrats have argued the contest could have been within reach for the party if it had backed a more centrist candidate who more closely matched the views of the district.\n\n“Each time we nominate a far-left candidate in a swing district who declares themselves to be radical and alienates the voters in the middle who deliver majorities, we set back that cause,” Lanae Erickson, senior Vice President for Social Policy, Education & Politics, at liberal think tank Third Way said in a statement following Behn’s loss.\n\n“Might’ve been winnable with the right candidate, but Aftyn ‘I’m a very radical person’ Behn was not it,” Democratic strategist Simon Balezon wrote on X.\n\nNational Republicans are also eager to tie Democrats running in purple districts to New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s brand of democratic socialism. The increasing number of primary contests could also force Democrats to spend considerable resources in the primary while GOP incumbents rake in cash for the general election.\n\n“Democrats are trapped in a civil war of their own making, dragged left by Zohran Mamdani radicals while their swing seats bleed money,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement. “This is what a party in panic looks like.”\n\nHouse Democrats’ campaign arm countered that the number of primaries are a product of the party’s strong performance in the 2025 off-year elections and lead in the generic ballot. Republicans, however, continue to hold a higher favorability rating than Democrats and GOP incumbents have largely maintained an edge in fundraising over their Democratic challengers.\n\n“Every poll and election result this year point to one reality: voters are tired of Republicans’ broken promises and are poised to deliver major wins for Democrats in the midterms,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spokesperson Viet Shelton told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “It’s why we are fielding such a large and incredibly strong class of candidates across the country while Republicans are not.”\n\nContentious Democratic primaries with notable ideological and factional divides are playing out in the following four battleground districts. Given House Republicans’ razor-thin majority, these swing seats are likely to help decide House control during the midterms.\n\nCalifornia’s 22nd District \n\nDemocrats are locked in a fierce contest to unseat moderate Republican California Rep. David Valadao, who has successfully fended off Democratic challenges over consecutive cycles. Valadao’s reelection bid became more difficult after Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander redrew the majority-Hispanic district from one Trump won by six percentage points in 2024 to one the president would have carried by only two points.\n\nCollege professor and school board trustee Randy Villegas, 31, is running for the majority-Hispanic district as a staunch progressive. He has secured independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ endorsement and is affiliated with the left-wing Working Families Party.\n\nVillegas has also tapped political strategist Morris Katz, who helped steer New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s left-wing populist campaign, to cut ads for his congressional run.\n\nCalifornia state legislator Jasmeet Bains, 40, is running on a more moderate platform. She has rolled out a slate of endorsements from establishment California Democrats and EMILYs List, a pro-abortion organization supporting female candidates.\n\nVillegas has flexed his progressive credentials by swearing off corporate PAC money and including Medicare for All in his campaign platform — a universal taxpayer-funded health proposal that has divided Democrats.\n\nValadao entered October with nearly $1.8 million on hand, dwarfing Bains and Villegas who both reported less than $300,000 in the bank. With the retirement of Republican Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse, Valadao is the only remaining House Republican who voted to impeach Trump in 2021 seeking reelection in 2026.\n\nColorado’s 8th District \n\nRepublican Colorado Rep. Gabe Evans, a freshman lawmaker, is facing several Democratic challengers in a purple district that narrowly voted for Trump.\n\nColorado progressive Manny Rutinel, 30, is vying for the Democratic nomination against fellow state legislator Shannon Bird, 56, who is running on a more moderate platform.\n\nRutinel has pledged to not accept corporate PAC donations and has won the support of the left-leaning Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ campaign arm.\n\nBird is backed by EMILYs List and WelcomePAC, a center-left organization working to elect Democratic candidates in Trump-won districts. She announced her resignation from the state legislature in early December to focus on her congressional run.\n\nEvans leads the field in fundraising and ended 2025’s third fundraising quarter with nearly $2 million in the bank. Rutinel has maintained an edge over Bird in fundraising. He ended September with $1 million on hand. (RELATED: Seven Primaries That Could Tear Democrats Apart In 2026)\n\nPennsylvania’s 7th District \n\nFive Democratic candidates are vying in a crowded primary to defeat Republican Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in 2026. The freshman lawmaker representing a bellwether district in the Lehigh Valley is one of Democrats’ top targets in the midterms. The swing district backed Trump in 2024 after voting for former President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nMackenzie, 43, defeated then-incumbent Democratic Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild by 1 point in 2024. Wild has endorsed Carol Obando-Derstine, a one-time staffer to former Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, to challenge Mackenzie.\n\nPennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association president Bob Brooks leads the field in endorsements drawing support from progressives, such as Sanders and Democratic California Rep. Ro Khanna. Establishment Democrats, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, are also backing the union leader’s campaign.\n\nNorthampton County executive Lamont McClure and former federal prosecutor and Marine reservist Ryan Crosswell are also vying for the Democratic nomination.\n\nMackenzie maintains a significant fundraising edge over the pack of Democratic candidates.\n\nThe incumbent reported more than $1.4 million in the bank at the end of September. Crosswell closed the year’s 3rd fundraising quarter with more than $430,000 on hand, followed by McClure and Brooks, who both reported less than $300,000.\n\nArizona’s 1st District \n\nDemocrats are also divided over the best candidate to succeed retiring Republican Arizona Rep. David Schweikert.\n\nThe battleground seat vacated by Schweikert — who is running for governor — spans parts of wealthy North Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley that Trump carried by three points in 2024.\n\nFormer Democratic state legislator Amish Shah, who narrowly lost to Schweikert as the district’s 2024 Democratic nominee, is mounting a comeback bid for the swing seat. The ex-lawmaker has the support of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus’ campaign arm, which is affiliated with House Democrats.\n\nFormer TV anchor Marlene Galán-Woods is backed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ campaign arm and EMILYs List.\n\nGalán-Woods came up short against Amish in the 2024 Democratic primary, placing third, and has argued the party should nominate a new face in 2026. She is the widow of late Republican Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods and was a registered Republican until 2018.\n\nTrump endorsed Arizona Republican Party chairwoman Gina Swoboda to succeed Schweikert in October, though the president’s support has failed to stop other candidates from entering the race. Turning Point Action chief operating officer Tyler Bowyer excoriated Swoboda’s leadership in a post on X in October.\n\nFormer sports reporter, analyst and National Football League (NFL) kicker Jay Feely announced on Dec. 19 that he would run against Swoboda in the district’s Republican primary after previously running in the neighboring safely Republican 5th district. Feely switched seats a month and a half after Trump endorsed another GOP candidate for the 5th district but added that he likes Feely “very much” and suggested the former NFL player should run for another district or office.\n\nFeely played in the NFL for 14 seasons including four with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nIn another hotly-contested GOP-held seat, moderate and progressive factions of the Democratic Party have largely united around three-time Democratic candidate Rebecca Cooke, who is expected to face Republican Wisconsin Rep. Derrick Van Orden in the general election.\n\nCooke narrowly lost to Van Orden by roughly 12,000 votes in 2024. She notably outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris by roughly three points, according to analysis by The Downballot.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Not nearly enough. We have a plan to take them on | Chris Powell","text":"The next general election will be no ordinary democratic contest. Not the usual swing of the pendulum this way or that. It will be a key moment in the history of our democracy – and it could be less than three years away.\n\nBe in no doubt: populists represent a new and terrifying threat to the kind of free elections and free society we cherish, but now take for granted.\n\nAs Donald Trump declared at a pre-election rally in July 2024: “In four years you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Or, as his fellow populist Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, said: “Democracy is like a tram. You ride it until you arrive at your destination, then you step off.”\n\nYet, here in the UK, where is the urgently needed counter-plan on a huge scale to thwart and head off such an existential threat? It is simply not in place, nor does it appear to be even at the planning stage. We are at a very dangerous moment. We simply cannot afford to allow Nigel Farage’s Reform UK to have a free run, and become established and entrenched as a credible potential government in the minds of disenchanted voters.\n\nThe longer they go unchallenged, the more unthreatening and risk-free they will seem to voters. Just hoping that Reform and Farage implode, or that the rightwing vote will somehow fracture, is potentially suicidal for our freedom and democracy.\n\nThe Labour party has taken some small steps to counter Reform. Keir Starmer has at last begun to talk about a closer relationship with Europe, and more broadly challenge the disastrous failure that is Brexit. Presentationally, we have recently seen the first decent Starmer videos on TikTok. But it is small-scale and the narrative surrounding this government has more often been about its own failings and internal conflicts than the battle it faces against a populist surge.\n\nIf this goes on, the threat will grow. It is already doing just that on the international stage. The new US foreign policy strategy aims to support European populist parties. That is frightening. The 50-year-old Conservative Political Action Conference, reinvigorated by hard-right influencer Steve Bannon, brings populist parties in the US and Europe together to combine their electoral experiences and share initiatives. But what is there from the anti-populist side at European level? Nothing.\n\nIn September 1995, Tony Blair and his team met at my home for their first election planning meeting. All the key players were involved. New Labour was ahead in the polls. But we did not just hope that the Tories under John Major would continue to decline. We planned scrupulously for a complete reorientation, to signal a real break from the past by Labour: new strategy, new branding, new policy, new presentation, new organisation. This kind of no-holds-barred thinking is needed. A fundamental reset.\n\nFor four years, my colleague David Cowan and I have been studying how populist parties operate here and in other countries, and how to counter them. There are certain key lessons. The first is that many populists seem to work single-mindedly on the “we have only got to win once” principle. So survival means adopting an equally ruthless rebuttal mindset within democratic bounds. Prioritising conventional niceties, as Kamala Harris did when refusing to break with Joe Biden, will be a self-defeating luxury. Anti-populists must be prepared to fight fire with fire on messaging, call out lies and expose Farage’s simplistic solutions.\n\nOnce elected, a number of populists have faced accusations of rigging democratic political systems to make it nearly impossible for them ever to lose. Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Erdoğan in Turkey, Narendra Modi in India, now Trump in the US, Robert Fico in Slovakia and Andrej Babiš in the Czech Republic all seem to adopt the same game plan.\n\nSince he came to power in 2010, Orbán has changed the voting system to benefit himself. The judiciary became accountable solely to him; they appear to freely throw opponents in jail. Last year Erdoğan jailed his presidential opponent, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who was ahead in the polls, and demanded he serve a 2,000-year sentence.\n\nSome populists have been accused of meddling with national broadcasters, by appointing cronies to their board. They deny opposition parties equal rights to promote themselves, so they have no chance. This is the populist playbook. What chance then for our elections, our free speech? How will the BBC and independent media fare? An independent judiciary?\n\nThe second lesson from our research is that Starmer needs to fundamentally change the way he approaches voters and his way of interacting with them. Voters are fed up, think nothing works – and some are simply angry and feel ignored. Our work shows that populists are best taken on when their opponents can somehow demonstrate that they are on the people’s side. This is how Kentucky’s Democratic governor since 2019, Andy Beshear, won out in a deeply Republican state. He has relentlessly spoken out in plain language on bread-and-butter issues: jobs, roads, schools, prices.\n\nAnd third: Labour needs a top-to-bottom media and communications overhaul. The populist right in many countries operates a coordinated, emotionally driven media machine across social platforms, leaving the mainstream left’s ecosystem looking fragmented, reactive and constrained by an outdated broadcast mentality. To compete, Labour needs a two-front strategy now. Tactically, it must create a semi-autonomous digital narrative unit whose sole mission is to wage and win the daily war for attention. The goal is to ensure that when a voter scrolls, the populist narrative is no longer the only one they hear. This also requires a long-term cultural overhaul to recruit and elevate authentic communicators willing to talk on platforms like popular podcasts, as traditional media is no longer reaching disengaged voters.\n\nTo achieve this, a shift will be needed from a national media “air war” to a permanent, hyper-local “ground war”. The solution is a local action network, a permanent organising infrastructure modelled on the ground-up success of Stacey Abrams in Georgia. Its mission would be to listen, act and communicate – identifying local problems, launching campaigns to fix them and publicising every small win.\n\nThe current situation in the UK is a textbook case of an establishment party caught in the headlights as its populist opponent expertly reacts to voter pain and disenchantment. Relying on containment or a rational “hold-your-nose” vote is a strategy that will eventually fail. Labour needs a comprehensive action plan, now. Time is a luxury it can’t afford.\n\n Chris Powell is an election strategy analyst and advised the Labour party for more than 20 years.

But recent polling indicates that Democrats may not be able to count on the issue in their efforts to drive votes in the 2026 midterms, after making abortion rights the centerpiece of their pitch to voters in the elections that followed the fall of Roe v Wade.\n\nIn 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). But in October of this year, just 36% of Democrats said the same. By contrast, abortion remained about as important to Republicans in both 2024 and 2025, PRRI found. PRRI’s findings mirror a September poll from the 19th and SurveyMonkey, which found that the voters who cared most about abortion are people who want to see it banned.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, abortion was seen as the Democrats’ strongest issue, after the 2022 overturning of Roe sparked a wave of deeply unpopular state-level abortion bans. Kamala Harris put abortion rights at the heart of her presidential campaign, while Democratic Senate candidates and Super Pacs poured an astounding $175m into abortion-related TV ads – far more than any other issue. Donald Trump, who enabled Roe’s collapse by appointing three conservative justices to the US supreme court, repeatedly tried to downplay the fight over abortion rights, viewing it as a political liability and a sure-fire boost for Democrats.\n\nBut the power of the issue turned out to be overstated in 2024. Trump handily won the popular vote and Republicans ended up with control of both houses of Congress. Still, the president has largely avoided further action on the issue at the federal level, focusing instead on initiatives like cracking down on immigration, instituting steep tariffs and bulldozing the federal workforce.\n\nThe tumult has further yanked Americans’ attention away from abortion, said Melissa Deckman, PRRI’s CEO.\n\n“It’s just hard to catch your breath, because every day there’s a new, outrageous thing happening with the administration,” Deckman said. Abortion, she added, has been replaced as a top issue by affordability and the economy. “That seems to be first and foremost for everyone. But it’s also, for Democrats, the state of democracy writ large. We consistently find that Democrats are more concerned about the health of democracy.”\n\nAugust polling from the group Emilys List, which champions Democratic women who support abortion rights, found that voters are now prioritizing the economy over abortion. But it also found that 49% of female voters consider threats to abortion rights to be a “dealbreaker”. Abortion remains a galvanizing issue in state supreme court elections, which now often have the final word on the legality of state-level abortion restrictions. \n\nAdvocates are currently working to secure enough signatures to get abortion rights measures on the state ballots in Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon and Virginia. Idaho, Oregon and Virginia’s proposed measures would protect abortion access, while Nebraska and Montana’s measures would eliminate it. Two states, Nevada and Missouri, have already confirmed that they will have abortion-related measures on the ballot. (Nevada passed an abortion rights measure in 2024, but it must past a second time before the constitution can be amended.)\n\nIn the past, Democrats have hoped that these kinds of measures, which voters tend to support, will elevate their candidates. But in 2024, voters backed abortion rights while rejecting Democratic candidates. Trump won four states that voted in support of ballot measures that added abortion rights to their state constitutions.\n\nSome of those measures have also proven to be less gamechanging than advocates originally hoped. In 2024, Missouri voters decided to amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights, making the state – which at the time banned virtually all abortions – the first state in the country to repeal a post-Roe ban. However, a protracted legal battle over the exact implications of the measure have repeatedly blocked Missouri abortion clinics from offering the procedure. Now, in 2026, voters will be asked whether they want to repeal the measure they passed just two years ago.\n\n“It just feels like such a messaging failure, to not understand and not be able to communicate that these people are going to continue to decimate abortion access,” said Alisha Dingus, executive director of the DC Abortion Fund, which helps people get the procedure. “I would like to see more politicians who are more comfortable talking about abortion more regularly.”\n\nThe flagging attention to abortion is having a trickle-down effect on fundraising efforts by abortion rights advocates. Donations to the DC Abortion Fund dropped precipitously in 2025, as post-Roe rage donations evaporated and economic struggles led reliable donors to stop giving.\n\nData indicates that US abortions have increased over the past few years, thanks in large part to online access to abortion pills. But Dingus fears that funding will dry up for women who need to travel to clinics for abortions. Right now, the DC Abortion Fund gives out about $3,800 to dozens of people per week to support costs associated with abortions – but Dingus isn’t sure how much longer the money will last.\n\n“What I see is going off the cliff in 2026, because we can only stretch those additional dollars for so long,” Dingus said.","summary":"Abortion was seen as one of Democrats’ strongest issues in the 2024 election –  new polls indicate that may be shifting\n\nUp to seven states will vote on abortion rights this year.

Gavin Newsom at a major Democratic Party summit, it appears to be game on in the next White House race. Even though the main campaign focus this year will be on the 2026 midterm elections and the battle for Congress, early moves are underway in the 2028 race to succeed term-limited President Donald Trump. The starting gun for the next presidential showdown won't be fired until after November's midterms. But that's not preventing the large field of potential White House contenders from making headlines. Vance, considered by many to be Trump's heir apparent to eventually take over the MAGA mantle, was endorsed last month by Erika Kirk at an annual summit hosted by Turning Point USA, the increasingly influential and politically powerful conservative group. VANCE AMPLIFIES HIS 2026 MESSAGE WHILE LANDING KEY 2028 BACKING Kirk, who took over the reins of Turning Point after her husband and conservative champion Charlie Kirk was assassinated in September, opened the conference by supporting Vance. \"We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,\" in 2028, she said. \"Forty-eight\" refers to the number of the next president. The backing of the vice president by Turning Point, which is particularly influential among younger conservatives and whose political arm has built up a powerful grassroot outreach operation, could give Vance a major boost should he decide to run for president in the 2028 election. SUCCEEDING TRUMP IN 2028: SIX REPUBLICANS TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON A longtime Trump adviser told Fox News Digital that \"it wasn’t a surprise to see her endorse, given that while he was still alive, Charlie couldn’t have been more explicit about supporting Vance in 2028.\" And the adviser, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, emphasized that Erika Kirk's backing \"reaffirmed that Turning Point’s entire political machinery will be behind him [Vance] if he decides to run. It’s another big get for the vice president and a warning shot to other potential candidates.\" While Vance is considered the clear Republican frontrunner at this extremely early point in the 2028 cycle, other GOP lawmakers appear to be laying down markers. Two Republicans who tangled with Trump during the party's contentious 2016 presidential primary — Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky — are increasingly voicing their differences with the president and his administration. Among the other Republicans to keep an eye on in the new year are Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who was battered by Trump and his allies during the 2024 GOP presidential primaries, Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Brian Kemp of Georgia, and possibly Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who as a senator from Florida ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 nomination. Whether the Republicans have a competitive 2028 presidential primary will depend in part on the success of Trump's second term, whether the economy soars and how the GOP fares in next year's midterms. Regardless of those factors, as the part out of power, it's a sure bet the Democrats will have a wide open race for their party's presidential nomination. Harris, the Democrats' 2024 standard-bearer after then-President Joe Biden exited the race, showcased an edgier stump speech as she railed against both major parties and the political status quo in an address at the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) winter meeting in December. And Newsom landed the red carpet treatment, as he mingled with delegates during the opening day of the DNC's confab, which was held this year in Los Angeles, home turf to both Harris and Newsom. DEMOCRATIC HEAVYWEIGHTS TURN HEADS, SPARK 2028 SPECULATION \"Obviously, we must focus on the midterms,\" Harris said in her speech. \"But Democrats, we must also have a clear vision for what comes after the midterms. And then after Trump. We need to answer the question. We need to answer the question: what comes next for our party and our democracy?\" Expect to see more of Harris in the new year helping Democrats from coast to coast as the party works to win back congressional majorities in the midterms. And Harris has added more 2026 stops to her book tour promoting \"107 Days,\" her reflections on her abbreviated 2024 presidential campaign. Among the stops is one in South Carolina, a crucial early-voting primary state in the Democratic Party's presidential nominating calendar. While Newsom didn't address the delegates at the DNC's general session, he was treated like a VIP as he held meetings and mingled with delegates during the opening day of the winter meeting. And Newsom met with the Democratic Party chairs from New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state, and Nevada, another crucial early voting state. \"We had a great discussion on a wide range of issues,\" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told Fox News Digital. Newsom's stature in his own party has soared this year, thanks to his very vocal and visual pushback against the president, including his viral social media trolling of Trump and his successful California push to counter the Republican congressional redistricting effort. \"Newsom has shown an ability to stand up to Trump in a bold and highly effective manner without shying away from core democratic values,\" veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital. 21 DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 While both Newsom and Harris made a splash at the DNC winter meeting, they both have plenty of detractors who worry that neither would be electable in 2028 when the Democrats try to win back the White House. And if one or both of them launch presidential campaigns, they'll likely be joined by a large crowd of other contenders. One of those possible White House hopefuls is Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who was also making the rounds during the opening day of the DNC meeting. There are more than a dozen other Democrats thought to be potential 2028 White House contenders. And most of them have been paying visits to the early voting states, as well as parachuting onto the 2025 campaign trail. Among them are Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Wes Moore of Maryland and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan; Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut; progressive superstar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rep. Ro Khanna of California, another leading progressive; and two moderate Democrats, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and former White House chief of staff and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. With crucial midterm battles from coast to coast this year, expect to see much more of potential 2028 contenders out on the campaign trail in the months ahead.

Fool me twice, shame on me.” \n\nThis comes to mind reading reports of the mind-boggling welfare fraud megascandal that has been exposed in Minnesota. \n\nFor perspective on the scope of the scandal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson estimates fraud losses in Minnesota since 2018 could top $9 billion. \n\nWe’re talking about fraud in Medicaid, nutrition programs, government-funded housing programs, government programs to assist autistic children, etc. \n\nBeyond tracking down and indicting criminals, there are critically important lessons to be learned here for our country, and we must learn them. \n\nWhat do we learn about the connection between fraud and big government? What do we learn about fraud, big government and the Democratic Party? What lessons do we learn regarding our immigration policy? \n\nFraud and big government go hand in hand. \n\nA Government Accountability Office report in July notes over $300 billion of fraudulent payments in 19 pandemic-relief programs. \n\nLast May, CBS’ “60 Minutes” reported on vast fraud in federal spending programs. Per estimates of a woman who spent “a decade” at GAO, “I believe the government is losing between $550 billion and about $750 billion a year” in fraud. \n\nWhat’s the connection to the Democratic Party? Simple. Democrats are the party of big government. Every proposal coming out of the Democratic Party involves more government. More government programs, which means more fraud. \n\nAnd, of course, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, at the helm of his state while all this was happening, was the Democrat nominee in 2024 to be our vice president. He was introduced by Kamala Harris as her running mate, saying he’s “the kind of vice president that America needs.” \n\nThe Cato Institute issues a biannual Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors, grading all 50 governors on tax and spending policies. In the last report in 2024, number 50 out of 50 governors was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, scoring 19 points out of a possible 100. \n\nWhat is the lesson regarding immigration? \n\nThe Somali community in Minnesota disproportionately participated in this widespread fraud. \n\nInterviewing Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, CBS’ “Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan noted that in COVID-19 fraud exceeding a billion dollars, “of 87 charged all but eight are of Somali descent.” \n\nOmar herself is Somali and a member of the far-left “squad” in Congress. \n\nNoting the disproportionate Somali presence in the scandal, President Donald Trump wrote on social media, “Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER.” \n\nThose calling Trump a racist miss the point. \n\nConsider the Corruption Perception Index published annually by Transparency International, an organization working to eliminate corruption around the globe. \n\nOut of 180 countries measured in the Transparency International Index, Somalia is the second most corrupt country in the world. \n\nWorth noting is the strong inverse relation of corruption with economic freedom. The most economically free countries—smaller government, less intrusive regulation, strong consistent rule of law—are also the least corrupt. \n\nIn the annual Fraser Institute Economic Freedom of the World Report, out of 165 countries measured and ranked in economic freedom, Somalia ranks 101. \n\nThe point is that the Somalis so prominent in the massive fraud in Minnesota come from a country with values and reality the total antithesis of what our country is about. It is a country with little economic freedom and widespread corruption. \n\nIf Somalis chose to come here to be free and responsible citizens, good for them and good for us. But it appears many have brought the destructive values of their home country with them. They should be screened. \n\nRep. Omar has been a perverse megaphone for anti-American sentiment since she arrived in Congress. \n\nSo, cut fraud by cutting back the scope of government, and shut our borders to those who do not aspire to our values of personal responsibility and freedom. \n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM \n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Nick Shirley, the independent conservative YouTuber who published a 42-minute documentary on the subject, has racked up 2.5 million views in just five days. Commentary on the various aspects of this scandal, from Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's culpability to Somali immigration and where the money went, has gone insanely viral on social media and YouTube, and cable news is now covering the subject relentlessly.\n\nShirley has received unending acclaim from conservative commentators—Vice President J.D. Vance implied his work was worthy of a Pulitzer Prize—and a neutral-to-hostile reception from the mainstream media. Outlets like CNN are working to poke holes in some of his specific claims, while acknowledging there is plenty of evidence of fraud throughout the state's welfare system.\n\nI watched Shirley's video, and I admit that it left me feeling conflicted. I'm perfectly comfortable with the fact that he's not a professional or credentialed journalist; journalism is not a priesthood, and anyone who seeks to report the truth can engage in the craft. Great works of investigative journalism have been achieved by amateurs. Consider Guan Heng, the former Chinese citizen who took it upon himself to document the communist government's atrocities in Uyghur detention camps. In visiting state-funded child care facilities to see if they're actually enrolling children, Shirley was doing something perfectly valid. Moreover, we all know there is a considerable amount of fraud in state services: Prosecutors have charged nearly 100 people, most of them members of the Somali diaspora, in connection with fake charity schemes, Medicare payments, and child care.\n\nCritics have countered that Shirley's methods lack rigor and have questioned whether he visited the daycares during their actual hours of operation. His video draws attention to the fact that the front doors of the daycares were locked and no one would let him in, but in an era of mass social panic over school shootings (which are thankfully rarer than most people understand), there is no daycare in the country that would permit a stranger to simply walk right in. Some local reporters have suggested that the reason Shirley didn't see any kids is because the centers in question had already closed down.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be a serious mistake to dismiss what Shirley found, and there's some genuine confusion over the state of the daycares. Tikki Brown, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families, explained that numerous childcare facilities had been investigated for serious safety issues, though they continued to receive public funding. One daycare that is featured significantly in Shirley's video, the Quality Learning Center, was permanently closed the week before he visited it, yet local television reporters spotted children still being dropped off at the center. Moreover, the fact that the name of the center is misspelled on the sign hanging above the door does not inspire great confidence. (Anyone want to enroll their child at the Quality Learing Center?)\n\nThis school, in particular, seemed beset with problems. One local report contended that the Quality Learning Center had accrued 95 violations over the course of five years for offenses such as failing to keep hazardous materials away from children and improperly keeping records on who was enrolled. Yet the center continued to receive millions in state funding during that time period.\n\nWhat's notable about that local news item, however, is that it was published almost a year ago, on January 28, 2025. As Reason's Eric Boehm pointed out in his excellent explainer on the welfare fraud story, conservative complaints that no one in the media paid any attention to the story until now are demonstrably false: Local media has been covering Minnesota child care fraud as far back as 2015.\n\nIt is true that the story did not become a topic of national news until conservative writer Christopher Rufo began focusing on it. Since then, however, some large media organizations have done commendable work on the story. The New York Times, for instance, published a devastating report on the fraud that laid the blame very squarely on Walz.\n\nEven so, the welfare fraud story has not exactly attracted wall-to-wall coverage from mainstream media, even though it is obvious that these kinds of schemes are hardly isolated to Minnesota or to the Somali community: Taxpayer dollars are misappropriated, lost, or stolen in blue states and in red states alike. Moreover, Walz's selection as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election was a perfect opportunity for the national media to follow up on the local fraud reports and make this a big story. For whatever reason, they chose not to.\n\nConservative media is big and powerful too, though. It's always a bit rich when we hear Republican commentators complaining that the mainstream media has failed to investigate one news story or another, when conservative and independent media journalists are perfectly capable of looking into this as well. To be sure, there are powerful examples of nonmainstream reporters doing incredible work on a wide variety of underscrutinized topics: Gabe Kaminsky, Matt Taibbi, Ken Klippenstein, and others. Sometimes, their work goes unremarked upon by mainstream media, even when it deserves coverage—and then, when it is covered, the mainstream adopts the \"Republicans pounce and or/seize\" framing.\n\nIf mainstream, establishment national media treated the widespread looting of the public coffers as an urgent crisis that deserved at least as much scrutiny as, say, President Donald Trump's renovation of the East Wing, this would constitute a profound public service. American taxpayers and news consumers deserve a media class that is highly attuned to government corruption at the federal, state, and local levels.\n\nA Walz Around the Welfare State\n\nFor what it's worth, Walz is doing an absolutely terrible job of reassuring the public that he actually cares about identifying and prosecuting fraud. It's all well and good to push back against attempts to blame the entire Somali community for perpetrating the fraud, but Walz has a weird habit of shifting accountability by highlighting the criminality of \"white men.\" If you assert that we should ignore crude racial collectivization and then immediately claim that actually white people are the real problem, you are not helping yourself.\n\nBut the worst take of the week relating to this story comes from Politico's Josh Gerstein, who wrote on X: \"At some point, the amateur effort to knock on doors of home daycares intersects with robust stand-your-ground laws.\"\n\nAt some point, the amateur effort to knock on doors of home daycares intersects with robust stand-your-ground laws\n— Josh Gerstein (@joshgerstein) December 30, 2025\n\nThese two things don't intersect at all. Stand-your-ground laws establish the right of individuals not to retreat from dangerous situations and instead defend themselves, as long as they have the legal right to be there in the first place. You can't shoot someone just because they knocked on your door; that's because knocking on someone's door isn't placing them in danger.\n\nAnd a special shoutout to leftist streamer Hasan Piker—who recently returned from a Jane Fonda-style propaganda tour of China—who opined that it was a crime to barge into a daycare with a camera.\n\nidk what kind of fraud somalis in daycares are doing but i think it's a separate crime to try and storm w a camera into a daycare w kids in it??\n— hasanabi (@hasanthehun) December 28, 2025\n\nPiker apparently didn't watch the video, either. Shirley knocked on the door: He did not break into the premises of the Quality Learning Center, or any other center.\n\nThis Week on Free Media\n\nNo Niall Stanage this week, but I am joined by Amber Duke to break down the welfare fraud story, Trump alienating Joe Rogan, and our top entertainment choices of the year.

That last one has never been my favorite, but apparently Christian Britschgi has thoughts and we plan to address it on FREED UP this week. (Are you watching FREED UP?

Tim Walz, which began after conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley posted a 42-minute documentary alleging that Somali-Americans in Minneapolis had embezzled “upwards of $100 million” in state funds in a daycare scam.\n\nShe followed up with another post on the same platform shortly afterwards in which she reiterated: “Almost every Trump voter I see on X is so fed up they are planning a 2026 tax revolt. And rightfully so!\n\n“It’s because Americans work their asses off, barely make ends meet, and the government consistently gives their hard earned tax dollars to foreign countries, foreign wars, and foreigners the U.S. government has brought/allowed into America! And NOTHING is given to Americans!!!”\n\nGreene concluded: “We have nearly $40 Trillion in debt, unaffordable healthcare, unaffordable housing, and the dollar loses value every day. Meanwhile the government, NO MATTER WHICH PARTY IS IN CHARGE, screws over Americans. What will it take to put the American people first???”\n\nWhether Americans really will refuse to submit their income tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service en masse come Tax Day – Wednesday, April 15 – remains to be seen. Still, Greene appears correct in diagnosing widespread discontent on the right.\n\n“F*** it, I’m not paying taxes this year,” Turning Point USA contributor Savanah Hernandez wrote on X Tuesday.\n\n“And then when the IRS comes after me, I’ll blow that up into a huge national story about how the government will destroy your life over a couple thousand dollars meanwhile the Pentagon just failed their 8th straight audit in a row, Somalis literally come to the U.S. just to defraud us out of billions and illegals are prioritized for section 8 housing and welfare programs over Americans. I’m not paying for it anymore.”\n\nShe added in a follow-up: “I’m not even joking, I am fully supporting Americans not paying taxes this year or any other year until we see arrests made, funds being utilized properly and fraud being rooted out.”\n\nGreene approvingly reposted Hernandez’s remarks with the comment: “Now imagine if millions of Americans did this.”\n\nA number of other MAGA-aligned accounts have posted similar sentiments to Hernandez this week, including the Hodge Twins, Theo Von, and Rumble personality Graham Allen.\n\n“What are the feds gonna do if we all just stop paying taxes?” the Hodge Twins asked Monday.\n\n“What are we paying taxes for?” Von posted a day later.\n\n“THE WHOLE COUNTRY SHOULD STOP PAYING TAXES UNTIL THE CORRUPTION ENDS!!” Allen proposed in Trumpian all-caps. “HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS!! DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY BY TAKING AWAY THEIR MONEY!!”\n\nThe president has also pounced on the Minnesota scandal, relishing the uproar engulfing Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate in the 2024 presidential race, calling the state a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”\n\nTrump pitched a complete end to income taxes during his most recent White House run and has lately claimed that his reciprocal tariffs program will be so successful that it will render income taxes unnecessary.\n\n“I believe at some point in the not too distant future, you wouldn’t even have income tax to pay because the money we’re taking in is so great,” he said at a December 2 cabinet meeting, perhaps unwisely raising expectations.\n\n“It’s so enormous that you’re not going to have income tax to pay. Whether you get rid of it or just keep it around for fun or have it really low, much lower than it is now, but you won’t be paying income tax.”","summary":"Retiring Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene expresses sympathy with MAGA discontent amid growing talk of income tax protest","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-tax-revolt-b2893043.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/16/1/48/FILES-US-POLITICS-TRUMP-GREENE-5m0i7ijr.jpeg?crop=1888.5,1259,x209.7,y0&trim=0,210,0,209&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EVYKus1M-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-01 11:16:08","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.543},{"id":390629826,"title":"We saw progress and peril in 2025. There's hope for Trump's next year","text":"Listening to the usual legacy media suspects, one might think 2025 was an apocalyptic wasteland of sorts — an authoritarian fever dream brought on by the return of Donald J. Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let’s take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar. First, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation’s capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos — wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage and more — the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: national sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests — not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex. That reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90%. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump’s law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20% from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says. Still, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which remains elusive. A durable peace — one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration — should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful — if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious — concessions. Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration’s righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally “required” birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of noncitizens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet — granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally — is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress’s rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration. Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 — from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it — cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline — the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration. The burgeoning fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, including at businesses run by Somali Americans — astonishing in scale — has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris — who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate — know, and when did she know it? The Biden administration and the Walz administration began investigating these fraud allegations years ago, and the American people deserve answers to all these questions. Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible and emboldening key regional allies — such as Japan — who share America’s interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump’s presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal. This past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life. Let us hope we will see more — a lot more — of that same success in this new year.

The contours of that presidential contest are already emerging even as the race for control of Congress in 2026 is only just starting.\n\nDemocrats head into the 2026 midterms with a strong hand after sweeping the most-watched contests in New York, New Jersey and Virginia in both liberal strongholds and more moderate, swingy areas. They succeeded with a message largely centered around affordability as the economic picture continues to wobble, with President Donald Trump calling the issue a Democratic “hoax” and having trouble finding his footing on topic.\n\nThe overall narrative from November was one of Democratic resurgence, offering the party strategic leverage and confidence as it prepares for a pivotal midterm fight.\n\nAs Democrats look ahead to 2026, a new generation of party figures — and a few familiar faces — are positioning themselves as national players. Some have continued to build profiles beyond their states, often framing Democratic approaches to economic growth, infrastructure and policies in ways aimed at swing voters. \n\nTogether, these Democrats represent the party’s broader challenge: balancing experience and fresh leadership while crafting a message that resonates with voters across an increasingly polarized political landscape.\n\nHere are MS NOW’s picks for the Democrats to watch in 2026:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries\n\nU.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks during a news conference on Nov. 4, 2025, on Capitol Hill.\n\nJeffries, D-N.Y., more than almost any other Democrat, will be responsible for the minority party’s success in 2026. Democrats have a good shot of retaking the House majority and Jeffries is poised to become speaker if they succeed.\n\nJeffries must find a way to harness the desire from an angry base to fight Trump at every turn and win in contests in which independent voters make the difference. So far, he has leaned into the Democrats’ “affordability” mantra and opposition to rising health care premiums.\n\nHis position in the longest government shutdown in history was critical. As House minority leader, Jeffries consistently framed the government shutdown as Republicans having “zero interest” in making life better for the American people. Though Democrats didn’t exactly win the shutdown fight from a policy perspective, they did succeed in putting the Affordable Care Act premium extensions at the center of the political agenda.\n\nThe New York Democrat vehemently advocates for uniting his party around practical and bipartisan solutions, while pushing back against Republican priorities, in ways designed to appeal to moderates and swing voters. This tactic was on full display after four moderate Republicans unexpectedly joined a discharge petition launched by Jeffries to push for a three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies.\n\nJeffries’ leadership is widely seen as pivotal for the party’s 2026 strategy, both in legislative fights and in framing the stakes of the midterms to voters across competitive districts.\n\nNew York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\n\nZohran Mamdani on Oct. 15, 2025 in NYC.\n\nMamdani secured a historic win and will become the youngest New York City mayor in more than a century, also making history as the first Muslim and South Asian to lead the city. Stepping into his role on Jan. 1, Mamdani embodies a new wave of Democratic leadership, blending policy initiatives with a readiness to challenge a Republican-controlled government.\n\nThe mayor-elect did more than perhaps any Democrat to bring “affordability” into the national political lexicon, framing his entire campaign around ways to make life more affordable for average New Yorkers. It’s a message that seems to have resonated more loudly with voters and cut across more divisive cultural issues that some argue have hurt Democrats in elections.\n\nWhile defeating major challengers, including incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, to win the mayoralty, Mamdani also openly contested Trump’s agenda and rhetoric, at times trading sharp public digs with the president. \n\nAfter Mamdani’s victory, the mayor-elect and Trump held a highly watched meeting in the Oval Office in November, a rare engagement between the city’s incoming Democratic mayor and a Republican president in a second term. Their exchange, widely seen as a warm reception, may serve as a model moving forward for how local Democratic leaders can manage opposition on issues such as funding, public safety and immigration while continuing to advance their own agenda.\n\nTrump’s allies have already sought to use Mamdani as a political foil for 2026, arguing that his progressive record could help Republicans fire up their base in closely contested races.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore\n\nWes Moore, governor of Maryland, speaks on March 12, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n\nMoore is among several high-profile Democrats up for reelection next year who could find themselves quickly pivoting to a presidential run. \n\nHe is seeking a second term in a deep-blue state even as the rising Democratic star sparks speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. Moore previously insisted during an interview with NBC’s “Meet The Press,” that he’s “not running” in 2028 and instead will focus on his upcoming campaign. “I’m really excited about going back in front of the people in my state and asking for another term,” he said.\n\nThe Democratic governor has made economic growth, public safety and middle-class affordability central to his campaign, and his leadership on budget and tax issues has been a defining feature of his time in office.\n\nNotably, Moore also launched the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission to explore congressional redistricting ahead of the midterms, an effort aimed at strengthening Democratic representation in Washington even as it creates debate within his own party.\n\nMoore’s travel this year to key states has helped to fuel rumors of potential national ambitions. The Maryland governor visited Lincoln University, a historically Black college in battleground Pennsylvania, to deliver a commencement address in May. Moore also sparked attention by making a trip to South Carolina weeks later, a key early presidential primary state with a vital Democratic electorate. \n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks to reporters on Oct. 22, 2025, in Stockton, California.\n\nMany argue Newsom is the current front-runner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination given his high-profile moves to take on Trump this year. Newsom, who is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027, has many asking what’s next for him, and he has been publicly vocal that a 2028 run is a possibility.\n\n“Yeah. I’d be lying otherwise,” he said during an interview with CBS when asked if he is going to give a White House bid serious thought following the midterms.\n\nNewsom has had a busy year, including challenging the Trump administration head on, both when the National Guard and ICE were deployed into Los Angeles. Additionally, he successfully championed Proposition 50, a ballot measure to adjust congressional districts in California in response to Republican redistricting efforts — a move that could help Democrats pick up five U.S. House seats and has boosted his standing among national strategists. \n\nHe has also widened his national reach by embracing media appearances and by launching a solo podcast earlier this year, in which he discusses a flurry of topics, including with MAGA personalities. He also has a memoir titled, “Young Man in a Hurry: A Memoir of Discovery,” set to release in February.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro speaks during a press conference on April 13, 2025, outside the Governor’s Mansion in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nShapiro is seeking a second term in one of the nation’s most consequential swing states, Pennsylvania, making his actions this year significant not only for his state, but also for the party’s overall direction. Kamala Harris seriously considered him as her running mate in the 2024 contest.\n\nShapiro won his 2022 campaign for governor by double digits, and a strong 2026 performance could help him stand out as a rising star in a potentially crowded 2028 field. He has pushed bipartisan budgets that cut taxes for families and invested in education and workforce initiatives, showcasing a sensible approach that appeals to moderates and independents — coalitions that could decide 2026 House and Senate races.\n\nWorking to expand his national profile, Shapiro will travel to several states starting in January to promote his new book, “Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service.”","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/jeffries-mamdani-newsom-shapiro-moore-democrats-2026","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1766523538/251223_EOY-dems-to-watch-2026-bk/251223_EOY-dems-to-watch-2026-bk.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 11:00:00","author":"Allison Detzel","authors":["Allison Detzel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":390634706,"title":"Calmes: Trump's motto in 2025?

Back in office, the president has shown that the only pronouns he really recognizes are the first-person kind: me, myself and I. A year into Trump 2.0, those self-regarding pronouns are now firmly affixed as the bywords of his presidency, on matters major and mundane. They might as well be mounted in gold in the Oval Office, in fonts so large as to not get lost amid all the bling he’s installed there. Asked in October just who was to be honored by Trump’s planned Arc de Triomph-like monument near Arlington Cemetery, the president was quick: “Me.” To an extent that’s shocked even critics long convinced of his sociopathic narcissism, Trump has fashioned a government that’s of Trump, by Trump and for Trump. “I run the country and the world,” he boasted in April. Trump thinks “there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing,” his White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair, as reported in two articles last month that signaled her own unease with Trump’s ongoing vengeance against his political enemies; his clemency for even the most violent rioters of Jan. 6, 2021; the pain of his erratic tariffs, too-cruel migrant roundups and tragic shutdown of USAID’s humanitarian aid; his stonewalling of the Jeffrey Epstein files that candidate Trump promised to release; and the foibles of his slavish Cabinet. If Trump strutted as the center of the universe in 2025 — unchecked by advisors like Wiles or by a cowed Republican-controlled Congress, the Supreme Court and corporate chieftains — buckle up for 2026. It marks the 250th birthday of America’s independence, and our self-appointed master of ceremonies is focused on the festivities that he’ll star in not only on July 4th but all year long. One of his first acts as president was to create a White House task force with himself as chair, of course, to plan semiquincentennial events, ignoring an eight-year-old commission created by Congress for that purpose. Coming soon: A (possibly illegal) commemorative $1 coin with Trump’s image from the U.S. Mint. Never mind that 2026 starts with a big spike in health insurance costs for tens of millions of Americans, including many Trump voters. The president who campaigned on bringing down the costs of living has stood in the way of a legislative remedy to the Dec. 31 expiration of healthcare premium subsidies, repeatedly mouthing his years-old promise that he’ll propose a cheaper alternative within weeks. But here’s how 2026 will end: with midterm elections in November that loom as a referendum on whether the Trump Republican Party should keep control of Congress. The early betting is that no, it won’t. Especially after another year of Trump grandstanding, and his party’s genuflecting. In good times, Trump’s garish self-regard might be tolerable to voters, even comical. But these aren’t good times, hardly the “golden age” Trump announced in his inaugural address last January — except for him and the wealthy hangers-on at his seemingly endless round of parties in the White House and at Mar-a-Lago. The Gatsby-themed Halloween party at Trump’s Florida resort was especially rich, pun intended, coming as it did hours before federal food aid for 42 million Americans expired amid a government shutdown he’d done nothing to avert. Days later, voters gave a shellacking to Republicans in various states’ 2025 off-year elections, which is a good omen for the same result nationwide in 2026. There are other signs. On Tuesday, a new Gallup poll showed three out of four Americans were dissatisfied with “the way things are going in the United States.” Trump’s approval rating was just 36% in Gallup’s poll in early December, his lowest reading of the past year, and nearly equal to his all-time low after the Jan. 6 insurrection. Averages of various polls show Trump with negative ratings on his handling of immigration, the economy, trade and tariffs, and inflation — all issues that helped get him reelected. But go ahead, Mr. President. Keep talking about how great you are. You’re a legend in your own time and mind. Trump’s tone-deafness has become the great mystery of U.S. politics, for both parties, especially considering that he slammed President Biden for bragging about the economy’s post-pandemic recovery when Americans weren’t feeling it. As Americans struggle to buy a home or to afford its upkeep, Trump has gilded the People’s House (see the New York Times’ recent 3-D recreation of the Oval Office for full, nauseating effect) and transformed the bathroom adjoining the Lincoln Bedroom in marble and gold. Having demolished the East Wing to make way for a gargantuan ballroom where Marie Antoinette would be at home, financed by favor-seeking billionaires and corporations, Trump told reporters on Tuesday that it would have to be bigger than he’d first planned because “we’re gonna do the inauguration” there. What? The man who’s supposed to be leaving office on Jan. 20, 2029, is picking the new location for the next presidential inauguration? Hmmm. Even before he’s been in office a year, Trump has put his brand on two Washington buildings, including the nation’s 60-year-old cultural center named by law as a memorial to an assassinated president. The Kennedy Center (no, I will not call it by Trump’s name) will have marble armrests; Trump took to social media on the day after Christmas to show off samples. Meanwhile, he’s refurbishing a royal jet from Qatar, a “palace in the sky.” Trading on his power in unprecedented ways, Trump was a “crypto billionaire” by May, the Wall Street Journal reported, and in August the New Yorker estimated that he’d profited in office by at least $3.4 billion through crypto and licensing deals. No, Trump is not for you. He’s for he/him.

Democrats will look to pick up where they left off in 2025, when they scored victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governor's races by leaning heavily on affordability and the economy. But they will need to navigate crowded primaries in some key states where thorny issues could arise. Meanwhile, Trump will loom large on the Republican side — both in primaries, where he's already been active with endorsements, and in general elections, as he and his party are in control in Washington. “Most of these races across the map are going to be a referendum on Trump and his economy,” said Mike Noble, CEO of Noble Predictive Insights, a nonpartisan polling and research firm that focuses on Nevada, Arizona and other Southwestern states. “I just can’t see how they won’t be.” “The setting is good for Democrats. The big question for them is, can they really dial in their messaging and figure out who they are?” Six of the seven key presidential battleground states are among the 36 holding races for governor in 2026, and more than a half-dozen others are likely to be competitive. The year’s slate of races also includes 17 open contests — where incumbents are term-limited or retiring — and the tussling among declared and potential candidates is already in progress. Here are 10 big races for governor to watch in 2026. Arizona Arizona is one of five states Trump won in 2024 where a Democratic-controlled governorship is on the ballot this year (the others are Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). It’s one of several dynamics that underscore the challenges facing Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, who won her 2022 election by just 17,000 votes. Hobbs, whose approval rating has been under water, recently called her race “the toughest in the country.” But a competitive — and possibly unwieldy — primary is unfolding on the Republican side. The GOP field includes Rep. Andy Biggs, a founding member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Rep. David Schweikert, and Karrin Taylor Robson, who lost in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2022. Trump has endorsed both Biggs and Taylor Robson in the race, which could complicate the path for either to fully claim the president’s “MAGA” base. It could also create a messy primary ahead of the general election — a bane for Republicans in Arizona, who, with the notable exception of Trump’s 2024 win, have lost a string of statewide races in recent cycles. “Candidate quality matters a lot,” veteran Republican strategist Alex Conant said. “We’re already seeing a lot of very contested primaries; the key for both parties is to end up with electable nominees.” California The race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in the biggest blue state in the country has no shortage of candidates. The list of Democrats includes Rep. Eric Swalwell, former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, billionaire activist Tom Steyer, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and former state Controller Betty Yee. Former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., have both said they will not run. At least 10 lower-profile Republicans have said they’re running, with Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco leading the pack. Such crowded fields could create complex dynamics in a state that used a “jungle primary” system, where candidates from all parties appear on the same primary ballot, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election. Both Porter and Swalwell have so far put countering Trump and boosting affordability at the center of their early messaging. Swalwell gained prominence during Trump’s first term, having been heavily involved in both impeachment proceedings. Porter, a staunch progressive and former student of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., rose to prominence as a member of Congress for her sharp questioning of Trump administration officials at hearings during his first term. Her campaign got off to a rocky start after a tense interview with a local TV reporter made waves nationally earlier this year. Georgia With GOP Gov. Brian Kemp facing term limits, a number of fellow Republicans in state government have lined up to try to replace him. They include Attorney General Chris Carr, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who rejected Trump’s plea to “find” more votes in Georgia after he lost the state to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Jones has already secured an endorsement from Trump, who carried Georgia in 2024. The Democratic slate of candidates includes Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta who also worked in the Biden administration, as well as former Lt. Gov Geoff Duncan, a former Republican who switched parties. While Georgia has two Democratic senators, the state's voters haven't elected a Democratic governor since 1998. Iowa It's been a solidly red state during the Trump era, but if the GOP is facing particularly strong headwinds this year, Iowa's governor race could be more competitive that expected. Multiple candidates on both sides have entered the race to succeed GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds, who declined to seek a third term. State Auditor Rob Sand is seen as the Democratic front-runner, while Rep. Randy Feenstra is the favorite in the GOP primary. Iowa voters last elected a Democratic governor in 2026, but the party has been buoyed by a string of strong performances in recent special legislative elections. Kansas Kansas was an especially bright spot for Democrats four years ago, when Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won re-election in the Republican stronghold. This year, with Kelly term-limited, the state is one of Republicans’ best opportunities to flip control of a governorship: In Kansas, registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats nearly 2 to 1. A full slate of Republicans has already lined up for the open seat, including former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, state Senate President Ty Masterson, and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt. On the Democratic side, a pair of state senators — Cindy Holscher and Ethan Cordon — are vying for the nomination. While Democrats are sure to attack Trump’s cuts to the social safety net, another big part of their message may be serving as a check on the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Michigan The gubernatorial race in Michigan features not only competitive primaries for both parties, but a well-known independent candidate. The Democratic primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer includes Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, as well as Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson. The Republican primary includes Rep. John James, a former Senate candidate who has cast himself as a loyal Trump ally, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former state Attorney General Mike Cox and former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard. The winner of the primaries will face an interesting three-way race: Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who’s led the city as a Democrat for more than a decade, is running for governor as an independent, which is likely to scramble the general election in the key state. Nevada Unlike many other battlegrounds on this list, the general election in Nevada is already more or less set: State Attorney General Aaron Ford is the clear Democratic favorite to take on Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. While the \"big, beautiful bill\" Trump signed into law will hang over all the marquee gubernatorial contests, it will be especially notable in Nevada. Approximately 1 in 3 Nevadans are on Medicaid, according to data from the state and KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Inflation and tariffs have had an outsized impact on business owners and Las Vegas tourism, and the casino-laden state’s economy relies almost exclusively on gaming and hospitality, areas with big tax changes in the law. Ford has already signaled his intention to aggressively tie Lombardo to Trump. But Lombardo has proven an ability throughout his first term to distance himself from the president without triggering Trump’s ire. As is the case elsewhere, the economy will be top of mind for voters of all stripes in the Silver State. But the issue will also help illustrate whether Latinos, who make up about one in five voters in Nevada, will stick with Republicans after they helped power Trump to victory in 2024 in Nevada. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro is widely viewed as a 2028 White House contender. But he'll have to get through a re-election campaign in this battleground state first. Even after Trump flipped the state in 2024, Shapiro is still viewed as the favorite in the general election. That's due to the fact that he's maintained high approval ratings in Pennsylvania after winning in 2022 by 15 points. Part of that lopsided victory was the result of Republicans nominating a flawed candidate in state Sen. Doug Mastriano. This time around, they think they've identified a more mainstream contender and have rallied around state Treasurer Stacy Garrity. Another big win for Shapiro would only add fuel to the presidential speculation, but it could also help Democrats gain control of the Legislature, which has been politically split throughout the governor’s time in office. South Carolina The general election for governor here won’t be competitive: South Carolina voters last elected a Democrat to lead the state in 1998. But the crowded Republican primary for state’s first open governor’s race could provide major clues about the future of the party. Given that Trump's endorsement has long been a major, if not decisive, factor in GOP primaries, securing it has become the top priority for the South Carolina Republican candidates. The leading contenders are Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman and state Attorney General Alan Wilson, with Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and state Sen. Josh Kimbrell also in the mix. But Trump has yet to weigh in. The race has already turned bitter in other ways. In a February speech on the House floor, Mace accused four men of rape, sex trafficking and other sex crimes against her and other women. And she accused Wilson, the state’s top law enforcement officer, of delaying and failing to prosecute the men. Wilson has called that “categorically false.” The process could end up being drawn out: In South Carolina, primaries go to a runoff between the top two vote-getters if no candidate wins majority support. Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' decision not to run for a third term in this perennial battleground has sparked packed primaries for both parties. Former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who lost a tight 2022 race to Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., last month became the latest Democrat to enter the race. He joins a field that includes current Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, who ran for governor in 2018, and state Rep. Francesca Hong, who identifies as a democratic socialist. On the Republican side, Rep. Tom Tiffany, who represents a rural and solidly GOP area of the state, and Josh Schoemann, the county executive of Washington County, an exurban area northwest of Milwaukee, are the main contenders. Democrats are aiming to hang on to the governorship in Wisconsin after Trump narrowly carried it in the 2024 presidential contest. Veteran Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said the party's candidates are wise to continue hammering affordability in swing states like Wisconsin, but that they must remain agile in their messaging given how far away the races still are. “I don’t think you win the next war by refighting the last one — this isn’t about replicating [the wins in New Jersey and Virginia], it’s about building on the path they laid out,” he said. “People feel like Washington is just lighting their wallets on fire. Governors have the chance to step forward with the fire extinguisher.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/10-races-governor-watch-2026-rcna248043","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251026-josh-shapiro-vl-429p-4e39ec.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 10:00:00","author":"Adam Edelman","authors":["Adam Edelman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.222},{"id":390524666,"title":"Off to the races: The Democrats get ready to rumble","text":"A midterm election year is upon us, and that can mean only one thing: We have entered the realm of quickened speculation about the 2028 presidential election. On the Republican side, if President Donald Trump decides to abide by the Constitution in at least one respect, the nomination looks to be Vice President J.D. Vance's to lose. Which leaves most of the tea leaf-reading to the Democrats, with a few gaggles of candidates eyeing a run.\n\nCongressman Ro Khanna and Senators Chris Murphy and Chris Van Hollen have telegraphed their strategy for winning support from the Mamdani/AOC/Sanders wing of the Democratic primary base, which is rather an ample wing: saying the word \"genocide\" quite a lot and the phrase \"Oct. 7\" not at all. The bad news for them is that they are all competing in the same lane. The good news is that it is a very wide lane indeed, and the one richest in small donors, Hollywood endorsements, avid if not rabid activists and social media air cover.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, fresh from her \"Let-Me-Diss-Positively Everybody\" book tour, has a legitimate claim to be the most qualified to be president by dint of her four years as vice president. She is, moreover, the most prominent Black in a field that may or may not see Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Sen. Cory Booker jump in, with Blacks the single most potent constituency in the Democratic Party. There's also an emotional appeal to replacing Trump with the candidate he defeated, the ultimate middle fingered salute for the old sociopath. But in their gut, many Democrats share the queasiness that an even greater percentage of independents have about Harris, whose penchant for performative-seeming word salad and whose tendency to look gravitas-challenged lost her the election in 2024.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says she's not running. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker is as inspirational as a slab of asphalt, and as a billionaire, seems ill-positioned to make the affordability case that presently resonates with Americans. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is a charismatic candidate who has successfully countered Trump's bid to maintain GOP control of Congress by gerrymandering Texas with a corresponding countermove in California. And he has delighted Democrats by effectively mocking Trump at every turn, and there have been plenty of turns. He's good-looking and his hair is great. Among the things that remain to be seen is whether he will ultimately come off as too slick, whether skeletons in his closet (an affair with his campaign manager's wife, the indictment of his former chief of staff) rattle and how loudly.\n\nTwo potential candidates reside in whatever moderate lane still exists among Democratic primary voters. The jury is very much out on whether there are enough Democrats for whom the proclamation \"Zionism is Satanism\" seems neither compos mentis nor persuasive messaging. These are Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former a-whole-lot-of-things Rahm Emanuel. Both, coincidentally or not coincidentally, are Jewish. Both are disinclined to drink the poisoned Kool-Aid being imbibed by many of their fellow Democrats.\n\nOf the two, while Shapiro has a strong record in Pennsylvania and is popular there, Emanuel, who lacks a political or geographic base, may be the more interesting candidate. A three-term U.S. Congressman, White House chief of staff under former President Barack Obama, mayor of Chicago for eight years and U.S. ambassador to Japan under former President Joe Biden, his multi-faceted experience enables him to argue compellingly that his preparedness for the presidency exceeds that of anyone save Harris. His natural instinct for and skills at verbal combat are second to none of his rivals, and his willingness to freely engage with conservative interlocutors like \"Fox & Friends\" and Megyn Kelly — and even to critique Democratic orthodoxies — could set him apart from the pack. But he is already facing the hyped-up wrath of Bernie Bros, who would sooner see Trump 3.0 than have a Democratic president disinclined to kowtow to them.\n\n\"I'm not a member of any organized party,\" Will Rogers famously quipped. \"I'm a Democrat.\" Anyone who expects the 2028 contest for the Democratic presidential nomination to be bloodless should think again. It ain't going to be pretty.","summary":"","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/off-to-the-races-the-democrats-get-ready-to-rumble/article_da1790a2-efd0-4990-a3e3-ff234368288c.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/49/a49048e5-649d-4a91-842f-2e3bd7932973/6953edbba50f6.image.jpg?crop=1556%2C817%2C221%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 10:00:00","author":"By Jeff Robbins","authors":["By Jeff Robbins"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.072},{"id":390508374,"title":"Trump tests Tim Walz as Democratic boogeyman after Somali fraud scandal","text":"Trump has heaped attacks on Walz in the weeks after the fraud became a national news story, with the president and Republicans more broadly questioning how hundreds of millions in federal dollars were squandered under Walz’s watch. The fraud represents the latest misuse of pandemic-era funds and has become a ballooning case for the Justice Department, which has prosecuted dozens of alleged conspirators.\n\nBut the story also has a political dimension that ties together the GOP’s emphasis on fiscal responsibility with the hard line it has drawn on immigration. FBI Director Kash Patel said that his agency is working with immigration authorities for “possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings.”\n\nWalz has defended his handling of the fraud allegations, telling Fox News that his office “strengthened oversight” once the schemes came to light. But that defense has not quieted the criticism, as the Trump administration and its congressional allies expand investigations into suspected misconduct and even begin to withhold federal dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has blamed Democratic policies for an influx of immigrants he says are “completely taking over” the country, and has hurled insults at Walz, drawing controversy for calling him a dated slur for intellectually disabled people.\n\nRepublican operatives concede that the focus on Walz, the former running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, is easy political fodder after an election cycle spent portraying him as an inept and radical governor. And in an election season in which Walz is seeking a rare third term in office, the attacks could prove fruitful in a blue state where Republicans are hoping to make inroads.\n\nStill, Republicans believe that “even Democrats” don’t want Walz as a candidate in future general elections, and that Democratic politicians such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), a possible 2028 contender for president, or New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, an avowed socialist, will prove the most useful in this and future cycles.\n\n“Let’s be honest. This is a guy who made Kamala Harris seem like an expert debater,” said one out-of-government adviser to the president, a veteran of all three of his presidential campaigns. “We’ll have our fun, but I’m not sure that even an expert brander like President Trump can just wish this one into reality.”\n\nA second Trump veteran, who previously worked in the White House but has since grown frustrated with the president’s performance in office, said Trump’s focus on Walz and “the past” will eventually wear on voters’ nerves, considering Trump’s declining approval ratings.\n\n“America elected President Trump in 2024 to save us from the economic disaster that a Harris-Walz administration would inflict,” the former Trump staffer explained. “But that was over a year ago, and we’re more or less in the same place. We’re still dealing with crazy inflation, and all the economic growth we’ve seen this year is propped up by just a handful of tech companies, which the administration is heavily subsidizing by the way. He needs to actually deliver some real results and fix these problems, not just b**** and moan about how much worse things would’ve been if he hadn’t won.”\n\nMultiple senior Democratic officials, one of whom staffed Walz on the 2024 campaign trail, told the Washington Examiner that the Minnesota fraud scandal plays into the GOP’s electoral strengths but doubted that it would help Minnesota Republicans win next year’s gubernatorial election or resonate with voters beyond the state like Trump’s immigration rhetoric did while running against Harris.\n\n“The thing about the border security issue was it was so present. People see ‘fraud’ and Somalian immigrants, but it’s not like the images of people running across the border or through the Rio Grande,” the former Walz aide said. “I’m always worried about the misuse of public dollars, but this is a little in the weeds.”\n\nA second senior Democratic official welcomed Trump’s attacks on Walz, saying the president’s focus could solidify support from the “anti-Trump” crowd around the incumbent.\n\n“No Democrat is running against Gov. Walz because we, and the voters, know the truth: He is a good man, and Trump’s attacks are more rooted in racism than reality,” the official assessed, noting that Republicans, by contrast, have not yet landed a strong recruit for the governor’s race.\n\n“On the other side, you’ve got basically a dozen Republicans all trying to out-Trump each other, and they’re all probably going to lose to Mike Lindell,” they added. “Minnesota hasn’t voted a new Republican into a major office since Trump stepped off the golden escalator, and I seriously doubt the My Pillow guy is going to change that.”\n\nA third Democratic staffer laughed that Trump “can’t even keep the plot straight” on who to blame for the Minnesota scandal, pointing fingers at both Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who is a Somali immigrant.\n\nStill, the fraud scandal continues to be an unwanted firestorm for the Democratic Party that, beyond politics, could jeopardize millions in federal funding. Kelly Loeffler, Trump’s Small Business Administration chief, sent a letter to Walz before Christmas, alerting him that the administration would be halting some $5.5 million in funding previously allocated for the state while the federal government continues to investigate additional fraud cases.\n\nNew reporting that surfaced over the weekend suggests that multiple Minnesota daycare operations were recipients of taxpayer subsidies, despite currently having no children enrolled in the programs.\n\nPatel reacted to those reports on Sunday by announcing plans to surge “investigative resources” to expand the federal government’s inquiry, adding that the indictments handed out so far represent “just the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem similarly offered up ICE agents on Monday to conduct investigations of alleged fraud sites.","summary":"The revelation of widespread fraud committed by members of Minnesota’s Somali community is a political gift for President Donald Trump, allowing him to elevate Gov.

California is worse, Illinois is worse, and unfortunately, New York is worse, along with many other places,” Trump stated.\n\nAs applause erupted from the crowd, which included celebrities, his cabinet members, and family, Trump vowed, “We’re going to get to the bottom of all of it.”\n\nThe controversy gained traction when right-wing influencer Nick Shirley released a YouTube video on Friday. The video alleged that daycare centers run by Somali residents in Minneapolis were involved in fraud amounting to $100 million.\n\nIn the video he stands outside two deserted ‘daycare centers’ which have collected $2.6m in federal grants despite not appearing to be in operation and highlighted a number of other alleged frauds. \n\nThe explosive accusation sparked nationwide anger, and the Trump administration announced on Tuesday it is freezing $185m in child care funds to the state and demanded an audit of fraud schemes involving government programs.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis-St Paul’s Somali community began in the 1990s when it accepted refugees fleeing the country’s civil war, and there are now around 94,000 city residents who speak the language. \n\nPoliticians in the Democrat-controlled state now stand accused of turning a blind eye to the fraud scandal for fear of being accused of racism. \n\nAnd Donald Trump has weighed in, branding Minnesota a ‘hub of fraudulent money laundering activity’, while FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X that ‘this is just the tip of a very large iceberg’. \n\nShirley’s video – which amassed 2.5 million views on YouTube in a few days – is just the latest alleged scheme in a string of scandals plaguing Minnesota, which prosecutors say have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. \n\nIt followed the White House launching a crackdown on illegal immigration in the state – the home to the largest population of Somali immigrants in the US – after Trump said America would ‘go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage’. \n\nIn addition to Shirley’s new bombshell claims, 14 Medicaid-funded programs in Minnesota are already under federal investigation for an alleged $9b COVID-era fraud scandal. \n\nThroughout Shirley’s video, entitled ‘I Investigated Minnesota’s Billion Dollar Fraud Scandal’, the YouTuber visits several facilities purporting to be daycare centers accommodating hundreds of children.\n\nBut when he visits the centers, many of them are closed, the windows are blacked out, and no children can be seen.\n\n‘They’re open seven days a week, 7am to 10pm it says here on their sign, yet there’s absolutely nobody here,’ he says, standing outside one center.\n\nLater, the content creator visits another facility, with a misspelt sign outside that reads ‘Quality Learing [sic] Center’.\n\nHe asks a man who says he has lived in the neighborhood for eight years if he’s ever seen children entering the center.\n\n‘None, not at all,’ the man replies. ‘I’ve been here since 2017 and I haven’t seen anybody down here.’\n\nOn several occasions, people inside the center refuse to open the door to Shirley and ask for him to leave. \n\nAs Homeland Security agents flock to Minnesota for what DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called a ‘massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud’, longstanding investigations dating back to 2022 continue.\n\nFederal charges have already been filed against 98 people in Minnesota, and at least 60 have been convicted. \n\nAs Attorney General Pam Bondi stressed on Monday – 85 of the defendants accused of embezzlement of public funds are ‘of Somali descent’. \n\nJoseph H. Thompson, the prosecutor conducting the investigation, said he had identified ‘staggering, industrial-scale fraud’ in Minnesota’s safety-net programs. \n\nThe fraud schemes – conducted mainly by Minnesota’s Somali community – targeted state initiatives meant to feed children during Covid-19, support minors with autism, and aid those at risk of homelessness.\n\nBut prosecutors say fraudsters billed the government for social services that were never provided.\n\nFifty-seven people have already been convicted in a scheme to divert $300 million in public grants intended to distribute free meals to children – but the meals never existed, prosecutors said.\n\nThe fraudulent payouts to the ‘Feeding Our Future’ program constituted the nation’s costliest Covid-era scam. \n\n‘What’s happening in Minnesota is a microcosm of the immigration fraud in our system,’ Vice President JD Vance posted on X.\n\n‘Politicians like it because they get power. Welfare cheats like it because they get rich. But it’s a zero-sum game, and they’re stealing both money and political power from Minnesotans.’\n\n‘Somali scammers get rich off the programs Governor Walz was supposed to be managing,’ Dr. Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), said in a video earlier this month.\n\nThreatening to cut off federal funding for programs administered by state officials, he said: ‘Minnesota politicians get elected with Somali votes and keep the money flowing.’\n\nAnnouncing the expansion of the investigation into Minnesota’s social services programs, prosecutor Thompson said new suspects included two men from Philadelphia who were engaged in ‘fraud tourism’. \n\nHe said they travelled to the state ‘because they knew and understood that Minnesota was a place where taxpayer money can be taken with little risk and few consequences’.\n\nSomali-Americans in Minnesota described their heightened fear following derogatory comments made by the president, who said during a cabinet meeting earlier this month that Somalia ‘stinks’ and is ‘no good for a reason’.\n\n‘They contribute nothing,’ Trump said, adding: ‘I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you.’\n\nHe hit out against Omar, calling the congresswoman an ‘incompetent person’.\n\n‘Anyone who looks like me [is] scared right now,’ Jamal Osman, a member of the Minneapolis City Council, told CBS News.\n\n‘My community is upset. Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.’\n\n‘ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is already here,’ said Kowsar Mohamed, who lives in south Minneapolis.\n\n‘We’re seeing boots on the ground activity where folks are just being plucked off of the streets and being asked about their residency status. That’s not a data informed approach.’ \n\nThe Trump administration in recent months has latched onto news of the large-scale public benefit fraud scandal to carry out immigration raids and harsher policies targeting Minnesota’s large Somali migrant community.\n\nRepublican elected officials and federal prosecutors have accused the local Democratic authorities of turning a blind eye to numerous warnings because the fraud involved Minnesota’s Somali community.\n\n‘When whistleblowers raised concerns, they were told that they shouldn’t say anything out of fear of being called racist or Islamophobic, or because it was going to hurt political constituency of the governor and the ruling party, the Democrats here,’ state representative Kristin Robbins, a Republican who is running for governor, told AFP.\n\nDemocratic Governor Walz – former vice president Kamala Harris’s unsuccessful running mate in 2024 – rejects the accusation.\n\nWhile the case became public in 2022, prosecutors ramped it up again this year with hotly politicised revelations.\n\nAnother Republican candidate for governor, state house speaker Lisa Demuth, told AFP the case is ‘finally getting the attention that it’s needed’ – especially following the viral video published by content creator Shirley. \n\nThe video – which blew up on X with tens of millions of views and played repeatedly on Fox News – resonated with Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA) circles, who are opposed to what they deem to be overly generous social and immigration policies.\n\nThe Trump administration responded to the outcry immediately, with DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin telling Fox News that hundreds of investigators were targeting local businesses in Minneapolis.\n\n‘We believe that there is rampant fraud, whether it be daycare centers, health care centers, or other organizations,’ she said.\n\nAs part of the crackdown, federal health officials announced a broad freeze of funding to Minnesota and across the county.\n\n‘We have frozen all child care payments to the state of Minnesota,’ Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy Jim O’Neill wrote in an X post Tuesday.\n\n‘We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud.’ \n\nHHS has broad spending oversight for programs for the underprivileged, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, early education of toddlers and foster care.\n\n‘While we have questions about some of the methods used in the video, we do take the concerns that the video raises about fraud very seriously,’ said Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families commissioner Tikki Brown. \n\nResponding to the video, FBI Director Patel said his agency was aware of ‘recent social media reports’, and that investigations into fraud in Minnesota were ‘ongoing’ since the pandemic.\n\n‘The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg. We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing,’ Patel wrote on X.\n\nCBS, which conducted its own analysis of nearly a dozen daycare centers mentioned by Shirley, said it found no evidence of fraud when it reviewed public records for the facilities, although it did find citations related to safety, cleanliness, equipment, and staff training.\n\nAll but two of the centers mentioned in the video had active licenses and were all visited by state regulators in the last six months. \n\nMinnesota congressman Tom Emmer, a leading figure in the Republican majority of Congress, called for mass ‘denaturalisation and deportation of every Somali engaged in fraud in Minnesota,’ in an X post Monday.\n\nPresident Trump preceded Emmer’s call with similar sentiments at the end of November, when a conservative outlet claimed money embezzled in Minnesota was being used to fund Somalia’s Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda linked Islamist militant group.\n\nThat accusation has since been denied by the prosecutor in the case.\n\nBut the US president was quick to accuse ‘Somali gangs’ of ‘terrorizing’ Minnesotans and ended their Temporary Protected Status, a program that exempted Somalis from deportation to their war-torn country.\n\nA surge in immigration raids followed his comments, creating ‘a dangerous atmosphere of chaos and instability that is making it harder for our police officers to keep Minneapolis safe,’ mayor Jacob Frey said at the time.\n\nDemocratic lawmaker Zaynab Mohamed, whose family emigrated from Somalia when she was a child, decried the Trump administration’s actions.\n\n‘Trump is scapegoating a tiny piece of the population,’ she said. ‘This is not about crime. It’s not about safety. This is about purging people like me from this country.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump recently addressed the unfolding migrant fraud scandal in Minnesota, suggesting&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump Criticizes Minnesota&#8217;s Handling of Somali Fraud Allegations first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/donald-trump-criticizes-minnesotas-handling-of-somali-fraud-allegations/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Donald-Trump-goes-scorched-earth-on-Minnesotas-Somali-fraud-scandal.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 07:06:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":390471450,"title":"Letters to the Editor — Monitoring AI, Texas GOP, public transportation, Charles Hosch","text":"Just ask AI\n\nRe: “Congress, not states, should govern AI — Trump’s executive order is a constitutional response to overreach,” by Kevin Frazier, Dec. 18 Opinion.\n\nFrazier presents a well-written and powerful argument to the question of should AI governance be at federal or state level. Obviously he must feel strongly that President Donald Trump’s executive order is well-intended. \n\nHowever, as I read through his opinions, I became curious as to why certain states argue to the contrary. So, I turned to AI, itself, using Google’s AI mode to ask the same question.\n\nAh-ha! It seems that there are a lot of good reasons for states retaining considerable say in the laws and rules, especially in the areas “focusing on immediate harms like deepfakes, biometric data privacy, and algorithmic bias.”\n\nI hope that your newspaper will be forthcoming in a little whataboutism on this subject.\n\nL. David McDonald, Heath\n\nFearful for democracy\n\nEven though it’s cold outside, seeing Tuesday’s cartoon of a redacted U.S. Constitution chilled me to the bone even more. In all my years, I would never have thought I would be concerned for our democracy. \n\nAs a former officer in the U.S. Army, I developed a very strong affection for our Constitution and our democracy, and today I am fearful for both. What have we allowed to happen?\n\nDan Siculan, Royse City\n\nDemocrats do more harm\n\nRe: “Texas GOP rooting me out,” by Clayton Devin, Tuesday Letters.\n\nLike Devin, I, too, read with interest the cases for voting values over parties. I consider myself a conservative independent. Like Devin, I vote mostly, but not totally, for Republicans. I don’t care about party labels. I care about what I believe is best for the country. \n\nUnlike Devin, I haven’t given up on the Republicans, because although they sometimes do things I don’t like, the Democrats do far more harm. One of three reasons Devin cites for abandoning the party is redistricting without input from voters. Fair enough. However, look what happened when Joe Biden, the duly appointed Democratic candidate for president, imploded during his debate with President Donald Trump. Suddenly, the Democrats realized Biden would lose. \n\nSo what happened? A handful of party power brokers, including Nancy Pelosi and a famous actor, decided Biden had to go. They picked Kamala Harris to replace Biden, without one single vote from the public. \n\nDemocrats love to accuse Trump of destroying democracy, yet this was one of the most flagrant acts against democracy in the history of our republic. \n\nSo, I’ll continue to vote mostly Republican, though sometimes I hold my nose when doing so.\n\nDaniel Willis, Garland\n\nDensity wrong for DART\n\nRe: “Public transportation is key,” by Fran Powell, Dec. 12 Letters.\n\nThis letter writer mentioned that Dallas-Fort Worth lacks the large, well-utilized public transit systems of some of the great cities of the world, proposing that the current system be expanded. New York, London and Paris were mentioned as models.\n\nI believe the main reason large transit systems work in those cities and not so much in D-FW is population density and more vibrant city centers. The member cities in DART have a density of about 1,500 people per square kilometer.\n\nLondon has about 6,000 per square kilometer, New York City about 11,000. Paris has even more than that. At those densities, transport via auto is not really feasible — mass transit is desirable, required and economically attractive.\n\nAnother consideration is city center development and daily visits. Downtown Dallas seems to be shrinking, not growing, and there are not enough daily visits to justify a large transit system.\n\nNew development is in the suburbs, and their low density does not make large mass transit required, desirable or economically feasible. I believe this is the reason some cities want a smaller DART, more responsive to their need levels and at lower cost.\n\nBill Pritchard, Farmers Branch\n\nUninviting pastor petty\n\nRe: “Pastor who backed Pride uninvited to meeting — Keller City Council revokes opening prayer offer, citing recent festival he hosted,” Dec. 20 Metro & Business story.\n\nHow small of the Keller City Council to uninvite the priest who leads St. Martin-in-the-Fields Episcopal Church from delivering the invocation at a council meeting, apparently because the church allowed a Pride festival to use a field on its property. How petty, how pitiful, how pathetic.\n\nBill Lewis, Round Rock\n\nHiker’s law partner tireless\n\nRe: “Family, friends keep search, hopes alive — SMU professor, attorney disappeared in Georgia a month ago during hike,” Dec. 13 news story.\n\nI am the next-door neighbor to Kathryn “Kate” Morris. I have known Kate for nine years. Over the years, I learned a lot about Kate’s life — growing up losing her biological father at around age 5, having childhood cancer and on into adulthood and the practice of law and her eventual decision to leave Strasburger & Price, LLP, for private practice with Charles Hosch.\n\nFast forward to Nov. 11, 2025, and at the disappearance of Charles, Kate has triggered an incredible effort that continues today to find and bring Charles home. \n\nKate has been in Georgia since the early days and the formation of the search and rescue/recovery missions. She did fly home to teach Charles’ Southern Methodist University course, but then she returned to Georgia.\n\nKate has set up the website, bringcharleshome.com, updates it daily and started a funding account to help repay all the many, many search, rescue and support efforts.\n\nI think everyone walking this earth wants to have just one friend like Kate. She is also very active in our neighborhood, and we co-host a once or twice a year “driveway party” for neighbors.\n\nShe would have also been most deserving of consideration for Texan of the Year.

I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.”\n\nIn the same interview, Clooney – who has been playing journalist Edward R Murrow in a recent stage adaptation of his 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck – criticised Trump’s battles with the US media.\n\nReferring to the recent CBS News and ABC News settlements with Trump, Clooney said: “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f*** yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country. That’s simply the truth.”\n\nEarlier this year, prominent Democrat donor Clooney said “everybody” worries about being targeted by Trump’s administration, but added that won’t stop him from standing up for what he believes in.\n\n“Sure, everybody worries about it,” Clooney told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “But you know, if you spend your life worrying about things, then you won’t do things.”\n\n“I want to be able to look at my kids in the eye and say where we stood and what we did at certain times in history, and I have no problem with that,” he said.\n\nIt emerged last week that Clooney, his wife Amal and their eight-year-old twins have been granted French citizenship.\n\nEarlier this year, Clooney talked about leaving Los Angeles for a quieter life in France and why he felt that it worked out better for his children.\n\n“I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood. I felt like they were never going to get a fair shake at life. France, they kind of don’t give a s*** about fame,” he told Esquire in October.\n\n“I don’t want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don’t want them being compared to somebody else’s famous kids.”\n\nClooney and his wife bought a house in Provence for $8.3m in 2021. The sprawling 425-acre estate reportedly consists of an 18th-century mansion with a pool, tennis court, vast gardens, and an ornamental lake.","summary":"Clooney, an outspoken liberal, knew Trump before his political career began","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/george-clooney-donald-trump-friendship-interview-b2892998.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/16/51/George-Clooney-and-Donald-Trump.png?crop=2034,1356,x7,y0&trim=0,7,0,7&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/BIRYT2ZA-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-01 03:14:46","author":"Ellie Harrison","authors":["Ellie Harrison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.112},{"id":390451410,"title":"Elected by Outrage, Removed by Reality","text":"Given the exceedingly short attention span of the average American mind, it is as if the nationwide DOGE protests and the subsequent idiotic vandalizing of Tesla automobiles occurred in a distant, forgotten past rather than during a period that transpired in the spring of 2025. By that metric, the protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody may as well have occurred in another century. During that evidently ancient time of middle 2020, an impulse-driven plurality of voters turned their understandable anger into what were sometimes ill-advised voting choices.\n\nHere in Pittsburgh, as in many other places, the resulting Floyd protest movement hangover is playing itself out in a thoroughly predictable manner; outgoing Democratic mayor Ed Gainey, who had called for “demilitarization” of police while riding the protest wave into office as the city’s first black mayor, was defeated in the May primary by city controller Corry O’Connor, who went on to win the November election.\n\nGainey, previously an unremarkable state legislator, demonstrated his unfitness for the job of mayor not long after taking office, alienating other city officials with his belligerent tone, his continually defensive posture, his thin-skinned reaction to even the slightest criticism from the local press and his all-around pettiness, culminating in his 2025 pronouncement that the county’s district attorney was, in fact, a racist, telling a group of supporters, with his typical verbal eloquence, “I told the DA he’s a racist. I ain’t support the DA.” Just for good measure, the mayor later discerned that a local radio talk show host also had some hitherto unnoticed racist tendencies.\n\nMeanwhile, the city’s finances and physical infrastructure have continued to crumble at an accelerating pace, without ever being addressed in a serious manner by Mr. Gainey’s office. Aging emergency response vehicles are in desperate need of replacement, the police department’s shortage of officers is an ongoing (and growing) crisis, the downtown area is being hollowed out as businesses flee the blight of homelessness and drug addiction in plain sight, and next year’s NFL draft at the nearby stadium is beginning to loom large in ways that feel increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nTo be fair, Gainey inherited a mess left behind by his predecessor and by a century of Democratic Party dominance in all things local. No one expected the new mayor to have any magic answers or magic ideas. But utter incompetence, unseriousness, and an unwillingness to make hard choices were not expected either. Gainey’s proposed city budget for 2026 calls for no austerity measures of any kind, despite the increasing reliance on a dwindling rainy day fund to make ends meet. It seems as though Ed Gainey has given his final “f*** you” to city council members or city voters or, more likely, both.\n\nAnd now, we are right back where we started: a conventional Democrat (who also is the son of a deceased former Pittsburgh mayor) has won handily against a token Republican opponent. O’Connor will preside over a city that is a hotbed of progressivism (not Portland hot, but hot), with the attendant racial tension often generated by such a circumstance, in addition to a never-ending cycle of public school consolidation, a shrinking tax base, and creeping urban decay. Not only will he have to expend time and effort trying to repair the dysfunction generated by Gainey’s trail of destruction, he’ll have to contend with ongoing headaches generated by people such as local U.S. House member and proud socialist Summer Lee, who may best be described as an excruciatingly insipid devotee of Bernie Sanders, and Allegheny County Executive Sarah Innamorato, a “former” supporter of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nIn his favor, O’Connor can fairly portray himself as disconnected from the Floyd overreaction. The national hysteria that lifted Gainey to electoral victory continues to recede, along with the absurd demands of those who were driving the protest, which, in retrospect, looks more and more like a flavor-of-the-month gone sour. Even Colin Kaepernick seems to be maintaining a low profile, as the prevailing winds clearly have shifted and there is an ever-growing chorus of (supposedly) cooler heads among the voting public yearning for the elevation of “moderates.” In that regard, as long as O’Connor can put some sort of moderate-sounding stamp on whatever he proposes, he should be able to get by, perhaps even thrive. Just as importantly, the current estrangement between police and the mayor’s office should dissipate in short order, as O’Connor reaps the many benefits of not being Gainey.\n\nIn the end, the justifiable outrage generated by George Floyd’s death proved not to be the beginning of a fundamental national shift to anything meaningful but rather a temporary detour into the progressive weeds, highlighted by the silliness of the CHAZ (Capitol Hill Organized Zone) declaration in a Seattle neighborhood. The expedited backtracking away from this kind of nonsense by local politicians months later was bemusing, to be sure, but also rather sad. In some cases, those who had praised the notion of defunding or “reimagining” police reversed themselves completely, perhaps feeling a bit traumatized by the whiff of anarchy they had experienced at close range.\n\nAnd what was gained by way of the whole experience? What lessons have been learned over the past five or so years? For the average American voter, who has a breathtakingly short memory, who has been trained by modern technology to live in the moment, who is easily distracted by the next shiny object that comes along, either to entertain them or enrage them, the answer has to be “none.” The more unfortunate aspects of our nature will continue to make too many of us act reflexively rather than reflectively, and there will never be a shortage of electoral outcomes generated by impulsive thinking, irrational assumptions, bigotry, tribalism, or whatever.\n\nIf it can be argued that Ed Gainey was, in some form or fashion, a DEI hire, then it certainly can be argued that he is now a casualty of DEI fatigue, and perhaps therein is the silver lining; maybe we actually are in the embryonic stages of a greater public demand for emphasis on realistic proposals and achievable goals, as the emphasis on immutable characteristics of candidates for elected office (hopefully) takes a back seat. The fractured status of the Democratic Party in the wake of Kamala Harris’s epic failure certainly provides an opening for some kind of seismic shift, though it remains unclear how the battle for the soul of the party will play out, especially when one considers the ascendency of Zohran Mamdani and the harbinger he represents.\n\nWhat does seem clear is that the improvement in the quality of our governing class, if it ever comes, most likely will be the result not of a sustained trend of enlightenment among voters but rather of some unforeseen series of favorable events combined with a bit of luck, more or less disconnected from any notion of a collective national wisdom.\n\n5 Years On, What the Media Need to Know About George Floyd\n\nDo the Democrats Remember Mississippi 1962?\n\nDerek Chauvin’s Real Crime — ‘Being Born White’","url":"https://spectator.org/elected-by-outrage-removed-by-reality/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ed-Gainey-e1767129747291.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 03:08:08","author":"Peter Davis","authors":["Peter Davis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":390451414,"title":"Heroes and Zeroes of 2025","text":"To nobody’s surprise, 2025 was a tumultuous year. Reversing a half-century of cultural, domestic, and geopolitical rot had to take a heavy toll, which it did in the blood of one crusader. Yet while the denizens of Leftist Hell increased their demonic shrieking, fearless conservative leaders began to expose them as the denuded maniacs they are. This, despite dissension on the Right — though not the true spiritual Right, led by the man shot dead in Utah last September. Whether common sense will be in ascent or descent next Christmas depends on who will follow in his footsteps over the next few months.\n\nCharlie Kirk. Charlie Kirk earned his place as the most influential traditionalist Christian leader of American youth. To be 18 and realize everything you learned from academia, news media, and entertainment media was a lie is shocking enough. But then, to do something about it, out of your garage, founding an organization to uncloud young minds; that is historic. Charlie didn’t rest on the triumph of Turning Point USA. He went into the trenches, debating the deluded. And the more of them he turned to reason, the more the rest despised him. Last fall, one killed him. But because Charlie lived the faithful life he championed, the right person succeeded him.\n\nErika Kirk. The whole world watched the moment Erika Kirk became a widow and the single mother of two little children. Most people were horrified, even on the Left, yet far too many were jubilant, only on the Left. Through the unbearable darkness of being, Erika’s courage and class shone brighter. She publicly forgave her husband’s depraved assassin and took the helm of TPUSA, vowing to make it into a formidable force for truth, justice, and the American Way. She’s not a superhero, but she is a wonder woman, empowered by love of family, country, and God.\n\nDonald Trump. The Soviet Union outlasted Ronald Reagan by three years before falling from the mortal wound he dealt it. The Democrats may not survive Trump for that long, though their hatred for him is the glue holding them together. No Republican president ever damaged them the way Trump has so soon in his second term, by extracting every card in their house of marked cards — DEI, the open border, trans equality, a nuclear Iran, even artistic hegemony. I look forward to attending the Trump Kennedy Center in the New Year, and laughing off leftist howls.\n\nMarco Rubio. I voted for Rubio over Trump in the 2016 Florida primary. Not because he’s a fellow Cuban (though that helped) but because, like many, I thought Trump was nuts. History not only proved me wrong, but it slapped me by making Trump the second greatest president of my lifetime (with a shot at the title) and Rubio the greatest secretary of state. Just three of his accomplishments: securing NATO countries’ spending commitments, countering Chinese influence (no ChiCom spy balloons over secret bases this year), reducing illegal migration.\n\nScott Adams. Also in 2016, Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams shocked everyone by predicting Donald Trump would become president. Leftist outrage when he was proven right didn’t prevent the then-progressive Adams from becoming a hugely successful podcast host, even after a logical racial statement in 2023 got Dilbert canceled by every newspaper in the country. Adams’s deadpan, humorous observations on Democrat lunacy have driven them crazier, especially before and since the ’24 election. He is currently and heroically battling Stage 4 prostate cancer, and could use all our prayers.\n\nTim Walz. The goofy, effete — but amusingly macho posturing — governor of Minnesota had an awful 2024 as Kamala Harris’s VP running mate. He’s had a much worse 2025 as reports of multi-billion-dollar Somali immigrant welfare fraud keep flooding in, though not from the mainstream media. Whatever presidential race plans he made are gone with the taxpayers’ money.\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson. It was no surprise that Supreme Court Justice Jackson dissented in the August decision pausing DEI-based NIH funding (along with her two progressive sisters on the Court and the ever disappointing Chief Justice John Roberts). Without DEI, Jackson wouldn’t be on the Court. Her opinions this year were so absurd and liberal protective, even the demure Amy Coney Barrett had to mock one as “tethered neither to these sources [precedent and the Constitution] nor, frankly, to any doctrine whatsoever.”\n\nKeir Starmer. Great Britain declined gradually in the 20th Century (following the suicide of World War I) and rapidly in the 21st, but at warp speed in the last year under the Labour Party and its twit PM Keir Starmer. His government has been arresting or hassling citizens for such hideous offenses as citing Muslim immigrant criminality on social media — such as raping young girls — or praying outside abortion clinics. Starmer appears to be reading Orwell’s 1984 as a “How to Govern” guide.\n\nHollywood. After I fulfill my contract for three Mark Slade-Neil Cork political detective thrillers (book two out in Fall 2026), I intend to write the Great Hollywood Novel. It will be an epic story of the studio years from 1927 to 1980. But a new story idea may forestall it. For a Joseph Heller-type comic novel about the once great industry’s meltdown under woke idiots with no clue about the screen art they inherited from virtue-signaling male fools. And how their diversity hiring, fantasy agenda, and contempt for their audience have collapsed the industry, especially this year. Of course, the argument against my writing this book is — they’d never make it into a movie.\n\nREAD MORE from Lou Aguilar:\n\nBardot and Other Screen Legends We Lost in 2025\n\nWhen the Churches Go Silent at Christmas\n\nHollywood Horror: The Murder of Rob Reiner","url":"https://spectator.org/heroes-and-zeroes-of-2025/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Erika__Charlie_Kirk_51327028199-e1767199404938.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 03:04:51","author":"Lou Aguilar","authors":["Lou Aguilar"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.153},{"id":390440948,"title":"Johnny Manziel sparks more College GameDay fury after cashing in on no-show with bizarre ad","text":"Johnny Manziel's recent no-show on ESPN's College GameDay has given way to a promotional opportunity for both the former Heisman winner and the prediction-market platform, Kalshi.\n\nEarlier in the month it was announced that the former Texas A&M quarterback would be appearing on the show as the guest picker back at his alma mater ahead of the Aggies' playoff game against the Miami Hurricanes in College Station on December 21.\n\nYet moments before he was scheduled to appear, College GameDay host Rece Davis mysteriously revealed that former Texas A&M basketball player and two-time NBA champion Alex Caruso would be stepping in instead.\n\nFans were left confounded Manziel's absence, given he had been in attendance at Kaseya Center in Miami for Jake Paul's controversial boxing showdown with Anthony Joshua just the night prior.\n\nSocial media erupted with an array of theories. Some thought Manziel's well-known problems with alcohol had resurfaced, while others thought the former Cleveland Browns first-round pick was feuding with ESPN or College GameDay co-host, Pat McAfee.\n\nManziel has since claimed he was battling an illness before, somewhat confusingly, using the incident to plug Kalshi, a prediction-market platform. \n\n'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE,' began the statement dated December 30 and posted on X the following day.\n\n'There's been plenty of speculation lately,' Manziel wrote. 'I'm good with ESPN. I'm good with McAfee.\n\n'If you want to keep guessing, you can now do it officially. Thanks to Kalshi, you can trade on whether I'll be back on College GameDay in 2026.\n\n'The market currently gives me a 34% chance of being back on set next season. If you think that number's low, take the other side.'\n\nFollowing Manziel's post, that figure spiked up over 50 percent. \n\nAs far as the Kalshi plug was concerned, Manziel's online followers weren't thrilled. \n\n'Get this dude a publicist for the love of god,' one critic wrote.\n\n'Good thing Kalshi didn't exist when you played,' another wrote. 'I would've lost my kid's college fund betting on your odds of winning rookie off the year.'\n\nAnother called Manziel's post 'the most Johnny Manziel thing I've ever read.'\n\nFor the uninitiated, Kalshi and its competitor Polymarket are increasingly popular alternatives to sportsbooks, which are far more regulated. \n\nThe emerging industry's trading platforms do work like online sportsbooks by offering futures contracts at prices and returns that fluctuate like betting odds (i.e. underdogs pay off better than favorites). Customers are given binary choices ('yes or no' or 'one or the other') on any number of positions, from gas prices to the next Pope and, of course, sports: Will the Knicks win this year's NBA title? etc.\n\nPlatforms like Kalshi and Polymarket made news during the 2024 US Presidential race by using customers' wagers to accurately forecast Donald Trump's electoral victory over Kamala Harris. Since then, the industry has faced cease-and-desist orders in several states as platforms have taken hundreds of millions of dollars in bets on everything from March Madness to the Masters.\n\nCrucially, these websites consider themselves to be 'exchanges' rather than 'sportsbooks.' As a result, they face fewer taxes and are more widely available because they're not being prohibited, or even regulated, by individual states. \n\nRather, prediction markets are under the federal jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) — something Nevada state senator Dina Titus sees as a 'backdoor way' to legalizing sports gambling without necessary safeguards.","summary":"Johnny Manziel's recent no-show on ESPN's College Game Day has given way to a promotional opportunity for both the former Heisman winner and the prediction-market platform, Kalshi.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/college-football/article-15426029/Johnny-Manziel-College-GameDay.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/01/00/105146275-0-image-a-12_1767227336270.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 01:55:55","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.084},{"id":390448442,"title":"Donald Trump cheers for George Clooney's new French citizenship: 'Wasn't a movie star at all'","text":"Donald Trump is celebrating what he refers to as some \"good news\" at the end of the year — George Clooney and wife Amal Clooney's recent naturalization as French citizens.\n\n The Jay Kelly star, his wife, and their 8-year-old twins have been granted French citizenship, according to government decrees issued over the weekend, and viewed by Entertainment Weekly on Tuesday.

It destroyed 6,833 structures and killed 12 people, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reported.\n\nThe Eaton Fire in the Altadena/Pasadena area destroyed 9,418 structures and killed 17 people, according to Cal Fire.\n\nAs the fires started, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) was part of a Biden administration delegation to the new Ghanaian president’s inauguration. Bass said she wasn’t aware of warnings before the fire started and suggested Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristen Crowley downplayed the risks. Bass later demoted Crowley and named interim and permanent fire chiefs.\n\nIn August, Crowley filed a legal claim against the city and Bass, claiming the mayor “launched a smear campaign built on falsehoods” because Crowley said the Bass’ budget cuts and the city’s years of neglect caused the fire department to be underfunded, understaffed and ill-equipped.\n\nIn October, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Jonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old Melbourne, Fla., resident, with starting the Palisades Fire. Rinderknecht was brought to Los Angeles and is awaiting a trial set for April 21. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMeanwhile, Southern California Edison, which many blamed for starting the Eaton Fire because of faulty equipment, has started a program to reimburse victims. Entities varying from the U.S. Department of Justice to the Pasadena Unified School District and the cities of Pasadena and Sierra Madre have sued Southern California Edison.\n\nFires weren’t the only turbulence. After the Trump administration cracked down on illegal immigration with arrests and raids, rioters took to the streets of downtown Los Angeles in June. In response, President Donald Trump deployed the California National Guard to protect federal buildings. \n\nBesides rioters, there were peaceful protesters, some of whom told The Center Square that they were avoiding any scenes of violence and simply wanted to get their message heard.\n\nIn July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested nearly 200 illegal immigrants during raids in marijuana fields in Southern California’s Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. ICE said more than 500 rioters attempted to disrupt the raids, but the United Farm Workers said several agricultural workers were critically injured, and one of them died from those injuries. \n\nIn Los Angeles, local officials and others accused ICE of detaining U.S. citizens and mistreating illegal immigrants during various operations. But Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin repeatedly told The Center Square that demonizing ICE was leading to a huge increase in assaults on agents. \n\nAs all this went on, California continued its growing number of lawsuits against the Trump administration on issues varying from immigration to food assistance. By the end of the year, California had filed 51 lawsuits. State Attorney General Rob Bonta joined or co-led a coalition of Democratic attorneys general in the suits.\n\nAgainst the news was the backdrop of the 2026 midterm election, the party in the White House historically loses control of at least one chamber of Congress. At Trump’s urging, the Texas Legislature redrew congressional districts to pick up five Republican seats in the House. The Democratic supermajority in the California Legislature and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom responded by putting Proposition 50 on the November general election ballot to redraw congressional districts to pick up five Democratic seats. Nearly 65% of California voters approved Proposition 50.\n\nPlaintiffs, including Assemblymember David Tangipa, a Fresno Republican on the Assembly Election Committee, and the U.S. Department of Justice, responded with a lawsuit accusing California of illegal racial gerrymandering. The defendants, who include Newsom, contend the gerrymandering was political-partisan, which is legal. A decision is expected soon from the U.S. District Court for Central California in Los Angeles. Tangipa told The Center Square he expects the suit to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of who wins in the lower courts.\n\nIn the realm of more normal politics, Democrats dropped in and out of a crowded field in the open 2026 gubernatorial race, in which a couple of Republicans are running. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat living in Los Angeles, decided against joining the race, raising speculation about her yet-to-be-announced plans, if any, for 2028.\n\nNewsom, who said he will consider a run for president in 2028, will be termed out. \n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidates vary from former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to Tom Steyer, the billionaire who financed the campaign to pass Prop. 50.\n\nIt was also a year for movie studio mergers. Skydance bought Paramount Studios in Hollywood, and Netflix was all set to purchase Warner Bros. in Burbank, but is being challenged by a hostile bid from the newly merged Paramount Skydance.\n\nIt takes three to tango.\n\nThat was according to state Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, then the chair of the Arizona Senate Appropriations Committee, about getting the state Senate and House to agree on a $17.6 billion budget that Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs would sign. Ultimately, the two Republican-controlled chambers agreed on a budget, and Hobbs signed it, just days before Arizona in June would have shut down its state government for the first time. Kavanagh went on to become the Senate’s majority leader.\n\n“By working together, we have secured pay raises for state police and firefighters, made child care more affordable and accessible, taken action to stop drug smuggling and human trafficking, and invested in public education from kindergarten through higher ed,” Hobbs said.\n\nThe year’s drama persisted with the Dragon Bravo Fire, one of Arizona’s largest blazes at 145,504 acres. It struck the Grand Canyon National Park’s Northern Rim.\n\nThe blaze started July 4 and was 100% contained by late September when the rim partially reopened. Seasonal closure started Nov. 14. The National Park Service said the Northern Rim is tentatively scheduled to reopen on May 15.\n\nDefense issues also dominated headlines in 2025. U.S. Rep. Abe Hamadeh (R-AZ) urged Secretary of War Pete Hegseth not to downgrade Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix.\n\nAlso in 2025, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) went to Ukraine to watch pilots training on U.S. jets and voice his support for NATO and Ukraine’s defense against Russia.\n\nKelly, though, found himself at odds with Trump and Hegseth when he participated, along with other lawmakers, in a video urging military members to disobey illegal orders from the Trump administration. Hegseth said Kelly, a retired Navy combat pilot, could be called back into service for a court-martial, but Kelly said he wouldn’t be silenced.\n\nThere were high-profile deaths this year in the Southwest. Among them was the Sept. 10 assassination of conservative leader Charlie Kirk when he spoke at a rally at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.\n\nKirk, who lived in Scottsdale, Arizona, was the founder and CEO of Phoenix-based Turning Point USA. His widow, Erika Kirk, stressed forgiveness during a memorial service at State Farm Stadium in Phoenix, where those speaking on Kirk’s behalf included Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Tyler James Robinson, 22, is in jail waiting to be tried on seven counts, six of which are felonies that include aggravated murder of Charlie Kirk. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said he will seek the death penalty if Robinson is convicted of murder. The next in-person hearing is set for Jan. 16 in Utah County’s Fourth Judicial Court in Provo.\n\nIn politics, Hobbs announced she would seek reelection in 2026. Trump, meanwhile, has endorsed two Republicans running for governor: Freedom Caucus member U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs and Karrin Taylor Robson, who lost the 2024 U.S. Senate primary to Republican Kari Lake. On Sept. 30, a third Republican announced he was running for governor: U.S. Rep. David Schweikert of Phoenix.\n\nThe $687 million gambling industry saw a decline in 2025 from 2024 on the Las Vegas Strip, along with a continued decrease in tourism. \n\nYou couldn’t bet this year on government websites always working. A cyberattack left the state’s executive branch without functioning websites in late August and early September.\n\nIn other news, the Democratic majority in the Legislature killed all of Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony’s bills in 2026. The reason, as reported exclusively by The Center Square, was because of Anthony’s stance on keeping boys out of girls’ sports, according to a source who worked for Anthony’s office. \n\nThe blocking of the legislation meant the end of the state Office of Small Business Advocacy. Business owners who felt they were hurt by that move talked to The Center Square. They said the office helped them to navigate the maze of government regulations.\n\nIn politics, Nevada’s 2026 gubernatorial race is neck-to-neck. An Emerson College poll this year shows Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo and the leading Democratic challenger, state Attorney General Aaron Ford, are tied at 41%. As the two sides campaigned, a former Clark County deputy district attorney, Bernard Zadrowski, talked to The Center Square about an ethics complaint he filed against Ford for allegedly using the Attorney General’s Office social media account on X to campaign.\n\nTRUMP WITHDRAWS NATIONAL GUARD FROM CHICAGO, LA, AND PORTLAND DESPITE ‘GREATLY REDUCED’ CRIME\n\nAnd in economic news, the Legislature failed to pass a tax incentives bill that would have resulted in a new movie studio in Las Vegas. Assembly Bill 5, also known as the Nevada Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training Act, passed in the Assembly but didn’t get enough votes in the Senate.\n\nThe bill would have brought California studios to Nevada. Warner Bros. Discovery, which operates the historic Burbank-based Warner Bros. movie studio, and Sony Pictures Entertainment, whose Culver City movie lot was once home to MGM classics, would invest in the Las Vegas studio. Another investor is the Howard Hughes Corp., a real estate company based in The Woodlands, Texas.","summary":"(The Center Square)&#160;– 2025 started in California with devastating wildfires, continued with immigration raids and riots protesting them, and ended with congressional redistricting.

George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Trump wrote.\n\n Also in his post, Trump addressed the July 2024 op-ed that George wrote for the New York Times, urging then-President Joe Biden to step aside and allow Vice President Kamala Harris to seek the Democratic nomination for the presidency following Biden's performance in a June 2024 presidential debate, which many viewed as disastrous.\n\n Trump continued, \"Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!), who is now fighting it out with the worst governor in the Country, including Tim Waltz, Gavin Newscum, for who is going to lead the Democrats to their future defeat.\"\n\n He also claimed that \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre movies.\"\n\n \"He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics,\" Trump wrote in conclusion. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\n Clooney's latest film, Jay Kelly, arrived in theaters and on Netflix in December and features the actor starring as the titular character, also a famous actor.\n\n In a recent interview with Variety, Clooney addressed CBS News' recent settlement with Trump. In July, the network agreed to pay $16 million to Trump's future presidential library to end a lawsuit in which Trump accused the network of deceptively editing former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign trail appearance on 60 Minutes.\n\n “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f--- yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney told the outlet. “That’s simply the truth.\"\n\n He also spoke about knowing Trump before his political career began, describing the president as a \"big goofball\" whom he \"knew very well.\"\n\n “I knew him very well,” Clooney says. “He used to call me a lot, and he tried to help me get into a hospital once to see a back surgeon. I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.”\n\n Clooney has long been a vocal critic of Trump. In 2021, the actor said that the Trump name would forever be relegated to the \"dustbin of history\" following the January 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n \"That name will now forever be associated with insurrection,\" Clooney said at the time.\n\n Amal has also been critical of Trump's treatment of the press, arguing in 2019 that the president's rhetoric makes \"honest journalists all over the world more vulnerable to abuse.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n George, Amal and their two children currently live in France, in part due to Clooney's concerns about \"raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\" The couple obtained French citizenship in December 2025, according to a naturalization decree obtained by the French newspaper Journal officiel and viewed by PEOPLE.\n\n “You know, we live on a farm in France. A good portion of my life growing up was on a farm, and as a kid, I hated the whole idea of it,\" George explained in an October interview with GQ. \"But now, for them, it’s like—they’re not on their iPads, you know?

Gavin Newsom next year, a handful of Democrats are positioning themselves to run for Bonta’s post in the event it opens up.\n\nTwo state lawmakers have both recently opened accounts to run for the seat in 2026 and confirmed their interest to The Sacramento Bee.\n\nAssemblymember Jesse Gabriel, D-Encino, raised more than $1 million for a potential attorney general bid in the month of December alone. Many of his donors maxed out with $9,800 donations for both the primary and the general election, the latter of which must be returned if a candidate does not advance beyond the primary.\n\nGabriel is a close ally of Speaker Robert Rivas and holds a powerful post as chair of the Assembly Budget Committee. Donors to his fledgling attorney general account include former Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg, Hollywood producer Marc Platt and more than a dozen of his Democratic Assembly colleagues.\n\n“There is immense momentum for his candidacy should Attorney General Bonta decide not to run for another term,” Gabriel spokesman Nathan Click said in a statement.\n\nIn his seven years in the Assembly, Gabriel has had several high-profile bills signed into law, including a hike on gun and ammo taxes to fund gun violence prevention and multiple bills to phase out synthetic dyes and other additives in food starting in 2027.\n\nState Sen. Dave Cortese, D-San Jose, also confirmed plans to launch a campaign for Bonta’s seat if the attorney general decides to pivot.\n\n“We’re ready to go,” he said, “the minute he announces, if not sooner.”\n\nCortese chairs the Senate Transportation Committee and was first elected to the body in 2020 after serving 12 years as a Santa Clara County supervisor. He’s “made a lot of phone calls” to potential supporters and would focus more on fundraising after formally launching a campaign.\n\nSan Francisco City Attorney David Chiu also plans to enter the race if Bonta moves on, a source close to him confirmed. Chiu, a Democrat, served nearly seven years in the Assembly before he was appointed to his current role in 2021.\n\nBonta weighs political future\n\nNewsom terms out of office in early 2027. Bonta last year considered running to replace him but told his supporters in February, soon after President Trump was sworn into a second term, that his role as AG is “without question one of the most impactful jobs in the country right now.”\n\nNow Bonta is reconsidering his future, noting recently that his two picks for governor — former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla — have declined to run.\n\nA spokesperson for Bonta did not respond to requests for comment about when the attorney general plans to make a decision. The deadline for candidates to file for election is March 6.\n\nWho might run — and who won’t\n\nAfter “strongly considering” a potential bid for attorney general, Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur, D-Los Angeles, announced this week he will focus on reelection to the seat he won in 2022.\n\n“Ultimately, I believe that there is so much more that we can and must do in the Legislature to lower costs and raise wages for working families,” Zbur said in a statement to supporters Monday.\n\nPolitical observers have also named top county prosecutors Brooke Jenkins of San Francisco and Nathan Hochman of Los Angeles as potential candidates. A Jenkins ally told Politico she is being encouraged to run if Bonta switches gears.\n\nAllies of Assemblymember Maggy Krell, D-Sacramento, are encouraging the freshman lawmaker to run. A former deputy attorney general, Krell has served under five AGs during her 15 years at the state Department of Justice. She also scored a major win during her freshman year when Democratic leadership attempted to water down her bill to crack down on sex solicitation of minors but relented after public pressure.\n\nThis story was originally published December 31, 2025 at 2:34 PM.","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article314088072.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/bjxqr2/picture311584309/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_2450_HA_250804_NewsomBonta.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 22:34:14","author":"Nicole Nixon","authors":["Nicole Nixon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":390423300,"title":"Tim Walz called to testify before Congress on Minnesota fraud scandal","text":"Republicans in Congress have invited Tim Walz, Minnesota's Democratic governor and Kamala Harris' former running mate in the 2024 presidential election, to testify before lawmakers over the fraud scandal that has rocked his state.\n\nRep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, scheduled a Feb. 10 hearing featuring the governor. The announcement came several days after influencer Nick Shirley posted a video on social media alleging fraud at multiple Minnesota child care centers.\n\nIn a statement, Comer accused Walz of being \"asleep at the wheel\" while, federal prosecutors say, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars were siphoned from a child nutrition program. The Justice Department has called it the \"largest COVID-19 fraud scheme in the country.\"\n\nAlleged fraud in Minnesota's social services programs has drawn increasing ire from the White House and congressional Republicans. On Dec. 30, the federal Department of Health and Human Services said it was pausing child care payments to the state amid the controversy.\n\nRead more: HHS freezes all childcare funding to Minnesota, citing 'blatant fraud'\n\nWalz, who has faced calls from the GOP to resign, criticized the Trump administration for politicizing what he called a \"serious issue\" and emphasized the president's own pardons of people convicted of fraud.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Walz's office said that although the governor is \"happy to work with Congress,\" the House Oversight Committee \"has a track record of holding circus hearings that have nothing to do with the issue at hand.\" His office did not confirm whether Walz had accepted the invitation to testify.\n\nAn initial hearing on the matter is scheduled for 9 a.m. on Jan. 7, according to the House Oversight Committee.

For whatever reason, they have concluded that the interests of their class or their bizarre moral code require that they put the power that determines what taxes they pay, who goes to jail, and who gets off scot free, and where literally trillions of dollars are spent into the hands of corrupt moral degenerates. \n\nAdam Schiff is a United States Senator.

How many people who watched that ABC This Week program and still went out to vote for Kamala Harris?\n\nEvery single Democrat. Bet on it. \n\nI keep insisting that many of those Democrats are good people who have tied themselves up in knots, convincing themselves that the alternative is the country sliding into fascism. They have done so for no other reason than that they believe it when the media tells them that this is so. Even though the media has proven itself to be little more than propaganda. \n\nThese people remind me of the babushkas who, decades after his crimes were exposed, insisted that Stalin was really a great guy. \n\nThe brainwashing is strong. \n\nMany of these people experience cognitive dissonance, which comes out when they say things like, \"I don't approve of violence, but...\" Or who will simultaneously express total support for free speech...except for speech they don't like. \n\nThey HAVE to know that they are supporting bad people and bad policies, so they tell themselves that the alternative is worse. \n\nI had a conversation flying back from Detroit with a nice person who explained that she wanted all the illegal immigrants gone, just not with deportations. \n\nA few years ago, when Biden had the border completely open, a friend of mine complained about housing prices; I brought up the 12 million new migrants, and he swore that supply and demand had absolutely nothing to do with it. He is one of the smartest people I know, and rejected the obvious explanation for ideological reasons. \n\n🚨Criminal Illegal Invader renters (using taxpayer-funded welfare) are driving the housing price surge.A new Housing and Urban Development analysis found that 67 percent of the increase in rental demand between 2022 and 2024 came from foreign-born residents, driving housing…— Tony Seruga (@TonySeruga) December 31, 2025\n\nAt some level they have to know they are supporting policies destroying the country, and in some cases they absolutely and consciously know they are supporting evil, but they have convinced themselves that their votes are the only thing stopping the country from descending into a hellscape of white supremacists murdering immigrants in the streets. \n\nIt's bizarre. \n\nI have some hope that the explosion in coverage of the massive welfare fraud will make an impact, but no hope at all that the impact will go beyond Independent voters who recoil in disgust. If Tim Walz were marched into jail along with half the Democratic governors in the country—which no doubt will not happen—Democrats would still march to the polls and vote for the next Democrat. \n\nRemember, they elected Jay Jones.","url":"https://hotair.com/david-strom/2025/12/31/despite-it-all-they-will-continue-to-vote-for-democrats-n3810378","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/293/a2064b6c-848b-4f2d-ae83-20eecdcd3ea1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 21:00:23","author":"David Strom","authors":["David Strom"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":390398266,"title":"A Happy MAGA New Year!

In recent years, the lists have included Cabinet officials and the occasional congressional ally like Sen. Ted Cruz, who attended in 2024.\n\nThis year’s event is likely to be attended also by a new generation of MAGA insiders, including many of the wealthy CEOs and socialites who make up the new Trump-aligned social circles in Washington D.C. Those insiders include the members of Donald Trump Jr.’s exclusive Georgetown club, the Executive Branch, which hosts notables like crypto guru David Sacks, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, and the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler. FBI Director Kash Patel, known for hitting the D.C. nightclub scene since taking the job, is also very likely to be there.\n\nOther MAGA influencers like James O’Keefe, Jack Posobiec and C.J. Pearson, host of the “Cruel Kids” Halloween party in Washington D.C. attended by a few White House staffers and many younger conservative staffers in the city, are likely to be in attendance tonight as well. Pearson attended several parties at the club over the past several days, according to his Instagram. Posobiec is due to host one in February.\n\nGuests could also be on the lookout for Laura Loomer, whose presence in the West Wing felt like that of a grim reaper in 2025 as her visits typically heralded efforts to purge “disloyal” members of the administration from the White House to smaller positions at various federal agencies. Loomer tweeted that she was at a Mar-a-Lago event on Tuesday evening.\n\nA former mainstay of the Mar-a-Lago scene who attended last year’s bash could make headlines simply by showing up tonight: Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO and former DOGE chief had a rough falling out with Donald Trump this year, accusing the president (correctly) at one point of being “in the Epstein files” and breaking with the GOP on the passage of the Republican budget reconciliation package this summer after his time in the White House came to a somewhat unceremonious end. Tales of his antics and alleged ketamine usage were widespread in the press and seemingly confirmed by chief of staff Susie Wiles in an 11-interview series that published in Vanity Fair this month.\n\nBut Musk was in attendance at the club as recently as November, making his appearance Wednesday evening a distinct possibility.\n\nThe president’s family including his newest soon-to-be daughter-in-law, Bettina Anderson, are likely to be in attendance. Anderson and the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., announced their engagement on December 15, which would make her the latest MAGAworld insider to marry their way into the Trump family after sister-in-law Lara Trump did the same.\n\nMar-a-Lago will mark an outpost of resistance for MAGAworld as the president’s political landscape crumbles in Washington, D.C. The House of Representatives is heading into 2026 with a very thin margin complicated further by the impending departure of Marjorie Taylor Greene on January 5 and, more broadly, a growing feeling of resentment shared by lawmakers of all stripes in the Republican House caucus.\n\n“More explosive early resignations are coming,” one unnamed senior House Republican told the outlet last month. “It’s a tinder box. Morale has never been lower.”\n\nThis week, Trump did nothing to help that dynamic as he vetoed a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by one of the Republicans who broke with him on the Jeffrey Epstein files resolution, Rep. Lauren Boebert. The congresswoman, who vowed “this isn’t over” on Tuesday after the veto, is just one of a number of members of the president’s own party increasingly dissatisfied with the White House’s total control over the lower chamber of Congress through Mike Johnson, the Speaker known for relying on the president as his own enforcer.\n\nHe also lashed out at a Republican district attorney in Colorado who recommended against ceding to Trump’s wishes and honoring a federal pardon for Tina Peters, a former county clerk who was convicted of crimes related to the 2020 election and efforts to investigate supposed fraud in the state’s voting systems.\n\n“I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell,” the president wrote in a Wednesday morning Truth Social blast.\n\nHis polling continues to suffer as Americans feel the brunt of persistently high prices on many grocery items and other consumer goods, which experts continue to blame on his “reciprocal” tariff agenda and persistent trade issues with China, which threatened to blow up the U.S. soybean market this year.\n\nA Gallup poll this month found Trump’s approval – at 36 percent – to be the lowest of any president at this point in their term in 50 years.\n\nThat problem could explode for Trump in just a few days. \n\nAs 2025 comes to a close Wednesday evening, federal subsidies for Obamacare plans on the Affordable Care Act’s public exchanges are due to expire, a deadline which is set to spike premiums for many health plans on the public exchanges. The issue is likely to affect millions of Americans who purchase health care off of the Affordable Care Act exchanges rather than see it provided through their jobs, some of whom experts told The Independent earlier this year will be priced out of health care altogether.\n\nAffordability remains a top issue for Americans of all political affiliations heading into 2026, the same as it was in 2024 when Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris attempted to win four more years in the White House. Republicans, now in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, are reportedly in deep fear of losing the House and possibly the Senate in 2026’s midterm election cycle, which is set to kick off in earnest in just a few weeks. Despite calls from the likes of Greene and moderates such as Sen. Susan Collins for their party to pass legislation addressing the impending premium spikes, the House and Senate left town unable to do so in December. \n\nThe challenge of passing a bill when Congress returns in a few days won’t be any easier.\n\nAlready Johnson and his counterpart in the Senate, John Thune, are both facing resignations from key Republicans who threaten to endanger their holds on either chamber this year. Some Republicans in hard-fought seats are still publicly undecided over running for re-election, causing further headaches. Those include Joni Ernst, whose Iowa seat could be the center of a massive battle as she will step down in 2026.\n\nOne House Republican described as a “senior” member of the caucus by Punchbowl’s Jake Sherman excoriated the White House in a text to the outlet shortly after the Thanksgiving holiday in November.\n\n“This entire White House team has treated ALL members like garbage. ALL. And Mike Johnson has let it happen because he wanted it to happen. That is the sentiment of nearly all — appropriators, authorizers, hawks, doves, rank and file,” they wrote.\n\nTrump may enter 2026 surrounded by his family and most fawning supporters, but his return to D.C. will mark a return to the cold reality of the unique challenges Republicans have set themselves up for in the new year, and the rough waters that appear to be coming up ahead.","summary":"President and MAGA influencers will gather for joyous bash as Republican power splinters and recedes in Washington","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-mar-a-lago-florida-nye-party-b2892884.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/31/18/48/President-Donald-Trump-arrives-to-greet-Ukraines-President-Volodymyr-Zelenskyy-at-his-Mar-a-Lago-clu.jpeg?crop=2550,1700,x0,y814.9&trim=814,0,674,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TzTsQUDW-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-31 20:30:46","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.462},{"id":390422706,"title":"Dem's stunning upset in red state should have Trump 'very worried': analyst","text":"Republicans got another flashing warning sign on Tuesday night as Democrats notched another stunning electoral upset in a red state amid plummeting approval ratings for President Donald Trump.\n\nRenee Hardman scored a massive 71.5 percent of the vote in the race for Iowa state Senate — a jaw-dropping 27 points higher than former Vice President Kamala Harris managed statewide just a year ago.

I'd see him out at clubs and at restaurants.\"\n\n\"(Trump's) a big goofball,\" the Oscar winner added. \"Well, he was. That all changed.\"\n\nWhile the friendship between Clooney and Trump may have changed, the actor's blunt political takes have not.Clooney Rips Networks 'Bowing' to TrumpDuring the same interview, the O' Brother Where Art Thou star slammed networks that seemingly bent the knee to Trump by settling multimillion-dollar lawsuits he filed against them.\n\nTrump reached a $16million settlement with CBS' parent company, Paramount, in July after he sued the network over what he alleged was \"deceptive\" editing in a 60 Minutes interview with then-Democratic nominee Harris. \n\nThe president also sued ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for defamation, claiming the anchor falsely stated he was found liable for rape in E. Jean Carroll's civil lawsuit case, in which a jury found the president liable for sexual abuse. The network agreed to settle with Trump in December 2024 for $15million, which was said to go toward his future presidential library, as well as agreeing to pay one million in legal fees.\"If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, 'Go f--- yourself,' we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,\" Clooney said. \"That's simply the truth.\"\n\nClooney went on to air his frustrations and concerns over Paramount's new owner, David Ellison, the son of Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, both of whom Trump has praised to the press. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the $8billion merger of David's Skydance Media with Paramount in August. \n\nWithin two months of David taking over as Chairman and CEO of Paramount, he overhauled CBS News and tapped conservative Bari Weiss to serve as Editor-in-Chief.Clooney didn't hold back when discussing the changes Trump-aligned Paramount has made at CBS News. \n\n\"Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak,\" the Ocean's Eleven star said. \"I'm worried about how we inform ourselves and how we're going to discern reality without a functioning press.\" \n\nThe movie star then recalled a line from his film and play, Good Night, and Good Luck, saying, \"'Let’s not confuse dissent with disloyalty.'\"\n\n\"I mean, what a beautiful, important statement about who we are at our best.

Stephen A. Smith recorded an unplanned podcast late Friday evening, addressing Jason Whitlock, whom he called the \"devil in the flesh.\" Smith said that although he had promised never to mention Whitlock's name again, he felt compelled to respond to comments Whitlock made about his father on Sage Steele's podcast last week. \"Do a deep dive on Stephen A’s book and the way he went after his father in his book, as opposed to what he used to say about his father in interviews,\" Whitlock said when Steele asked him about the inconsistencies he found in Smith's 2023 memoir. \"You can go look up, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, what Stephen A said about his father — no criticism at all, mostly praise. Certainly no criticism,\" Whitlock continued. \"And then he comes out with this book where he basically says he had an absentee father, that he can’t stand his father, and that it’s all about his mother. That’s trying to put Stephen A in the feminist lane, in the ‘support of the matriarchy’ lane … he had a completely different narrative about his dad than he does now.\" Appearing in a split screen with his business partner Kevin Frazier and nephew Josh, Smith insisted he \"never spoke negatively\" about his father because his \"mother asked [him] not to.\" \"My mother’s exact words to me were, ‘Do it when I’m dead and gone. Don’t do it when I’m alive and I have to live with the words that you have to say about your father,’\" Smith said, quoting his late mother. \"What I did in speaking about my father was talk about what he did and the effect that it had on our family. I never said that I didn’t love him. I never said that I hated him. I never said any of those things. What I said was that I resented the impact that it had on our family and on my mother. But I never spoke about it because my mother always asked me to be quiet until she was dead and gone.\" In other words, Smith admitted that the version of his father’s story he tells now isn’t the one he told early in his career. So why the emergency 45-minute rebuttal? Because, as OutKick has long noted, Smith reflexively launches into emotional, rambling monologues whenever he’s under attack. His first instinct is to overcompensate or deflect attention elsewhere. Last month, Smith faced backlash from what he called the \"black community\" after questioning whether Rep. Jasmine Crockett was more interested in viral media attention than in representing her constituents. While initially claiming he wouldn’t \"back down,\" we predicted he would quickly cave. Since that prediction, Smith has: – Apologized to Crockett, calling her a \"sister.\"– Apologized to Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama for reasons unknown.– Appeared on CNN with Laura Coates, challenging anyone who thinks he’s conservative to listen to his liberal views.– Backtracked on his previous support for Trump deploying the National Guard.– Challenged LeBron James to be more supportive of black journalists.– Blamed Trump for the NBA gambling investigation, despite it predating Trump.– Suggested the Miami Dolphins unfairly fired general manager Chris Grier because he's black. It’s reminiscent of last year, when Smith cited a poll during a Fox News appearance about black male support for Trump. After the usual outrage, he launched another week-long apology tour, praising Michelle Obama and accusing white people of racism. When reached by OutKick earlier this month, Smith said he didn’t like, agree with, or respect my coverage. Unfortunately, he didn't offer specifics. After he cooled down, I left an open invitation for him to address anything I had written about him in any media format he chose. We hope he eventually agrees to a discussion. The core issue for Stephen A. Smith is that he’s trying to play too many roles at once, trying to satisfy too many different power players. At ESPN, he must placate his Disney bosses, \"the black community,\" WME, and NBA athletes. Elsewhere, he needs to continue convincing his touring partners, Chris Cuomo and Bill O’Reilly, that he’s the anti-woke centrist between their political extremes. On right-wing talk radio, Smith plays the disillusioned Democrat who's coming around on Trump. On CNN, he fans the flames about the GOP's supposed lack of respect for democracy. All the while, he understands he cannot draw the ire of the Democratic leaders, in the event he launches a campaign in 2028. Now, add the NFL to the list of groups he must appease. The NFL is in the process of acquiring a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Smith is also now a contributor to Monday Night Football, which he touted as part of his new $100 million contract. He’s well aware of how much influence the leagues have over pregame programming. As the story goes, the NBA had previously blocked ESPN from allowing Smith to appear during the Finals. Commissioner Roger Goodell, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and Patriots owner Robert Kraft are the three most powerful figures in the NFL. Smith has already cozied up to Jones, recently sitting with him in a suite during a Cowboys game. But his recent comments likely didn’t sit well with Kraft or Goodell. Last week, Smith hosted First Take from Bethune–Cookman, a private HBCU, alongside Ryan Clark and Cam Newton. Playing to the crowd, he called white Patriots quarterback Drake Maye a \"liar\" for claiming he didn’t know Newton was on First Take. \"[Drake Maye] is a liar… First Take is the number one morning show… don’t tell me you’re an athlete and you don’t know that. Don’t tell me you’re an athlete and you don’t know that Cam Newton is on this show. You lying,\" Smith said. The outburst was popular on set but not elsewhere. Even media watchdogs criticized him for belittling the 23-year-old quarterback simply for not watching his show. \"Self-manufactured Drake Maye feud shows the biggest flaw of First Take,\" Awful Announcing wrote. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy demanded an apology: \"You call the MVP of the league a liar? Well, you owe us. Me, Drake Maye, the Krafts, all Patriots fans, an apology.\" And that’s where Jason Whitlock comes in. There’s one tried-and-true way to get back into the good graces of the sports media establishment. And that's to shift the negative attention back toward Whitlock, Clay Travis, or me. Take the former, bitter sportswriter who now pens a weekly Substack column to convince the cool kids he's on the right side of the culture war. His most-read story is a factually challenged hit piece about me. His fifth most-read is another hit piece, one about Jason Whitlock. It’s not hard to see why. Mina Kimes and Jemele Hill loved the stories and shared them with the audiences the author wants to impress. Likewise, Smith successfully deflected the attention away from his juvenile remarks about Maye by inserting Whitlock into the discussion. The same blogs criticizing Smith early last week now credit him for \"destroy[ing]\" Whitlock by calling him fat and a \"walrus.\" Just like that, Smith is the good guy again. Whitlock is the boogeyman. It’s a familiar play. Two years ago, Smith faced widespread criticism after Terrell Owens and Marcellus Wiley called out his poor treatment of his former white co-host, Max Kellerman, whom Owens previously declared \"blacker\" than Smith. In response, Smith posted a profanity-laced rant in which he branded Whitlock \"worse than a white supremacist.\" The cool kids of sports media loved Smith's attack. Now you see why Smith suddenly accused LeBron James of favoring white reporters after a BLM leader accused Smith of favoring white members of Congress. Or why he called me a \"liar\" on New York radio in 2021 after my report about his control over First Take, which he later confirmed and bragged about. Deflection is his only defense. Amusingly, Smith says he wrote his memoir to reveal the \"real Stephen A.\" But the real Stephen A. is the one we see – someone who is willing to play any role for fame and fortune, quick to conjure a boogeyman when he needs to redirect blame. That’s why he broke his own rule and said Whitlock’s name again last week.","summary":"Here&apos;s the truth about Stephen A.
