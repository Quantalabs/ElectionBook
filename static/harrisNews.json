At the time, White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor said it was basal cell carcinoma, but it did not require further treatment.\n\nIn 2021, he underwent a colonoscopy to remove a \"benign, slow-growing but thought to be precancerous lesion\" from his colon.Biden Penned an Emotional Statement After Revealing His Cancer DiagnosisFollowing the announcement of his cancer diagnosis, the former commander-in-chief took to Instagram to share a photo alongside his wife, former First Lady Jill Biden.\n\n\"Cancer touches us all.

Jill also had another basal cell carcinoma on the left side of her chest removed during the procedure.Kamala Harris, Barack Obama and More Reacted to Biden's Cancer DiagnosisAmid Joe's health crisis, Kamala Harris said she and her husband, Doug Emhoff, were \"saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis.\"\n\n\"We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time,\" the former vice president added. \"Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.\"\n\nDoug also shared a separate post to express support and send \"love and strength\" to Joe.\n\nMeanwhile, Barack took to X to share he and his wife, Michelle Obama, are \"thinking of the entire Biden family.\"\n\n\"Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace.

Historically, it was used sparingly—only when a case had a strong chance of succeeding and there was clear irreparable harm in letting a lower court ruling stand.\n\nBut today’s shadow docket is something else entirely. It’s become just another weapon in the conservative Supreme Court’s arsenal to tilt the scales in the GOP’s favor—especially for President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly benefited from this judicial shortcut in both of his terms. But President Joe Biden wasn’t so lucky.\n\nNow liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has had enough, openly calling out her conservative colleagues for abandoning even the pretense of restraint and turning the Supreme Court into a partisan cudgel. \n\nAs Millhiser writes:\n\nMaybe there is a nonpartisan explanation for why the Court treated Biden differently than Trump… But, if such an explanation exists, the Republican justices did not explain what it is… They’ve chosen to sit silently while Jackson levies some very serious charges against them — all while presenting evidence that strongly suggests her colleagues are rooting their shadow docket decisions in partisanship and not the law.\n\nLet’s be blunt: When a 6-3 conservative majority still feels compelled to rig the rules for Trump, that’s not jurisprudence; it’s corruption. This isn’t about ideology. It’s about raw, unaccountable power cloaked in judicial robes.\n\nAnd it’s not new. The rot goes back at least to Bush v. Gore, when the conservative justices handed George W. Bush the presidency, even though he lost both the popular vote and, frankly, Florida. That ruling was so nakedly partisan that the majority actually wrote that it shouldn’t be used as precedent. They knew how full of shit it was.\n\nBut let’s put a pin in the Supreme Court issue for a moment and pivot to this Politico story about a recent conference hosted by “centrist” Democrats, which was framed as a counterweight to the party’s left wing. Their thesis? Progressives are why Democrats lose elections.\n\nNow, anyone who’s followed me for the last 23 years knows I’m a pragmatist. I back progressive candidates when they help us win, and I criticize left-wing rigidity when it loses us elections. But let’s be real: The biggest disadvantage progressives face isn’t policy; it’s the media ecosystem. \n\nThe right has one. We don’t.\n\nRight-wing billionaires built Fox News, talk radio, and Facebook propaganda farms. Progressives? We waste hundreds of millions of dollars on TV ads that no one remembers and invest pennies in media that can actually shape public opinion.\n\nJust look at 2024. Kamala Harris and her outside allies raised more than $1.1 billion, while Trump and his outside allies raised just over $600 million. Democrats also outraised Republicans in Senate and House races but still lost. Why? Because TV ads don’t stand a chance against the right-wing noise machine.\n\nSo, yeah, if you’re reading this, please consider redirecting your political donations away from TV ads and into media infrastructure—like Daily Kos and your other favorite progressive outlets. That’s how we change minds. That’s how we win.\n\nIf focusing on what voters care about is the centrists’ message, I’m not arguing. If Democrats want to get together to figure out how to win over voters in next year’s brutal battleground states—Nebraska, Iowa, Florida, and Texas—then great. If the economy is what voters care about—and they do—then let’s talk about the economy, and only the economy, until the day after the election. \n\nIf that’s called “centrism,” fine. I don’t care. I just want to win.\n\nAnd if that sidelines some groups who haven’t done much to help Democrats win power? Also fine. \n\nPolitico quotes Justice Democrats as the progressive foil to centrists, but come on. This is the group that excommunicated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. That’s not a serious organization; it’s a purity cult. And it’s a shame, because their anti-billionaire message is great. But if AOC isn’t pure enough for them, then … good luck.\n\nThe problem isn’t centrism. The problem is people who hide behind centrism to avoid doing what’s right.\n\nWhich brings me back to the Supreme Court. The New York Times reported that at that same centrist conference, organizers were handing out buttons pushing a campaign to keep the Supreme Court at nine justices.\n\nPushing to lock in nine justices—after Republicans stole two seats—isn’t just absurd, it’s strategically suicidal. It’s also weird for a group that claims that we need to focus on the issues that voters actually care about to make this a talking point. \n\nThe average voter isn’t concerned about the Supreme Court headcount. No average voter gives a damn about court packing. They didn’t care when Republicans rigged the court, and they don’t care about the shadow docket.\n\nThey care about groceries, rent, wages, and whether they can afford to live.\n\nBut here’s the thing: just because voters aren’t talking about the Supreme Court doesn’t mean that Democrats should ignore it. If we retake the White House and both chambers of Congress, we should expand the court immediately. The Constitution gives us that power. \n\nBecause this isn’t an ideological court. If it were, there’d be a stronger case for leaving it alone. Rather, this is a partisan court. It rewrites precedent depending on who’s in the White House. It changes the rules to help Republicans and punish Democrats. That’s not justice. That’s rot.\n\nAny Democrat arguing to preserve this illegitimate 6-3 conservative majority is arguing for one thing: permanent conservative rule.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that we explicitly run on court expansion, but it sure as hell means that, if we ever get the power, we fix this broken institution. \n\nWhether you’re a proud progressive or a data-driven centrist, if you actually believe in democracy, the current Supreme Court cannot stand.","summary":"Ian Millhiser, senior correspondent at Vox, recently dropped a must-read on one of the most galling features of today’s Supreme Court: the shadow docket. \n\n\n\nIt’s the legal equivalent of fast-tracking a decision without the usual hearings, written opinions, or transparency.

Alex Padilla is forcefully removed from Kristi Noem’s news conference on immigration raids and handcuffed","text":"By KRYSTA FAURIA, MICHAEL R. BLOOD and LISA MASCARO\n\nLOS ANGELES — Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla on Thursday was forcefully removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference in Los Angeles and handcuffed by officers as he tried to speak up about immigration raids that have led to protests in California and around the country.\n\nVideo shows a Secret Service agent on Noem’s security detail grabbing the California senator by his jacket and shoving him from the room as he tried to speak up during the DHS secretary’s event. Padilla interrupted the news conference after Noem delivered a particularly pointed line, saying federal authorities were not going away but planned to stay and increase operations to “liberate” the city from its “socialist” leadership.\n\n“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” he shouted in a halting voice.\n\nScuffling with officers outside the room, he can be heard bellowing, “Hands off!” He is later seen on his knees and then pushed to the ground and handcuffed in a hallway, with several officers atop him.\n\nThe shocking scene of a U.S. senator being aggressively removed from a Cabinet secretary’s news conference prompted immediate outrage from his Democratic colleagues. Images and video of the scuffle ricocheted through the halls of Congress, where stunned Democrats demanded an immediate investigation and characterized the episode as another in a line of mounting threats to democracy by President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said what he saw “sickened my stomach.”\n\n“We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,” the New York senator said from the Senate floor. “It’s despicable, it’s disgusting, it’s so un-American.”\n\nIn a statement, DHS said that Padilla “chose disrespectful political theater” and that Secret Service “thought he was an attacker.” The statement claimed erroneously that Padilla did not identify himself — he did, as he was being pushed from the room.\n\n“Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,” the statement said, adding that “officers acted appropriately.”\n\nThe fracas in Los Angeles came just days after Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted on federal charges alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers outside a detention center in New Jersey while Newark’s mayor was being arrested after he tried to join a congressional oversight visit at the facility. Democrats have framed the charges as intimidation efforts by the Trump administration.\n\nIt also follows days of rising tension between Trump and Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom over the federal military intervention in California. In a speech earlier this week, the governor warned that “democracy is under assault before our eyes.”\n\nEmerging afterward, Padilla said he was removed while demanding answers about the Trump administration’s “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions.” He said he and his colleagues had received little to no response to their questions in recent weeks, so he attended the briefing for more information.\n\n“If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question … I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers throughout the Los Angeles community, and throughout California and throughout the country,” he said.\n\nNoem told Fox LA afterward that she had a “great” conversation with Padilla after the scuffle, but called his approach “something that I don’t think was appropriate at all.”\n\nThe White House accused Padilla of grandstanding.\n\n“Padilla didn’t want answers; he wanted attention,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “It’s telling that Democrats are more riled up about Padilla than they are about the violent riots and assaults on law enforcement in LA.”\n\nPadilla, the son of immigrants from Mexico, has been a harsh Trump critic and his mass deportations agenda. In a social media post, he said of recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, “Trump isn’t targeting criminals in his mass deportation agenda, he is terrorizing communities, breaking apart families and putting American citizens in harm’s way.”\n\nPadilla in 2021 became the state’s first Latino U.S. senator when he was selected by Newsom to fill Kamala Harris’ Senate seat after she was elected vice president. At the time, Padilla was the state’s chief elections officer.\n\nHarris wrote in a social media post Thursday that Padilla “was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this administration’s actions in Southern California.” She called his forceful removal “a shameful and stunning abuse of power.”\n\nDemocratic senators quickly gathered in the chamber, denouncing the treatment of their colleague — a well-liked and respected senator — and urged Americans to understand what was happening.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Trump is making this country “look more and more like a fascist state.”\n\n“Will any Republican senator speak up for our democracy?” Warren pleaded.\n\nSen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., called on Noem to resign, saying that there was no justification for Padilla’s treatment and that the Trump administration needed to be held accountable.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., accused Padilla of “charging” Noem and indicated that the behavior “rises to the level of a censure.”\n\n“My view is it was wildly inappropriate,” Johnson, a Trump ally, told reporters outside the House chamber as Democrats walking past shouted over him, “That’s a lie!”\n\n“A sitting member of Congress should not act like that,” Johnson said, loudly speaking over reporters’ questions. “It’s beneath a member of Congress.

I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla shouts, as he struggles to move past against the men pushing him back toward the exit.\n\n“Hands off!” Padilla says at least three times. Outside the room, he is pinned to the floor and placed in handcuffs.\n\nRelated: ‘Snatching off the streets’: Ice targets churches, car washes and workplaces \n\nEmerging afterward, Padilla, the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on immigration, citizenship and border safety, said he and his colleagues had repeatedly asked DHS for more information on its “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions” but had not received a response to his inquiries.\n\n“If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the DHS responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they’re doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers, throughout the LA community and throughout California and throughout the country,” Padilla, the son of immigrants from Mexico, told reporters. “We will hold this administration accountable.”\n\nThe extraordinary scene stunned his Democratic colleagues from Capitol Hill to California, though his actions drew criticism from Republicans, including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who called for Padilla’s censure. It comes amid escalating tensions between California and the federal government, after Donald Trump deployed national guard troops and US Marines to LA to quell protests prompted by immigration raids, over the objections of the state’s governor and the city’s mayor.\n\n“I am shocked by how far we have descended in the first 140 days of this administration,” Adam Schiff, the junior senator from California said in a speech from the Senate floor shortly after viewing the video of the incident. “What is becoming of our democracy? Are there no limits to what this administration will do? Is there no line they will not cross?”\n\nIn a statement, the DHS said the senator “chose disrespectful political theatre” and disrupted a live news conference. They falsely claimed that Padilla had failed to identify himself and believed he was an attacker when he “lunged toward” Noem as she delivered remarks.\n\n“Mr Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,” the department said in a statement posted on X, adding that officers responded and “acted appropriately”.\n\nThe deputy FBI director Dan Bongino accused Padilla of “not wearing a security pin” and said he “physically resisted law enforcement when confronted”.\n\n“Our FBI personnel acted completely appropriately while assisting Secret Service and we are grateful for their professionalism and service,” Bongino added.\n\nNoem was in Los Angeles to accompany federal agents on immigration operations in the area.\n\nNoem said Padilla’s approach “wasn’t appropriate” and that she wished he had reached out to her office before interrupting the event. Following the incident, she and the senator met for 15 minutes, according to DHS. Noem told reporters that they had a “great” and “productive” conversation and exchanged phone numbers.\n\nDemocratic officials said they were stunned by what the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, described as the “manhandling” of a sitting US senator.\n\nThe California governor, Gavin Newsom, called Padilla “one of the most decent people I know”, before adding: “This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now.”\n\nIn 2021, Padilla became California’s first Latino senator when he filled Kamala Harris’ seat after she was elected Joe Biden’s vice-president. Harris weighed in on his removal from the press conference, calling the incident “a shameful and stunning abuse of power”.\n\n“Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration’s actions in Southern California,” she wrote on X.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, wrote on X that “watching this video sickened my stomach, the manhandling of a United States Senator, Senator Padilla. We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.”\n\nJimmy Gomez, a California representative, wrote on X : “This isn’t just shocking, it’s a threat to the rule of law and democratic accountability. Sen Padilla is conducting oversight over the lawlessness of the Trump and the violations of the #RuleOfLaw. If this can happen to immigrant communities, it can happen to anyone.”\n\nNorma Torres, a California representative, lambasted the treatment of Padilla in an impassioned video, writing: “Senator Alex Padilla was dragged and handcuffed out for daring to question Secretary Noem. This wasn’t a threat – it was dissent. They’re not keeping us safe – they’re silencing us.”\n\nThe clash with Padilla comes just days after the Democratic representative LaMonica McIver of New Jersey was indicted on federal charges alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers after a clash with law enforcement at a May protest outside a detention facility in Newark. Democrats have cast the charges as a politically motivated attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate the opposition.\n\nAs he exited the floor of the House of Representatives, Johnson said the senator had been at fault, accusing him of “charging a cabinet secretary at a press conference” and calling his actions “wildly inappropriate”.\n\n“A sitting member of Congress should not act like that,” he said. “It is beneath a member of the Congress, it is beneath a US senator.”\n\nJohnson said he believes Padilla’s behavior “merits immediate attention” by Congress and “at a minimum, it rises to the level of a censure” by the Senate.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/senator-alex-padilla-forcibly-removed-184525806.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/4d8b00871819cd2a8da0f10b3f8df2a3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-12 23:30:40","author":"Jenna Amatulli, Lauren Gambino In Los Angeles, And Chris Stein In Washington","authors":["Jenna Amatulli, Lauren Gambino In Los Angeles, And Chris Stein In Washington"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":330850046,"title":"Sen Alex Padilla dragged out of Noem immigration briefing in LA","text":"California's Governor Gavin Newsom called on Republican congressional leadership to condemn the detaining of Padilla. \n\n\"If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you,\" Newsom wrote on social media.\n\nBut the White House accused the California senator of storming the press conference, and said he \"yelled and lunged toward Secretary Noem\". \n\n\"Padilla didn't want answers; he wanted attention,\" Abigail Jackson, White House spokesperson said. \"Padilla embarrassed himself and his constituents with this immature, theater-kid stunt – but it's telling that Democrats are more riled up about Padilla than they are about the violent riots and assaults on law enforcement in LA.\"\n\nFormer vice-president and Trump opponent, Kamala Harris also criticised the move and said the California senator was trying to get answers for his constituents about the ongoing immigration raids in the state. \n\n\"United States Senator Alex Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration's actions in Southern California,\" she said on Twitter. \"This is a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygn48djrko","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ef37/live/e89f1130-47ca-11f0-84b6-6bf0f66205f1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-12 23:19:35","author":"Ali Abbas Ahmadi & Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu","authors":["Ali Abbas Ahmadi & Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":330855458,"title":"US senator dragged out of LA immigration news conference","text":"Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla has been forcibly removed from a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles.\n\nNoem was offering the latest figures on immigration enforcement in the area, which has led to nearly a week of protests in the city, to members of the news media when Sen Padilla interrupted and started shouting a question.\n\nOnce removed from the room, the California senator was handcuffed.\n\nPadilla's removal caused condemnation on both sides of the aisle, with fellow senators calling the arrest shocking and a \"sickening disgrace\" and the Trump administration dubbing it \"disrespectful political theatre\".\n\n\"I'm Senator Alex Padilla,\" he said as he was confronted by authorities. \"I have questions for the secretary!\"\n\nNoem, who was speaking about immigration and the protests in LA, continued addressing reporters and law enforcement officers while the senator was ejected from the room.\n\nPadilla's office said he was \"forced to the ground and handcuffed\" by federal agents when trying to ask the secretary a question, and added that he was not currently being detained.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Padilla had engaged in \"disrespectful political theatre\" and that Noem met with the senator after the news briefing.\n\nLA Mayor Karen Bass called the incident \"absolutely abhorrent and outrageous\", adding that the Trump administration's \"violent attacks on our city must end\".\n\nPadilla told reporters that he was already in the federal building for a previously scheduled meeting.

Noem was describing what she called the \"burdensome leadership\" of California's governor and the mayor of Los Angeles, when Padilla interrupted and attempted to ask a question before being pushed from the room. He could be heard yelling, \"I'm Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,\" as he was escorted out of the room.Before the interruption, Noem was discussing increasing immigration operations in the area and claimed that Homeland Security agents were staying to \"liberate the city socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country.\" She was asked by a reporter about the incident, and clarified that she does not know the senator and that he did not request a meeting with her.\"When I leave here, I'll have a conversation with him and find out really what his concerns were,\" Noem said. \"I think everyone in America would agree that wasn't appropriate.\" Padilla addressed the situation outside the Wilshire Federal Building in Westwood, appearing to get emotional at times. He told reporters he was in the federal building waiting for a scheduled briefing with federal officials and General Guillot when he went to listen to Noem's speech. He explained that he was trying to get information about DHS's immigration enforcement actions around the L.A. area and the state. After being forcibly removed from the room, Padilla said he was forced to the ground, handcuffed, but was not detained or arrested.\"If this how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question you can only imagine what they're doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country,\" he said.He encouraged people to continue to protest peacefully and not allow the Trump administration to intimidate them. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, posted on X that the Secret Service thought Padila was an \"attacker\" and added that officers acted appropriately. Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino wrote on X that Padilla was not wearing a security pin at the time of the incident and \"physically resisted law enforcement.\" Padilla, who is from Pacoima, has previously served as president of the L.A.

County Supervisor Janice Hahn also released a statement condemning the handling of the situation, calling out the Trump administration for \"abusing their power.\"\"They are using force on immigrants in our neighborhoods, their family members, and now on a sitting Senator. Senator Padilla wasn't interfering with one of their operations. This was at a staged press conference in front of the cameras -- all for show,\" she said.Secretary Noem's trip to Los AngelesNoem's visit comes almost a week after demonstrations in L.A. turned into violent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement officers. The attacks led to President Trump deploying National Guard and U.S. Marine troops to the area, which local leaders have criticized as the reason for the escalation.Noem has supported Mr. Trump's decision to federalize troops, saying they are meant to help \"keep peace\" and \"law and order.\" She has also said that anyone involved in harming law enforcement officers will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.","summary":"California Sen.

America Isn’t Buying.","text":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. I was looking at the polls today. Given all the negative views of President Donald Trump on the economy, he still has a 17-point lead over the Democrats when the public is asked, “Who do you have greater confidence in, Donald Trump or the Democrats, to manage the economy?”\n\nWe’re getting a lot of bias reporting on the riots in Los Angeles. The governor of California here, Gavin Newsom, and the mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, have come down decidedly on the side of the violent protesters against the federal government trying to enforce federal immigration law.\n\nAnd yet with all of that bias and prejudicial news reporting, 54% of the American people favored deportation. Not just apprehension. Deportation.\n\nAnd then when we look at the transgender issue, that’s been in the news because there was a baseball game in Minnesota where a boy—a biological male, transgendered female, if you will—dominated sports and kept pitching inning after inning to ensure their victory. \n\nWe had one here in Clovis, California, the same type of situation where a biological male dominated the sporting event, taking the awards away from his female competitors. Same thing in Northern United States in Washington.\n\nSo, what I’m getting at is that the criticism of Donald Trump is not resonating with the people. On all those issues he polls favorably. And why is that? I think it’s a disconnect. \n\nI talked about The Wall Street Journal in the past, they seem disconnected from reality after they told us we would now be in a recession, the stock market would be in the proverbial toilet, it would not recover, there would be high inflation and high—that didn’t happen. We just looked at the news. Inflation: down. Job growth: good. Unemployment: steadily low. Personal savings and real wages: up. Record profits for the Standard and Poor index.\n\nAnd yet, when you look at The Wall Street Journal, they’ve learned nothing and forgotten nothing. Most of their stories today—and I’m speaking over the weekend and early part of next week—what are they talking about? They’re talking about a recession coming and people are jittery. But their own news stories do not validate their headlines.\n\nSo, the same thing is true of the transgender. People think that’s a popular issue. That is a losing issue. Donald Trump is on the right side—70% to 30% of the American people—just as he is on the economy. They believe that if you have fair and not just free trade, it’s in our interest. They believe that if you cut federal spending, it’s in our interest. \n\nThey believe, in the case of the Los Angeles riots, they do not want another May, June, July, August, September 2020. They do not want their officials, like former Vice President Kamala Harris, saying, ”These riots are not—these demonstrations are not gonna end. They’re gonna go on to election.” They don’t want that. They do not want a Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s wife saying that she opened up the window so she could smell the burning from the rioting. They don’t want that. \n\nSo, he nationalized the guard. And when Gavin Newsom, the governor of our state, sides with the protesters, and the mayor, Karen Bass, sides with the protesters who are now violent, we say to them: \n\nIs there something about fire you like? You didn’t do anything about the fires in Pacific Palisades. You had policies that discouraged conservation of the hillsides and reasonable trimming and clearing up bushes and shrubs. Didn’t you learn from that, Mayor Bass? You were in Ghana of all places. Didn’t you learn from that? So, why would you and Newsom attack the federal government for trying to enforce a federal law and then using federal troops to restore order so we don’t have a 2020-like riot? And what credibility do you have when you are saying ‘reckless’ and ‘chaotic,’ the government. What’s reckless and chaotic is right before our eyes. People burning and looting. \n\nSo, what am I talking about? I’m talking about the Left’s insane opposition to anything Donald Trump does when the evidence is clear that the economy is doing well, that most people want deportations and an orderly immigration process and favor deportation to people who broke the law, and that they don’t want biological males in female sports. \n\nAnd yet, the Left doesn’t see that. And so, they just hammer away on unpopular issues. And they wonder why people are kind of tired of them and why Donald Trump seems to be more popular than ever and more successful. It’s because he reflects what the people want and the people who oppose him don’t.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

For instance, on the presidential campaign trail last year, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris told attendees at a rally that President Donald Trump “intends to cut Social Security and Medicare.”\n\n“None of that is true,” Tenney said in regard to the accusations from Democrats. She said that what Republicans want to do is safeguard the program and make sure that it will continue to provide payouts in the coming decades to those who are paying into it.\n\n“I’m worried about the next generation and the next generation,” she said during an interview in her office. “Everyone is paying, and we want to make sure they have it, and we want to make sure that people know that we are very much behind it, and we want to protect and preserve Social Security.”\n\nSocial Security is a popular retirement program that can be first claimed at age 62, although benefits increase the longer one waits to claim them, capping out at a retirement age of 70.\n\nWhile, if passed, the resolution would not specifically change anything policy-wise, it does affirm Republican support for Social Security amid the Democratic attacks.\n\n“It shouldn’t be a political rhetoric talking point against us, but it’s always the only point that they have, even though, no matter how many times we say and express that we want to preserve and protect Social Security for future generations,” Tenney said. “They don’t want to be part of the solution.”\n\nThe resolution comes as Social Security faces challenges down the line.

He was quickly escorted out of the room after attempting to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question.\n\n Noem, 53, was holding a press conference to address the ongoing protests against President Donald Trump's immigration policies and the administration's aggressive response.\n\n Padilla — who succeeded Kamala Harris in 2021 to become California's first Latino senator — has been an outward Trump critic and directed a recent post on X at the federal immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\n “Trump isn’t targeting criminals in his mass deportation agenda,\" he wrote, \"he is terrorizing communities, breaking apart families and putting American citizens in harm’s way.”\n\n Video footage that quickly circulated online on Thursday shows officers dragging Padilla out of the room and into the hallway after he says, “I am Senator Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary.”\n\n The footage then captures Padilla, 52, pushed down with his face against the ground and handcuffed by officers wearing FBI vests. Padilla can be heard saying, “Hands off!” during the incident.\n\n Padilla's office issued a statement shortly afterward, saying, “He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground, and handcuffed.”\n\n The office also clarified to the public that he was not still being held by authorities.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n Padilla later released his own statement, saying, \"We have repeatedly asked the Trump Administration for answers on the deployment of military forces and the needless escalation in Los Angeles over the last week — and have gotten limited to no information.\"\n\n \"I attended Secretary Noem's press conference in hopes of getting some answers,\" he continued. \"After identifying myself and trying to ask a question, I was aggressively pushed out of the room, forced to the ground, and handcuffed.\"\n\n Padilla concluded: \"If that's what they do to a United States Senator with a question, imagine what they can do to any American that dares to speak up.\"\n\n The Department of Homeland Security responded to backlash from the video on X, saying, \"Senator Padilla chose disrespectful political theatre and interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem.

Tim Walz on Thursday, pressing him on whether Minnesota complies with federal immigration laws while admonishing him for recently saying Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were a “modern-day gestapo.”\n\nIn a full-day hearing, Republicans zeroed in on Walz’s time on the 2024 presidential campaign trail, as well as his remarks, accusing him of trying to incite violence on ICE agents. Many members tried to get him to apologize to the federal agents.\n\n“Comparing brave law enforcement officers – who risk their lives to uphold federal law – to genocidal Nazi thugs is not just wrong, it’s vile and disgusting,” said Rep. James Comer, who’s led the committee on investigating whether Democratic leaders are shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation and carrying out sanctuary policies.\n\nWalz didn’t apologize for the comment, instead saying agents weren’t giving people due process and “the Constitution is not an inconvenience.”\n\nHis Capitol Hill appearance was the first time Walz faced questions from Republicans since his run for vice president. Democratic governors Kathy Hochul of New York and JB Pritzker of Illinois also testified alongside him.\n\nDemocrats on the committee defended Walz and the other governors, calling the hearing a political “circus” and a waste of time. Others defended Walz’s remarks about ICE agents.\n\n“They want to act offended because someone has the courage to say: ‘If it walks like a duck, if it talks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck,’” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said. “I want to thank you for not wavering to their bullying.”\n\nRepublicans often talked over Walz, going off topic to get their points across and preventing him from being able to respond. Their questions ranged from Minnesota’s immigration policies to his response to the 2020 Minneapolis riots and whether he asked Vice President Kamala Harris about former President Joe Biden’s “cognitive decline.”","summary":"Republicans zeroed in on Walz’s remarks and his time on the 2024 presidential campaign trail in the hearing on immigration policies.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/walz-defends-minnesota-immigration-laws-as-gop-slam-governor-on-ice-gestapo-remarks/601371792","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/6OJC7TODGBEZ5IIPMJZIIYLSQY.jpg?&w=1200&ar=1.91:1&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-12 21:29:35","author":"Sydney Kashiwagi","authors":["Sydney Kashiwagi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":330838636,"title":"Gavin Newsom, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and More Raise the Alarm on Alex Padilla Arrest: ‘Stunning Abuse of Power’","text":"California Gov.

Alex Padilla is one of the most decent people I know. This is outrageous, dictatorial and shameful,” Newsom penned in an X post on Thursday. “Trump and his shock troops are out of control.

As seen in the video, Padilla is rushed by several security members and then detained.\n\n“I’m Senator Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” Padilla, who is a ranking member of the immigration judiciary subcommittee, said as he was pushed by the men. “Hands off!” he yelled.

The president campaigned in 2024 on the promise of mass deportations and appointed Tom Homan as his administration's border czar to execute his agenda.Protests broke out on Friday in Los Angeles in reaction to numerous U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the area. Trump sent National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to help quell the unrest over the weekend, against California Governor Gavin Newsom's wishes.What To KnowNoem scheduled a news conference in L.A. on Thursday regarding the ongoing protests, and Padilla, a California Democrat, was in attendance.As Noem spoke, the senator was taken from the room while saying he had questions to ask her. Video footage from the incident showed that Padilla was pushed to the ground and handcuffed outside the door. Noem stopped speaking for a brief moment during the commotion, then immediately continued.Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the incident \"shocking,\" CBS News reporter Alan posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"I've seen that one clip.

Internet reacts with awe, confusion, and memes galore","text":"Apple just gave iOS a makeover, and it's turning heads for better or worse. Unveiled at WWDC 2025, the new “Liquid Glass” design promises beauty, fluidity, and a futuristic vibe.Apple’s new “Liquid Glass” design for iOS 26 debuted at WWDC 2025 with a bold, translucent look that adapts to surroundings.While Apple hails it as their broadest visual overhaul ever, online reactions have been mixed with users praising its sleekness but mocking its readability and practical usability.Certain social media users have swiftly taken to criticizing or mocking the beautiful, new software design for iOS 26, revealed at the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference. The design, named Liquid Glass, was created using a translucent material that reflects and refracts its environment, while continuously changing to enhance focus on content, Apple stated in a news announcement.Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design, referred to the iOS 26 launch as the company’s largest software design update to date. “It merges the visual properties of glass with a smoothness that only Apple can attain, adapting according to your content or situation,” Dye stated in a declaration.What is “Liquid Glass” and how does it work?Liquid Glass is a fresh software design or aesthetic, characterized by Apple CEO Tim Cook as Expressive, charming, yet still immediately recognizable. Apple claims that the appearance makes applications and system interactions more vibrant and enjoyable while remaining instantly recognizable. It is semi-transparent and acts like glass in reality, with its hue influenced by nearby elements and smartly adjusts to different lighting conditions, as quoted in a report by USA Today.Why are users criticizing the design?Internet responds to Apple's 'Liquid Glass' Numerous individuals appreciate the concept of Apple's Liquid Glass, yet the implementation is less favored.Key issues include the clarity of notifications and the alteration of the image behind the wavy, bubble-like app border.ALSO READ: Kamala Harris election results: Musk dragged into voter bribery scandal as Trump’s win over ex-VP gets murkier The new liquid glass appears terrible and exemplifies prioritizing form/aesthetic/design over functionality/readability/practicality; what are we thinking here, an X user commented in a June 9 post.Some, however, believed that Apple fell short by introducing the liquid glass display rather than revisiting the AI enhancements revealed at the previous year's WWDC. Memes, discussions, and critiques have emerged on social media following Apple's announcement, as per a report by USA Today. So Apple's next big thing, aka Liquid Glass, is random icon packs from the Android world, one user tweeted.“But once you put everything together and fill the screen, it turns into noise and makes things feel way too crowded, like the idea of liquid glass but the readability is not good at all,” another person tweeted.One user wrote on X, “Apple trying to convince us they’ve done something groundbreaking by adjusting the opacity of the control center and calling it “liquid glass” should be a crime.”FAQsWhat exactly is Apple’s Liquid Glass?It’s a new interface design for iOS 26 that’s see-through, shifts with its surroundings, and aims to blend style with usability.Why are people making fun of it online?Some say it prioritizes looks over function, making notifications hard to read and the screen feel cluttered.","summary":"Apple's innovative \"Liquid Glass\" design for iOS 26 was introduced at WWDC 2025, featuring a striking, see-through appearance that adjusts to its environment.

Alex Padilla By Federal Agents In L.A. Puts Trump Team In Spin Mode – Update","text":"UPDATED: Outrage and spin are proving the partisan fallout of Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) being hauled out of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference Thursday in Los Angeles and handcuffed by federal agents.\n\nAfter the incident, Padilla explained what occurred when he went to ask Noem a question about the thousands of troops deployed to L.A. and the ramped-up rounding up of undocumented immigrants (and more than a few legal immigrants) by ICE agents in recent weeks.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\n“I began to ask a question,” Padilla said. “I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room. I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed. I was not arrested. I was not detained.”\n\nThe clarification about whether California’s senior senator was actually arrested did nothing to lessen the blow that what happened to Padilla is what’s happening to American democracy and immigrant communities.\n\n“If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, we can only imagine what they’re doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country,” Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants, said outside the federal building in West LA this afternoon. “We will hold this administration accountable.”\n\nFellow Golden State native Kamala Harris was quick to weigh in on what occurred to the man who replaced her in the Senate in 2021 when she became Vice President, calling it “a shameful and stunning abuse of power.”\n\nIn Washington, DC, as the attack on Padilla took over cable news and the Internet, Democratic House leader Hakeem Jefferies responded in stronger than usual words. “The Trump administration is a disgrace, Secretary Noem is a disgrace, the manhandling of Sen Alex Padilla was a disgrace … it’s un-American,” Jeffries said today with California’s other senator, Adam Schiff, standing beside him.\n\nIn typical Trump administration fashion, Noem took to the safe space of Fox News to offer justification for the incident with Padilla.\n\n“Nobody knew who he was when he came into the room, creating a scene,” Noem told Fox’s Martha MacCallum in live counterprogramming to Padilla’s speaking to the media.\n\n“He was removed from the room, and yes, they started to put handcuffs on him when he finally identified himself, and then that was stopped,” she said of the potential constitutional crisis flashpoint moment. “They said he wants to talk to us and, sure, I’d love to sit down and visit. So, we went to a room and visited for 10 or 15 minutes and then exchanged phone numbers.”\n\nWith more Republicans picking up on false accusations of “storming cabinet secretaries,” Noem doubled down on the clichés on TV: “I’m so sick of the politics, Martha. This is literally people’s lives.”\n\nAs Noem spins her own version of events, there has been no confirmation from Padilla’s office of that meeting.\n\nIt should be noted that Padilla was identifying himself as a senator as the widely circulated video of the incident confirms. Noem has also met and interacted with Padilla on numerous occasions, especially since the former South Dakota governor was appointed to run DHS.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom took to social media to point out the gap between what Noem, the GOP, and the DHS officially say and what anyone can plainly see and hear:\n\nIn the video of the attack, Padilla, who was in the high-level security building for a meeting with military leaders about the troop presence in L.A., repeated that he had a question. Padilla had been in the room for several minutes before starting to ask the question, with no apparent move by federal agents to a so-called security threat.\n\nEarlier today, in a hearing on Capitol Hill, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is a defendant in Newsom’s bid for a temporary restraining order against troops in L.A., refused to commit to the administration complying with court orders. At the same time, Donald Trump himself today walked back parts of his anti-migrant policy after getting complaints from corporate America.\n\nPREVIOUSLY, 12:22 PM: “We are a democracy, but we can lose that democracy,” a mournful Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) said Thursday at the U.S. Capitol mere minutes after Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) was stunningly dragged out of a West Los Angeles press conference held by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nPadilla was handcuffed and hauled off. “This is so wrong, this is so wrong,” Murray said.\n\nThe senator’s office says the Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants, was not detained, but he has not emerged from the federal building yet. DHS has said the Secret Service shockingly reacted, or overreacted, because they thought Padilla was an “attacker” who seemed to “lunge at Noem” – a statement that makes no sense with the level of security required to even get inside a federal building.\n\nWith tensions high in L.A. and thousands of National Guard and U.S. Marines deployed and protests over the harsh ICE raids, DHS says Noem and Padilla had a 15-minute meeting afterwards. That has not been independently confirmed; Padilla is expected to speak on the matter soon.\n\nThe widely condemned reaction by federal agents as Padilla was seeking to ask Noem questions comes as massive raids on undocumented immigrants, including at churches and school graduations, have been unleashed across California and the nation over the past week. A pivotal court hearing is set to start in the next hour on California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request for an emergency temporary restraining order on Trump federalizing the Golden State National Guard on June 7 without consultation with the state.\n\nNewsom expressed his own outrage at what happened to Padilla today, pointing the finger at Trump and his authoritarian rule.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

Esto debe terminar ya”.\n\n“Esto es totalmente inaceptable”, declaró el representante Mike Levin, demócrata por San Juan Capistrano. “El senador Alex Padilla ha sido mi amigo durante más de 20 años: un servidor público decente y honorable, y un orgulloso hijo del sueño americano.

It also shows the political heft the crypto industry now carries under Trump, with several Democrats and Republicans joining the company's payroll in order for the company to influence policy how it wishes.\n\nThe crypto industry also was among the largest spenders in the 2024 election. A crypto super political action committee spent over $130 million in 2024 congressional races. Coinbase — the nation's largest crypto exchange — was the super PAC's biggest contributor.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry's bets are already paying dividends. Congress is now moving quickly to create a comprehensive framework for the regulation of digital assets amid a shift in Washington. Trump, a Republican, has pledged to make the U.S. the global capital of cryptocurrency, contrasting with what industry leaders viewed as a stifling regulatory approach under the previous Democratic administration. Americans may be soon able to invest in crypto in their retirement accounts, after Trump's Secretary of Labor repealed a Biden administration's guidance that said crypto may not be appropriate for 401ks and IRAs. President Joe Biden's regulators had argued that extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies makes the asset class too risky for Americans trying to save long-term for retirement.\n\nRegardless of how crypto has performed in the past, the ability for Americans to put their retirement funds, roughly $44 trillion in assets, into crypto will lead to billions of dollars in profits for the industry, if even a small portion of Americans put their assets into a cryptocurrency fund.\n\nTrump and his family have also been aggressively expanding their personal business into almost every part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including raising billions of dollars to buy bitcoin, creating a new stablecoin and launching and promoting a Trump-themed meme coin.\n\nTrump addressed crypto enthusiasts at Coinbase's policy conference in New York via video on Thursday, saying it's “a really big honor” to be called the “first crypto president.”\n\n“Congratulations to everyone at this exciting time for your industry and in our country's life,” Trump said, to applause.\n\nChris LaCivita, the former co-campaign manager of Trump's successful 2024 presidential bid, joined Coinbase's advisory council in January.\n\nLaCivita and Plouffe were interviewed Thursday at the policy conference in New York, where they talked about their efforts to court so-called “crypto voters” in the 2024 election. Both the Harris and Trump teams viewed the group as a new bloc of potential swing voters who were up for grabs. Coinbase chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad said the company met with both campaign to sell them on the potential.\n\nLaCivita said Trump — who had once been a crypto skeptic — quickly came around, with the help of input from his sons Barron Trump and Donald Trump Jr.\n\n“The newness of it I think was exciting, from the president’s standpoint,\" said LaCivita. “It didn't take really a lot.”\n\nThe campaign, he said, also saw an opportunity to engage with a swath of voters who may not have been actively engaged with politics in the past, including Black and younger voters, with whom the Republican Party has struggled in the past.\n\n“It gave us an opportunity to establish common ground with an area and a demographic that we need expand in in order to be successful,\" he said. “This was one of those just great growth opportunities in politics,\" which he said are “few and far between.”\n\nPlouffe said the Harris campaign had reached the same conclusion and argued the group is only growing.\n\n“The folks who own crypto are pretty politically competitive,\" he said. “These are not MAGA voters. They are swing voters. Lean a little Democratic, certainly lean a lot younger.”\n\nBoth were also bullish on their party's chances in next year's midterm elections. Plouffe stressed the party out of power generally has an edge. He acknowledged that the Democratic Party “has a lot of work to do on its brand\" after their disappointing finish last year, but said he hoped \"that's going to come from the people who run and from the grassroots together.\"\n\nLaCivita said the goal for Trump would be to demonstrate to voters that he is delivering on his campaign promises.\n\nPlouffe, who previously served on the global advisory board for Binance, joins a council that also includes former Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat-turned-independent. The role of advisers is to be a “sound board” to discuss policy efforts and business strategy, said Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s chief policy officer.\n\nIn Congress, legislation is advancing far more quickly than usual for a new industry — a pace that some involved in shaping the bills say comes amid an all-out pressure campaign from the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of Democrats joined the Republican majority to advance legislation regulating stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. Final passage through the Senate could come next week.\n\nMeanwhile, a more sweeping bill to implement cryptocurrency market structure has begun moving through House committees.","summary":"A senior adviser to Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign is joining Coinbase's global advisory council, which already includes several former U.S. senators and President Donald Trump's ex-campaign manager, as the cryptocurrency exchange broadens its political reach.

Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials Thursday morning.\n\n“I am Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” the Democratic senator said as he was being pushed out of the room by multiple people.\n\nHe is not currently detained, his office said later Thursday.\n\n“Sen. Padilla is currently in Los Angeles exercising his duty to perform congressional oversight of the federal government’s operations in Los Angeles and across California,” Padilla’s office said.\n\n“He was in the federal building to receive a briefing with General Guillot and was listening to Secretary Noem’s press conference. He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground and handcuffed. He is not currently detained, and we are working to get additional information.”\n\nVideo shows Padilla kneeling on the ground after being removed from the room before officers push him to the ground and handcuff him with his arms behind his back.\n\nNoem continued to speak from the federal building on the westside of Los Angeles, several miles from downtown Los Angeles, where the large immigration protests have been taking place, saying federal immigration enforcement efforts are going to continue in the area.\n\n“We are not going away,” Noem said. “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and this mayor have placed on this country and this city.”\n\nNoem alleged that federal buildings were surrounded by more than 1,000 “violent rioters” on Friday night, June 6, adding that it took LAPD more than two hours to respond.\n\n“So we are going to continue to operate with our federal partners and continue to keep asking the governor and the mayor for their support and their backup in these operations to make sure that all of our law enforcement officers are protected while they do their work,” she said.\n\n“We’re going to protect American cities from lawlessness, and we’ll do what it takes to put American citizens first,” she said.\n\nWhen asked by reporters, Noem said she stayed “close” to downtown when she got into town. She said she spent Thursday morning in various parts of the Los Angeles area while out “on operations” with law enforcement.\n\nShe was spotted by the New York Times accompanying federal immigration enforcement officers during a search at a home in Huntington Park earlier in the morning.\n\nMeanwhile, California Democrats quickly came to Padilla’s defense.\n\nNewsom said the senator is “one of the most decent people I know.”\n\n“This is outrageous, dictatorial and shameful,” Newsom said. “Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now.”\n\n“This is totally unacceptable,” said Rep.

They don't have enough electricity right now.\" The resolutions work to end California's plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, including one ending a waiver issued by the Biden-era EPA that mandated at least 80% of vehicles be electric vehicles in California by 2035, as well as another resolution ending the Biden-era EPA's approval of a plan to increase the number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks in California, and another on California's low-nitrogen oxide regulations for heavy-duty vehicles, including off-road vehicles. Trump was joined Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA chief Lee Zeldin, whom Trump called the \"most important man in the room,\" and other Republicans and administration leaders during the bill-signing event. \"They can't take us to court,\" Trump said, explaining the resolutions of disapproval were signed under the Congressional Review Act and not as executive orders. \"They can't do any of the things they can do with the executive orders, and it's permanent. I'll sign three pieces of legislation that will kill the California mandates forever, and they're never coming back.\" Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who currently finds himself repeatedly trading barbs with Trump as anti-ICE riots break out in his state, has long championed the left-wing state's EV mandates and plans, characterizing California as leading the U.S. into a future that does not rely on oil and gas. \"This is the most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change,\" Newsom said back in 2020 as he unveiled an executive order requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035. \"For too many decades, we have allowed cars to pollute the air that our children and families breathe,\" he added. \"Californians shouldn’t have to worry if our cars are giving our kids asthma.

It'd be burning just like his damn houses burned down because you didn't have the water that he should have had it,\" Trump said, also referring to the wildfires that rocked southern California in January. Trump explained that his bill signing event was held not only due to California's massive size, but also die to how 17 other states have fallen in line with California's rules restricting the car industry with EV mandates and environmental rules. \"Because of the size of California's population and the fact that 17 other states follow California, that's the problem,\" he said. \"Seventeen other states follow California. They have the most ridiculous laws I've ever seen. For a lot of things, this is just cars … and trucks. And, they have a lot of them for other things. But we have what's called the California Car standards.\" Trump added that he is protecting American jobs with the bill signing, as China has been \"very strong on electric\" vehicles and auto jobs likely would have been \"shipped to China.\" \"All of the auto jobs would be shipped to China because they're very strong on electric, and it lives off an estimated 200,000 American autoworkers would be destroyed,\" he said. \"It's one of the reasons I did so well with the United Auto Workers, and now I'm really doing well with them.

The unsubstantiated claims took hold after the president, who will turn 79 on Saturday, stumbled while boarding Air Force One last weekend. Trump's slip on the stairs to the presidential aircraft was quickly compared to that of former President Biden while also boarding the plane.\n\nImages have since circulated on various online platforms of Trump inspecting work in the Rose Garden on Monday, which appeared to show \"bulges\" in his trousers, possibly indicating the presence of leg braces. That soon set off a wave of theories.\n\nIn one, it was suggested that Trump's decision to create a Mar-a-Lago-style patio in the famous White House Rose Garden was because he has trouble walking on thick grass and would be steadier on pavement. However, the administration has said it is because the heels of women attending events can sink into the ground when it is wet or even damp.\n\nSome on social media suggested the bulges in Trump's trousers were proof of leg braces. (Photo by ... More Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nAnother theory that gained traction was that Trump was wearing a Foley catheter, possibly due to bladder issues. Still, others said it would enable the president to give lengthy speeches or attend events without needing to excuse himself to use the bathroom.\n\nThe White House has dismissed the claims as \"fake news.\"\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nNetflix’s Best New Show Lands A 100% Rotten Tomatoes Score From Critics\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Thursday, June 12th\n\nFBI Confirms iPhone And Android Warning—Delete These New Texts\n\nSuch Wild Theories Aren't New\n\nThis is hardly the first time that a slip on the stairs of Air Force One or an ill-fitting suit has been seen as being at least somewhat \"newsworthy.\" In the social media era, such matters can't go unnoticed.\n\nTrump often joined, if he hadn't already led, the efforts to call out any misstep by former President Joe Biden, when images and videos circulated of Biden slipping or tripping while boarding Air Force One.\n\nThe previous administration, aware of how quickly a minor mistake can go viral, took steps to minimize the risk of falls on the presidential aircraft. That included having Biden use the shorter stairway, which, in turn, still drew attention and highlighted the question of his age and his ability to serve in the highest office.\n\nAn irony for Mr. Biden is that he may have inadvertently caused some of the issues. Just weeks after winning the 2020 election, Biden suffered a hairline fracture on his foot while playing with one of his dogs. Not wanting to appear weak or feeble, he reportedly refused to wear the walking boot when cameras were around. The inconsistency in wearing the boot may have contributed to his persistent stiff gait, which became increasingly noticeable during his presidency.\n\nSocial Media Users See Things Differently\n\nThere is the old saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but the truth is also in the eye of those who see what they want to see. It was in the pre-social media days, but some claims still went \"viral\" in 2004 that former President George W. Bush had worn a radio receiver connected to an earpiece that fed him answers during a debate with then-Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.\n\nThe only \"evidence\" was a bulge in Bush's jacket. If social media had been around, it likely would have received even more scrutiny.\n\nSimilar allegations were leveled against former Vice President Kamala Harris during last September's debate with Trump, with some users claiming she wore a pair of Nova H1 Audio earphones disguised as pearl earrings. The fact that the earnings were part of a Kickstarter campaign and never released didn't squelch the rumors. Whether the rumors swayed voter opinion is unclear, but it is a reminder that perception matters.\n\nUS Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks during the presidential ... More debate last year. Some believe her earings were actually earphones that allowed her to be provided with answers to the questions. (Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nIt hasn't just been fashion-related issues that now trend on social media, either.\n\nIn 2016, rumors also circulated that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was replaced by a body double to conceal serious health issues. It came after Clinton was forced to leave a 9/11 memorial event early after feeling overheated and was diagnosed with pneumonia. It wasn't the only, or even the most high-profile, rumor that dogged Clinton, but it certainly didn't help her campaign.\n\nThe Media Used To Cover For The President\n\nThere have also been allegations that the mainstream media didn't dig deep enough into Biden's stumbles, including a fall on stage during the June 2023 U.S. Air Force Academy graduation ceremony. Critics of Mr. Biden argue that it wasn't just White House insiders who concealed his decline, but that the media also failed to do their job, a failure that now seems far more apparent.\n\nIt wasn't until the presidential debate between Biden and Trump last June that the issue became too difficult to ignore. Still, questions about Biden's fitness had already been regularly raised on social media. That has given credence to the claim that social media covers news stories that the mainstream media won't.\n\nThe truth is that until the modern era, the media didn't cover such aspects of the presidency. It was readily apparent that Franklin Roosevelt's health was declining, but the country was shocked when he passed away in April 1945, just months into his record fourth term.\n\nIt didn't become widely known that he was confined to a wheelchair until after his death. Such matters weren't considered newsworthy at the time. Likewise, the public didn't know of his or most presidents' extramarital affairs. The media simply didn't focus on such things.\n\nThat changed over time, and the world likely knew too many details about former President Bill Clinton's activities in the Oval Office. In the social media era, such rumors can circulate, even if they're not true.\n\nThe flip side is that just as social media is quick to suggest a cover-up is underway, detractors will offer a counter-narrative. Failing that, there is always the \"WhatAboutism\" argument to fall back on. If Trump slips on the stairs of Air Force One, as soon as a video appears on X, ten more will follow, showing Biden looking worse, and possibly a few vintage ones of Gerald R. Ford slipping on Air Force One's stairs will circulate for good measure.\n\nAnd as for the leg brace, it may go viral, but it will only be believed by those critical of the sitting president. His supporters won't see it, or at least won't care. The divide is simply too great, but that's what social media does best. It divides while keeping everyone engaged. And because there is now so much misinformation, it is hard to know what, if anything, on the platforms is the truth.\n\nThat's what we all need to brace for!\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The unsubstantiated claims took hold after the president, who will turn 79 on Saturday, stumbled while boarding Air Force One last weekend.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/06/12/latest-social-media-conspiracy-theory-suggests-trump-wears-a-leg-brace/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/684b0736bccbffecbd6c33e9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-12 17:06:03","author":"Andrew Caballero,Contributor,Peter Suciu","authors":["Andrew Caballero","Contributor","Peter Suciu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":330767540,"title":"Welcome to the Era of Abusive Federalism | Opinion","text":"Anyone who has taken an introductory American politics class probably remembers the way that America's system of federalism has been divided by scholars into \"eras\" based on understandings about the balance between state and national power. The most recent, ushered in by the Reagan revolution, is known as \"The New Federalism,\" and purported to return various powers to the states. As President Donald Trump orders the military into Los Angeles to crush what are by all accounts fairly modest and largely peaceful protests and prepares to use the federal government to blackmail and starve out states that refuse to bend the knee to MAGA, I think it's safe to say that Reagan's era is over. Welcome, instead, to the age of \"Abusive Federalism.\"The Constitution's power-sharing scheme was creative but deeply underspecified, leaving the task of figuring out the boundaries of state and federal power to future courts and policymakers. Unlike Ronald Reagan, Trump has no ideological preference for state versus national power. The president, after all, claims proudly that he \"solved\" the abortion issue by appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe and gave states jurisdiction over reproductive rights while simultaneously hurling invective at states that defy his whims on other issues, like education and immigration.The distinctive ethos of Abusive Federalism is one of vengeance, punishment, and submission. Since the day Trump declared his candidacy in 2015, he has spoken about Democratic-controlled states and cities as if they are hellish, renegade provinces that must be brought to heel by force if necessary. This is a target-rich environment, so to choose but one example, Trump said, \"Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president,\" in October 2024, referring to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Speaking about a city, region, or state like this would once have been career-ending. Under Abusive Federalism it is just another day at the office.During his first term, Trump repeatedly threatened to cut off federal funding to states and cities that maintained \"sanctuary\" laws that limit the ability of local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal agencies like ICE. Those threats are obviously back, this time with the full backing of the executive branch.But Trump's vengeance politics extend well beyond immigration. The president yearns to use his unchecked power to turn funding on and off to states whenever he wants. He has already gotten into an escalatory battle with Maine Governor Janet Mills over the state's policies for trans athletes, threatening to cut off millions of dollars to the state's schools. As is often the case with Trump, he picks a fight, which then disappears out of the news cycle and into a legal battle. But the damage is done. Instead of making and enforcing policy through normal political channels, Abusive Federalism delights in threatening to bankrupt Democratic states by withholding their own tax dollars from them.He has even threatened to use natural disasters as a point of leverage to force states into policy capitulation over routine political disagreements, something that would have seemed unimaginably corrupt and insane even 10 years ago. In January, he threatened to withhold federal aid from California if the state didn't change its water management practices to suit the president's conspiracy-addled preferences. He also demanded completely unrelated changes to the state's voter ID laws.That he may be unable or unwilling to follow through on many of these threats is not really the point. Under Abusive Federalism, the executive branch has become a tool of scorched-earth partisan warfare, and the federal government's relationship to individual states is dependent on the choices that state's voters made in the previous election. Ordinary disagreements are now seen as grounds to capriciously immiserate and ruin lives, and failing that, to intimidate state leaders into capitulation.What's happening in California is a case in point. Unlike when former President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalized the National Guard to enforce desegregation in 1957, neither California Governor Gavin Newsom nor Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is obstructing federal immigration enforcement, much less ordering the California National Guard to do so as former Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus did in 1957. They are simply refusing to order the kind of unwarranted brute force that Trump seems to desire, and are unwilling to dismantle sanctuary statutes that have never once been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.We are less than five months into Trump's second term, and despite loss after loss in court, the administration seems determined to stick to Abusive Federalism as both the philosophy and practice of governing. The union was not designed for this kind of naked coercion, and the White House should not be surprised, then, when the blue state targets of Trump's abuse start thinking a little more carefully about their options.David Faris is an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University and the author of It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics. His writing has appeared in Slate, The Week, The Washington Post, The New Republic, Washington Monthly and more.

President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the renowned “60 Minutes” news program is the wildcard that threatens to delay some industry consolidation.\n\nHome to the “Mission: Impossible” movie franchise, Paramount is scrambling to cope with its limbo state nearly a year after controlling shareholder Shari Redstone agreed to the controversial sale.

Paramount, which needs agency approval to transfer its TV licenses, offered $15 million to settle the case, but the president has asked for $20 billion and spurned it, according to media reports.

These employees should allow extra time for travel to and from work, whether by private vehicle or public transportation.”\n\nEmployees who are eligible for telework were thus encouraged to ask supervisors about remote work, and supervisors are allowed to grant it the last three days of this week. \n\n“Employees may also request to use annual leave or other authorized time off,” the notice reads. “Employees are encouraged to monitor local news media for announcements on street closures for vehicular and pedestrian traffic and disruptions to public transportation.”\n\nIt’s unclear if the notice applies to all federal agencies. The White House did not respond to questions from the Washington Examiner, and the Office of Management and Budget confirmed that it had such a policy in place this week but said it could not speak for other departments. \n\nThe Washington Examiner has contacted other agencies, including the Department of Education, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Labor, to inquire as to their remote work policies this week.\n\nUpon retaking the White House, President Donald Trump began ordering federal employees back to the office after many spent the better part of five years working from home.

Gavin Newsom, who irked him by criticizing his militarized response to Los Angeles protests against his administration’s immigration raids. Just four days earlier, Trump had suggested that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, his former ally, could lose his government contracts for going public with concerns about the president’s fiscal recklessness.\n\nIt’s not clear whether Trump was serious in either case, whether he intends to follow through on his threats, or exactly how that would work. But the authoritarian intolerance of dissent reflected in those comments is consistent with the various ways Trump already has used the powers of his office to punish people whose views offend him.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump deployed 2,000 members of California’s National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, invoking a law that authorizes such action when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion” against the U.S. government’s authority. That unilateral step, Newsom argued, was unnecessary, provocative, and illegal because local and state law enforcement agencies were willing and able to maintain order without federal intervention.\n\nThis was the context in which a reporter asked Trump whether Newsom should be arrested, noting that border czar Tom Homan had threatened that consequence for “anybody,” including Newsom, who interferes with the immigration crackdown. “I would do it if I were Tom,” Trump replied. “Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing.”\n\nMaybe Trump was joking. Maybe he also was joking when he argued, during the public flap that Musk provoked by slamming a Trump-backed bill as a “disgusting abomination” that would add trillions to the national debt, that “the easiest way to save money in our Budget” would be to “terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”\n\nThen again, maybe not. No such excuse is available for Trump’s plainly serious crusades against foreign students, lawyers, universities, and new outlets he portrays as enemies of democracy and American values.\n\nBy deporting students who criticize the Israeli government, Trump says, he is fighting antisemitism and protecting U.S. foreign policy interests. The goal, he explains, is to make students think twice before they open their mouths.\n\n“Any student that protests,” Trump said during his 2024 campaign, “I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave.”\n\nTo justify his executive orders against disfavored law firms—which aimed to ruin them by revoking their security clearances, restricting their access to federal officials and buildings, canceling their government contracts, and threatening other contractors with ties to them—Trump likewise cited their support for causes and clients he abhors. Federal judges therefore had no difficulty concluding that the orders violated the First Amendment.\n\nTrump’s conflict with Harvard, framed as an attempt to enforce federal civil rights laws, extends far beyond that goal. The administration has said the university cannot regain access to federal research grants unless it surrenders academic freedom by implementing a litany of hiring, admission, administrative, curricular, and disciplinary reforms.\n\nTrump is still pursuing his legal vendetta against CBS News, which he absurdly claims committed consumer fraud by editing a pre-election 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris in a way that made her seem slightly more cogent. In February, he upped the ante by raising his already risible estimate of the damages inflicted by that interview from $10 billion to $20 billion.\n\nTrump’s beef with CBS is not limited to his abuse of the legal process as a private litigant. Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, reopened an equally groundless investigation of the network for “broadcast news distortion” based on the same interview—a probe that entails second-guessing journalistic judgments protected by freedom of the press.\n\nGiven this track record, it may not be safe to assume that Trump is only kidding when he threatens government retaliation for constitutionally protected speech.\n\nJacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com\n\nGet Opinions content delivered to your inbox.

But this time, it’s not just another headline. It’s a gut punch to every hardworking, law-abiding Hispanic family who believed in the American dream, followed the rules, and came to this country the right way.\n\nThe images coming out of Los Angeles are heartbreaking. Looted storefronts. Torched vehicles. Families locked in their homes while criminals roam free. And let’s not ignore where these riots are happening: in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods like Boyle Heights, Huntington Park, and South Central. These aren’t elite zip codes. These are working-class communities—immigrant communities—being torn apart by the failed immigration policies of the previous administration.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nWhat about the millions of Hispanics who came here legally? What about those who stood in line, paid their dues, learned the language, and embraced the American dream? Don’t they deserve safe streets and secure neighborhoods? What about the small business owner who worked 20 years to open a shop, only to see it burned to the ground in one night of lawlessness? They followed the rules. They did everything right. And now they’re watching their neighborhoods destroyed by people who didn’t and by others on the left, including anarchists, radicals, and agitators who exploit chaos for their own agenda. (RELATED: BOB UNANUE AND JORGE MARTINEZ: Trump’s Crackdown On Illegal Aliens Is Saving American Lives)\n\nThis chaos isn’t a mystery. It’s not a natural disaster. It’s the direct result of the last administration’s reckless, open-border, soft-on-crime agenda. An agenda that let illegal immigrants flood across our border unchecked. An agenda that empowered radical prosecutors who refuse to hold criminals accountable. An agenda that saw those in charge stand by as violent mobs were glorified and police officers were vilified.\n\nKamala Harris even once said that these riots are “not going to stop—and they shouldn’t.” That’s not leadership. That’s lunacy.\n\nNow, thankfully, President Donald J. Trump is back in charge. And he isn’t just tweeting. He’s taking decisive action.\n\nThe moment the riots broke out in Los Angeles, he deployed the National Guard. He empowered law enforcement. And he made it clear: law and order is not optional. It’s non-negotiable.\n\nUnder President Trump, illegal immigrants who commit crimes are being arrested and deported. Because protecting the American people starts with protecting our borders and removing those who break our laws. These are not “immigrants”—they are criminals who abused a broken system and are now tearing apart the very communities immigrants helped build.\n\nLet’s be clear: America is a nation of immigrants, and Hispanics are proof of that. We are builders, not destroyers. We raise families, not riots. We open businesses, not break windows. We go to church on Sunday, send our kids to school, and work two jobs if we have to—all because we believe in the promise of this country. And yet, we’re the ones paying the highest price for the failures of the liberal immigration agenda.\n\nPresident Trump understands this. That’s why he’s restoring law and order—not just in rhetoric, but in action. His administration is cracking down on radical, Soros-funded prosecutors who refuse to do their jobs. President Trump is reinvigorating ICE to remove criminal illegal aliens, supporting local law enforcement with the tools and manpower they need, and securing the border and enforcing immigration laws fairly and firmly.\n\nThe America First approach is not anti-immigrant. It’s pro-law, pro-family, and pro-community. It respects those who come to America legally and want to contribute. It draws a hard line against those who come to destroy. Because we can’t have a country without borders. We can’t have safe neighborhoods without law enforcement. We sure as hell can’t define “justice” as letting criminals run wild while honest families live in fear.\n\nThis is not about politics. It’s about what kind of nation we want to be.\n\nDo we want a country where illegal gangs and violent mobs control our streets? Or do we want a country where legal immigrants and their families can thrive in peace and security?\n\nDo we want chaos—or do we want order? Do we want excuses—or results?\n\nThe choice is clear. America is choosing law and order once again.\n\nThe Hispanic community overwhelmingly wants safe, strong communities. We want opportunity, not anarchy. We want secure borders and legal immigration, not chaos and crime.\n\nLos Angeles should serve as a wake-up call to the rest of the country. Liberal immigration policies are not just wrong—they are dangerous. But under President Trump, we are taking our communities back.\n\nBecause the America First Agenda is the only way forward—for Hispanics, and for every American who believes in freedom, fairness, and the rule of law.\n\nBob Unanue serves as board member of the America First Policy Institute.

Malcolm Kenyatta chosen as vice chairs, did not align with DNC rules designed to promote gender equity.\n\nKenyatta, who had more support than Hogg in the last election, is now unopposed for the vice chair position designated for a man under party bylaws. The race for the other slot will feature three women. \n\nHogg, a gun control activist who survived a 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., has become a lightning rod within the party after announcing that his political action committee, Leaders We Deserve, would back challengers to “ineffective” Democratic incumbents in safely blue seats — a move that seemed incompatible with his role as party leader. \n\nThe internal turmoil spilled into the open over the weekend when Politico reported that DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed frustrations with Hogg on a May Zoom call, saying his actions had “essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to.”\n\nHogg said in a statement Wednesday that he had opted to step aside.\n\n“I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible,” he said. \n\nKenyatta said in a statement following Hogg’s exit that Democrats should keep their focus on the president. \n\n“As Donald Trump sends troops into American cities, threatens peaceful protest, and tries to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid, working families are feeling the squeeze,” he said. “Democrats must be bold and meet this moment.”\n\nKenyatta and others have signaled that the focus on Hogg has been a distraction at a time when Democrats should be on offense, both against the House-passed budget reconciliation measure dubbed the “one big, beautiful bill” as it moves through the Senate as well as Trump’s move to deploy the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to the streets of Los Angeles.\n\nIt’s a bit of a choose-your-own-adventure when it comes to early polling on the unrest in Los Angeles, which was fueled by opposition to Trump’s mass deportation policies.\n\nA June 10 YouGov survey found that on one hand, a plurality of 47 percent disapproved of Trump’s move to use the Marine Corps on U.S. soil. Just a slightly smaller percentage, 45 percent, disapproved of using the National Guard.\n\nBut a plurality of 45 percent also disapproved of the protests in Los Angeles.\n\nStarting gate\n\nTime to rotate the crops? A flip of a state Senate seat, an abundance of experienced candidates and a remark by a Republican incumbent that drew widespread scorn: Those are some of the factors fueling optimism among Iowa Democrats about the 2026 midterms. But shifting the political direction of a state that has swung sharply to the right in the Trump era won’t be easy, and Hawkeye State Republicans are confident they can turn back any potential blue wave.\n\nSherrill wins New Jersey primary: Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill secured her party’s nomination for New Jersey governor Tuesday, defeating five other candidates, including fellow Rep. Josh Gottheimer. She will face Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the November election. \n\nTea party redux? Several former House Democrats who went down in the 2010 “tea party” wave say they’re watching a reboot taking place today — this time with Republicans facing town hall heat from constituents angry about policies being pursued by the majority party in Washington. Our colleague Jim Saksa has the story, which he talked about with CQ Roll Call Editor-in-Chief Jason Dick on the latest “Political Theater” podcast. \n\nPingree for governor: Hannah Pingree, a former state House speaker who is the daughter of Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree, has announced a gubernatorial bid in Maine. She joins a Democratic primary field that already includes Angus King III, whose father is the state’s junior senator.\n\nEyeing the exit: Tennessee Rep. Mark E. Green will resign from Congress “as soon as the House votes once again on the reconciliation package.” Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, said he was offered a private sector job “that was too exciting to pass up.” At least three Republicans — Montgomery County Commissioner Jason Knight; Matt Van Epps, who served in Gov. Bill Lee’s administration; and Army veteran Jon Thorp — have said they will run in the special election to complete Green’s term.\n\nLone star launches: Texas Democrats have announced an eight-figure campaign called Blue Texas to elect Democrats in a state that’s largely been a white whale for the party in recent cycles. The announcement comes amid talk of a mid-decade redrawing of the state’s congressional map ahead of next year’s midterms to help boost Republicans’ chances of keeping the House. \n\n#PA07: Ryan Crosswell, a former federal prosecutor who resigned from the Justice Department earlier this year, entered the race to challenge Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Ryan Mackenzie. The two other Democrats already in the race criticized Crosswell, a former Republican, for his loose ties to the Lehigh Valley district.\n\nEndorsement watch: Leaders We Deserve, the group co-founded by Hogg, has endorsed Virginia Del. Irene Shin in the special election to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Gerald E. Connolly. In Minnesota, Rep. Angie Craig’s bid for Senate has gotten the backing of two prospective future colleagues: Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Andy Kim of New Jersey. And Elect Democratic Women, the PAC founded by female Democrats in Congress, has endorsed Illinois Rep. Robin Kelly for the state’s open Senate seat. \n\nVirginia special election: Early voting for the June 28 Democratic “firehouse primary” in the special election for Virginia’s 11th District will take place on Thursday, June 26. At least nine Democrats have so far declared bids to fill the seat left vacant by Connolly’s death. District Republicans will hold their own canvass the same day. The nominees will face off in a special election on Sept. 9.\n\nMore Texas news: Two-time Democratic congressional candidate Gina Ortiz Jones will be the next mayor of San Antonio after winning a runoff election over the weekend. Jones, who served as undersecretary of the Air Force in the Biden administration, overcame a well-funded challenge from Republican Rolando Pablos in the officially nonpartisan race to lead the heavily Democratic city. \n\nBudget bill blues: The GOP’s budget proposal is deeply unpopular, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll, with just 27 percent of voters supporting the measure. Trump’s approval numbers are also underwater, the Quinnipiac poll found, with 38 percent approving of the president’s handling of the job and 53 percent disapproving. \n\nMore endorsements: EMILY’s List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, is endorsing three mayoral candidates facing contested primaries: Boston incumbent Michelle Wu, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno and Detroit City Council President Mary Sheffield. The group also endorsed Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Christine Donohue, one of three Democrats on the bench facing retention elections this year. \n\nPlouffe’s new gig: David Plouffe, the Democratic strategist who most recently was a senior adviser to Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, has joined Coinbase as an adviser, Politico reported. Plouffe appeared at a Coinbase crypto summit Thursday morning, not long after the announcement.\n\nNathan’s notes\n\nThe fight for the House majority looms as the biggest story of the 2026 election cycle, CQ Roll Call elections analyst Nathan L. Gonzales of Inside Elections writes, and both parties are well into recruitment mode. \n\nNathan identifies 11 House candidates, or potential ones, whose nontraditional backgrounds could give their parties a boost in the fight for the chamber. \n\nWhat we’re reading\n\nD.C. delegate: The Washington Post reports that several D.C. officials are questioning whether longtime Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who turns 88 on Friday, continues to be the city’s best advocate on Capitol Hill. \n\nScions of the times: The Boston Globe looks at the durability of political dynasties in northern New England, where several sons and daughters of well-known politicos are running this cycle.\n\nNo change in the Bayou: Louisiana lawmakers considered modifying the state’s new law that requires a runoff when a candidate doesn’t get a majority of the primary vote, which some analysts predicted would help Sen. Bill Cassidy’s reelection bid next year, NOLA.com reports, but ultimately no changes were made. \n\nThe Blue Dog way: DSCC Chair Kirsten Gillibrand talks to The Washington Post about Senate Democrats’ efforts to recruit candidates in red-leaning states as they try to win the majority next year. The New York Democrat sees parallels with her own first race for Congress, when she flipped a conservative-leaning upstate seat in 2006.\n\nThe count: 5\n\nThat’s how many New Jersey counties — Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Middlesex and Union — have never voted for a woman for governor in a general election.\n\nVoters in these counties have had four opportunities to cast a ballot for three different female gubernatorial nominees: Republicans Christine Todd Whitman (1993 and 1997) and Kim Guadagno (2017), as well as Democrat Barbara Buono (2013).\n\nAll five counties are either solidly Democratic or fairly open to voting for Democrats, which leaves the party’s nominee, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, with a good chance of ending the streak in at least some of those counties this fall.\n\nThe toughest might be Gloucester and Cumberland counties, which Republican rival Frank Ciattarelli carried in his losing 2021 bid for governor. Both South Jersey counties also voted for Trump in last fall’s presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile, Whitman, the first woman to be elected New Jersey governor, said Wednesday that she’s backing Sherrill to become the second. \n\n— by CQ Roll Call’s Ryan Kelly\n\nTuesday is election day in Virginia, with primaries for executive and legislative offices to determine this fall’s matchups. But the commonwealth’s gubernatorial race is effectively set between Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, neither of whom faces any primary challengers. \n\nPhoto finish\n\nSubscribe now using this link so you don’t miss out on the best news and analysis from our team.","summary":"Welcome to At the Races!

June 18 will mark two years since the Titan submersible tragedy, which claimed the lives of all five people aboard during a deep-sea expedition. The Titan, an experimental vessel built for underwater tourism, was intended to take passengers close to the Titanic wreck for $250,000 each.Among the victims were OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, billionaire adventurer Hamish Harding, businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, a university student, as well as Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.

The documentary shows a number of shocking moments including exclusive footage showing how Rush had fired one of his senior divers, David Lochridge, for raising health and safety concerns about the submersible, reports Ladbible. One detail in the documentary series has surprised viewers: a distinct ‘popping sound’ heard at various moments during footage from inside the Titan submersible.This sound is especially noticeable in a clip showing Stockton Rush piloting the sub alone during an underwater test.ALSO READ: US Open 2025: Where to watch golf coverage online for free, live schedule, coverage and other detailsThe late CEO reacts to the unexpected noises, referring to the pops as “attention-getting” and appearing visibly unsettled by them.But later in the documentary, however, Rush informs passengers of the vessel to simply ‘ignore’ any pops, insisting the sub was safe. Fans took to Reddit to discuss the documentary, with many expressing their utter shock at hearing the noises from inside the sub.One commented saying: “The Netflix [Titan Sub] doc is the best yet. Those cracks & pops. My gosh,” while another said: “My gosh. I've been following the Titan story since the sub went missing.

Over the following four days, the world came to know about Titan, the diminutive submersible its charismatic inventor, Stockton Rush, had touted as the key to unlocking deep-sea exploration for the masses. When pieces of the vessel were found at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, experts determined Titan had imploded during its descent, likely killing all five of its passengers instantly.The documentary film Titan: The OceanGate Submersible Disaster focuses on the years leading up to the incident that dominated headlines, examining Rush’s quest to become the next world-renowned change-maker, and culminating in the doomed underwater endeavor.

The House of Representatives is set to consider the measure on Thursday afternoon, which cuts $8.3 billion in funds to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and just over $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which routes federal funds to NPR and PBS. But at least four GOP lawmakers are known to have expressed some concerns about various aspects of the package. House Republican leaders have a razor-thin, three-seat majority in the chamber, which means any dissent beyond that could sink the bill. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE None of the four Republicans – Reps.

But Amodei, co-chair of the Public Broadcasting Caucus, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday afternoon that he was not worried about NPR and PBS' national brands, with which he acknowledged the GOP's bias concerns, and that his fear was gutting funding to smaller local outlets that rely on federal funding to keep people informed in areas with less access. \"These aren't the people that are doing editorial boards that are flipping you the bird,\" Amodei argued to his fellow Republicans. \"They're kind of important pieces of infrastructure in their communities.\" Amodei, who is intimately familiar with the government funding process as a House appropriator, said \"a whole bunch of red counties\" depend on public broadcast funding. \"It's easier for the nationals to raise money if they've got to make up for some funding they lost than it is these guys,\" he said. Valadao, who represents a California swing district, told Politico he was not sure if the measure would pass. He declined to elaborate on his concerns to Fox News Digital, however, and his office did not respond to a request for clarification. Meanwhile, Malliotakis told reporters on Wednesday that she met with Republican voters in her district who wanted PBS funding preserved – but that her real concern was the process. \"I think that there's a lot of questions that members have regarding what programs specifically are going to be cut. This is a broad look at general accounts. We are, at the end of the day, the Congress that holds the power of the purse. We're the ones who we're supposed to be identifying where funding is going. And this gives a lot of discretion to the White House to be doing that unilaterally without Congress,\" Malliotakis said. \"I think there's a large number of members that do have concerns about that. And whether members are going to vote yes or no is a different story in this place. But I have, certainly, reservations… and we'll see how things go.\" Bacon, one of three House Republicans representing a district that former Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024, told reporters Tuesday morning that he was feeling better about the legislation after getting assurances that the foreign aid cuts would not gut money for critical medical research. MCCAUL TOUTS MONEY IN TRUMP TAX BILL TO PAY TEXAS BACK FOR FIGHTING BIDEN BORDER POLICIES He did not say whether his earlier concerns about PBS and NPR were alleviated, however, nor did he say how he would vote on the bill. Bacon told reporters last week, \"It does bother me, because I have a great rapport with Nebraska Public Radio and TV.\" When reached for comment, his office pointed Fox News Digital to Bacon's Wednesday morning appearance on C-SPAN. \"I think the president has to work with us and make this better. So I'm in opposition. That said, I'm in current negotiations with the leadership on this as well,\" Bacon said. The $9.4 billion proposal is called a rescissions package, a mechanism for the White House to block congressionally approved funding it disagrees with. Once transmitted to Capitol Hill, lawmakers have 45 days to approve the rescissions proposal, otherwise it is considered rejected. Such measures only need a simple majority in the House and Senate to pass. But that's no easy feat with Republicans' thin majorities in both chambers. If passed, Republican leaders hope the bill will be the first of several rescissions packages codifying spending cuts identified by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

House GOP leaders lauded the proposal during their weekly press conference on Tuesday. \"These are commonsense cuts. And I think every member of this body should support it. It's a critical step in restoring fiscal sanity and beginning to turn the tides and removing fraud, waste, and abuse from our government,\" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said.","summary":"President Trump&apos;s $9.4 billion spending cuts proposal faces uncertainty as moderate House Republicans express concerns about the measure.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fate-trumps-9-4-billion-spending-cut-package-hangs-house-gop-moderates","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/johnson-trump-capitol.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-12 14:50:15","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":330741950,"title":"Justin Bieber’s behaviour sparks conservatorship talk as Hailey reportedly considers legal action to intervene","text":"Fans and people close to Justin Bieber are getting more and more worried about his recent emotional social media posts and strange behavior in public.There are now rumors of a possible conservatorship led by his wife, Hailey Bieber.

I just encourage them to work this out.”\n\nDuring an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that aired the same day, Schwarzenegger argued that “the democrats and the Republican’s have no interest in solving this problem [immigration] because they use that to raise money and so what they do is they just keep pointing the finger at each other and then they’re surpised if all of a sudden we are using our ‘middle finger’ on them.”\n\n“This wouldn’t happen if the politicians would do their work. Think about it,” he said of the protests. “It’s all bogus because I think we can do better than that.”\n\nThe Austrian-born Terminator star added: “The whole thing is to do with deportation. Of course, this is a very sensitive subject for me because when I came over to this country, I was living in fear of being deported.”\n\nSchwarzenegger, who endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, served as the Republican Governor of California from 2003 to 2011. \n\n“I will always be an American before I am a Republican,” he declared. \n\nOver the weekend, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers conducted raids in LA, anti-ICE protests erupted across the city, causing days of civil unrest. To quell the protests, President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard, a decision that he is now being sued for by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who claims Trump acted “illegally.”\n\nWhile LA remains the epicenter of unrest, The Independent found that demonstrations had flared up in at least 37 cities across the U.S. Hundreds of arrests had been made nationwide by Thursday.\n\nApproximately 60 protesters, including juveniles, were arrested Sunday in San Fransico after a group began to vandalize property.

We have a fight on our \n hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America.

This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — \n the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth.

Not so much any more.

Don’t attack them,” he added.\n\nHe supported Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election but didn’t donate to her campaign, joined Bluesky in late 2024 and has posted nearly 2,000 times since.\n\nHis first post — “Hello Less Hateful World” — set a hopeful tone. But that optimism has since faded.\n\n“Engagement went from great convos on many topics, to agree with me or you are a nazi fascist,” Cuban wrote. “We are forcing posts to X.”\n\nHe said even small disagreements are met with outsized hostility.\n\n“Even if you agree with 95% of what a person is saying on a topic, if there is one point that you might call out as being more of a grey area, they will call you a fascist etc.,” Cuban wrote.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Cuban’s net worth stands at approximately $8.35 billion.\n\nSome users didn’t take kindly to Cuban’s critiques — and they made their feelings known in blunt, often profane language.\n\nIn response to his concerns, one user wrote, “Go wipe your crocodile tears with a wad of hundreds you tw-t. People are over the idea of ‘cool’ billionaires.”\n\nAnother told him, “Man if I were as rich as you I’d probably be less of a p—y,” while a third simply said, “F–kin leave then, p—y.”\n\nYet another post, which Cuban also reposted, read: “It’s like you, as a billionaire, are a despicable bastard and we want you to stop pushing AI and big business here and just Go Away.”\n\nBluesky launched as a decentralized social media alternative and saw explosive growth in the aftermath of Elon Musk’s full-throated endorsement of Donald Trump’s reelection campaign in late 2024.\n\nMusk’s backing of Trump triggered an exodus from X, driving millions of liberal-leaning users to Bluesky in search of a quieter, more ideologically aligned environment.\n\nBetween November 2024 and May 2025, Bluesky’s user base tripled — from roughly 10 million to over 30 million — according to Pew Research Center. That analysis also found that many of the platform’s most prominent news influencers lean left politically.\n\nBluesky CEO Jay Graber acknowledged the politically driven migration in a June 4 podcast interview with Vox’s Peter Kafka.\n\n“It’s people wanting to just try something new. It’s people finding their community here,” she said.\n\n“I think in general it’s both people looking for something and people looking to get away from something.”\n\nBut for Cuban, that community appears to have turned inward.

President Donald Trump will celebrate his birthday with a huge military parade in Washington, D.C. and at the same time, Pope Leo XIV will send a heartfelt virtual message and mass from Chicago. The timing couldn't be more symbolic. People are facing the biggest dilemma of now having to decide between attending Pope Leo XIV's special speech and Donald Trump's birthday and military parade on Saturda. What message is the Pope sending from Chicago?The event, which is almost sold out, is all about unity and compassion, which is the opposite of what President Trump is doing with his show of force and nationalism. There are disagreements about values and the direction of leadership.The president's multimillion-dollar party in Washington, D.C., coincides with the pontiff's plans to broadcast a video message and mass in his hometown of Chicago.ALSO READ: Kamala Harris election results: Musk dragged into voter bribery scandal as Trump’s win over ex-VP gets murkier The event will take place at Rate Field, home of Pope Leo's favorite team, the Chicago White Sox, and tickets are available for $5 each online. The 40,000-seat stadium was nearly completely sold out as of Wednesday, as per a report by The Independent.How different both of the events are?About 6,600 Army soldiers and military hardware, including a WWII-era B-25 bomber, a P-1 fighter, and Vietnam-era Huey helicopters, along with 25 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Stryker armored vehicles, and four Paladin self-propelled artillery vehicles, are expected to participate in Trump's military parade. Thus, the atmosphere in Washington, D.C., will be a little different.Has Pope Leo XIV rejected Donald Trump’s anti-immigration policies?Although it hasn't specifically mentioned the president, the pope has also denounced anti-immigrant rhetoric, including remarks made by the Trump administration.In social media posts made while still a cardinal, Leo, who was elected Holy See last month, was known to have expressed disagreement with both the president and vice president, J.D. Vance.During Sunday's mass in St. Peter's Square, Leo prayed for peace and communication while denouncing the rise of nationalist political movements worldwide. Prejudice, 'security' zones that divide us from our neighbors, and the exclusive mentality that, regrettably, we now see emerging also in political nationalisms have no place where love exists, he said.Pope Leo previously expressed disapproval of the treatment of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadorian immigrant who the Trump administration accused of being a member of the MS-13 gang, as per a report.FAQsWhy is Pope Leo speaking at Trump's parade?The Pope's virtual mass in Chicago coincides with Trump's parade, which could highlight opposing visions of leadership.What does Pope Leo's message center on?His speech emphasizes unity, compassion, and a rejection of rising nationalist sentiment around the world.","summary":"This Saturday presents a stark contrast as President Trump celebrates his birthday with a grand military parade in Washington, D.C., while Pope Leo XIV delivers a virtual message and mass from Chicago.

The parade will have helicopters, Bradley vehicles, fireworks, and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights team. Big TV networks like CBS, NBC, and ABC are not fully airing the parade. They will not stop their regular shows for it, says reports. ABC will air the parade on its online news channel, ABC News Live, starting at 6 p.m. NBC will also stream it on NBC News Now, not on the main NBC channel. CBS will stream it on CBS News 24/7, not on their main channel either.

Fox will skip the parade and show baseball, Yankees vs Red Sox or Padres vs Diamondbacks. Trump’s White House doesn’t have a strong bond with big TV networks. He’s sued ABC and CBS recently, according to reports. Disney which owns ABC paid $15 million to Trump’s library after an anchor wrongly said Trump was found guilty of rape. Actually, the jury found him liable for sexual abuse, not rape, and Trump denied it. CBS’s parent company is fighting a lawsuit from Trump about a Kamala Harris interview on “60 Minutes”, as mentioned in the report by Variety. This lawsuit might be used to slow down CBS’s important merger with Skydance Media. MSNBC will only give light coverage and let anchor Ali Velshi cover “news as it happens.” CNN didn’t share any info on their parade coverage plans, as per reports. FAQsQ1. Why won’t ABC, CBS, and NBC show Trump’s parade fully?They are busy showing sports or regular shows, and don’t want to stop for the parade.Q2.
