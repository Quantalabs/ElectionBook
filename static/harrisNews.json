Tim Walz, who was recently picked to be Vice President Kamala Harris‘ running mate, is headed to Orange County. Walz is scheduled to headline a fundraiser in Newport Beach on Tuesday, Aug. 13, according to an event invitation from Harris’ fundraising committee. Tickets range from $1,000 to attend to $100,000 to be named a chair. Some of the more expensive tickets include a photo opportunity. Anne Earhart, Janet Keller and Bernie Schneider, Bette and Wylie Aitken and Teddy Ray are named as the fundraiser’s hosts. Walz’s trip will happen exactly a week after Harris picked him to join her at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket. The progressive congressman-turned-governor is also a veteran and former coach and educator. On Sunday, Harris and Walz are expected in San Francisco, where Harris served as district attorney earlier in her career, for a fundraiser at the luxury Fairmont Hotel. Tickets for that event range from $3,300 to $50,000, according to the invitation. It’s unclear where exactly the Newport Beach event with Walz will be held. The invite says an address will be given upon RSVP. President Joe Biden had been scheduled to attend a Laguna Beach fundraiser on July 26, but the president decided to forgo his re-election bid just days prior, thus leaving the event canceled.","summary":"The Newport Beach event comes exactly a week after Vice President Kamala Harris named the former congressman her running mate.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/08/09/gov-tim-walz-is-headed-to-orange-county-for-a-fundraiser/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/OCR-L-WALZOC-0810.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 00:32:20","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":253792426,"title":"Tim Walz's long history with China","text":"Washington — Thirty-five years before Vice President Kamala Harris named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, he was on his way to teach high school in mainland China as a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square took place in 1989. \"As the events were unfolding, several of us went in,\" Walz said at a 2014 congressional hearing marking 25 years since the massacre. He recalled meeting a crowd of people in a Hong Kong train station who were \"very angry that we would still go after what had happened.\" But Walz, who became fascinated with China during his youth, saw it as an opportunity. \"It was my belief at that time that the diplomacy was going to happen on many levels, certainly people to people, and the opportunity to be in a Chinese high school at that critical time seemed to me to be really important,\" Walz said. In 2007, as a newly elected congressman, he told The Hill that \"China was coming, and that's the reason that I went.\" His year teaching U.S. history, culture and English in Foshan, a city in the southeastern Chinese province of Guangdong, was the beginning of his decades-long relationship with China. It has opened him up to criticism from Republicans, who are trying to portray him as being weak on the communist-ruled nation, which is widely viewed as the greatest geopolitical threat and economic rival to the U.S.Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said Walz owes Americans \"an explanation about his unusual\" relationship with China. Morgan Ortagus, who was a Trump-era State Department spokesperson, claimed that \"if Walz has his way, our China policy will be the weakest in generations.\" But Walz has spent his political career criticizing the Chinese government, especially its human rights record. After Walz returned to Nebraska following his year teaching abroad, he told the Star-Herald that if Chinese citizens \"had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what they could accomplish.\" As of 2016, Walz had visited China about 30 times, including for his honeymoon. Walz married his wife, Gwen, a fellow teacher, on June 4, 1994 — the fifth anniversary of China's brutal repression of Tiananmen Square protests. \"He wanted to have a date he'll always remember,\" she told the Star-Herald before they wed. For their honeymoon, the couple led dozens of American students on a tour through China. The couple continued the educational trips for years through their own travel company. Elected to Congress in 2006, Walz served on the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which focuses on human rights. He backed Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, garnering praise from activist Jeffrey Ngo. In 2017, he was the only lawmaker to co-sponsor the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which eventually passed in 2019. Walz has met with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader, and has been critical of China's aggression in the South China Sea. In a 2016 interview, Walz said he didn't \"fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship,\" and said there could be \"many areas of cooperation\" between the U.S. and China. But he also said the relationship depends on China playing \"by the rules.\" That same year, Walz said China's human rights record was \"getting worse, not better.\" He suggested that separating China's human rights record from trade policies, which he previously supported, was a mistake. \"I think the idea was, with a free-market economy, we would see a more opening of the Chinese grip on social life and on human rights. That simply has not occurred,\" Walz said during a House hearing. \"We cannot decouple economic growth from human rights growth, and, as a nation, we need to hold those ideas up.\"","summary":"Republicans are suspicious of his relationship with China, but Tim Walz has a record of criticizing the Chinese government.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-china-views/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/09/b955c1c9-29ca-4e87-a881-9bce331c1ce6/thumbnail/1200x630/d55af460a5355b9452732308d707bc4d/gettyimages-2165776933.jpg?v=0a0c17d349635d55704afd4e16e28fc6","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3111564_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-08-10 00:30:44","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.047},{"id":253792162,"title":"Listen: Cops Scramble to Secure Hospital for Biden Health Scare","text":"Officers from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department rushed to clear roads and secure the perimeter of a hospital that had been placed on standby to treat President Joe Biden for a medical issue last month, according to radio transmission recordings obtained by the Daily Beast. It remains unclear what the undisclosed medical issue was, though the White House announced later that day he had been diagnosed with COVID. “Meet at the Valley Hospital ER parking lot. We’re going to meet behind the ER entrances, where the ambulances go,” an officer says in one of the transmissions, which were sent to the Daily Beast in response to a public records request to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. The radio transmissions were broadcast on July 17, after the president abruptly canceled a speaking engagement on a campaign trip in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he was set to speak to Hispanic voters at the UnidosUS event. At 2:15 p.m. local time the same day, the University Medical Center (UMC) hospital was alerted of an unspecified medical emergency involving Biden, which was first reported by KSNV Las Vegas. While details about the emergency were scant, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMP) quickly mobilized outside the hospital, securing a perimeter around the facility. Meanwhile, UMC’s staff “stood ready,” UMC’s CEO Mason Van Houweling told KSNV at the time, setting up an incident command center in anticipation of the president’s arrival. “We knew we were dealing with more of a medical issue—definitely trauma and any accidents were off the table. So again, we shifted gears to be able to address a medical need here at UMC,” Houweling said. In one of the radio transmissions shared with the Daily Beast, a police officer warns that “we gotta take this one slow ’cause we don’t have a lot of resources to make it work.” “Everybody just keep in mind safety, safety, safety. If it doesn’t look good, don’t do it… no one gets hurt.” Biden was never admitted to the hospital, however. Instead, the president was taken directly to the airport, where he boarded Air Force One and departed Las Vegas for Delaware. In another set of police radio broadcasts—which appears to feature LVMPD officers assisting the Secret Service as Biden was being driven to the airport—an officer asks: “Do we know if the Secret Service has drones flying over the stratosphere right now?” Towards the end of one recording, an officer thanks his units for how they handled the incident. “All my units at the airport, be advised that the motorcade is at Air Force One,” he says. “I just wanna let everybody know. Great work out there. You know we put that together ad hoc… appreciate all the resources coming over. You guys did a fantastic job that looked like we had planned it for weeks, so great job everybody.” Days later, the LVMPD released a statement saying that they had been informed that the president was sick without further details, adding that they had proactively started clearing roads to the hospital. Hours later, the White House released a statement saying that the president had been diagnosed with COVID. “Earlier today following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19. He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement released later that day. “The White House will provide regular updates on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation.” Just four days later, Biden—already plagued with questions about his apparent frailness and cognitive capacities, made worse by his dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27—dropped out of the 2024 U.S. presidential race. “While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” the president wrote in a letter posted to X. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to run in his stead in a later post that same day. Harris formally secured the Democratic presidential nomination on Aug. 6, and has since selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. Harris is set to debate former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, for the first time on Sept. 10.","summary":"Kent Nishimura/AFP/GettyOfficers from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department rushed to clear roads and secure the perimeter of a hospital that had been placed on standby to treat President Joe Biden for a medical issue last month, according to radio transmission recordings obtained by the Daily Beast.\n\nIt remains unclear what the undisclosed medical issue was, though the White House announced later that day he had been diagnosed with COVID.\n\n“Meet at the Valley Hospital ER parking lot.

Walz’s lack of combat experience did not stop him from thanking Pelosi for her praise. “Well, thank you, Madam Speaker, and thank you to the leadership here,” Minnesota’s then-1st Congressional District rep said when he took the podium. C-SPAN, the network that taped the press conference, labeled Walz as an “Afghanistan War Veteran” on its chyron. Walz was never on the ground in Afghanistan, however, he did deploy to Italy — more than 3,000 miles away from the Taliban-run country — in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (the war in Afghanistan). The current Minnesota governor’s only other deployment was to Norway in support of NATO. Walz retired from the National Guard in May 2005 — as his battalion was preparing to deploy to the Iraq war zone — to run for Congress. Earlier this week, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, 39, accused Walz of leaving his guard colleagues high and dry by retiring on the brink of their deployment. “What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,” Vance said in Michigan. The Republican Ohio senator was referencing a recently resurfaced clip of Walz from 2018, in which he argued: “We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.” Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, argued that Walz shouldn’t “pretend to be something that you’re not.” In the press conference with Pelosi, Walz also claimed his rank in the Guard was “command sergeant major,” which is false. “As someone who’s spent their entire military career as an enlisted person, my job as a command sergeant major or as a first sergeant was solely to take care of these troops,” Walz said. Walz did not complete the required coursework to reach the rank of command sergeant major and thus retired as a master sergeant. On Thursday, the Harris-Walz campaign scrubbed a reference to Walz as a retired “ command sergeant major” from his official biography on its website. Harris, responding to criticism of Walz’s National Guard service on Thursday, told reporters, “Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country. And I think that we all should.”","summary":"Walz, 60, was never deployed to an active war zone during his 24 years in the Minnesota National Guard, and he has faced accusations of “stolen valor” from Republicans since being placed on the Democratic ticket.  ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/us-news/pelosi-once-praised-walz-for-his-service-on-the-battlefield/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/pelosi-praises-walzs-national-guard-service.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723234209&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rpU96F4s-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-10 00:11:35","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":253792290,"title":"Trump campaign projects confidence and looks to young male voters for an edge on Harris","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — As Donald Trump adjusts to the reality of his new race against Kamala Harris, his campaign is counting on younger male voters to give him the edge in November in a presidential contest they insist is his to lose. Trump and his Republican campaign now face a dramatically different race than the one just three weeks ago, before President Joe Biden abandoned his bid. While they acknowledge polls have tightened with Harris as the Democratic nominee, they maintain that the fundamentals of the race have not changed, with voters deeply sour over the direction of the country, and particularly the economy. “What has happened is we are witnessing a kind of out-of-body experience where we have suspended reality for a couple of weeks,” Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio told reporters during a briefing in West Palm Beach on Thursday of the current state of the race. It was a message echoed by Trump during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club. “The honeymoon period’s gonna end,” he insisted while minimizing the size of the crowds Harris has been drawing and lashing out at his new opponent. “Let me tell you: We have the enthusiasm.” Campaign officials acknowledge that Harris had energized the Democratic base and that her team has taken the lead on fundraising. But they insist they have more than enough to do what they need to win. Trump’s campaign and its affiliates reported raising $138.7 million in July — far less than the eye-popping $310 million sum reported by Harris. Her campaign began August with more cash on hand. With less than three months to go, senior campaign officials are focused on a group of persuadable voters that they believe is key to victory. The targets, which they say comprise about 11% of the electorate in key battleground states, skew younger and are disproportionately male and moderate. While more than half are white, they include more nonwhites, especially Asians and Hispanics, than the broader electorate. They are especially frustrated by the economy, including their personal finances, and are pessimistic things will improve. “It’s a very narrow band of people that we are trying to move,” Fabrizio said of the efforts. Since these voters don’t engage with traditional news outlets and have traded cable for streaming services, the campaign has been working to reach them in novel ways. “There is a reason why we’re doing podcasts. There is a reason why we’re doing Adin Ross,” Fabrizio said, referring to the controversial internet personality who ended his interview with the former president earlier this week by giving him a Tesla Cybertruck wrapped in images of Trump raising his fist after his assassination attempt. “There is a reason why we are doing all of those things. You know what these people pay attention to? MMA, Adin Ross,” he said. “MMA” refers to mixed martial arts. Trump campaign officials acknowledge the Democratic base is now motivated in a way it wasn’t when Biden was the nominee. Harris, they say, will likely do better than Biden would have with Black voters, especially women and older men. But they argue Harris is doing little to appeal to swing voters. And they intend to spend the next 80-plus days painting her as a radical liberal and as the incumbent rather than a change, tying her to the most unpopular Biden administration policies. “There’s way more information about her that they don’t know that they’re going to hear. And we’re going to make sure they’re going to get,” Fabrizio said. By the end of the race, they believe, neither candidate will be liked, but voters will choose the candidate they feel will most improve their economic conditions. They pointed to a line Harris has been using to refer to Trump’s presidency — “We are not going back” — as particularly ill conceived, given that some voters say things were better when Trump was in office than they are now. Trump campaign aides said they now have staff on the ground in 18 states, ranging from critical battlegrounds to states like Virginia, where Democrats have been favored, that they hope they can put into play. The campaign says it now has hundreds of paid staff and more than 300 Trump and GOP offices open across battleground states. But much of their effort relies on volunteers and outside groups. They are trying to replicate a model they used successfully during the GOP primary in Iowa this winter, where volunteer “caucus captains” were given a list of 10 neighbors they pledged to get out to the polls. The campaign has credited that model with boosting turnout on a brutally cold and icy caucus night. The “Trump Force 47” program is focused on targeting low- and medium-propensity voters. Volunteers will be canvassing, writing postcards, phone banking and organizing their neighbors. So far, 12,000 captains have been trained and given voter target lists, according to officials. An additional 30,000 have volunteered, with more than 2,000 expected to be trained per week between now and Election Day. A large part of the campaign’s outreach will also rely on outside groups, which will be running paid canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts thanks to new guidance from the Federal Election Commission that allow campaigns to coordinate with outside groups in ways that were previously not allowed. The campaign said more than 1,000 paid canvassers are on the ground in battleground states, and they’re also working to register about 1.6 million targeted voters in those competitive places.

I’m still doing my research.” Fair said Harris’s legal background is notable but not impressive enough for her to be president. “I haven’t seen anything that really excites me about her,” she said. “Michelle Obama was more active as the first lady than Harris has been as vice president.” Fair told The Epoch Times that Harris hasn’t provided enough evidence that she can lead the country. “I don’t want to vote for Harris just because she is a woman,” Fair said. “I need more substance. She has bad blood with a lot of people.” Fair said her boyfriend is a strong Trump supporter, but she has reservations about supporting the GOP candidate. Richard Kiczek, a tech writer who edits documents and forms for the military, is a lifelong Republican who voted for Trump in 2016. The retired member of the U.S. Air Force believes MAGA (Make America Great Again) voters and politicians have hijacked the Republican Party, but he prefers to discuss why he supports Harris. “I started questioning Trump’s character and switched to [being] independent,” Kiczek told The Epoch Times. “I began looking at other options.” The Fort Walton Beach, Florida, resident intends to cast his vote for Harris when early voting begins. “I appreciate Harris’s position on energy, women’s health rights, LGBTQ unity, her support of Ukraine, and the Democratic Party’s push for reasonable gun control. It’s a no-brainer for me,” he said. Kiczek says he had been hopeful that Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro would be the vice presidential pick, but he’s satisfied with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Harris has chosen as her running mate. “Plain and simple, I’m voting for Trump,” Lowery said. “The Democrats have been horrible for the country.” Lowery, who says he “became an independent several years ago,” is part of a broader movement of black leaders in Illinois who are urging their communities to reconsider their traditional support for the Democratic Party and to vote Republican. The increasing polarization in U.S. politics has been a significant factor for him. “I am not a big fan of Harris, but I refuse to vote for Trump, and Oliver isn’t getting traction,” Sauder said. “I want my vote to count.” Sauder, who works 50 to 70 hours a week to support himself and his family, is concerned about the economy, the border, and the nation’s foreign policy toward Israel. He said he is frustrated by the difficulty of finding accurate information on candidates that isn’t manipulated by the media. “During the Biden administration, [Harris] was invisible, never speaking out, and didn’t seem too confident,” Sauder said. “I want to believe in her, but she’s been weak on the border and unclear about her foreign policy positions.” Sauder told The Epoch Times that he felt the Republican Party had become too extreme. While Trump hasn’t endorsed Project 2025, Sauder said he remains concerned about it. Project 2025, also known as the 2025 Presidential Transition Project, is an initiative spearheaded by The Heritage Foundation and supported by more than 100 conservative organizations. It aims to prepare for a potential Republican administration in 2025 by developing a comprehensive policy agenda and creating a 180-day playbook to swiftly implement conservative policies. “I will vote for Harris if she is [officially] nominated. She’s younger and like a breath of fresh air,” Sauder said.","summary":"Recent polling data suggest that Vice President Kamala Harris has made strides in gaining support among independent voters, after President Joe Biden decided to bow out of the 2024 presidential race.

Elabed then said the Democratic presidential nominee agreed to meet with the group. “She said yes I will meet with you. And I understand when she agreed to meet with me, she wasn’t agreeing to an arms embargo, she was agreeing to discuss an arms embargo and discuss a policy that will save lives now in Gaza and hopefully get us to a point where we can put our support behind VP Harris,” Elabed explained. Fellow Uncommitted Movement founder Abbas Alawieh seconded Elabed’s account of Harris’ agreement to meet — and also claimed that Democratic Party leaders showed sympathy with their desire for an arms embargo. “While we were backstage, ahead of getting to interface with Vice President Harris, we talked to one party leader after another and said to them, ‘Listen, if it was your family that was living under the bombs, we would expect that you would want our candidate to have a policy of stopping the sending of bombs to kill your family members,'” Alawieh said in the video. He continued, “Party leaders who we spoke to understood this. It was clear that Vice President Harris understood the gravity of the situation, and we found hope in the fact that she expressed an openness to engage.” The eyebrow-raising revelation came after Harris was accused of passing over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, as her pick for vice president because she didn’t want to cross the progressive, anti-Israel left. The claims that she is now open to discussing an arms embargo quickly sparked outrage among Israel supporters, who say it is just more evidence of her kowtowing to the radical, anti-Israel mob. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) interpreted the news as Harris appeasing a pro-Hamas undercurrent in her party. “Kamala Harris is a Hamas sympathizer. She has made it crystal clear that she will stand with Hamas as the Jewish people are relentlessly attacked by Hamas terrorists,” she told The Post. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also hit out at the Democratic presidential nominee. “Kamala Harris won’t speak with press. But she will speak with pro-Hamas radicals and suggest she’s open to a full arms embargo against Israel,” Cotton lamented on X. “Floating an arms embargo against Israel to pro-Hamas activists is disgraceful,” former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added to the chorus of fury online. “Kamala Harris’s radical policies will encourage more terror attacks against our ally.” Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY), however, shot down the claims. “The Uncommitted movement, delusional as ever, is imagining support where none exists,” Torres told The Post. “The Vice President’s team has made it clear that she opposes an arms embargo. An arms embargo against Israel — at a time when Israel finds itself under threat from Iran and its proxies on seven fronts –would endanger the world’s only Jewish State in a moment of existential self-defense.” Harris’ National Security Advisor, Phil Gordon, also insisted that Harris would “always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups.” “She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law,” Gordon wrote in a statement on X Thursday, without explicitly denying she was open to at least a discussion about an embargo. On Wednesday, Harris spoke to a crowd of around 15,000 attendees who packed the Detroit airplane hangar — where she was interrupted by anti-Israel protestors. “Kamala, Kamala, you can’t hide! We won’t vote for genocide,” the demonstrators from an anti-Israel University of Michigan student group yelled. “You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking,” Harris shot back.","summary":"The founders of the Uncommitted National Movement claimed that Kamala Harris \"expressed an openness\" to meeting with them to discuss an arms embargo against the Jewish State.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/us-news/anti-israel-uncommitted-voter-group-claims-kamala-harris-agreed-to-discuss-an-arms-embargo-against-israel/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87376492.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:49:29","author":"George Caldwell,Josh Christenson","authors":["George Caldwell","Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":253791354,"title":"Harris, Walz campaign in Arizona as immigration issue looms large","text":"Harris, Walz campaign in Arizona as immigration issue looms large Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

There is a tougher reality for Harris, though, belied by the euphoric haze. The contest between Harris and former President Donald Trump remains remarkably close, and she is tied with him in must-win states like Wisconsin and Michigan, according to The New York Times’s polling averages. Trump’s allies are sharpening their attacks. And in a candidacy measured in days not months, she has yet to face the scrutiny of an interview or release a detailed vision for her potential presidency. Every presidential campaign is a series of tests. Can you excite voters? Can you raise money? For Harris, the answer to both of those questions so far is yes. Her party coalesced around her instantly. She has smashed fund-raising records and held overflowing rallies, and she seems to be tugging key swing states her way. But as Harris wraps up a battleground campaign tour with her brand-new running mate this weekend and turns her attention toward the Democratic National Convention this month, fresh challenges are in the offing. And the short campaign leaves a candidate who is still introducing herself to voters with little time for do-overs.","summary":"Fresh challenges in the offing could determine how long the vice president’s honeymoon will last.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/us/politics/harris-walz-trump-polls.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/09/multimedia/09-pol-on-politics-newsletter-top-lhfb/09-pol-on-politics-newsletter-top-lhfb-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:48:13","author":"Jess Bidgood","authors":["Jess Bidgood"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.045},{"id":253791590,"title":"Donald Trump’s aircraft had to land unexpectedly in Montana due to a mechanical problem, while a large number of people were assembling for a rally.","text":"Saturday, July 13 – Donald Trump is shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Republican frontrunner is hit in the ear but stands up and pumps his fist to the crowd. Shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, is shot dead but the Secret Service is slammed for suspected security blunders. Ex-fire chief Corey Comperatore is killed protecting his family. Sunday, July 14 – President Joe Biden calls on Americans to unite and “cool down” political rhetoric in the wake of Trump’s shooting. The Democrat had faced growing calls since his disastrous performance in June’s CNN debate. Shocking video reveals how close Trump came to being killed after turning his head at the last minute. Monday, July 15 – The Republican National Convention kicks off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump is formally nominated as the Republican candidate. An emotional-looking Trump makes his first appearance since surviving the shooting wearing a large ear bandage. It quickly becomes a must-have fashion item at the RNC. Ohio Senator JD Vance is named as Trump’s running mate. Previously anti-Trump, Vance at just 39 is an inexperienced choice, but seen as having a connection with ordinary Americans. In an interview, Biden admits it was a “mistake” to talk about putting Trump in “the bullseye” days before the assassination attempt. Tuesday, July 16 – The FBI warns of more potential violence in the wake of Trump’s shooting. Intelligence claims Iran had a separate plot to assassinate Trump, but there is no proven link to Crooks. Biden returns to the campaign trail for the first time since the assassination attempt and insists he isn’t stepping down. Wednesday, July 17 – Joe Biden tests positive for Covid, just days after saying he would drop out of the presidential race if he was diagnosed with a medical condition. It intensifies the calls for him to step aside with Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom floated as potential replacements. At the RNC, JD Vance makes his first speech since being selected as Trump’s VP pick, to the delight of the MAGA crowd. Thursday, July 18 – Donald Trump addresses the RNC, his first speech since surviving an attempted assassination. He appears slower and more subdued than usual but gives the longest convention acceptance speech in US history. Just before he goes on, former wrestler Hulk Hogan rips his shirt off and tells cheering crowds “Trumpomania” will sweep America. Former First Lady Melania, who has barely been seen on the campaign trail, makes an appearance but does not speak. Barack Obama joins calls for Biden to step aside. Friday, July 19 – President Biden appears to consider resigning, as a source says he is in a “contemplative stage” while isolating with Covid. Video emerges showing Biden appearing to lean into the wrong woman after mistaking her for his wife Jill. Meanwhile, the world’s biggest tech outage sparks travel chaos for Republicans leaving the RNC in Milwaukee. Saturday, July 20 – Donald Trump holds his first campaign rally since the shooting in Butler. He appears in Michigan without his ear bandage. His former doctor Ronny Jackson describes his injuries. He appears in his first interview alongside his running mate Vance. Senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi speaks for the first time since being linked to growing calls for Biden to resign. Meanwhile, Biden’s reelection campaign continues to insist he is running, as a spokesperson slams Trump’s rally remarks as showing he is “focused only on himself.” Sunday, July 21 – Joe Biden announces he isn’t running in November in a shock letter, just hours after insisting he was staying in the race. He is the first incumbent to step down in their first term since 1968. Biden endorses Kamala Harris for president as senior Dems through their support behind the Vice President. The news appears to throw the Republicans off their stride. Biden vows to continue his term until November’s election. Monday, July 22 – Kamala Harris raises a record $81 million in 24 hours as she secures the Democratic candidacy. She also inherits some $91 million in leftover campaign funds from Biden. Harris gives her first speech since Biden stepped out, and speaks to the president on the phone, although he doesn’t appear in person. Under-pressure Secret Service chief Kimberly Cheatle appears on Capitol Hill and faces increasing calls to resign over the shooting of Trump. She admits the Secret Service “failed” on July 13 and resigns the following day.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDONALD Trump&#8217;s plane made an emergency landing on Friday afternoon following a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump&#8217;s aircraft had to land unexpectedly in Montana due to a mechanical problem, while a large number of people were assembling for a rally. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/donald-trumps-aircraft-had-to-land-unexpectedly-in-montana-due-to-a-mechanical-problem-while-a-large-number-of-people-were-assembling-for-a-rally/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Donald-Trumps-plane-forced-to-make-emergency-landing-in-Montana.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:45:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":253791424,"title":"VP Harris' husband Doug Emhoff has awkward interaction with Steph Curry after Team USA's thrilling comeback","text":"The U.S. men's basketball team trailed by as many as 17 points during its game against Serbia at the Paris Olympics Thursday. But Team USA managed to pull off a miraculous fourth-quarter comeback to advance to its fourth straight gold medal game, beating Serbia, 95-91. Avid sports fan and U.S. second gentleman Douglas Emhoff was on hand to watch the thrilling victory. After the game, a social media video surfaced showing Emhoff interacting with Steph Curry, who put together his best performance of the Summer Games in the semifinal round. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Curry ended the game with a team-leading 36 points, which was just one point shy of the most for an American during an Olympic basketball game. Carmelo Anthony still holds the record for the most points by an American. While it is unclear what Emhoff and Curry said to one another during the celebratory exchange, some observers pointed to the second gentleman's body language. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS ENCOURAGES US MEN'S BASKETBALL TO 'BRING BACK THE GOLD' AS PARIS OLYMPICS LOOM Shortly after greeting Curry, Emhoff made a gesture with his hands that suggested he was attempting to project his voice even though the NBA superstar was standing just a couple of feet away. The U.S. entered the fourth quarter down 13 points, but the Americans quickly cut the deficit to five with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Then the U.S. took over. After both teams exchanged baskets, back-to-back buckets by Joel Embiid brought the United States back to within two with just over four minutes to go. And a tough layup by LeBron James knotted it at 84 with 3:39 to go. Serbia regained the lead, but Curry dropped his ninth 3-pointer to put the U.S. up one. James then made a reverse layup to make it a three-point U.S. lead, and Curry matched it with his own, going coast-to-coast to put the Americans up 91-86 with 1:41 to go. The game turned on a 14-2 run by the Americans. Emhoff makes no secret of his basketball fandom. He’s been a Los Angeles Lakers season ticket holder for years. In her 2019 memoir, Vice President Kamala Harris revealed Emhoff initially reached out to her in a text message he sent from a Lakers game.

That is, the veep said Thursday that she wants to “get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.” It is the beginning of August… One interview, if she can fit it in, and so can . . . who? Rachel Maddow? Mika Brzezinski? Does she dare try Lester Holt again after she embarrassed herself with him last time? Fine, she’s busy campaigning, but it’s not like she has a real day job: President Biden (or whoever actually runs the country) has that covered. Meanwhile, she hasn’t suffered the examination of serious, potentially adversarial campaign press since she dropped out of the Democratic primaries in 2019. She simply parachuted into the 2024 nomination after Nancy Pelosi & Co. muscled Biden into dropping. Since then, he’s done more interviews than she has: It airs Sunday. She can’t match the pace of an 81-year-old man who’s also technically busy being leader of the free world? You have to think Donald Trump had it right the other day at his take-all-comers press conference: “She won’t even do interviews with friendly people, because she can’t do better than Biden.” Unlike Harris, who has the Dem-allied press eating out of the palm of her hand, Trump would actually have an excuse to avoid live press Q&As: The national media is overwhelmingly, and openly, hostile toward him, his supporters and the rest of the GOP (except, of course, for any Republican willing to dump on Trump). On top of his presser this week, Trump’s sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Time in April and another with Bloomberg Businessweek in July. He took fire from multiple directions at the July 31 National Association for Black Journalists convention. That’s how a democracy is supposed to work: Candidates face tough questions on their policies, record and vision for the country from watchdogs in the press, so come election time, Americans know what they’re getting. Yet Harris won’t even get near a media lapdog. J.D. Vance joined his ticket less than a month before she moved to the top of hers; Vance’s wife has since done more interviews than Harris. The veep won’t even flip-flop in her own voice: All her disclaimers of past radical positions have come via campaign flacks and press releases. Plainly, she’s afraid to try explaining why she held her looniest positions, let alone why she’s switched (at least until November). Let alone having to explain why, now that she’s promised to bring grocery prices down on her first day as prez, she can’t do anything about it now. Is Joe standing in the way? Democrats and their media pals have been talking up “saving democracy” for years now, yet they’re colluding in the least democratic presidential contest our lifetimes, and our parents’, too. Vance has taken to posting a count of how many days since Kamala faced the press; we don’t expect that to shame her into action, but we have some hope our colleagues will wake up and realize how badly they’re damaging their own brands, and the nation. Voters will start to wonder, too: If she can’t face down, say, Britt Hume or Peter Doocy, how will she possibly face Vladimir Putin? Seriously, and sincerely, Kam: You can do this, and you’re going to have to; putting it off too long only risks a disastrous performance too late in the game to recover.","summary":"On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris said she wanted to \"get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/opinion/kamalas-vague-promise-of-upcoming-interview-is-an-offensive-joke/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-v39b01f1o-1723242778111.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723228430&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:18:53","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":253790298,"title":"Trump's plane diverted in Montana due to mechanical issue","text":"Former President Donald Trump's plane was forced to divert its landing in Montana Friday due to a mechanical issue, a law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News.

Trump's plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, according to Jenny Mockel, administrative assistant at Billings Logan International Airport. Mockel said the former president was continuing to Bozeman via private jet. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Trump's campaign posted a video of him upon landing in which he said he was glad to be in Montana but did not mention anything about the landing. The former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Tester has tried to convince voters he's aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She's drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice-presidential nominee. Trump's only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops \"stupid.\" \"I don't have to go there because I'm leading those states,\" he said. \"I'm going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.\" He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado. Trump could be decisive in Montana's Senate race Friday's rally at Montana State University, which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president's bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy's on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin. \"There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,\" Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business. Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester's. Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He's also become a prolific fundraiser. The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator. Trump's drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker's work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump's personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson's nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department Then-president Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by three percentage points. Tester has positioned himself apart from national Democrats Before Trump's latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he's part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans' issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed. Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party's presidential candidate in the wake of Biden's withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana \"farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,\" campaign spokesperson Harry Child said. The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That's also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over two percentage points. A similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump. Harris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown's 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law. Friday's rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career. He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale. Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines. \"Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,\" Seifert said. \"For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.\" But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was \"responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris\" because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California. Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap.

Trump’s plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, according to Jenny Mockel, administrative assistant at Billings Logan International Airport. Mockel said the former president was continuing to Bozeman via private jet. Trump’s campaign posted a video of him upon landing in which he said he was glad to be in Montana but did not mention anything about the landing. The former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Tester has tried to convince voters he’s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester’s opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She’s drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice presidential nominee. Trump’s only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops “stupid.” “I don’t have to go there because I’m leading those states,” he said. “I’m going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.” He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado. Trump could be decisive in Montana’s Senate race Friday’s rally at Montana State University, which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president’s bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy’s on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin. “There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,” Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business. Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester’s. Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He’s also become a prolific fundraiser. The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator. Trump’s drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker’s work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump’s personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson’s nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department Then-President Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by 3 percentage points. Tester has positioned himself apart from national Democrats Before Trump’s latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he’s part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans’ issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed. Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party’s presidential candidate in the wake of Biden’s withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana “farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,” campaign spokesperson Harry Child said. The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That’s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points.

More than 13 percent of Americans, or roughly 41 million people, have worked at a McDonald’s restaurant at some point in their lives. That includes Kamala Harris, who worked at a restaurant for a summer while she was in college. Harris mentioned her brief stint on the fryer when she joined the picket line with fast food workers in Las Vegas in 2019 and during an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show in April. (Her order? “Quarter pounder with cheese and fries,” and barbecue sauce for dipping if she gets McNuggets). Now, the Democratic presidential candidate’s campaign is nodding to her summer job to highlight her upbringing and a platform to boost American workers that stands in stark contrast to her Republican rival Donald Trump, who “has no plan to help the middle class — just more tax cuts for billionaires,” according to a recent ad. McDonald’s is all over influential Americans’ resumes (former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have also worked in McDonald’s restaurants), but service worker labor unions and fast food employees have been leading nationwide efforts to improve working conditions for lower-wage workers, including calls to boost the federal hourly minimum wage to at least $15. They could soon have a powerful advocate in one of their former coworkers. Harris — who has earned endorsements from several influential unions, including Service Employees International Union, which supported the nationwide Fight for $15 campaign — stood with striking McDonald’s workers and protesters as she was launching her first presidential campaign. “If we want to talk about these golden arches being a symbol of the best of America, well, the arches are falling short,” she said from Las Vegas in June 2019. “We have got to recognize that working people deserve livable wages.” “I did the french fries and I did the ice cream,” she told workers. “There was not a family relying on me to pay the rent, put food on the table and keep the bills paid by the end of the month,” she added. “But the reality of McDonald’s is that a majority of the folk who are working there today are relying on that income to sustain a household and a family.” Fast food jobs are often denigrated as temporary employment for teenagers looking for summer work, echoing Republicans’ “bootstraps” mentality that frequently overlooks the more than 3 million fast food workers across the US; in 2022, the typical fast food worker was a 26-year-old woman making just over $13 an hour, according to federal labor data. McDonald’s corporate-owned restaurants raised their hourly wage up to $17 in 2021, though roughly 95 percent of the company’s 14,000 restaurants are independently owned, with separate wage rates. The company has stated that it recognizes workers’ rights to join a union. When President Joe Biden tapped her as his running mate in 2020, Harris renewed her support for raising the federal minimum hourly wage to $15, which is nearly double the current minimum wage of $7.25 — which has not been raised since 2009. “Raising the minimum wage is about the floor and not the ceiling,” she said during a virtual rally with fast food workers and Senator Bernie Sanders in October 2020. Most states have raised their minimum wages above the federal minimum, but $7.25 an hour remains the minimum wage in 20 others. Georgia and Wyoming have set their minimum to just $5.15, lower than the federal rate, which applies instead. Raising the federally set minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour would lift nearly 1 million people out of poverty and raise wages for more than 30 million Americans, according to the federal government’s nonpartisan budget office. Congress failed to approve a minimum wage hike as part of a larger COVID-19 aid package in 2021. The vice president, who acts as the Senate’s presiding officer, was under pressure from a group of congressional Democrats at the time to ignore nonbinding guidance that the measure could be included in that legislation. Fast food workers in California won a major victory earlier this year with a measure that raises the hourly minimum wage to $20. The state also has the first fast food workers union, through the Service Employees International Union, after more than a decade of labor battles and strikes at 450 restaurants to have a seat at the table. The Raise the Wage Act, which has stalled in a deadlocked Congress, would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2029. The subminimum wage for tipped workers – which is set at $2.13 an hour — would effectively be eliminated by 2030. Harris co-sponsored a version of that legislation when she was a senator. Nearly 30 percent of US workers, roughly 44 million people, make less than $17 per hour, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The “real” value of the federal minimum wage has gradually declined, reaching a 66-year low in 2023, with its buying power worth 42 percent less than it did at its highest point in 1968, according to the think tank. “This significant loss in purchasing power means that the federal minimum wage today is nowhere close to a living wage,” according to a 2023 report. A “real” minimum wage — if it kept pace with inflation and productivity growth — would be $23 an hour by now, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Vice President Harris is the daughter of a working mother and worked at a McDonald’s to put herself through college,” according to a statement from campaign senior spokesperson Lauren Hitt. “She knows what middle-class families go through,” she added. “Donald Trump, on the other hand, is running to give more handouts to his ultra-wealthy friends at the expense of working Americans. That’s the contrast voters are going to see between now and Election Day.”","summary":"Fast food workers fighting for union recognition, higher minimum wages and better working conditions could have a powerful advocate in a former fellow french fry cook, Alex Woodward reports","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-mcdonalds-minimum-wage-b2594233.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/09/19/mc-copy.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 23:07:39","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.293},{"id":253789742,"title":"Joe Rogan denies endorsing RFK Jr. for president, says he only meant to say he likes him 'as a person’","text":"Podcast host Joe Rogan clarified that his recent comments praising Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a presidential candidate were not an endorsement. After saying the independent 2024 presidential candidate is the \"only one that makes sense to me,\" the host of the \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" posted on X Friday that the comments weren’t meant to be taken as an official endorsement, but only his opinion on how much he likes RFK Jr. \"For the record, this isn’t an endorsement. This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence,\" Rogan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Rogan’s post tried to stem the controversy generated by the earlier statements he made during his show. During his podcast, Rogan called out what he believes is 'dirty politics\" being played by both Democrats and Republicans in the 2024 campaign. \"That's politics. They do it on the left. They do it on the right. They gaslight you, they manipulate you. They promote narratives,\" Rogan said. He then praised RFK for being \"the only\" candidate that doesn’t engage in those tactics.

Kennedy Jr.,\" Rogan said, noting that he’s \"a fan.\" \"He's the only one that makes sense to me. He doesn't attack people. He attacks actions and ideas. He’s much more reasonable and intelligent.\" he added. Rogan’s comments went viral and took heat from pro-Trump circles on social media that condemned him for endorsing RFK over former President Trump. Even Trump himself blasted the podcast host and UFC commentator on his platform, Truth Social, writing, \"It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024.\" Rogan did damage control Friday afternoon, reposting a clip of his statements and declaring that he was only saying how much he likes RFK because of his \"civility and intelligence.\" \"I think we could use more of that in this world,\" he added. Rogan also added some praise for Trump, particularly for the way he handled the assassination attempt on him last month. \"I also think Trump raising his fist and saying ‘fight!’ after getting shot is one of the most American f------ things of all time,\" Rogan said, before advising his fans to listen to other people on political topics – like his friend, comic Dave Smith JOE ROGAN SUGGESTS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS THE STAFF: ‘SO RIDICULOUS’ \"I’m not the guy to get political information from. If you want that from a comic, go to @ComicDaveSmith. He actually knows what he’s talking about.\" Smith – also an avowed libertarian – sounded off shortly after Rogan set the record straight. He rebuked pro-Trump accounts and Trump himself, saying, \"Trump supporters have a lot of nerve flipping out because @joerogan said some nice things about RFK. During the greatest assault on liberty in modern US history, Trump praised lockdowns, demonized countries not locking down and brags to this day about the bs vax.\" Smith then backed up his friend: \"Rogan, on the other hand, had the biggest platform in the country and relentlessly exposed the entire con for what it was, in heroic fashion. I’m not endorsing Bobby Kennedy (neither is Joe btw) but he can support whoever the hell he wants to and if people who are voting for President lockdown warp speed have a problem, maybe they should consider the possibility that their guy should be less awful on stuff.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Podcast host Joe Rogan recently clarified that he has not endorsed Robert F.

Mostly about their parents. Or the politicians they want to elect as their surrogate Mama and Papa. As soon as Tim Walz was selected by Kamala Harris as her running mate, social media users started casting the progressive in Carhartt and camo as their make-believe father. “Tim Walz is the dad an entire generation wish they had instead of the one they lost to Fox News,” read one viral tweet by the X user coketweet. In the Minnesota guv, many see a perfect parental match for Harris — whom Drew Barrymore, in April, begged to “hug” the country. “I keep thinking in my head that we all need a mom,” Barrymore told Harris on her talk show. “But in our country, we need you to be Momala of the country.” What back then could have been brushed off as Barrymore’s own well-documented mommy issues has now become the overwhelmingly dominant sentiment of the left. Their mission is to elect Ma and Pa America — someone to hug them and soothe them. A pair to gentle-parent Dems to a better, more virtuous life, and maybe quietly slip them a beer if they’re a good boy or girl. As Liz Whitmer Gereghty, the sister of Michigan governor Gretchen Whtimer wrote on X: “So it will be a contest between Dems with serious cool parent vibes who would totally pick you up in the middle of the night to get you home safely vs the people they warned you about.” When did we all become so childish and submissive? We are supposed to be electing leaders who can stare down foreign despots, clean up a crisis at the border, ease inflation and make 15 tough decisions in a day. Not validate our feelings. This universe of neediness and imagined intimacy reveals the deep delusion of our unhealthy political culture. Elected officials — perfect strangers — are not your family. And your family is way more important than some narcissist with a government pension. Yet many newly-minted Walz fans are creating fan fiction about their dream daddy. Tiktok influencer Pamela Wurst Vetrini went viral with a video in which she says Walz “represents the dad that a lot of liberal women lost. A lot of us had moderate to conservative educated, sensible fathers that we lost to Rush Limbaugh, that we lost to Fox News. That we lost to Donald Trump and the cult of conservatism.” Meanwhile romance novel author Emily Rath cranked out her own seven-minute reel about the feelings Walz stirs in her. Through tears, she says that her father is a former fighter pilot with a chemistry degree from the Air Force Academy. Yet he “denounces climate change and basic facts about medicine … He is so smart … And to see what politics has done to him.” In my day, girls with daddy issues became strippers. Now they become insufferable progressive influencers. Maybe it’s time to call your dad instead of bashing him online. I understand that many people have replaced religion with politics and practice it fervently. But imagine having a father who is walking this Earth right now, alive and well, and trashing him over politics. Life is too short, family is too precious. Maybe these dads are difficult, but I guarantee these women — hardened ideologues — are too. Your relationship with your parents was not forged in cable news, so why let it die there? Also, Walz becoming Veep will not heal said relationship. Much of the media is reveling in this Walz “papa” fest. The Washington Post breathlessly tweeted about a $40 camo hat sold by the Harris/Walz campaign, calling it “a send-up of the Minnesota governor’s trademark Midwestern dad fashion, giving MAGA a run for its money.” Meanwhile, a Salon story declared, “Tim Walz’s normal dad energy is causing MAGA to come unglued.” But it’s mostly unglued folks on the left, who are creating familial fantasies about Harris and Walz. Sure, leaders and candidates can have maternal or paternal characteristics that endear them to us. But to form this parental attachment is creepy. It’s infantilizing and smacks of craving authoritarianism. These leaders ultimately work for you, the taxpayer. Personally, I don’t want any politician from the right or left as my parents. Though maybe some of these Dems simply want to recreate their childhood, where Mom and Dad paid for everything — but this time on the government’s dime. After all, as Walz on the recent “White Dudes for Harris” Zoom call said: “One person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness.”","summary":"Imagine having a father who is walking this Earth right now, alive and well, and trashing him over politics.

Now celebrities are crawling out of the woodwork to join Kamalapalooza—including Uma Thurman, John Legend, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kerry Washington. And if the Democratic Party planners’ dreams come true? Beyoncé herself will be there in person to sing “Freedom” live as Kamala Harris formally accepts the nomination that delegates to the convention have already bestowed her. Queen Bey has already granted the Harris campaign permission to make her 2016 hit the theme song for the first ever Black female presidential nominee, and she is widely rumored to be the headliner on Thursday, August 22, the last night of the convention, when Harris will take the stage to give her acceptance speech. That type of star power would have been a big stretch for a Biden-fronted convention. Legend, who is married to the arguably more famous Chrissy Teigen, did not initially commit when asked to perform at the DNC when Joe Biden was still the nominee. That changed when Biden exited the race and Harris became the headliner on the Democratic ticket to take on Donald Trump in November. “They never said ‘no’ with Biden, just didn’t ever give an answer,” one source familiar with the discussions told The Daily Beast. And Louis-Dreyfus, who previously performed a series of comedy bits during Biden’s virtual convention in 2020 and has taken on new significance this time around with the resurgence of her HBO series Veep, seemed even more enthused about showing up for Harris in person this time, telling The Times of London that she will be “extra-involved” in the Harris campaign through to Election Day. It’s safe to say, DNC officials would love to see Beyoncé be part of history. DNC Chair Minyon Moore wrote in an op-ed for the Grio this week, “It’s hard to overstate the significance of this moment, for the first time ever—a Black woman has secured the presidential nomination of a major party. But history doesn’t just happen—it’s made. And it’s important for us to remember how we got here.” Other celebrities and musicians expected to attend this year’s convention, set to begin on August 19 in the Windy City, The Daily Beast hears, include Oscar nominees Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction) and Octavia Spencer (The Help), the vocal harmony group Boyz II Men, and a slew of actors who are members of the Creative Coalition, a nonpartisan arts advocacy organization. The group’s delegation will be led by Tim Daly and includes Thurman, Uzo Aduba, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Anthony Anderson, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Busy Philipps, Jon Cryer, David Cross, Yolonda Ross, Iain Armitage, Chris Witaske and Danai Gurira. “Four weeks ago, we had a modicum of interest from the 51st State of Hollywood,” Robin Bronk, the CEO of the Creative Coalition, tells the Daily Beast. “Now we have a waiting list.” In fact, Bronk adds, “Everyone wants to get on our list.” The Democratic National Convention did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment about whether Beyoncé or other big-name celebrities would be performing or attending the event. Similar requests for comment to stars like George Clooney and Tom Hanks did not receive a response. Even if the Beyoncé rumors end up being too good to be true for Democrats, this year’s DNC is shaping up to be a repeat of Barack Obama’s first star-studded convention that drew major A-listers to Denver including Sting, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez (back when “Bennifer” meant Jennifer Garner), Spike Lee, Scarlett Johansson, and many other big names. On the final night, leading up to Obama’s nomination speech, Jennifer Hudson belted the national anthem and artists like Steve Wonder and Sheryl Crow wowed the Mile High stadium crowd. So while concerned pundits had been warning that this year’s DNC in Chicago could serve as a bad flashback to the chaos of 1968 that presaged Richard Nixon’s landslide victory, it could end up looking a lot more like the convention that helped American make history in 2008. — Additional reporting by Mini Racker","summary":"Photo Illustration by Erin O'Flynn/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesA month ago, Hollywood was ho-hum about the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this month.

Jon Tester.Tester has tried to convince voters he’s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester's opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She's drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice presidential nominee.Trump's only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops “stupid.\"“I don’t have to go there because I’m leading those states,” he said. “I’m going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.”He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado.Trump could be decisive in Montana's Senate raceFriday's rally at Montana State University, which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president's bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy's on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin.“There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,\" Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business.Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester’s.Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He's also become a prolific fundraiser.The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents.For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator.Trump’s drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker’s work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump’s personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson's nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs DepartmentThen-President Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by 3 percentage points.Tester has positioned himself apart from national DemocratsBefore Trump's latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he's part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans' issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed.Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party's presidential candidate in the wake of Biden's withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana “farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,” campaign spokesperson Harry Child said.The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That’s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points.A similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump.Harris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown's 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law.Friday's rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career.He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale.Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year.Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines.“Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,” Seifert said. “For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.”But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was “responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris” because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California.Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana’s airwaves.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-plane-heading-to-montana-rally-was-diverted-but-landed-safely-nearby-airport-staff-says/articleshow/112413421.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-112413526/112413526.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:31:40","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":253789748,"title":"JD Vance's awkward troll of Kamala Harris is another giant fail","text":"This was the first week of the new 2024 presidential election, with a big kickoff for the Democrats’ team of Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz filled with huge rallies and surging polls. The Trump team had an answer for all that: showboating Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s weird running mate. It was a bad answer. The Trump strategy to detract attention from Harris was for Vance to shadow her this week, showing up wherever Harris and Walz went and having his own events—not rallies, because there’s no way he could draw a crowd, but “press appearances.” He was supposed to draw attention away from Harris and Walz with attacks. But he just came across as a weird stalker—even to Republicans. It did nothing to put a dent in Harris’ campaign. Her approval rating continues to surge, as does her polling head-to-head against Trump. Her rallies are huge, much to Trump’s dismay, and her fundraising has been massive. Harris’ headlines reflect all that: Just for comparison: Meanwhile, barring an appearance in Montana on Friday, Trump plans to stay off the campaign trail until at least after the Democratic National Convention ends on Aug. 22. No word yet on what’s planned for Vance. They might have decided to keep his appearances more private, since this week was pretty much a disaster for him. His “awkward” and “bizarre” stunt on the airport tarmac in Wisconsin stands out as the most memorable part of his week on the stump. He was all bluster, telling reporters, “I just wanted to check out my future plane,” and claiming that he “wanted to go say hello to the vice president and ask her why does she refuse to answer questions.” That too was a flop. All Vance got out of it was more bad press—“‘Creepy!’ CNN Morning Crew Torches Trump Pick Vance Over ‘Bizarre’ Kamala Harris Plane Stunt’”—and a roasting on social media. Like getting dragged by Liz Cheney. “Weird” is now baked in when it comes to Vance, and it’s showing. He’s even more unpopular now than just after he was picked, when he entered the race as “the first guy immediately following a convention—a VP pick—who actually had a net negative favorable rating, that is underwater,” according to CNN data analyst Harry Enten.

But according to one election expert, Vice President Kamala Harris has a much more varied path to a 270-vote Electoral College majority. In a Friday interview with MSNBC, Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics said that thanks to growing enthusiasm around her candidacy, Harris is positioned well to win not only toss-up states like those in the Midwest, but also in other states that were previously favorable to former President Donald Trump. Sabato said one example is Georgia, which President Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 by less than 12,000 votes. \"Most of the Georgia experts we know and check with felt that Georgia was clearly leaning to Trump for most of this year, even before Biden's troubles, but that isn't true any longer,\" Sabato said. \"[T]hose very same people — some of them Republicans — think it's a very competitive state, that Georgia could go either way.

He noted that even though former President Barack Obama won the Tar Heel State in 2008, he lost it in 2012, and it's remained in Republican hands since then. Harris winning the state would be a major victory, as North Carolina has voted for Republican presidential candidates in all but two elections dating back to 1976. And according to Sabato, North Carolina Republicans nominating an \"extreme\" candidate in this year's gubernatorial race in the form of Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson could end up providing additional turnout from the state's more liberal voters who hope to keep the governorship in Democratic hands. \"That's one we're really watching. That is normally a Republican state,\" he said. \"The demographics in North Carolina are changing, and those who have professional degrees of one sort or another are becoming more dominant in certain parts of North Carolina.\" \"Some Republicans get turned off by the gubernatorial candidate, and they may not be excited about Donald Trump, and they may not vote,\" he added. \"So, will that happen? I don't know yet, it's too early to say. But it's certainly worth watching.\" READ MORE: Biden 'heavily' investing in these 3 states that are 'key to the whole election': analysis The Georgia electorate in 2020 not only delivered the Electoral College to Democrats, but also flipped two Republican-held U.S. Senate seats. The 2020 election and the 2021 runoff resulted in the Peach State voting for a Democratic presidential candidate and elected two Democratic senators for the first time in more than three decades. However, Georgia's Republican-dominated state government has since made adjustments to state election law that will make a Democratic victory in 2024 that much more difficult. Earlier this month, Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger announced the rollout of a new website allowing any Georgian to challenge a voter registration in the Peach State. This is an accordance with a controversial new law passed by the GOP-controlled state legislature and signed into law by Brian Kemp allowing a Georgia resident to challenge an unlimited number of voter registrations.

Friday’s rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career. He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale. Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year. Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines. “Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,” Seifert said. “For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.” But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was “responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris” because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California. Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana’s airwaves.

Didn't happen, Willie Brown says","text":"WASHINGTON -- Former President Donald Trump mixed up two prominent politicians from California when he told a harrowing tale of almost crashing in a helicopter. During a meandering press conference Thursday riddled with false and misleading statements, Trump recalled riding as a passenger in the chopper with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown when it was forced to make an emergency landing. The comments were in response to a question about a relationship between Brown and Vice President Kamala Harris three decades ago. MORE: Trump lashes out about Harris crowd size, attacks her intelligence at press conference But Brown has never shared a helicopter with Trump, the former mayor said. Instead, it was former California Gov. Jerry Brown who rode with Trump in a helicopter in 2018 to survey wildfire damage, and no emergency landing was reported. \"I know Willie Brown very well,\" Mr. Trump said about the alleged incident. \"In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought maybe this was the end.\" He went on: \"We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing.\" Trump said Brown also told him \"terrible things\" about Harris. \"He was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\" But Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle that he's never been in a helicopter with Trump. \"You would have known if I had gone down on a helicopter with Trump,\" Brown told the paper. The longtime Democratic politician said he has never disparaged Harris to Trump, either. MORE: Trump says he has agreed to offer from ABC News to debate Harris \"Hell, no,\" Brown said. \"I wouldn't say anything bad about any woman to him.\" Former California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and Trump did ride in a helicopter to survey wildfire damage in 2018. But no problems with the flight were reported. Current Gov. Gavin Newsom was also on the aircraft. A spokesperson for the Democrat, Izzy Gardon, said Friday there was no problem with the flight, no emergency landing, and no conversation about Harris. The two Browns each have public-sector careers spanning decades in California. Willie Brown, 90, is Black. Jerry Brown, 86, is white. Willie Brown's long-ago relationship with Harris has resurfaced since she became the Democratic nominee for the White House. Now that Trump faces her in his bid for a second term, he and other Republicans have used the relationship to lob attacks suggesting Harris didn't earn her political positions legitimately. Brown was serving as speaker of the California State Assembly in the 1990s when he and Harris were in a relationship. Brown had separated from his wife in 1982. Harris, 59, spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016. She has been married to Doug Emhoff since 2014. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt declined to explain the discrepancies in Trump's story when asked about it Friday on Newsmax. \"I would just refer you to President Trump's statement and what he said yesterday,\" Leavitt said. \"The president has a lot of amazing stories from his life.\"","summary":"Former President Donald Trump mixed up former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and former California Governor Jerry Brown when he told a harrowing tale of almost crashing in a helicopter... which didn't happen.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/donald-trump-willie-brown-jerrry-helicopter-emergency-landing-didnt-happen/15166137/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15166197_080924-kgo-trump-willie-jerry-img.png?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:16:57","author":"David Klepper Associated Press","authors":["David Klepper Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":253788894,"title":"Trump Says His Campaign Attracts More People Than Harris' and Claims His Crowd is as Big as MLK Jr.’s","text":"Donald Trump, never one to shy away from controversy, recently shot down concerns about Vice President Kamala Harris’ growing crowd sizes during her campaign stops. During a feisty press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump expressed agitation at the media’s portrayal of Harris as a rising star and boasted about the turnout at his own rallies instead, claiming they are 30 times larger. When a reporter asked Trump if he was worried about the attendance at Harris’ events, Trump remarked, “Oh, give me a break.” As per the Daily Mail, the press conference comes at a time when the Trump campaign has been increasingly critical of Harris, especially her lack of media engagement since announcing her candidacy. Glibly, Trump said, “What a stupid question. This [is] because I am leading by a lot…I’m doing tremendous amounts of taping here. We have commercials that are at a level I don't think that anybody has ever done before…I see many of you in the room where I’m speaking to you on the phone. I’m speaking on the radio. I’m speaking on television. Television is coming here. Excuse me, what are we doing right now? She is not doing any news conferences...She’s not smart enough to do a news conference.” Trump accusing the media of unfairly propping up Harris by exaggerating her crowd sizes, exclaimed, “Listen, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey, you didn't report it. I'm so glad you asked, what does she have in your city? 2,000 people? If I ever had 2000 people, you'd say my campaign is finished…It's dishonest – the press…And here's a great example. I had in Michigan recently, 25,000 people, and 25,000 people we just couldn't get them in. We had in Harrisburg, 20–25,000 people, and 20,000 people couldn't get in. We had so many – nobody ever mentions that. And when she gets 1,500 people – and I saw it yesterday on ABC, they say, 'Oh the crowd was so big' – I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size…And they never say the crowd was big. That's why I'm always saying, turn around the cameras.” As per NBC News, perhaps the most delusional moment of Trump’s press conference was the comparison of his crowd sizes to those of Civil Rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. Rambling, Trump claimed, “The biggest crowd I've ever spoken to was that day, and I'll tell you, it's very hard to tell. It's the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to and I've spoken to the biggest crowds.\" He continued, \"Nobody spoke to crowds bigger than to me. When we look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, the same everything, the same number of people, if not we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people. My crowd, we actually had more people...They said I had 25,000 and he had a million people, and I'm okay with it because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.”","summary":"Trump said, “I’m doing tremendous amounts of taping here.

Jensen, a Republican and COVID-19 skeptic, was endorsed by Donald Trump when he vied to unseat Walz during the heated 2022 race. He described his former opponent as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” who had no problem going back on his word to advance his political agenda. Walz, 60, boasted that he “can’t wait” to debate Donald Trump’s VP pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance – but Jensen warned that the face-off may never even happen. “My advice to JD Vance is I wouldn’t want to make a hotel reservation and make sure it’s not refundable,” Jensen quipped. “If it’s politically strategic, I think he’ll do it regardless of what he told people he will do,” he added of the possibility that Walz could decide not to debate his opponent in the end. “That’s just the way he does politics.” Jensen, 69, got a sense of Walz’s slippery tendencies in the run-up to Election Day in 2022, he said. In the months before the election, Walz supposedly told the press “‘we’ll have more debates, absolutely,’” Jensen recalled. The pair ultimately faced off in three debates but opponents “never had any statewide televised debate,” Jensen lamented. “We had a localized [debate]….that was not allowed to be televised here in the two major cities of Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul,” he claimed. “He basically went back on his word.” The Oct. 18, 2022 televised debate was filmed at a TV station in Rochester, according to MPR News. The showdown was aired live on Gray Television studios outside the Twin Cities — and was only streamed online throughout the state, the outlet said. The Republican also said Walz has a reputation within his adopted home state of being able to emerge from scandal or negativity curiously unscathed. “In Minnesota, I think an awful lot of people feel like anything he does wrong just never sticks,” the doctor said. “He dilly-dallies around in terms of calling the National Guard in helping out the Twin Cities. In the end, it’s Mayor Frey’s fault because he didn’t fill out the correct paperwork or it’s the troops themselves,” he said, referring to the controversy over when and how Walz called in the National Guard during the protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in 2020. “When he closed down schools in many areas for more than a year during COVID and schools didn’t perform as well, it wasn’t his fault. It was the students’ fault,” Jensen added. “He has an ability to slide out from underneath difficult situations. He’s very skilled at that.” Jensen is just the latest to criticize Walz in the wake of his debut as Harris’ would-be veep. Over the past few days, the governor has come under fire for his military record – including claims that he left his National Guard unit in the lurch on the brink of deployment – and renewed criticism over his handling of the destructive 2020 protests. JD Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, jumped into the fray when he accused Walz of “stolen valor” for some of his comments about his military experience. Harris was asked about the barrage of detractors on Thursday. “Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country. And I think that we all should,” Harris told reporters. Harris and Walz are expected to appear together Friday night for a rally at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona – the latest stop on their whirlwind tour of battleground states in the wake of their ticket debut in Philadelphia Tuesday night. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, batted down Walz’s viral comments that the Republican Party was “weird” as a “smokescreen.” “There’s so much weirdness with just their obsession with tearing down so much of the cultural norms. It’s just, it’s a smokescreen. They’re trying to, they said they’re trying to ‘David Copperfield’ their way out of some really, really terrible policies,” a Trump official told The Post in West Palm Beach on Wednesday.","summary":"Dr. Scott Jensen ran against TIm Walz in the 2022 Michigan gubernatorial election.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/us-news/tim-walzs-2022-opponent-blasts-vp-pick-as-wold-in-sheeps-clothing/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87487138.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:14:03","author":"Olivia Land,Steven Vago","authors":["Olivia Land","Steven Vago"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.522},{"id":253788340,"title":"Trump’s plane forced to land in Billings, Montana, after mechanical failure","text":"Former President Donald Trump’s plane was forced to be rerouted and landed in Billings, Montana, after a mechanical failure.

How does a sub-par vice president get transformed nearly instantaneously into a joyful performer who can do no wrong? It’s easy. As the 20th century writer and strategist James Burnham put it, “Where there is no alternative, there is no problem”: Since there was no alternative to pumping up Harris to star status (or the only alternative would be to sub out Joe Biden for a barely replacement-level politician), she’s now inspirational, hip and beguilingly moderate. In other words, Kamala has reversed the usual dynamic for being considered a JFK- or Obama-level political talent: She is great because she’s the Democratic nominee; she’s not the Democratic nominee because she’s great. If Joe Biden had done the responsible thing and stepped aside last year, there presumably would have been a contested nomination battle. Kamala would have been the favorite and perhaps would have won the nomination. But she would have had to fight for it — doing town halls and interviews, participating in debates, defending her record, dealing with media scrutiny, and winning the support of real voters. Securing a nomination is a major accomplishment, and there’s usually a moment when even the weakest nominee looks like he might have something going on. Back in 1988, it was, Wow — Michael Dukakis is leading George H.W. Bush by 17 points. In 1996: Maybe this Jack Kemp pick has injected the sense of energy into the ticket that Bob Dole needs. Etc. Kamala didn’t have to prove her chops this way. To the contrary, that she did nothing to win the Democratic nomination has perversely smoothed her way to stardom. A real nomination process would likely have exposed Kamala or at least would have made the current cocoon impossible. (She hasn’t done a formal TV interview since June 24, and one Harris ally has suggested she won’t do another until after Labor Day.) All her positions would have been litigated, and any change in policy would have been seized on and denounced by fellow Democrats. In the context of a primary, the media would have been happy to cover all the contention and ask the tough questions — for all we know, they might even have become vested in some candidate other than Kamala. By fast-forwarding past the primaries and caucuses, Kamala went directly into a race with the hated Donald Trump, where the media is inevitably deeply committed to her. Meanwhile, she hasn’t had to interact with voters in settings where she’s going to get challenged; hasn’t had to do dozens of interviews fighting for attention with other Democrats; and hasn’t seen, as nominees often do, key lines of attack against her developed by intramural party competitors. Because trying to have a competitive process after Biden stepped aside would have been too difficult, she was simply selected. Yet she is being treated like she swept through the primaries and caucuses like a unstoppable political phenomenon, when she still has never run in a national Democratic primary. (She got out too early in 2019 and got in too late in 2024.) The sheer fact of her ascension created the incentive for Democrats and the media to declare her great. In reality, she’s a cardboard cutout of a politician whose main political talent is being able to, just barely, simulate determination, passion and mirth while reading from a teleprompter. Insulated from personal interactions with voters and from media scrutiny, running against an unpopular former president, and boosted by a party and press that have no alternative but to invest all their hopes in her, she is suddenly more than the sum of her parts. Coach Walz, as Kamala dubbed her running mate, Tim Walz, may have told his football players at some point that “there’s no substitute for going out and earning it.” Kamala 2024 is a testament to the fact that, actually, there is.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump headed to Montana for a Friday night rally in hopes of ousting the state’s Democratic senator, but his plane first had to divert to an airport on the other side of the Rocky Mountains because of a mechanical issue, according to airport staff. Trump’s plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, according to Jenny Mockel, administrative assistant at Billings Logan International Airport. Mockel said the former president was continuing to Bozeman via private jet. Trump’s campaign posted a video of him upon landing in which he said he was glad to be in Montana but did not mention anything about the landing. The former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Tester has tried to convince voters he’s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester’s opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She’s drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice presidential nominee. Trump’s only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops “stupid.” “I don’t have to go there because I’m leading those states,” he said. “I’m going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.” He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado. Trump could be decisive in Montana’s Senate race Friday’s rally at Montana State University, which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president’s bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy’s on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin. “There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,” Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business. Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester’s. Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He’s also become a prolific fundraiser. The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator. Trump’s drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker’s work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump’s personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson’s nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department Then-President Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor. Rosendale lost by 3 percentage points. Tester has positioned himself apart from national Democrats Before Trump’s latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he’s part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans’ issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed. Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party’s presidential candidate in the wake of Biden’s withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana “farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,” campaign spokesperson Harry Child said. The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That’s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points. A similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump. Harris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown’s 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law. Friday’s rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career. He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale. Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year. Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines. “Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,” Seifert said. “For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.” But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was “responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris” because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California. Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana’s airwaves. __ Associated Press reporter Julie Smyth contributed from Columbus, Ohio.","summary":"Trump’s plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, an airport officials said.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/08/09/trump-plane-heading-to-montana-rally-was-diverted-but-landed-safely-nearby-airport-staff-says/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Trump_02149.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:09:16","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":253788018,"title":"Trump plane heading to Montana rally was diverted but landed safely nearby, airport staff says","text":"By MATTHEW BROWN and AMY BETH HANSON, Associated Press BOZEMAN, Mont.

Tester has positioned himself apart from national Democrats Before Trump’s latest visit, Tester has sought to insulate himself against charges that he’s part of the Democratic establishment by rolling out the names of Republicans who support him, including former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. His campaign highlighted more than 20 pieces of legislation, many dealing with veterans’ issues, that Tester sponsored and Trump signed. Tester also was the sole Democratic delegate from Montana to withhold a vote backing Harris as the party’s presidential candidate in the wake of Biden’s withdrawal. And when the Democratic National Convention takes place later this month in Chicago, Tester will be back in Montana “farming and meeting face to face with Montanans,” campaign spokesperson Harry Child said. The last time Tester attended the Democratic National Convention was in 2008. That’s also the last time a Democratic presidential candidate came anywhere near winning Montana, with President Barack Obama losing by just over 2 percentage points. A similar situation is developing in Ohio, where three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown faces a tough race in a state expected to vote for Trump. Harris visited Ohio when the two were Senate colleagues to raise money for Brown’s 2018 campaign, but Brown has said he has no plans to campaign with her this year. Like Tester, Brown has highlighted legislation he worked on that Trump signed into law. Friday’s rally takes place in Gallatin County, which Tester has become increasingly reliant on over the course of his political career. He lost the county in his first Senate race, in 2006, but his support has since grown. A substantial margin of victory in Gallatin in 2018 helped push him ahead of Rosendale. Republican Don Seifert, a former Gallatin County commissioner, said he voted for Tester that year and plans to do so again this year. Seifert backed Trump in 2016 and said he has continued to support other Republicans, including Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines. “Montanans tend to vote for the person over the party,” Seifert said. “For the state of Montana, Jon is the one that can do what we need.” But Sheehy says Tester has lost touch with his home state and fallen into step with Democrats in Washington. The Republican said in a message this week to supporters that Tester was “responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris” because he served as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2015 to 2017, when she was elected to the Senate from California. Tester has outraised Sheehy by more than three-to-one in campaign donations reported to the Federal Election Commission. However, outside groups supporting Sheehy have helped the Republican make up much of that gap. Spending in the race is on track to exceed $200 million as advertisements from the two sides saturate Montana’s airwaves. __ Associated Press reporter Julie Smyth contributed from Columbus, Ohio.","summary":"Trump’s plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, an airport officials said.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/09/trump-plane-heading-to-montana-rally-was-diverted-but-landed-safely-nearby-airport-staff-says/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Trump_02149.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:09:16","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":253788920,"title":"Trump plane heading to Montana rally was diverted but landed safely nearby, airport staff says","text":"BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump headed to Montana for a Friday night rally in hopes of ousting the state’s Democratic senator, but his plane first had to divert to an airport on the other side of the Rocky Mountains because of a mechanical issue, according to airport staff. Trump’s plane was en route to Bozeman, Montana, when it was diverted Friday afternoon to Billings, 142 miles to the east, according to Jenny Mockel, administrative assistant at Billings Logan International Airport. Mockel said the former president was continuing to Bozeman via private jet. Trump’s campaign posted a video of him upon landing in which he said he was glad to be in Montana but did not mention anything about the landing. The former president came to Montana hoping to remedy some unfinished business from 2018, when he campaigned repeatedly in Big Sky Country in a failed bid to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. Tester has tried to convince voters he’s aligned with Trump on many issues, mirroring his successful strategy from six years ago. While that worked in a non-presidential election year, it faces a more critical test this fall with Tester’s opponent, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, trying to link the three-term incumbent to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Harris has benefitted nationally from a burst of enthusiasm among core Democratic constituencies, who coalesced quickly around her after President Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign last month. She’s drawn big crowds in swing states, touring this week with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, her choice to be her vice presidential nominee. Trump’s only rally this week, meanwhile, will be in a state he won by 16 percentage points four years ago rather than a November battleground. Facing new pressure in the race from a candidate with surging enthusiasm, Trump on Thursday called questions about his lack of swing state stops “stupid.” “I don’t have to go there because I’m leading those states,” he said. “I’m going because I want to help senators and congressmen get elected.” He will add on fundraising stops in Wyoming and Colorado. Trump could be decisive in Montana’s Senate race Friday’s rally at Montana State University, which is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Mountain time, is expected to draw thousands of GOP supporters. Yet the former president’s bigger impact could be simply having his name above Sheehy’s on the ballot in November, said University of Montana political analyst Rob Saldin. “There is a segment of the electorate that will turn out when Trump is on the ticket,” Saldin said. And that could benefit Sheehy, a Trump supporter and newcomer to politics who made a fortune off an aerial firefighting business. Republicans have been on a roll in Montana for more than a decade and now hold every statewide office except for Tester’s. Tester won each of his previous Senate contests by a narrow margin, casting himself as a plainspoken farmer who builds personal connections with people in Montana and is willing to break with his party on issues that matter to them. He’s also become a prolific fundraiser. The race has drawn national attention with Democrats clinging to a razor-thin majority in the Senate and defending far more seats than the GOP this year. Tester is considered among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. For him to win, large numbers of Trump supporters would have to vote a split ticket and get behind the Democratic senator. Trump’s drive to oust Tester traces back to the lawmaker’s work in 2018 as chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. Tester revealed past misconduct by Trump’s personal physician, Ronny Jackson, that sank Jackson’s nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department Then-President Trump took the matter personally and came to Montana four times to campaign for Republican Matt Rosendale, who was then the state auditor.

Walz, Minnesota’s two-term governor, even doled out cash to the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, which is helmed by the alleged extremist imam, Asad Zaman, the Washington Examiner revealed Friday. The governor’s office has awarded more than $100,000 in funding to the Muslim non-profit in recent years, the outlet found. “Asad Zaman is one of America’s most prominent Islamist voices and has a long history of extreme rhetoric and ideas,” said Sam Westrop, director of the Middle East Forum’s Islamist Watch project, to The Post. “Along with Neo-Nazi conspiracy theories and sharing Hamas press releases mourning the death of a convicted war criminal, Zaman and his organization justified the October 7th attacks against Israeli civilians, releasing a sickening statement the very same day offering ‘unwavering support’ for the Palestinian ‘struggle,” Westrop said. In 2016, Zaman posted a Hamas press release about Motiur Rahman Nizami, a Bangladeshi Islamic leader, when Nizami was hanged in 2016 after being convicted of genocide, rape and torture. As for the October massacre, Zaman, who was born in Bangladesh, has said his organization “stands in solidarity with Palestinians” after the Palestinian terror group Hamas invaded Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis. “MAS reaffirms its unwavering support for the Palestinian people in their struggle against the Israeli occupation,” said Zaman in a Facebook post as details of the horrific attack surfaced. “Israel’s recent unprovoked attacks on Palestinian areas have claimed numerous lives…We call on the US government…to exert maximum pressure on Israel to respect Palestinian lives.” Zaman also reposted an image of a Palestinian flag with the message from fellow St. Paul Muslim community leader Yusuf Abdi Abdulle that the US government “is on the wrong side of history today as it was always by supporting the extremist Zionist regime and its illegal settlements.” A day after the terrorist attacks on Israel, Zaman asked Democratic California Congresswoman Katie Porter, who had condemned the attacks, if she would be willing to “reaffirm the right of Palestinians to defend themselves.” In November 2015, he also posted a link to “The Greatest Story Never Told” — a 2013 neo-Nazi propaganda film praising Hitler that is popular among antisemites and QAnon conspiracy theorists, according to the Middle East Forum. “How could Walz and his staff have failed to conduct the most cursory of checks on the company they keep?” Westrop said, adding that his group first warned about Zaman’s extremist rhetoric and his apparent neo-Nazi sympathies in 2019. “Under Gov. Walz, hundreds of thousands of Minnesotan taxpayers’ dollars have subsidized this hate and radicalism. Which extremists will he end up funding as vice-president?” Zaman along with other Muslim leaders met at the governor’s office in St. Paul last year for a meeting about mosque security, according to the Washington Examiner. He also has met with the governor and delivered speeches beside him on several other occasions, including in 2019, when he gave an invocation before Walz’s state address. Neither Walz’s office nor the imam returned Post requests for comment Friday. Walz is the running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, who took over President Biden’s slot after the 81-year-old commander in chief dropped out of the race over concerns about his mental and physical state.","summary":"The iman \"is one of America’s most prominent Islamist voices and has a long history of extreme rhetoric and ideas,\" said Sam Westrop, director of the Middle East Forum’s Islamist Watch project, to The Post.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/09/us-news/tim-walz-has-hosted-muslim-leader-who-didnt-condemn-oct-7-and-touted-hitler-film/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/democratic-presidential-nominee-vice-president-87269765_9015d6.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 22:01:06","author":"Isabel Vincent","authors":["Isabel Vincent"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":253787888,"title":"Kamala Harris’ Sorority Sisters Launch a PAC","text":"Good sisters always come through.

Tim Walz (D-MN), Vice President Kamala Harris‘s running mate, attended a march with “Abolish ICE” protesters in 2018, a move that goes further than even his partner’s criticism of the government agency. Walz, a veteran and former congressman whom Democrats have portrayed as a Midwesterner with centrist views, marched in the streets of downtown Minneapolis with hundreds of protesters denouncing the Trump administration’s immigration policies, according to the Minneapolis Daily. Walz, who was running for governor at the time, told a separate publication he did not support abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement but did believe in “majorly reforming” it. Other notable attendees at the “Free our Future” protest included Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, gubernatorial candidate and Rep. Erin Murphy (D-MN), and Rep. Peggy Flanagan (D-MN). The protest came days after the Trump administration rescinded its “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, an action that resulted in parents and children being separated while in Border Patrol custody for the adults to be prosecuted. Roughly 5,000 children were separated as a result. Matt Wolking, vice president for communications at Axiom Strategies, one of the largest Republican political consulting firms, first posted pictures from the June 30, 2018, event on X on Friday afternoon. “Kamala Harris is a self described radical, and she picked a radical running mate who matches her open borders beliefs: sneaking across the border is a not a crime, sanctuary cities and drivers licenses for illegals are good, building a wall and securing the border is bad, the agency in charge of enforcing immigration laws should be scrapped, and illegals are entitled to receive taxpayer funded health care and benefits,” Wolking said in a text message to the Washington Examiner on Friday afternoon. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Progressive Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY), called for the government to wipe out the agency, though no action was taken under then-President Donald Trump or President Joe Biden. Harris did not declaratively call for ICE to be closed down during the 2018 or 2020 election cycles, but she did say in 2018 that the government should think about “starting from scratch” with the agency. ICE was created in the early 2000s through an act of Congress. Under congressional mandate, agents and officers within ICE are responsible for investigating certain federal crimes and detaining, arresting, and deporting illegal immigrants whom federal judges order removed. Walz told a reporter during an interview in 2019 that he identified as a “progressive,” not a “centrist.” Walz has a history of advancing liberal immigration policies, a top issue for voters heading into November. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER As a gubernatorial candidate in 2018, Walz said he supported Minnesota becoming a “sanctuary” state, a term used for local and state jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration officers.As governor, Walz has signed several bills into law, including providing immigrants who illegally entered the country with driver’s licenses, free college tuition, and taxpayer-subsidized healthcare.","summary":"Gov.

The Alpha Kappa Alpha, Inc. has formed a political action committee, allowing the country's oldest Black sorority an avenue to raise money in support of federal candidates. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is an alumna of the sorority, part of the \"Divine Nine\" group of historical Black fraternities and sororities which together have more than 2.5 million active members across the country, and has made the groups a focal point of the campaign, even before Biden quit the ticket on July 21. Harris addressed AKA's annual convention in Houston earlier that month. The sorority's new political action committee — which complements an existing voter registration, education and mobilization coordinated campaign among the organizations — is the latest indication of a wave of enthusiasm for Harris among Black Americans, whose early and enthusiastic support helped ensure Harris' uncontested glide path to the nomination following Biden's withdrawal. In the hours immediately after President Biden called it quits and backed Harris, the Win With Black Women political action committee spurred more than $1.5 million in fundraising in a Zoom donation drive and inspired a wave of similar efforts that raised tens of millions more. Now, Harris has a 51%-48% lead over former President Trump, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll — in part due to her strength among Black women and voters of color more broadly. That strength is expected to make a number of states that once appeared to be slipping out of reach for Democrats under the Biden-Harris ticket, including Georgia and North Carolina, competitive come November.

The questions included: “We know Tim Walz is white, but is he white enough to win all 19 electoral votes from Pennsylvania?” “Have you guys seen him play hacky sack?” “Have you seen him at a Dave Matthews Band concert?” “Have you seen him say, ‘I love yogurt’?” Eventually, supporters attending the event did begin to recognize that Walz being on the ticket might partially be because he’s “white enough” to placate certain parts of the country and bigoted voters. “By having a Black Asian woman as Democratic candidate, so I think it was necessary that we had a white man, unfortunately,” another attendee said in the video. “In a way was he kind of like a DEI hire?” Kuhlenschmidt asked back, to which the response was “absolutely.” Watch the full clip from “The Daily Show” above.","summary":"Grace Kuhlenschmidt interviews Democratic voters at Kamala Harris’ first official event with her VP pick\n\n\nThe post &#8216;The Daily Show&#8217; Asks Kamala Supporters If Tim Walz Is &#8216;White Enough&#8217; to Be VP: &#8216;When It Comes to White, He&#8217;s Right!&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/daily-show-kamala-harris-tim-walz-white/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DailyShowTimWalz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 21:49:48","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.199},{"id":253787268,"title":"Trump Plans ‘Willie Horton’ Attacks on Kamala Harris","text":"Taegan Goddard is the founder of Political Wire, one of the earliest and most influential political web sites.

With election day just three months away, Trump's light schedule -- a rally every four or five days -- has been contrasted with the hectic program of an opponent almost 20 years his junior, and his with own vigorous campaigning in 2016. The 78-year-old tycoon has held just five rallies since the Republican National Convention concluded in mid-July -- one fewer than Harris is staging this week alone -- and has no events at all announced yet for next week. Eight years ago, Trump was staging multiple events a day by August, but the oldest major party presidential nominee in US history is venturing out of Florida for the first time this week for a rally in Montana, a state he should win easily. The ex-president, who survived an assassination attempt at a rally last month, bristled at questions over his schedule in a hastily convened press conference Thursday at his home in south Florida. He said he had been absent from battleground states because he was \"leading by a lot and because I'm letting their convention go through,\" a reference to the Democratic National Convention, which doesn't end until August 22. The Harris campaign called the ex-president \"low energy\" --- a favorite Trump insult -- while his former communications chief Alyssa Farah Griffin bemoaned Republicans not picking a \"younger, more vibrant candidate.\" Trump appeared on track to win back the White House before Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, but Harris has made big gains since replacing the president at the top of the ticket and naming running mate Tim Walz. Her rise appears to have wrongfooted Trump, who dismissed her surging polling numbers as he held court in front of journalists at his Mar-a-Lago estate for a freewheeling hour-plus news conference. He complained about coverage of Harris's large crowds and assailed her for avoiding interviews. And in a bizarre moment that made headlines, he related an anecdote about a helicopter near-miss that never happened, in which he appeared to confuse former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown with Jerry Brown, California's governor for most of the 2010s. He pitched three September debates -- mixing up the dates of the showdowns he was proposing -- and attacked Harris as unintelligent and incompetent. Former prosecutor Harris -- praised for her forensic questioning as a senator and for her performance in the vice-presidential debate in 2020 -- immediately confirmed one of the dates, an ABC News face-off on September 10. Meanwhile Harris continues her tour of the swing states alongside Walz, with a stop in the racially diverse southwestern battlegrounds of Arizona on Friday and Nevada on Saturday. Formerly worried White House aides have begun to rekindle their enthusiasm over the possibility of victory in the two states, which were shifted this week from \"lean Republican\" to \"toss up\" by election forecaster Cook Political Report. Harris campaign spokesman James Singer said the vice president was \"earning every vote\" with her travel this week. \"Our campaign is centered around what unites America: opportunity, freedom, and love of country,\" he said. \"Donald Trump is too lazy to fight for anything but himself or leave his country club -- fine by us.\" Policy has taken a backseat in an election overwhelmed in recent weeks by Biden's disastrous debate performance, the assassination bid on Trump and Harris's surge. But Harris and Biden will discuss tackling inflation -- a top concern for voters and a winning issue for Trump -- in Maryland next week at their first joint campaign trip since the president's withdrawal. © 2024 AFP","summary":"Donald Trump was to campaign Friday in a safe Republican state as Kamala Harris barnstorms the battlegrounds likely to decide November's election, carried by a surge in momentum…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/harris-blitzes-battlegrounds-as-trump-schedule-raises-eyebrows","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/f4/56/1f5a9d5ba40c24a0ad81d99035ab9bd4e73d/f4561f5a9d5ba40c24a0ad81d99035ab9bd4e73d/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-09 21:47:06","author":"Japan Today Editor,Robyn Beck","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Robyn Beck"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.045},{"id":253786828,"title":"Lil Pump Says He’s Leaving America If Kamala Harris Becomes President","text":"Lil Pump — who has supported Donald Trump since 2020 and has a tattoo of the former president’s mugshot on one of his thighs — has promised to leave the country if Kamala Harris wins the presidential election. The Miami rapper recently gave his fans the news in a video shot in his car. “I swear on my dad’s grave, if this stupid-a– bi— Kamala Harris wins the f—ing election, I’m moving out of America, boy,” he said. “I swear on everything.” He then claimed on X that he’s going to perform a diss track aimed at both President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris during Trump’s next rally. “I will be performing the joe Biden kamal Harris diss track at the next trump rally,” he tweeted. After Harris was announced as the hopeful replacement for President Biden as the Democratic nominee, Pump took to X and to voice his displeasure, tweeting, “Kamala Harris isn’t even black… she’s Indian. She locked up over 1,500 people for weed related crimes and then laughed about it years later. The worst VP in American History. Trump 2024” If you remember, back in 2020 during a rally, the former president introduced Lil Pump as “Lil Pimp.” “Speaking of sound, music and other things, one of the big superstars of the world, Little Pimp,” he said. “There he is! How’s it going? Do you want to come up and say something?” When Pump got onstage, he told the crowd, “I came here to say, Mr. President, I appreciate everything you’ve done for our country. You brought the troops home and you’re doing the right thing. MAGA 20, 20, 20. Don’t forget that! Don’t forget that.

Harris’s Plan Mirrors Biden’s.","text":"For months, Donald Trump has been adding new tax cuts to his list of campaign promises. He says he wants to exempt tips, cut the corporate rate and end the tax on Social Security. His plans have real political appeal — people tend to love paying lower taxes — but independent analyses suggest that Trump’s plans could add close to $4 trillion over the next decade to the national debt. It is not yet possible to make a similar estimate for Kamala Harris because she has not yet detailed her own economic policy proposals. But her campaign said today that her plans would be similar to President Biden’s proposals to reduce the deficit by about $3 trillion over the next decade, largely by raising taxes on corporations and high earners. Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, are campaigning this evening in Arizona.Trump is holding an event tonight in Montana, where Republicans are looking to unseat a Democratic senator. Your questions: We asked readers what they’d like to know about the election, and hundreds of people wrote in with questions for our reporters on the ground. Today, we’re featuring the first question. We gave it to Rebecca Davis O’Brien, who covers national politics. What’s going on with RFK Jr.? Is there a chance he’ll drop out? Does he take more votes from Harris or Trump? — Seth Knievel, Dallas. Rebecca: The Kennedy campaign is plowing forward with its expensive effort to get on the ballot in all 50 states. He’s on in 19 states, with others likely to follow. Support for independent candidates tends to fade as the election draws near, and that has been the case for Kennedy: Independent polling suggests that he is hovering at around 5 percent nationally. President Biden’s departure from the race has also shifted the math: While Kennedy once drew about equally from Biden and Trump, polling now suggests he draws more votes from Trump. When Kennedy is absent from the race, Trump pulls ahead of Harris.","summary":"Also, Russia is scrambling to halt Ukraine’s surprise offensive.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, has launched a political action committee that could send even more money to her campaign, which already has shattered fundraising records. According to a Friday filing with the Federal Election Commission, the new committee is called “Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority PAC, Inc. (AKA AKA 1908 PAC).” “I am proud of my sorority sister,” reads an Instagram caption under a photo of the Democratic presidential nominee and a woman named Kiahna W. Davis, who is listed as treasurer of the PAC. The address listed for the PAC is the site of the Ivy Center, AKA’s corporate headquarters in Chicago. Harris joined AKA when she attended Howard University four decades ago. But the perks of her membership did not end at graduation. The sorority network includes prominent Democratic mega donors and celebrities like Wanda Sykes and Ava DuVernay, who have expressed support for Harris. Many other influential African-American politicians, like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are also involved in Black Greek life, a testament to how powerful such networks can be. AKA members have been key donors to Harris before. In 2020, over the week after President Joe Biden announced Harris as his running mate, she raised hundreds of thousands through donations in the amount of $19.08—the year her sorority was founded. This year, the Council of Presidents for the Divine Nine, the group of nine historically Black Greek-letter organizations, announced it was launching an unprecedented effort to boost voter turnout the day after Biden stepped aside. Historically Black sororities have previously led a “Stroll to the Polls” initiative to encourage early voting. The sorority’s new PAC, AKA, Davis and the Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Beast’s requests for comment. But Harris, for her part, has remained connected to the AKA community. For a Vogue cover shoot in 2021 she was photographed in front of AKA’s official colors: salmon pink and apple green. More recently, she spoke at the AKA Boulé conference—just weeks before she became the Democratic nominee.","summary":"Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesGood sisters always come through. \n\nVice President Kamala Harris’ sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, has launched a political action committee that could send even more money to her campaign, which already has shattered fundraising records.\n\nAccording to a Friday filing with the Federal Election Commission, the new committee is called “Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority PAC, Inc.
