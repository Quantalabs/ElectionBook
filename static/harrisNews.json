Given the presence of Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris’s Secret Service detail at the [Democratic National Committee] when authorities discovered the pipe bomb, your agents may possess information that is necessary for our oversight and request your cooperation in this process,” Loudermilk wrote.\n\nLoudeermilk had previously questioned why the federal agents did not find a pipe bomb placed by an unknown individual near the DNC headquarters on the evening before Jan. 6. \n\nHarris’s Secret Service detail used two canine units to conduct a sweep of the area in preparation for her visit to the DNC on the morning of Jan. 6. But it was a plainclothes U.S. Capitol Police officer who first reported finding the bomb, still undetonated, later that afternoon, around the same time the Capitol was breached. Harris came within 20 feet of the bomb placed at the DNC during her visit to the location. \n\n“It is generally accepted that the pipe bombs acted as a means of diverting law enforcement resources away from the Capitol, notably at almost precisely the same time as protestors started to breach the Capitol perimeter,” Loudermilk wrote this week. \n\nDuring a congressional hearing last year on the DNC pipe bomb, Loudermilk said two Secret Service K-9 sweeps seemed to miss the bomb, as well as a second pipe bomb similarly planted at the Republican National Committee headquarters on Jan. 5\n\n“I mean, the Secret Service did two sweeps of the perimeter out there. Never identified the bomb that was left to be seen,” Loudermilk said. \n\nOn Monday, the Jan. 6 committee chairman requested the Secret Service turn over all documents and communications relating “to a cell phone migration, system upgrade, or any other process or act by which employees of the United States Secret Service had their phones wiped of all electronic communications in the January–April 2021 timeframe.” \n\nThe FBI has been investigating the pipe bomb planter’s identity for years. The agency has blamed its inability to trace the suspect on several issues, including what it described as inferior surveillance cameras in the areas around the Capitol.\n\n“The available surveillance camera footage in the area is a bit sporadic. It certainly is not all the same quality,” David Sundberg, the assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington field office, told CNN in January. \n\nAt the time, the FBI said it was unable to locate the suspect after reviewing 39,000 video files, conducting 1,000 interviews, and investigating over 600 tips.\n\nThe FBI has released several videos of surveillance footage of the suspect to the public, including one most recently made available last month. \n\nTOP BBC EXECUTIVES RESIGN AFTER LEAKED DOSSIER SHOWS OUTLET DECEPTIVELY EDITED TRUMP JAN. 6 SPEECH\n\nOne video shows the individual placing the bomb under a bench close to the DNC building.

And party officials say it’s all thanks to President Donald Trump. The Democratic National Committee raised more than $6 million through grassroots donations in October, internal numbers show. That’s more than three times what it raised during the same month in 2017, the last time weary Democrats headed into an off-year election after losing to Trump. Notably, the windfall came as the government was shuttered for the entirety of the month, with Republicans blaming Democrats for the pain caused by the deadlock. But it also coincided with Democrats sweeping nationwide elections, big and small, and 10 months into Trump’s second presidency, which Democrats have seen as figuratively and literally wrecking democracy. “Democrats’ decisive victories all across the country have turbocharged that energy and we’re going to make sure we channel our supporters’ enthusiasm to keep winning in 2026 and beyond,” Roger Lau, executive director of the DNC, told MSNBC. The minority party is now looking squarely ahead to next year’s midterm elections, hoping to break the Republicans’ stronghold on power and counting on the president to help them. “Trump is the best fundraiser for the Democratic Party right now, and even better than he was the first time,” a former DNC official told MSNBC, acknowledging that donors are giving to the DNC “in the absence of anywhere else to give.” Shutdown strategy infighting aside, Democrats are clawing back from their 2024 election collapse and engaging — not just at the ballot box, where they dominated in federal, state and local elections last week — but with their wallets. The party may even be benefiting from what it is lacking: a clear leader in the wake of its catastrophic 2024 presidential race. The former DNC official also expressed surprise, given last year's debacle, that voters \"now trust the DNC to be the vehicle where they get engaged, because the DNC hasn’t really been doing anything right.\" That person was granted anonymity in order to speak candidly about the party's lack of leadership and its fundraising challenges. The DNC, for its part, has touted historic investments in this year’s elections, including $3.2 million each in Virginia and New Jersey — where Democrats won gubernatorial elections last week — and $175,000 in Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court retention race, resulting in resounding wins across the board. As of October, the DNC had a war chest of almost $12 million, compared with roughly $7 million cash on hand at that point in 2017. But Democrats, who are crawling out of the depths of debt from Kamala Harris’ bank-breaking defeat in November 2024, still trail far behind the Republican National Committee, which had $86 million heading into November. So far this year, the DNC has raised $72 million in grassroots donations — more than in 2017 and 2019 combined, putting it on stronger financial footing heading into the midterms. The fundraising boon is a welcome bright spot for Democrats, who have struggled to win back unhappy big-dollar donors hesitant to write checks after their presidential nominee blew $1.5 billion in her 15 weeks as a candidate. The DNC paid out $1.6 million in related expenses in September alone, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The DNC’s Election Night fundraising text last Tuesday had one of its best yields of the year, according to a DNC official not authorized to speak on the record who said the average individual donation was $36, with schoolteachers winning a gold star for being the most prolific donors of all the professions. “We encourage left-wing donors to keep sending money to the DNC, where it can be used to pay off Kamala Harris’ campaign debts instead of actually being used in next year’s midterms,” RNC press secretary Kiersten Pels said in a statement to MSNBC. Republican donors, however, are being asked to give to all things Trump, from the president’s new White House ballroom and his MAGA Inc. super PAC to other visions of grandeur, including the so-called Arc de Trump and other causes Trump wants funded. Veteran Democratic political operatives are urging the party faithful to stay positive and keep the groundswell of donations flowing in order to take back control of Congress next November and repair the party. “There is still a lot of work to do, but I think we can stop with all of the doom and gloom,” Doug Thornell, a longtime Democratic strategist, told MSNBC. “2026 should be a very good year for Democrats if we can maintain this energy and focus on winning.”","summary":"Democrats had a major grassroots fundraising surge in October, thanks to voter discontent with President Trump, according to data shared exclusively with MSNBC","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/exclusive-dnc-rakes-grassroots-haul-thanks-trump-rcna243036","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251110-DNC-fundraising-zz-399007.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-10 21:18:56","author":"Julia Jester","authors":["Julia Jester"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":377634748,"title":"Trump threatens $1 billion lawsuit against BBC over video of speech","text":"Nov. 10 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump is threatening a $1 billion lawsuit against the BBC over how the media organization edited video of him speaking to supporters outside the White House on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump's attorney, Alejandro Brit, wrote a letter to the British-based outlet demanding a retraction of a BBC Panorama documentary by Friday or face a lawsuit of \"no less\" than $1 billion. Fox News published the letter. The BBC confirmed receipt of it.\n\n\"Failure to comply will leave President Trump with no choice but to pursue any and all legal rights and remedies available to recover damages for the overwhelming financial and reputational harm that the BBC has caused him to suffer, with all rights and remedies being expressly reserved by President Trump,\" the letter said.\n\nIf the deadline is not met, \"President Trump will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages,\" Brit wrote.\n\nThe defamation allegations are based on Florida law, where Trump is a legal resident.\n\nA BBC spokesperson responded to The Hill: \"We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.\"\n\nThe Telegraph, also based in Britain, reported on a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser about failings in the broadcaster's coverage. The report criticized the speech, as well as coverage on transgender issues and Gaza.\n\nThe documentary, titled Trump: A Second Chance, was first broadcast on Oct. 28, 2024, a week before the 2024 presidential election won by Trump. He returned to the White House on Jan. 21.\n\n\"The BBC intentionally sought to completely mislead its viewers by splicing together three separate parts of President Trump's speech to supporters,\" the letter said. \"The documentary showed President Trump telling supporters: 'We're gonna walk down to the Capitol, and I'll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'\"\n\nAccording to the letter, Trump actually said, \"We're going to walk down, and I'll be there with you, we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down any one of you but I think right here, we're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"\n\nThe report also edited out Trump saying, \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\"\n\nBBC director general Tim Davie and News CEO Deborah Turness then resigned.\n\nBBC Chair Samir Shah on Monday apologized for the editing of the Trump speech, calling it an \"error of judgment.\" In the letter Shah didn't know whether there would be legal action.\n\n\"I will personally ensure that the BBC continues to take the necessary actions in the future to ensure the BBC retains the trust and confidence of the public we serve,\" Shah said.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump posted on Truth Social with a link to the article: \"Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt 'Journalists.' These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!\"\n\nTrump also posted other articles about the Telegraph report.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Office denied the BBC was \"corrupt\" or \"institutionally biased.\"\n\n\"The BBC is facing a coordinated, politically motivated attack,\" BBC veteran John Simpson wrote on X Sunday night. \"We've now got a real fight on our hands to defend public service broadcasting, because that's under threat too.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X her Saturday interview with the Telegraph, which she captioned with \"shot\" and the BBC article announcing Davie's resignation, captioned with \"chaser.\"\n\nOne month after the protest, Trump was impeached by the U.S. House for \"incitement of insurrection\" related to the storming of the Capitol by rioters, but he was acquitted by the Senate.\n\nIn August 2023, Trump was indicted on federal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his involvement in the attack. The case was dismissed on Nov. 25, 2024, after he was re-elected president because of the Department of Justice policy against prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nTrump has sent letters to other news organizations threatening lawsuits over their coverage. There are pending suits against the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Des Moines Register. He settled with Disney's ABC and Paramount's CBS.

Tim Davie, BBC director general, and Deborah Turness, the CEO of news, resigned following a leaked memo concerning alleged bias in BBC programming. \n\nThe memo, written last May by Michael Prescott, then independent advisor to the BBC’s editorial standards committee, raised a number of concerns about alleged bias in the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues, and alleged anti-Israel bias in the BBC Arabic service. \n\nBut the key issue appears to have been in the editing of a 2024 Panorama documentary titled Trump: A Second Chance? In the documentary, two different sections from President Donald Trump’s speech on the day of the January 6 2021 riots had been spliced together into one clip, which could have led viewers to conclude that Trump was calling on protesters to carry out the riot. Trump is now threatening to sue the corporation.\n\nIn the past week, the Telegraph has repeatedly accused the BBC of institutional bias. The broadcasters’s lack of public response, other than to declare that it did not comment on leaked information, was totally inadequate in the face of such an onslaught.\n\nBut while BBC supporters looked on aghast, internally, BBC news staff were attempting to respond. According to Today presenter Nick Robinson, BBC news executives had “agreed the wording of a press release” explaining that the programme should have made clear an edit had been made, but that at no point was there any “intention to mislead the audience”. \n\nThe BBC board refused to sign off on this statement, and the BBC was left looking like it was keeping schtum for possibly nefarious purposes.\n\nThe BBC’s chairman, Samir Shah, has now finally delivered a statement apologising for an “error of judgement”. He said that the BBC had discussed the corporation’s US election coverage and: “We accept that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.” \n\nMeanwhile, BBC journalists in Washington had to front up at the White House where Trump has declared that BBC journalists “are very dishonest people”. \n\nTrump has now threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion if they do not retract the documentary. As Shah has noted, Trump is “a litigious fellow”. \n\nIn July, Paramount settled a prospective lawsuit for US$16 million (£12.1 million) after Trump made a “false editing” accusation against 60 Minutes over an edit on a Kamala Harris interview headline during the last election campaign. Last year he also secured a US$15 million payment from ABC News as part-settlement in a defamation case against that network. \n\nIt is hard to imagine a scenario where the BBC would settle a dispute with the US government for cash. But with Trump, one never knows if his posturing might lead a media company to fold. For the BBC, this is a decisive own goal. \n\nInternal politics\n\nArriving at the BBC this morning, Turness acknowledged the mistake in the Trump edit, but was clear that the BBC was not institutionally biased.\n\nSome critics, however, have pointed the finger at the BBC’s own internal political challenges. Among them is David Yelland, a former editor of the Sun who now presents a BBC podcast. He called Turness and Davie’s resignations a “coup”, attributing it to alleged political bias on the BBC board.\n\nAlongside this drama, BBC journalists such as Nick Robinson, David Sillito and Katie Razzall are carrying out a thorough job of examining the chaos. But a less-reported fact is that it is yet again an outsourced independent production programme that has led to the BBC’s current problems. \n\nOctober Films Ltd made the film for BBC Panorama, just as it was HOYO Films that made the documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone. That film was narrated by the 13-year-old son of a Hamas deputy minister of agriculture, something that wasn’t explained to viewers, leading to an Ofcom sanction last October. \n\nHowever, outsourcing production to an independent company doesn’t outsource the editorial checking, which should have been exhaustive in the case of this Panorama programme. \n\n Read more:\n BBC Gaza documentary: how an editorial blame game overshadowed an important film and destroyed trust\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe BBC must now recruit two high-level executives, just as it should be readying for its 2027 royal charter renewal (major talks over the broadcaster’s future and funding). According to the Today programme, the top contenders are three women: Apple’s Jay Hunt, former Channel 4 CEO Alex Mahon and former BBC chief content officer Charlotte Moore. But these are early days.\n\nSome commentators will no doubt call for a “BBC cleanskin” so as to not be tainted by present controversies. But is this wise when the person will be called on to lead such a vastly complex and sprawling media organisation? Tim Davie had no background in journalism before becoming director general, and Deborah Turness had never worked for the BBC before. \n\nThe new broom may have to handle similar disputes to those over Gary Lineker’s social media posts or Bob Vylan’s anti-Israel Defense Forces chants at Glastonbury. Perhaps this should be the role of a deputy director, a post that used to exist at the BBC until recently.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the most important commodity in journalism is trust. To that end, the BBC continues to top the charts in the UK, according to the annual Reuters Digital News Report. The BBC houses some of the best journalists and news programming available today. The poor handling of this crisis puts all of their reputations at stake.","summary":"The BBC must now recruit two high-level executives, just as it should be readying for its 2027 royal charter renewal.","url":"https://theconversation.com/why-has-the-bbcs-director-general-resigned-and-what-could-happen-next-269408","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/701448/original/file-20251110-74-j4af5k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C196%2C4000%2C2000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-10 18:17:02","author":"Colleen Murrell,Dublin City University,Full Professor in Journalism","authors":["Colleen Murrell","Dublin City University","Full Professor in Journalism"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":377612822,"title":"Furor over editing of Trump speech sparks 'existential crisis' at the BBC (World)","text":"The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.\n\nThe century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and “fight like hell.”\n\nThe BBC chairman apologized Monday for an “error of judgment.” A letter from Trump’s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster “retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements” and compensate the president for the harm caused.\n\nCritics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.\n\n“This is an existential crisis for the BBC,” said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George’s University of London. “In capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it’s relatively easy to cow the BBC.”\n\nThat is “incredibly dangerous” in an increasingly polarized environment “where the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,” she warned.\n\nA look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future:\n\nAccusations of institutional bias\n\nThe furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.\n\nThe memo raised concerns over how the BBC’s “Panorama” documentary program edited a speech by Trump.\n\nThe program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.”\n\nAmong the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nThe BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.\n\nThe broadcaster’s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave “the impression of a direct call for violent action.” Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there’s no institutional bias” at the BBC — a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nThe memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster’s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service.\n\nLongstanding criticism from the right\n\nReacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC.” Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were “corrupt” and “dishonest” and “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.”\n\nCritics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC “has been institutionally biased for decades” to loud applause from supporters.\n\nIn recent months, the corporation came under sustained criticism from all sides over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, including its livestreaming of a rap duo’s chants calling for “death to the IDF\" (Israel Defense Forces) at this year’s Glastonbury festival. It also had to remove a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of a Hamas official.\n\nCharles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, alleged that the BBC has a consistent bias, “always from a sort of metropolitan, left position” on trans issues, as well as its coverage of race, Trump, Israel and Gaza.\n\n“I’m not, of course, saying that it should be right-wing either,” Moore said. “I’m saying it should take impartiality seriously and put in people capable of running this gigantic and self-satisfied bureaucracy.”\n\nPosetti disagreed and said the BBC, like many other news outlets, is under attack from right-wing voices and the Trump administration.\n\nShe acknowledged the editing mistakes but said it is wrong to call the broadcaster fake news “when patently it is not.”\n\n“I’m not suggesting that there weren’t errors made, but I think that those errors needed to be addressed head-on, clearly and transparently and in a very timely manner.\" Instead, she said, the resignations will have a “destabilizing effect.”\n\nThreats from Trump to sue\n\nTrump's threats to take legal action over the BBC’s editing brings to mind similar legal disputes between the president and several U.S. news organizations.\n\nIn July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a “ 60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.\n\nLast year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nTaxpayers provide funding\n\nThe BBC is funded through an annual TV license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television.\n\nThe corporation is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial and independent. It is not a state broadcaster beholden to the U.K. government. Its model has inspired the CBC in Canada, the ABC in Australia and other publicly funded outlets, Posetti said.\n\nKnown affectionately — or mockingly — as “Auntie,” the BBC began in the 1920s and changed the history of television when many Britons bought a TV set specifically to watch the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. It still devotes more time and resources than other outlets to events such as the death of the monarch in 2022.\n\nOutside the U.K. the BBC World Service operates in over 40 languages and is one of Britain’s most significant cultural exports. Apart from news, it retains a huge global viewership with popular entertainment shows, including “Doctor Who,” \"The Traitors” and “Strictly Come Dancing” and their spinoffs.\n\nAhead of the renewal of its charter in the next few years, many critics have questioned whether the license fee model is still viable at a time when viewers are turning to streaming competitors, YouTube and social media. The BBC has lost millions of pounds as more households stopped paying the fee in recent years.\n\n“This is the BBC’s last chance,” Farage said. “If the BBC doesn’t now get a grip … then I think what you would see within the next couple of years are many, many millions just refusing, just not wanting to have the license fee.”","summary":"The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.

On Monday, the public service broadcaster's director general, Tim Davie, and CEO of BBC News, Deborah Turness, announced their resignations over the misleading edit. The clip - which was broadcast a week before last year's US presidential elections - spliced parts of Trump's January 6 speech to suggest he urged violence at the Capitol, omitting context from the original transcript. The 2021 riots in Washington resulted in five deaths, including one police officer who was beaten by rioters. Critics said the Panorama edit removed a section where Mr Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully. The controversy, highlighted by a leaked internal memo on editorial lapses last week, has fuelled political divides in the UK and raised questions over institutional bias. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.\" BBC chair Samir Shah previously said the corporation has received communication from Mr Trump over the editing of the documentary, but did not confirm whether he had threatened to sue. He told the organisation's culture editor Katie Razzall: \"We are now considering how to reply to him.\" Asked directly if Mr Trump has said he will be suing the BBC, Mr Shah added: \"I do not know that yet, but he’s a litigious fellow so we should be prepared for all outcomes.\" In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social , on Sunday, the US President wrote: \"The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught 'doctoring' my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. \"Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt 'Journalists',\" he added. \"These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. \"On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!\" Reform leader Nigel Farage said he spoke with Mr Trump on Friday, telling a London press conference: \"He just said to me: 'Is this how you treat your best ally?' \"It’s quite a powerful comment,\" the MP for Clacton added. Mr Trump has a history of suing news organisations in the US. He previously settled a defamation lawsuit against ABC News after star anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely said he had been found \"liable for rape\". Mr Trump also settled a legal dispute with CBS News over an interview it broadcast on its 60 Minutes programme with former vice president Kamala Harris. He is currently engaged in lawsuits with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Mr Trump has also taken action against the Associated Press after the wire service refused to call the Gulf of Mexico by his preferred name for it - the Gulf of America.","summary":"The US President addressed the controversy on social media over the weekend","url":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/donald-trump-bbc-panorama-documentary-32847535","image":"https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/article32847555.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_Trump-BBC-Panorama.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-10 16:42:20","author":"Ryan Price","authors":["Ryan Price"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":377586544,"title":"Bill Maher, Cheryl Hines attack the left, say Democrats just want to 'cut you off'","text":"Comedian Bill Maher and actress Cheryl Hines, the wife of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., agreed that the political left is intolerant of them even though they aren't conservatives during a conversation on Maher's \"Club Random\" podcast. \"I think it would be a tragedy, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the case, that you would lose jobs because this is, it’s funny, it’s a town that loves to romanticize the period in the ’50s when there was a blacklist. And as they should, because it was a terrible blacklist, but they have their own kind of blacklist now. It’s not like they aren’t sort of recapitulating that, when it was a witch hunt about communists, now it’s a witch hunt for people who aren’t woke enough. You know, it’s not like we’re conservatives,\" Maher said. Maher spoke with Hines about how he was criticized by liberals for meeting with President Donald Trump earlier this year, despite his frequent attacks against him and his policies. They both reflected on how they are treated or received by Republicans vs. Democrats. \"I always say to my woke friends, we voted for the same person, you’re just why she lost,\" Maher said, referring to former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Even from the beginning, when Bobby was running as a Democrat, they weren’t mean, and they never have been. And I can’t say that for the Democrats,\" Hines said. Maher argued during the podcast that Republicans lack a \"chip for compassion.\" He and Hines agreed they always felt compassion was the backbone of the Democratic Party, but it did not feel that way in its current state. \"It's sad, because it's not the Democrats we grew up with,\" Maher said. BILL MAHER ADMITS HE STILL FEARS GETTING CANCELED DESPITE CULTURAL 'VIBE SHIFT' AFTER ELECTION Maher also said during the conversation that he aligns with Democrats politically, especially on \"preserving democracy\" but on other issues, he said, liberals get under his skin. He explained that while speaking to figures on the right, they often argue and clash, but come to a point where they agree to disagree, and they remain friends afterward. \"The left isn’t that way. They’re more like, ‘No, if you’re not with me, I f------ hate you, and you’re a deplorable, or you’re with the deplorables, or you’re talking to the deplorables, or you had dinner with Hitler or something.’ And it’s just like, you people are so, you’re such babies. You’re just not sophisticated people. To quote another show on our network: ‘You are not serious people.’ Serious people talk to each other, and they accept that you’re going to get to this point where you don’t agree,\" Maher said.

Ten and a half percent said nobody. Harris herself garnered the most support out of her fellow Democrats, with 16.1%. (Subscribe to MR.

(RELATED: Voters Give Gavin Newsom Green Light To Gerrymander California)\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez barely notched 1%, and the New York City mayor-elect, socialist Zohran Mamdani, tallied 0.3%.\n\nAnd, hilariously enough, Donald Trump actually polled better than Cory Booker, Tim Walz, Josh Shapiro, Pete Buttigieg, Mamdani, and JB Pritzker. \n\nThis poll is only a snapshot, but it still indicates that the Democratic Party’s future is quite foggy, despite their bruising of the GOP on Election Day. Yes, they might have had a convincing win in Virginia, with Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger defeating Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears by 15 points. And there is certainly a lot of excitement around Zohran Mamdani’s victory, even though it was in a deep blue city and driven by young, white, college-educated transplants.\n\nBut, as Scott Jennings argued in a post-election analysis, politicians like Mamdani and Jay Jones — who won the attorney general race in Virginia even though he fantasized about putting bullets in a Republican’s kids — may end up becoming serious liabilities as the midterms approach. What if Mamdani utterly fails? Will the Democratic Party really want to hitch its wagon to his agenda if New York City sees a massive drain of capital, thanks to higher taxes? Do Democrats understand that every Republican will cut ads highlighting the Jones text scandal? (RELATED: Scott Jennings Says What We’re All Thinking About Democrats’ Victories)\n\nAnd it is also telling that Harris voters still think she is the best option. Perhaps it is pure self-delusion, or it is that they still prefer that brand of politics — more establishment and center-left — to the anti-establishment politics of someone like Bernie Sanders or AOC.\n\nMaybe the Democratic Party has become too balkanized, with the far-left eating up their own, for any single person to emerge and keep the bickering coalitions united in a front against Republicans and the Trump administration. Since Trump took office, the centrists of the party have tried to keep each faction under a larger tent, focused strictly on attacking the GOP and Trump. Establishment figures, such as Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, haven’t condemned the rising influence of far-left socialists, like Mamdani, but have sought a middle, inclusive road.\n\nFor example, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries held out for as long as possible endorsing Mamdani, until he finally bent the knee. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also endorsed Mamdani, yet tellingly, Mamdani’s campaign refused to endorse her bid for reelection.\n\nBut, Sunday, another Democratic civil war exploded into full view after eight Democratic Senators joined Republicans in a deal to reopen the government. Almost immediately, the progressive left lashed out at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has tried (and failed) to keep them in line.\n\n“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced. If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna chided.\n\n Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced.

Seth Moulton, who recently launched a primary challenge against Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, said. “If @ChuckSchumer were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote ‘No’ tonight and hold the line on healthcare.”\n\n Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership.

He has power, and so do I,” one viewer pointedly wrote. “When I saw that he was being interviewed on last Sunday’s show, I used my power and turned it off immediately.”\n\nExactly a year after he filed a “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, which CBS News’ parent company Paramount settled just weeks before its merger with Skydance Media was approved by the Trump administration, Trump sat down with correspondent Norah O’Donnell for a lengthy one-on-one.\n\nThough the president and O’Donnell spoke for roughly 90 minutes, only 28 minutes of the interview aired on 60 Minutes. An edited 73-minute version of the conversation was dropped on the network’s YouTube channel, and an unedited transcript of the entire interview was published online. \n\nPart of the agreement CBS reached with the president in the settlement was that the network would publish the unedited transcripts of any interviews with presidents and presidential candidates. Therefore, in an ironic twist, 60 Minutes soon found itself under fire from viewers over portions of the interview that were not aired on the program.\n\nIn one exchange that was left on the cutting room floor, the president gushed over new CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss and Paramount chief executive David Ellison, all while boasting that CBS News was forced to pay him “a lotta money” to settle his lawsuit. While 60 Minutes did not air that portion, O’Donnell did reference the settlement at the top of the broadcast, noting that the network didn’t apologize as part of the agreement.\n\n“I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press,” Trump said of the new leadership at the network, adding that Weiss – who founded the anti-woke digital outlet The Free Press – is a “great person” and leader. Ellison, whose father is megabillionaire and close Trump ally Larry Ellison, has repeatedly been praised by the president.\n\nAlso missing from both the televised edit and the extended online version of the interview was a combative back-and-forth between Trump and O’Donnell over the president’s pardon of crypto entrepreneur Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who recently struck a multi-billion-dollar crypto deal with the Trump family. While some of the exchange was aired, only the online transcript revealed that the president became aggravated and even suggested he could walk out of the interview.\n\nMeanwhile, it wasn’t just Trump critics and liberals who found fault with the 60 Minutes interview. O’Donnell faced MAGA anger for referring to the president as “Mr. Trump” during their conversation, prompting some conservatives to grouse online that she was disrespecting the office. This played out in the letters Vega read aloud on Sunday night.\n\n“Instead of interviewing him, it appeared as an attack,” one viewer griped, while another wrote: “You should have more respect than what you showed.” \n\nOn the flip side, liberal viewers criticized the show for going too easy on the president and not taking him to task more fully during the interview. They also seemed to hint at the growing concern among critics and CBS News staffers that Ellison is pushing the network to the right in order to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“You wanted to show Trump in the best possible light,” one commenter noted. “There were no hard questions, no meaningful pushback,” another viewer added.\n\nOne person, meanwhile, took issue with 60 Minutes even giving Trump airtime, claiming that the president already has enough media exposure, bluntly stating that once they saw Trump was on last Sunday’s broadcast, “I used my power and turned it off immediately.”\n\nTrump’s appearance on 60 Minutes gave the already top-rated program a massive ratings boost, drawing 14 million viewers and posting its highest viewership since January 2021.","summary":"‘The country may be politically divided, but the criticism from viewers was bipartisan,’ CBS News correspondent Cecilia Vega says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/60-minutes-trump-interview-viewer-reaction-b2862238.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/10/14/54/Screenshot-Capture-2025-11-10-07-10-55.png?crop=1054.5,703,x129.2,y0&trim=0,129,0,129&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-10 14:48:38","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":377541694,"title":"Donald Trump pardons Rudy Giuliani and others who backed efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss","text":"By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, his onetime chief of staff Mark Meadows and others accused of backing the Republican’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe “full, complete, and unconditional” pardon applies only to federal crimes, and none of the dozens of Trump allies named in the proclamation were ever charged federally over the bid to subvert the election won by Democrat Joe Biden. It doesn’t impact state charges, though state prosecutions stemming from the 2020 election have hit a dead end or are just limping along.\n\nThe move, however, underscores Trump’s continued efforts to promote the idea that the 2020 election was stolen from him even though courts around the country and U.S. officials found no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome. It follows the sweeping pardons of the hundreds of Trump supporters charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, including those convicted of attacking law enforcement.\n\nAmong those also pardoned were Sidney Powell, an attorney who promoted baseless conspiracy theories about a stolen election, John Eastman, another lawyer who pushed a plan to keep Trump in power, and Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official who championed Trump’s efforts to challenge his election loss. Also named were Republicans who acted as fake electors for Trump and were charged in state cases accusing them of submitting false certificates that confirmed they were legitimate electors despite Biden’s victory in those states.\n\nThe proclamation, posted online late Sunday by pardon attorney Ed Martin, explicitly says the pardon does not apply to the president himself.\n\nThe pardon described efforts to prosecute the Trump allies as “a grave national injustice perpetrated on the American people” and said the pardons were designed to continue “the process of national reconciliation.” Giuliani and others have denied any wrongdoing, arguing they were simply challenging an election they believed was tainted by fraud.\n\n“These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an emailed statement.\n\nThose pardoned were not prosecuted by the Biden administration, however. They were charged only by state prosecutors who operate separately from the Justice Department.\n\nTrump himself was indicted on federal felony charges accusing him of working overturn his 2020 election defeat, but the case brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith was abandoned in November after Trump’s victory over Democrat Kamala Harris because of the department’s policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Giuliani, Powell, Eastman and Clark were alleged co-conspirators in the federal case brought against Trump but were never charged with federal crimes.\n\nGiuliani, Meadows and others named in the proclamation had been charged by prosecutors in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin over the 2020 election, but the cases have repeatedly hit roadblocks or have been dismissed. A judge in September dismissed the Michigan case against 15 Republicans accused of attempting to falsely certify Trump as the winner of the election in that battleground state.\n\nGiuliani, a former New York City mayor, was one of the most vocal supporters of Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of large-scale voter fraud after the 2020 election. He has since been disbarred in Washington, D.C., and New York over his advocacy of Trump’s bogus election claims and lost a $148 million defamation case brought by two former Georgia election workers whose lives were upended by conspiracy theories he pushed.\n\nEastman, a former dean of Chapman University Law School in Southern California, was a close adviser to Trump in the wake of the 2020 election and wrote a memo laying out steps Vice President Mike Pence could take to stop the counting of electoral votes while presiding over Congress’ joint session on Jan. 6 to keep Trump in office.\n\nClark, who is now overseeing a federal regulatory office, also is facing possible disbarment in Washington over his advocacy of Trump’s claims. Clark clashed with Justice Department superiors over letter he drafted after the 2020 election that said the department was investigating “various irregularities” and had identified “significant concerns” that may have impacted the election in Georgia and other states. Clark wanted the letter sent to Georgia lawmakers, but top Justice Department officials refused.\n\nClark said in a social media post on Monday that he “did nothing wrong” and “shouldn’t have had to battle this witch hunt for 4+ years.”","summary":"By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; President Donald Trump has pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, his onetime chief of staff Mark Meadows and others accused of backing the Republican&#8217;s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

The US President has threatened to sue the broadcaster, it was revealed on Monday (November 10). The BBC confirmed receipt of the letter from Trump and will \"respond in due course\", according to BBC News. This significant development follows an apology from BBC Chair Samir Shah for what he termed an \"error of judgement\" regarding the editing mishap. Earlier today, Mr Shah stated: \"Since the publication of Mr Prescott's memo, this issue has led to over 500 complaints . These are now being dealt with in the normal way. It has also prompted further reflection by the BBC. \"The conclusion of that deliberation is that we accept that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement.\" In the wake of public backlash over a BBC documentary accused of misrepresenting Donald Trump's January 6 speech, BBC Director-General Tim Davie and BBC News Chief Deborah Turness stepped down, reports the Express . Davie acknowledged errors and accepted full responsibility, while Turness pointed to the damage caused by the controversy. Trump hailed their resignations on Truth Social as a victory against what he dubbed the \"Fake News\" media. He levelled accusations at the BBC for tampering with his speech and commended The Telegraph for exposing what he termed as journalistic corruption, branding Davie and Turness as deceitful individuals who attempted to sway the presidential election. Asked directly if Mr Trump has said he will be suing the BBC, Mr Shah told culture editor Katie Razzall: “I do not know that yet, but he’s a litigious fellow so we should be prepared for all outcomes.” Reform leader Nigel Farage said he spoke with Mr Trump on Friday, telling a London press conference: “He just said to me: ‘Is this how you treat your best ally?’ “It’s quite a powerful comment.” Mr Trump has a history of suing news organisations in the US. He previously settled a defamation lawsuit against ABC News after star anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely said he had been found “liable for rape”. Mr Trump also settled a legal dispute with CBS News over an interview it broadcast on its 60 Minutes programme with former vice president Kamala Harris. He is currently engaged in lawsuits with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Mr Trump has also taken action against the Associated Press after the wire service refused to call the Gulf of Mexico by his preferred name for it: the Gulf of America.

Ida B. Wells say they plan to update the building’s iconic 108-panel stained-glass skylight and the surrounding atrium, located directly above the main balcony.\n\n“We know we’ve got our work cut out for us,” said architect Matt McNicholas, who is also an Auditorium board member. “We’re very excited about the way this is going to shock people, because it hasn’t been seen in anyone’s lifetime.”\n\nThe restoration, intended to wrap by fall 2027, will total nearly $3 million and be funded by donations from local organizations and a prestigious $625,000 federal grant from the National Park Service, known as the Saving America’s Treasures grant.\n\nThe renovation project will allow for sunlight to shine through the stained-glass panels for the first time in the building’s history, according to McNicholas.\n\nThe panels, designed by stained glass artists George Healy and Louis Millet in 1889, were crafted from jewels and feature organic shapes inspired by nature, intertwined with elaborate knot patterns. They became popular thanks to Sullivan’s signature neo-Celtic style that defined much of the Chicago architecture of that era.\n\nHealy and Millet’s panels were so impressive the pair exhibited them at the Paris World’s Fair of 1889 to showcase Chicago’s architectural innovation, and their work forever changed how the rest of the world sees stained glass.\n\nAccording to McNicholas, crews will also work to restore the signature Celtic stenciling found on the atrium’s walls, designed by Sullivan. His stencils decorate the walls and floors of the entire building, but for decades, eight layers of paint have covered the ones hidden along the atrium walls. Those originals likely have not been seen since the 1920s, McNicholas said.\n\nDuring the discovery phase of the project, preservationists used a meticulous chemical process to carefully expose the stencils. They also mapped out what everything would have looked like when it opened to the public in 1889, said Auditorium Theatre CEO Rich Regan.\n\nNext summer, a large work deck will be suspended from the atrium to safely prepare all the surfaces for new stencil, paint and gilding applications. The restoration crew will address the stained glass at the same time, Regan added.\n\nDuring a restoration project in 1967, the building closed for more than a year. However, thanks to modern systems such as the platform Regan mentioned, the theater can remain open through the end of this renovation project.\n\nAs one of the country’s last remaining buildings by Sullivan and Adler, the Auditorium leaders hope the theater can serve as a leading example of preservation for other historic structures nationwide at risk of destruction or neglect.\n\n“It’s about the history and the presence [of] this theater … and the ideas of democracy behind the design,” McNicholas said, referring to the way the box seats were built on the left and right sides of the house, instead of directly in the front.\n\nWhen the Auditorium Theatre opened in 1889, it was the tallest building in the United States at the time. Because it’s such an old structure and the wear and tear of time, temperature and limited resources, the theater is consequently in a “constant state of restoration,” Regan said.\n\nOver the past several years, various parts of the building have received updates. With a total capacity of 3,875, every seat in the house got an update, including those in the private boxes. The Auditorium also has new sound, lighting and HVAC systems.\n\nSullivan’s partnership with Dankmar Adler is regarded as one of the most influential in American history. The pair officially began working together on the Auditorium in 1886 with the help of Frank Lloyd Wright, a then 22-year-old intern who went on to become a significant figure in architecture on his own.\n\nRegan said he hopes the men who worked on the building in the late 1800s would be amazed the Auditorium Theatre is still standing today.\n\n“Many of their other structures throughout the city were torn down. They would be amazed to see that the Auditorium is not just standing but operating, filled with shows and restoration work,” he said.\n\nDuring a walk through of the project, the sounds of Americana guitarist and singer-songwriter Boz Scaggs floated up to the atrium as his band sound checked for a concert that night.\n\n“We’re a resource for the community,” Regan said, “whether it’s music or whether it’s comedy, or whether it’s spoken word, or whether it’s acting, we have such variety here.”\n\nRecent events include a sold-out series of David Byrne concerts and a conversation with former Vice President Kamala Harris on the topic of her new political memoir, “107 Days.”\n\nThe venue has also been the stage for several former U.S. presidents who were nominated by their respective parties, such as Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt in 1912 by the Bull Moose Party.\n\n“The history that has happened within the walls here is just incredible,” McNicholas said, adding it goes beyond the physical structure of the place. Roosevelt gave his famous Armageddon speech, during which he told the audience: “… the time is ripe, and overripe, for a genuine Progressive movement.”\n\nAnd during the 1916 Republican National Convention, the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage introduced the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, also known as the 19th Amendment, which would effectively grant women the right to vote.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/theater/2025/11/10/chicago-auditorium-theatre-restoration-sullivan-adler-atrium-historic","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05bb05b/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3600x2400+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F02%2F84fbdbac4e40a58fdab224f060a4%2F157-s","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-10 11:30:00","author":"Ambar Colón","authors":["Ambar Colón"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.229},{"id":377549410,"title":"Trump pardons Rudy Giuliani, others who backed efforts to overturn 2020 election, official says","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and others accused of backing the Republican’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to a Justice Department official.\n\nEd Martin, the government’s pardon attorney, posted on social media a signed proclamation of the “full, complete, and unconditional” pardon.\n\nThe list released by Martin includes dozens of Trump's political allies, and also names conservative lawyers Sidney Powell and John Eastman. \n\n\"No MAGA left behind,\" Martin posted on X before sharing the signed document. \n\nThe proclamation explicitly says the pardon does not apply to Trump.\n\nPresidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, and none of the Trump allies named were charged in federal cases over the 2020 election.

Or if you were happy with the candidate you chose and would do it again if the 2024 election were held tomorrow – with the same people on the ballot.\n\nThe volume of responses we got was truly stunning. In the hundreds of submissions, we read how most of you said you had no regrets about your vote and that there was no question you would check the same name on the ballot, given the choice. Many of you said you felt the opposing candidate was unfit, \"toxic\" or a danger to the Constitution and rule of law, and that your views have been reinforced by events since the 2024 election.\n\nBut some of you did have regrets, saying you had learned more about the candidates – or that you were disappointed in how the country is now being run. Some of you were sorry because you didn't vote and wished you had cast a ballot.\n\nYou can read a collection of these responses below, or send in your own to us at forum@usatoday.com using the subject line \"Forum Vote.\"\n\nI voted for Harris. One year later, I'm glad I did.\n\nI voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. Nearly one year later, I'm very glad I did. I knew Donald Trump was a toxic leader, and he has proved me right many times over.\n\nThere is no way I would have voted for a person who had already proved that he will not support and defend the Constitution. Trump has again proved me right as he appears to be working to dismantle the Constitution. I am a 21-year Air Force veteran, and I took the oath to support and defend the Constitution against ALL enemies, and Trump is the Constitution's enemy. I cannot believe that a person who incited an insurrection was reelected. The 77 million people who voted for him are to blame for the downward spiral of our democracy!\n\nI am extremely likely to vote in the 2026 midterm elections. And if the 2024 presidential election were held today – with the same candidates – I would 100% vote for Harris. She was and would still be the best candidate. I think some people did not vote for her because she is a Black Asian American woman, and I think that's sad.\n\n— Barry Nixon, Colorado Springs, Colorado\n\nI would vote for Trump again if the election were held today\n\nI voted for Trump in 2024. He is trying to do exactly what he said he was going to do.\n\nI'm angry with leftist Democrats whom I see as refusing to allow him to be the president by fighting his every step and by employing threats of violence and violent protests. Leftist Democrats seem to be inciting the general protest mobs to interfere, obstruct and undermine the rule of law.\n\nI would vote the same way if the election were held again today. Trump is the only president in my lifetime to actually adhere to cutting the size and cost of government, a plank of the Republican Party for decades. I believe he is also upholding the Second Amendment, stopping illegal immigration, stopping the fentanyl epidemic and enforcing the rule of law.\n\nI am extremely likely to vote in the midterm elections in 2026 and in the 2028 presidential election.\n\n— Michael Sessa, Cropwell, Alabama\n\nI'm a conservative who wrote in Mitt Romney. I stand by my vote.\n\nFor the 2024 presential election, I wrote in Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate who served as my state's senator.\n\nAs a conservative, I feel completely exonerated in my determination not to vote for Trump, or any other candidate on the ballot. Trump 2.0 is 10 times worse than 1.0, with norms, institutions and even constitutional checks falling left and right before a capricious and amoral authoritarian.\n\nI'd do the same thing again if the election were held today with the same candidates – meaning I'd write in someone with the capacity and values to run the country honorably.\n\nI'm extremely like to vote in both the 2026 midterm elections and in the 2028 presidential election.\n\n— Paul Taylor, Pleasant Grove, Utah","summary":"I voted for Trump.

The proclamation, posted online late Sunday, explicitly says the pardon does not apply to Trump.\n\nPresidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, and none of the Trump allies named were charged in federal cases over the 2020 election. But the move underscores President Donald Trump’s continued efforts to promote the idea that the 2020 election was stolen from him even though courts around the country and U.S. officials found no evidence of fraud that could have affected the outcome. It follows the sweeping pardons of the hundreds of Trump supporters charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, including those convicted of attacking law enforcement. \n\nThe proclamation described efforts to prosecute those accused of aiding Trump’s efforts to cling to power as “a grave national injustice perpetrated on the American people” and said the pardons were designed to continue “the process of national reconciliation.” \n\nThe White House didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Monday.\n\nAlso pardoned were Republicans who acted as fake electors for Trump in 2020 and were charged in state cases of submitting false certificates that confirmed they were legitimate electors despite Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in those states. Another key figure on the list is Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official who championed Trump’s efforts to challenge his election loss. \n\nTrump himself was indicted on felony charges accusing him of working overturn his 2020 election defeat, but the case brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith was abandoned in November after Trump’s victory over Democrat Kamala Harris because of the department’s policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. \n\nGiuliani, Meadows and others who were named in the proclamation had been charged by state prosecutors over the 2020 election, but the cases have hit a dead end or are just limping along. A judge in September dismissed the Michigan case against 15 Republicans accused of attempting to falsely certify Trump as the winner of the election in that battleground state. \n\nGiuliani, Powell, Eastman and Clark were alleged co-conspirators in the federal case brought against Trump but were never charged with federal crimes. \n\nGiuliani, a former New York City mayor, was one of the most vocal supporters of Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of large-scale voter fraud after the 2020 election. He has since been disbarred in Washington, D.C., and New York over his advocacy of Trump’s bogus election claims and lost a $148 million defamation case brought by two former Georgia election workers whose lives were upended by conspiracy theories he pushed. \n\nEastman, a former dean of Chapman University Law School in Southern California, was a close adviser to Trump in the wake of the 2020 election and wrote a memo laying out steps Vice President Mike Pence could take to stop the counting of electoral votes while presiding over Congress’ joint session on Jan. 6 to keep Trump in office.\n\nAlanna Durkin Richer, The Associated Press","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and others accused of backing the Republican&#8217;s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, a Justice Department official says.

She had already been kicked off most mainstream social-media platforms for things like “hateful conduct” and being a “dangerous individual.” She took to carrying a bullhorn around and contemplated driving her car off a cliff. In 2020, she ran for Congress, in the Florida district that included Mar-a-Lago, but she couldn’t make a candidate Facebook account or use PayPal to raise money. Her Democratic opponent refused to say her name, instead referring to her as a woman with the darkest heart she had ever known. Loomer lost the election by twenty points. She descended even further into what she called her “oubliette.” Increasingly, she had the sense that she was taking part in an ongoing conversation with Trump, almost like a shared inner monologue. “I don’t want to say, ‘Oh, President Trump is me,’ or, ‘I see myself in Trump.’ But I do. I mean, I do,” she told me recently. “Every time I listen to him speak, I feel like I’m listening to myself speak to myself. Does that make sense?”\nWe were at the memorial service for Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist, at a football stadium in Glendale, Arizona. (Kirk, who founded the youth organization Turning Point USA, had just been assassinated while speaking at a campus event in Utah.) The service, which was attended by nearly a hundred thousand mourners, began with three hours of live Christian rock. A man dragged a large wooden cross around the arena; babies wore noise-cancelling headphones while their parents swayed to the music. Loomer, who is thirty-two, casts herself as the President’s chief loyalty enforcer. She lives her life largely online—her Twitter account was reinstated in 2022, after Elon Musk purchased the company—where she posts long threads questioning the credentials and allegiances of Trump Administration officials, among other suspects. It’s always a bit disorienting to see her in person. She is slight and fairly sedate. At the memorial service, she wore a blue blouse, black slacks, and white loafers. “Since they tried killing Trump, I try not to go to events,” she said. “I’ve just been hiding in my hotel room.”\nFor twenty hours a day, from about 5 a.m. to 1 a.m., Loomer releases torrents of accusations and invective, an infinite scroll of alleged misdeeds and nefarious connections. She writes with the urgency of an Amber Alert, or of an incensed traveller tweeting at United Airlines in the middle of a flight delay. (“NEW: Anti-Trump, Islamist, Pakistani Immigrant State Department Employee Who Attacked Trump’s Islamic Travel Ban And Advocated For Islamic Foot Washing Stations At @StateDept Still Employed At US State Department Under Trump’s Administration. SHE JUST DELETED HER LINKEDIN!”) Though many of Loomer’s posts read like empty threats being pushed out into the void, they often reach more than a million people. She has credited herself with purging dozens of people from both the Administration and high-ranking roles in the private sector. Her motives apparently range from a desire to save the country to unabashed, petty vindictiveness; the two often overlap. She has a receptive ear in the White House. Despite never working for Trump in an official capacity—a job offer was rescinded after staffers opposed bringing her on—he has, since retaking the Presidency, allowed her to “come and visit occasionally,” Loomer told me. Trump, she insisted, is the only “other person on this planet who I think can actually empathize with me and who I can actually empathize with. I really do believe that.” He recently told her, “You’re great, and you’re difficult.”\nOn the floor of the stadium, the music was so loud that it was almost impossible to hear anything. I stood behind a woman who was swirling her white dress around before falling to her knees to pray. Above, I could see Trump in his glass-encased skybox. Two planes full of Administration officials, practically the entire Cabinet, had come from Washington for the funeral, as had a cross-section of the wider MAGA universe—from Tucker Carlson to the guy who shows up at rallies dressed as the border wall. Near the stage, where V.I.P. guests were filtering through the crowd to take their seats in a roped-off section, a woman on a motorized scooter backed up to hug Loomer and congratulate her on her work. Two teen-agers in Trump hats asked her for selfies. “I love when you drop the teasers and it’s, like, ‘I’m going to kill you later!’ ” one said. (Loomer will often post a red siren emoji with a directive to keep watching her account for a bombshell reveal.) Jacob Wells, a founder of GiveSendGo, an online fund-raising platform that Loomer has used to solicit donations for her “lawfare fund,” came up to shake her hand.\nSean Curran, the director of the Secret Service, approached the V.I.P. area, flanked by a coterie of other agents. Loomer recognized him immediately; Curran had jumped on Trump during the attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n“Oh, my God, that’s the hero that saved President Trump!” Loomer said.\nShe went up to say hello. They, too, hugged and took a photo together.\n“I’d love to talk to you sometime,” Curran said. “I’ll give you my contact.” He pressed a Secret Service commemorative coin into her palm.\nLoomer has described her work by quoting Plato: “No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth.” At the memorial, at least in some corners, she was being received with reverence. “People who are entrusted with the life of the President value the work that I’m doing,” she told me. She radiated a sense of weariness that this grand task, of being Trump’s protector and soothsayer, fell to her. “Why is it that I’m the one that has to identify people who are actively working against him?”\nLoomer had started to attack Warner the previous week, after he visited an ICE detention center. (Members of Congress are allowed to conduct such visits for oversight purposes, but many have been turned away or arrested.) “I don’t follow Ms. Loomer’s tweeting,” Warner told me. “But I was told that she’d gone on a screech for some time, calling me out.” He wasn’t sure whether to categorize her as a “trolling blogger” or a shadow member of the Administration. “When Laura Loomer tweets, Trump’s Cabinet jumps,” he said. Some of Warner’s Republican friends on the Hill had been attacked by her, too. Warner went on, “She’s an equal-opportunity offender.”\nBy then, Loomer’s interference in government matters had become a regular occurrence. In early April, Mike Waltz, then the national-security adviser, walked into the Oval Office to find Loomer sitting across from the President, in the midst of a presentation that questioned the allegiances of a number of members of his National Security Council. After the meeting, Trump hugged Loomer, then promptly fired six members of the N.S.C. He also fired General Timothy Haugh, the head of the National Security Agency and of U.S. Cyber Command. According to Loomer, Haugh, a thirty-three-year veteran of the Air Force, was close with General Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whom Trump had appointed and then clashed with during his first term. Wendy Noble, Haugh’s deputy, was also fired; she was apparently connected to another Trump critic, James Clapper, Barack Obama’s director of National Intelligence.\nLoomer wanted Waltz gone, too—he had been tagged as a neocon who, in her estimation, was contravening Trump’s desires. She was also concerned about his judgment: his deputy, Alex Wong, was married to a career prosecutor who had worked at the Department of Justice during the Biden Administration. A few weeks later, they both departed. Loomer posted, “SCALP.”\nAccording to three people with direct knowledge of Waltz’s ouster, Loomer had nothing to do with it. “It wasn’t working out with him,” someone with close ties to the White House told me. “She ends up getting the credit for it because she’s the one out there talking.” (Weeks before, Waltz had inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, to a Signal chat in which members of the Administration were discussing plans to bomb Yemen.) Still, White House officials—and operatives across Washington—have no choice but to deal with her. “I was on an hour-long Zoom call, which probably cost, when you think of how much everyone was getting paid, at least fifty thousand dollars, to talk about what to do about Loomer,” a consultant who works with the Administration told me. Her screeds are routinely cited in major newspapers and footnoted in lawsuits; her targets range from low-level government employees to the Pope. Recently, Loomer posted that an official at Customs and Border Protection was “Anti-Trump, pro-Open Borders, and Pro-DEI.” Three days later: “Now he’s FIRED.” She described Lisa Monaco, Microsoft’s new head of global affairs—and Joe Biden’s Deputy Attorney General—as a “rabid Trump hater,” and demanded that the company’s government contracts, which total billions of dollars, be revoked. “Wait till President Trump sees this,” she wrote. Not long afterward, Trump called for Monaco to be fired. Loomer picked up the baton, tagging Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s C.E.O. “Are you going to comply? Or continue to be two-faced?” she wrote. “How dare you.”\nLoomer’s influence extends beyond the realm of personnel. In August, a group of Palestinian children who had been severely injured in the war in Gaza arrived in San Francisco after the State Department issued around two hundred temporary visas for medical treatment. Loomer posted a video of the children being received with flowers at the airport. “Why are any Islamic invaders coming into the US under the Trump admin?” she wrote. “Who signed off on these visas? They should be fired.” She tagged Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, who was with Trump on Air Force One, having just met with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to try to broker an end to the war in Ukraine. “Look, President Trump has said he wants to crack down on Islamic terror, that he wants to crack down on Hamas,” Loomer told me. “I’ll tag whoever’s in charge of the agency, the offending agency, and I’ll say, ‘Are you going to be prepared to tell President Trump how this is in compliance with his agenda?’ ” She and Rubio spoke that evening. “He took a hands-on approach,” Loomer told me. The next day, the Administration suspended all visitor visas for anyone from Gaza. Republican lawmakers celebrated online. “I’m not saying Rubio is trying to run a fast one on Trump, but obviously there’s a lot of people at the State Department who shouldn’t be working there,” she said. “Bad actors.”\nDuring Trump’s first term, his agenda was frequently stymied by what maga acolytes consider disloyal political appointees and deep-state bureaucrats. “Trump One was a disappointment in a lot of ways,” a strategist with close ties to the Administration told me. “People got let in that were not aligned. Everybody is super psycho afraid of being screwed over again.” This time, rooting out perceived internal enemies has become an obsession. Cabinet secretaries have required staff members to take random polygraph tests. A high-level Administration official told me that, during one of the interviews for her position, her interlocutor opened his mouth to reveal that he had a maga tattoo on the underside of his lower lip. “It’s over the top, but it’s the currency of the realm,” the high-level official said. As the strategist put it, “We’ve fought too hard to get here—that’s just the feeling that permeates everything.” At dinner one night, a lawyer with ties to the Administration told me, “We took power, but we’re in a cold war, and we may not win.”\nLoomer thrives in this paranoid ambience. “I am screenshotting everyone’s posts and I’m going to deliver them in a package to President Trump so he sees who is truly with him and who isn’t,” she wrote recently. (Like Trump, she prints everything out.) Her vetting crusades have brought about a new Washington colloquialism. “Bro, I got Loomered,” a current Administration official said over drinks. David Sacks, Trump’s A.I. czar, mentioned on a podcast that A.I. critics ought to be “Loomered.” Trump himself has said, “If you’re Loomered, you’re in deep trouble. That’s the end of your career, in a sense.” Loomer describes her project as a constant purge. “Every day, I find a new one,” she told me. “It’s never going to end.”\nGrowing up, her household was generally conservative. Loomer has two brothers, one of whom suffers from schizophrenia, and when she was twelve her father enrolled her and the other brother in a private boarding school to keep them away from what could be a violent home environment. The school, on a ranch in the Arizona desert, was selective and remote. (Ronald Reagan and James Stewart sent their children there.) It had an internet curfew and almost no cell service. “Fear of being cut off from the world has stayed with me my whole life,” Loomer wrote. She moved across the country to attend Mount Holyoke College, a women’s liberal-arts school in Massachusetts. It was not a good fit. “Militant Marxist lesbians who, as soon as they got wind of my politics, wanted my head on a pike,” she wrote. She transferred to Barry University, a Catholic college in Miami. It wasn’t much better: “An impossible nightmare of woke from which I barely escaped without having my life ruined and almost going to jail.” In her senior year, she vehemently protested an interfaith 9/11 memorial service that included Muslim prayers, which she found deeply offensive. “The administration feared that I was either mentally ill or that I was in need of an urgent spiritual intervention,” she wrote.\nLoomer’s outburst garnered enough attention that, in 2014, she was invited to a yearly retreat hosted by the late conservative writer David Horowitz, whose organization centers on opposing “efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country.” Candace Owens was among the other aspirational activists who got their start there. Horowitz also mentored Stephen Miller, now a deputy chief of staff in the White House, whom he met when Miller was a teen-ager in Santa Monica. (Later, under Horowitz’s supervision, Miller set up an “Islamo-fascism awareness week” at Duke.)\nAt the conference, which was held at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, Loomer saw a presentation by James O’Keefe, the founder of the undercover-sting outfit Project Veritas. “I loved his videos, especially the video where he dressed up like Osama bin Laden and crossed America’s southern border with Mexico to emphasize our lack of border security,” Loomer wrote. After the talk, she approached O’Keefe and told him that she would do anything to work at Project Veritas. She was so persistent that he was initially a little disturbed, thinking she was a mole who’d infiltrated the conference. “She appears to be functionally immune to fear, to shame, and to embarrassment,” O’Keefe later wrote.\nA month later, he summoned her to New York for a trial run. It was winter, and Loomer had bronchitis and no warm clothes. O’Keefe’s team gave her a script and a long-sleeved shirt fitted with a hidden camera. The target was Black Lives Matter activists—that summer, a Black man named Eric Garner had died after being put in a chokehold by an N.Y.P.D. officer, leading to protests around the city. Loomer managed to share a cab with Erica Garner, one of Eric’s daughters, and secretly recorded her talking about Al Sharpton, who was organizing demonstrations on behalf of the family.\n“So, what, you think Al Sharpton is kind of, like, a crook, in a sense?” Loomer asks.\n“He’s about this,” Erica replies, rubbing her fingers together.\n“He’s about his money with you?”\n\nThe cover of the New York Post read “ALL ABOUT THE MONEY.” Loomer was hired. Soon she was baiting her own university by trying to start an “ISIS club”—Sympathetic Students in Support of the Islamic State—and recording her interactions with school administrators using her hidden camera. (The school was open to the idea, but tried to steer her away from putting Isis in the name.) After her “exposé” was published, she was expelled and banned from campus. But Project Veritas implemented versions of her “ISIS club” script at colleges around the country. Trump, who was a few months away from announcing his run for President, heard about the videos on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show and faxed a message to O’Keefe, asking him to come to Trump Tower. Loomer was in Florida dealing with her expulsion and had to miss the meeting. “I certainly couldn’t have predicted how intertwined Donald J. Trump would later become in my life,” she wrote. Her father, meanwhile, was crestfallen that there would be no college graduation for him to attend. (He could not be reached for comment.) “This won’t matter,” she told him. “You’ll see. By the time I am twenty-eight, I will be in the Oval Office some way or another. I’m doing things my way.”\nIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton became a favored target. Loomer started sneaking into her fund-raisers. “People think political royalty like the Clintons and the Trumps are untouchable and impossible to reach,” she wrote. “That’s where most people are wrong.” Her advice: act confident, use hair dye and glasses if you need to disguise your appearance, and go for the “ninja aesthetic.” Don’t worry about the Secret Service. At one event, Loomer, with her hidden camera, filmed Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide, talking about Clinton’s commitment to admitting refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. Two weeks before the election, Trump tweeted, “Wow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible. We cannot let this happen.” (Loomer has maintained that it was her video that “undeniably shaped the outcome of the Presidential election.”)\nIn 2017, Loomer confronted Clinton at a launch event for her book “What Happened,” Clinton’s election postmortem. Loomer was recovering from a nose job and was still meant to be wearing a cast on her face; she asked her plastic surgeon to take it off early, covered her bruises in layers of concealer, and headed to the Barnes & Noble in Union Square. At the book-signing table, she grilled Clinton on Benghazi, the “missing e-mails,” and a former staff member whose death has been the subject of various conspiracy theories. “You know what, I’m so sorry you believe things that are untrue,” Clinton responded, before Loomer was removed by security.\nThe next year, during the midterms, Loomer, who identifies as a “proud Islamophobe,” travelled the country “investigating jihadi candidates.” After the election, she was banned from Twitter for posting that Ilhan Omar, the Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, was “anti Jewish” and “pro Sharia,” which the site labelled as hate speech. Loomer was twenty-five. “I will never truly recover,” she wrote. Her life’s work had been “incinerated by gleeful vandals.” She went to dinner in Fort Lauderdale with Trump’s longtime adviser Roger Stone, who had become one of her mentors. He told her that she had to carry on. A few days after the dinner, while live-streaming, she handcuffed herself to the front door of Twitter’s New York headquarters, wearing a Star of David to convey, as she put it, “the fact that Jack Dorsey and Big Tech were behaving like Nazis with the same type of censorship tactics Hitler and the Gestapo utilized in 1930s Germany.” She threw the key to the handcuffs down a storm drain and yelled into a megaphone. (After several hours, police used a bolt cutter to free her.)\nOther bans followed: Facebook, Instagram, PayPal, Venmo, GoFundMe. (She’d already been kicked off Lyft, Uber, and Uber Eats.) Loomer entered what she described as a “deep dark pit of depression and anxiety.” She asked a prominent maga lawyer to help her sue various tech platforms. “This was right after a woman had gone to YouTube and shot it up,” the lawyer told me. “Laura was, like, ‘I’m going to be like that woman!’ She was threatening to murder everyone, and then commit suicide. She was insane.” (Loomer told me that she would never “incite violence” and that she brought up the YouTube shooting to illustrate how deplatforming could cause someone to “snap.”) She felt like she was enduring a form of drug withdrawal. “Sometimes I worry that I will be alone forever as a result of being digitally erased in a world where all aspects of life seem to take place online,” she wrote.\nLoomer soon figured out a way to get herself back into the conversation. One night in 2019, furious that she couldn’t post about “selfish open-borders Democrats,” she decided to pull another stunt. The next morning, she drove from Tucson to Napa Valley, hired several day laborers, and instructed them to set up a tent in the front yard of Nancy Pelosi’s vacation home. She used zip ties to hang up pictures of Americans who had allegedly been murdered by immigrants. (The presentation looked quite a lot like the mug shots of “illegals” that Trump subsequently displayed at his rallies, and then, earlier this year, on the White House lawn.) Infowars broadcast her stunt, which went viral. “There is no feeling more exhilarating than seeing your name trend as the number one topic in the world on a site you’re banned from,” Loomer wrote. “It makes you feel supernatural, like you’re coming back from the dead.” She claims that Trump saw and “loved” the video, and that he was inspired to replicate it on a larger scale by having ice deposit immigrant detainees in sanctuary cities. (This plan never came to fruition, though Republican governors later picked it up during the Biden Administration.) “That’s when I realized, Donald J. Trump wasn’t just my president, he was also a fan!” Loomer wrote.\nStone had identified Loomer as a “young person who would say and do these wild things,” a Trump official told me. “When Trump needed to build kind of an untraditional cadre outside of the establishment Party, we leaned on people like her.” In 2020, Karen Giorno, a former Trump adviser who ran his Florida operation through the 2016 primary, was tapped to put together a congressional campaign for Loomer. Giorno imposed some conditions: don’t lie about other candidates, and prioritize your mental health. (Loomer had been in therapy for what she described as “PTSD I have developed as a result of being silenced.”) Giorno bought her an English bulldog, which Loomer named Loomer.\nDoug Dechert, a conservative writer and consultant, met Loomer at a restaurant in Palm Beach at the start of her campaign. “We agreed intensely on the issue of the Muslim invasion,” he told me. “I opened my Rolodex to her.” Loomer courted wealthy patrons, including Julie Fancelli, the heir to the Publix grocery-store fortune, who was a main financial backer of the Stop the Steal rally that preceded the January 6th Capitol riot. Caroline Wren, Trump’s former campaign-finance director, said, of Loomer, “The MAGA donors love her.”\nLoomer lost the election. Two years later, she ran again. Trump declined to endorse her; he told Giorno that she was too controversial. Loomer picked fights with Trump-backed candidates in Florida and alienated several political operatives, some of whom went on to work in the White House. “Her ability to shoot at her own team gets tiresome,” the Trump official told me. She started to say that she planned to lead a hostile takeover of the G.O.P. When she lost the second race, she declared victory anyway, claiming voter fraud and election interference. (“YOU DO NOT CONCEDE WHEN THERE IS THEFT INVOLVED!”)\nThis was one of several issues on which she aligned with Trump. Loomer had felt a kinship with him since high school, when she watched him on Fox News. Back then, she relished that “he was one of the first people that had the courage to speak the truth about Barack Hussein Obama being a Muslim with a fake birth certificate.” Now she was convinced that their desires and struggles—the stolen elections, the deplatforming—were intertwined. “I see my fight as his fight,” she told me. “They did to Trump what they did to me. And they did it to me first.” In March, 2023, Trump invited Loomer to Mar-a-Lago. (She had just Loomered a book event for Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who was emerging as a challenger to Trump in the upcoming Republican Presidential primary.) Trump had occasionally reposted her content on Truth Social, and she had screamed at him from rope lines to get his attention, but this was the first time that they met formally. “He’s my favorite person in the world,” Loomer told me.\nThat fall, she accompanied Trump to Philadelphia for his debate with Kamala Harris, in which he claimed that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors’ cats and dogs. In the previous weeks, Loomer had already been, as she put it to me, “holding people accountable” for the alleged pet-eating on her show, “Loomer Unleashed!,” which streams twice weekly on Rumble. When I talked to her after the debate, she was cagey about confirming whether she and Trump had spoken about the matter. “Whether or not we did, didn’t it work?” she asked. The Trump official told me, “There were moments where you could see ‘Laura could help with this.’ ”\nStill, in the final months of Trump’s campaign, seemingly everyone in maga world, even those on the furthest fringes, acknowledged that Loomer felt like a liability. Reporters started to ask Trump whether he was going to distance himself from her. That autumn, when I saw him at a campaign event on one of his golf courses, outside Los Angeles, he said, “Laura has to say what she wants. She’s a free spirit.”\nThis June, I ran into her in Washington, D.C., at the Waldorf Astoria, the former Trump Hotel. Though she comes to D.C. on occasion, she mostly stays home, in Pensacola, Florida, with her live-in boyfriend and her four dogs. (Loomer, the gift from Giorno, is now six years old. When we spoke on the phone, I often heard Loomer saying “Loomer, stop that” or “Loomer, come here.”) As we said hello to each other on the hotel’s stairs, Jacob Helberg, an Under-Secretary of State, walked by. “Your stuff has been great,” he said. Since Trump took office, her “scalps” had been steadily accumulating. “I think that President Trump knows who’s been for him and who has been against him,” she told me. “I mean, I would hope, right? I think there’s some cases where maybe he isn’t as aware as one would think.” Loomer is deeply aware. On the phone with me one afternoon, she offhandedly listed a number of people she was keeping on her radar. An Arizona politician whom Trump “half endorsed” had at one point donated to Chris Christie. Dusty Johnson, a Republican congressman from South Dakota, was only proposing legislation about the U.S. taking control of the Panama Canal, she said, because he wanted to paper over the fact that “he’s a strong ally of Liz Cheney.” They were all compromised, guilty by association. “Kevin McCarthy’s son worked with a venture capitalist who was holding fund-raisers for Ron DeSantis,” she went on. “From what I’ve seen, there really isn’t much vetting going on.”\nAround D.C., analogies abound—she was everything from Trump’s Rasputin to the “MAGA Grand Inquisitor.” A prominent D.C. lobbyist called her a “one-person Washington Times”; no, said a nominee for a senior Administration post, she was a “one-person wrecking crew.” The nominee went on, “She’s part loyal bagman, part Roy Cohn figure,” referring to Trump’s ruthless New York lawyer. (“I’m just a professional woman who supports President Trump,” she told me. “And he’s a very hospitable person.”) Tucker Carlson told me that Loomer was “so poisonous, I don’t like to speak her name.” A former N.S.C. official compared her to Jiang Qing, a wife of Mao Zedong and his partner in enforcing the Cultural Revolution. “This histrionic, conspiratorial, and aggressive woman was the keeper of a list of those to be purged,” he said. “She used her power to rain hell on her enemies, while also carrying out her fair share of personal vendettas.” He went on, “She described herself as Mao’s dog—absolute subservient loyalty, and of course she bit when he wanted her to.”\nLoomer thinks the most apt comparison is to Joseph McCarthy, a parallel she finds flattering. “I think people now realize he wasn’t as crazy as they thought he was,” she told me. “He’s one of the most underrated and underappreciated political figures in history. He was trying to warn us about the rot and the infestation in our government and within our educational institutions. People acted like he was un-American for simply trying to protect America. Everything he said turned out to be true.”\nIn September, at the Kirk memorial, Erika Kirk, Charlie’s widow, said that she had forgiven the man who killed her husband. The crowd stood to applaud her, many in tears. “I could never feel that,” Loomer told me. Kirk’s assassin, she added, “deserves a bullet to the head.” She preferred Trump’s line: “I hate my opponent.” Loomer told me that she had already been saying those words to herself before Trump took the stage. “I don’t believe in kumbaya,” she said. After Kirk was killed, Trump spoke with more frequency about “the enemy from within”; Loomer appreciated the renewed focus. “I have to say, I do want President Trump to be the ‘dictator’ the Left thinks he is, and I want the right to be as devoted to locking up and silencing our violent political enemies as they pretend we are,” she wrote. She was offering cash donations to anyone who gave her the names of pro-Palestine protesters, and began encouraging her followers to start Loomering people who’d made disparaging comments about Kirk, with the aim of getting them fired.\nWhenever I pressed Loomer on how exactly she conducts her work, and what she can take credit for, the conversation veered into the woo-woo zone. “I’m manifesting my role,” she told me. “You have to manifest what you want. My hope is to continue using my large platform to develop policy, but I don’t want to say I’m actually developing policy.” It was late at night, and we were walking around outside the Turning Point headquarters after the memorial. Loomer kept looking back to make sure nobody was following us. Flowers and crosses had been laid on the ground in the parking lot. “I’m not saying that I’m an adviser, but I can manifest it,” she said. “Do you understand what I’m saying? I’m manifesting it.” I was reminded of an early conversation I had with the strategist who is close to the Trump Administration. “Influence is perceived power,” he told me. “That’s what it is with Laura. If people think you have power, then you do.”\nThe strategist close to the Administration described Loomer as a “tool of people who have factional intentions.” At the State Department, for example, there is a “very zealous maga crowd who don’t like Rubio’s people. So they use Laura Loomer to say, ‘Those guys aren’t maga, these guys aren’t America First. They’re coming from Swampland.’ ” The consultant who works with the Administration told me that, whenever Loomer launches a new campaign against someone, there’s an “immediate witch hunt” at the White House “to see who told her to post.” Loomer told me that her targets sometimes call her to defend themselves, or go to Trump to ask if he can get her to stop. She is largely despised by people who work in the West Wing, aside from the President. “She has this itchy trigger finger,” the strategist said. “Sometimes she pulls the trigger and you’re, like, Oh, look, So-and-So is dead now. Isn’t that nice?” He went on, “But sometimes it’s, like, That is friendly fire, Laura, that is friendly fire. What are you doing?”\nLoyalty enforcement can also provide cover to obscure something else. One afternoon in March, Loomer posted about Adam Schleifer, an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles. “Fire him,” she wrote. “He supported the impeachment of President Trump and said he wanted to repeal Trump’s tax plan. We need to purge the US Attorney’s office of all leftist Trump haters.” About an hour after Loomer’s post, the Presidential Personnel Office e-mailed Schleifer to say that he had been terminated. It’s very unusual for the White House to directly fire a career prosecutor. Schleifer happened to be at work on a case against a Trump donor, Andrew Wiederhorn, a food-industry executive who was indicted for fraud last spring. (Wiederhorn pleaded not guilty.) Wiederhorn’s lawyers had been urging the Justice Department to remove Schleifer from the case; a new attorney handpicked by Trump soon dropped it entirely.\nDavid Feith, one of the N.S.C. officials Loomer was credited with removing, was on her target list because his father, Douglas Feith, had served in the George W. Bush Administration. Feith’s removal, however, appeared to be about more than familial association. The N.S.C. had been split over whether to end a Biden-era restriction on the sale of A.I. chips to the United Arab Emirates. Feith wanted to keep export controls in place, on national-security grounds. A faction within the Administration wanted to remove them, as did the U.A.E. and Nvidia. “Loomer did hit jobs on people who were inconvenient to very powerful interests, inside and outside the Administration,” the former N.S.C. official told me. The strategist said, “Laura isn’t just this wild attack dog. Those who know how to spot it can see where she’s being influenced.”\nThe consultant who works with the Administration, however, told me that some of his clients have hired Loomer to post. He took out his phone to show me a screenshot of a message exchange on Signal. “We’re already ginning up a Loomer tweet,” read one. (He covered the contact’s name with his hand.) “I honestly tell my clients not to,” the consultant said, of partnering with Loomer. “It works, like, one in a hundred times.” Still, he added, they see her “get a couple people fired, so they’re, like, If someone is doing something in the Administration that’s harmful to my interests, this will do it.” At minimum, he went on, “you scare them into changing their policies. They don’t want to be on the wrong side of Loomer.”\nThis summer, Vinay Prasad, a top scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, was working to place a regulatory hold on a muscular-dystrophy drug, owing to safety concerns. Soon after the hold went into effect, Loomer started criticizing him in a series of posts, writing that he had “infiltrated” the Administration as a “Marxist Trojan Horse.” Prasad resigned, under pressure, the following week. Sarepta Therapeutics, the drug’s manufacturer, stood to lose millions of dollars; to Loomer’s critics, the timing and intensity of her campaign against Prasad seemed like a form of lobbying. Ned Ryun, a conservative activist, summed up the sentiment on X: “The fact of the matter is you got funded by Sarepta Therapeutics to take Vinay out; probably thru a middle man for deniability but still pharma money funding it all.” (Loomer maintains that the timing of her tirade was a coincidence.) The current Administration official told me that “the consensus among political leadership was that this was a directed assault by corporate forces.” Prasad was reinstated less than two weeks later.\nOne night at Ned’s Club, a members-only lounge with views of the White House, Nigel Farage, the British politician who heads the populist Reform Party, was hosting a bash for the right-wing television channel GB News, which was opening a bureau in D.C. Several members of Trump’s Cabinet were there; Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, gave a toast. Loomer was at home in Florida, but longtime lobbyists and consultants were discussing her activities on two separate floors of the club. “It’s like this pay-to-play Tasmanian devil,” one veteran political operative told me. “You just feed her any sort of D.E.I. comment that some executive made over the last twelve years—then you just expect total anarchy and a wide blast zone.” On a lower floor, a prominent lobbyist said, “She doesn’t want to be seen as a hired gun because that would undermine her credibility with her base. She’s saying, ‘I just believe in the President and maga!’ But in certain instances, when she starts opining about public-policy issues, it raises questions.” He drew a comparison to his own work on the Hill: “I would call the Wall Street Journal editorial board, and then Larry Kudlow, who had a CNBC show, and tell them a few things to say. Laura’s doing her own version of Larry.”\nThe next morning, I met a popular Trump-connected lobbyist at his office downtown. He put chewing tobacco in his mouth, and some of it scattered down the front of his shirt as he described the stance on Venezuela he was pushing—that the U.S. should buy Venezuelan oil, which was currently sanctioned, because otherwise China would. Loomer had been posting about Venezuela, advocating for lifting sanctions on its oil sector and allowing American companies to operate there. “Hell, yeah, she’s getting paid!” the lobbyist said. “It’s just not a thing someone’s really passionate about—oil licenses in Venezuela. That’s not anyone’s natural position. It’s my position, and it’s the right position, but not because I just woke up one morning and was, like, ‘I’m going to get really involved in Venezuela.’ No, it was, like, ‘I have clients.’ ” Loomer sometimes corresponds with Harry Sargeant, a Florida oil magnate and a Trump ally who had several licenses to operate in Venezuela. When I asked her about the origins of a long and very technically detailed post she wrote just after the Administration revoked Sargeant’s licenses, among others, she told me, “I am actually very qualified, and I’m highly accomplished. These people constantly disparage me like I’m some kind of no-name floozy.”\nThe person with close ties to the White House said, “Do you really think Laura Loomer has an organic interest in the intricacies of Venezuelan oil leases? Give me a fucking break. Someone’s paying her to put out those tweets. Ditto with her interest in the Puerto Rican issue.” This summer, Loomer started weighing in on Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy crisis, calling on Trump to fire the island’s financial-oversight management board, which, among other things, oversees public-utility contracts. Trump dismissed the majority of the board members. Various companies and financial institutions promoted new ones who were friendlier to their interests. “She tweets about the most obscure things that only a lobbyist would care about,” the person with close ties to the White House said. “She’s a P.R. firm that the press likes to write about as if she’s the maga vanguard, like she’s there to police the movement. It’s horseshit.” The Trump-connected lobbyist told me, “Her whole shtick is purity, and so she believes getting paid is a dirty word—that it takes away her purity.”\nI’d heard from several people that various middlemen were used to set up payments to Loomer, in some cases using a maneuver called the “Loomer two-step.” I called a D.C. operative to ask him about it. “What is that, a dance move?” he said, before speaking energetically about the practice for fifteen minutes. “I mean, I would assume, like, whatever major investment firm isn’t going to pay DC Draino directly,” he said, referencing a popular MAGA social-media account. “In the past, you would do a Fox banner, but now it’s moved toward this ecosystem of paying people who tweet about Trump all the time.”\nOf course, plenty of people are compensated for posts in Washington’s influence ecosystem. One afternoon not long ago, I met up with a source who had just taken out cash to pay a right-wing outlet to write an article. “DC Draino and Libs of TikTok take thousands of bucks per post for this stuff,” the strategist who works with the Administration told me. (Neither account responded to a request for comment.) The Trump-connected lobbyist said, “I literally just ran two campaigns with MAGA influencers—by paying them to tweet.”\nIt is an ascendant model. Although lobbyists are required to register with the government and disclose their funding, influencers operate in a gray zone. “If Laura is taking meetings on the Hill with members of Congress and asking them to change a policy position, that’s lobbying,” another Trump-connected lobbyist said. “But if Laura is posting something on her Twitter to her almost two million followers—just because the U.S. government sees it and then decides to change their position, it doesn’t mean that’s lobbying.”\nThis gray zone extends beyond Loomer, and beyond domestic politics. In September, as Israel’s increasingly unpopular war in Gaza ground on, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with a cohort of influencers on a visit to New York; his government has reportedly started paying accounts in the U.S. to post pro-Israel content. (A spokesperson for the Israeli government said no payments were made.) Last year, a federal indictment alleged that Russia funnelled almost ten million dollars to a number of pro-Trump influencers, including Benny Johnson and Tim Pool, to push Kremlin-backed messages. (The influencers claimed they hadn’t known the funders were linked to Russia.) Popular online activists can be useful tools. As the high-level Administration official told me, “People start out as zealots—then they realize everything is for sale, even zealotry.”\nIn this new paradigm, there’s a term to describe the startlingly porous barrier between the internet and the government: “posters in control.” “Really a huge amount of policy is being driven from my group chats,” the nominee for a senior Administration post told me. “If we have something that’s popular in right-wing Twitter, the White House is acting on it ninety-plus per cent of the time. I mean, it’s really kind of amazing. Say someone is writing a speech, and he’s this totally online guy who puts what he sees into the mouth of a senior official. All of a sudden that’s policy, and that’s the message that people are talking about.”\nHer activism has never been completely independent. Early in her career, she sold her sting videos to Infowars and to the Gateway Pundit. She has been funded by Robert Shillman, the billionaire founder of Cognex Corporation, an industrial-automation company. (Shillman declined to comment for this article.) A former board member of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, Shillman supports a variety of Zionist causes. “With this pen and my checkbook, I provide ammunition,” he has said.\nShillman paid for Loomer to attend Horowitz’s conference, and also underwrote the work she produced at Project Veritas. “They were ahead of the times,” Raheem Kassam, who runs the National Pulse (“Where ‘MAGA’ Goes To Know”) and also received funding for “anti-jihad” work from Shillman, told me. “It was proto-influencer culture.” Shillman has also reportedly financed the British anti-Islam influencer Tommy Robinson and the far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders. (Shillman was a major donor to Turning Point USA, though he recently withdrew funding when its conferences hosted guests, such as Tucker Carlson, who weren’t seen as reliably pro-Israel.) According to reporting in the Wall Street Journal, Yaacov Apelbaum, an Israeli American cyberintelligence analyst, has provided Loomer with some of the research behind her recent attacks. “I just say what I say,” she told me when I asked about these connections. “I’m not a puppet.”\nIn 2018, Shillman contemplated cutting Loomer off because she didn’t seem “trainable” enough. It’s true that her willingness to go scorched earth is unique, even among maga influencers. “I want to be friends with the people I influence and not have people hate me,” the consultant who works with the Administration said. “Using Loomer is vindictive—it’s seen as ‘I’m going to sic this psychotic, dishonest woman on you.’ It’s not honorable.” As the nominee for a senior Administration post put it, “She has power to the extent that she’s willing to transgress any normal boundary of human behavior.”\nStill, the power she has is precarious. “She has no underlying coalition there to back her up if the President were to shift in his view of her value,” the former N.S.C. official said. “She’s one of those courtiers who are essentially useful megaphones, useful foils, and useful agents, but disposable.” It’s not clear what her future with Trump would be if the appearance of pure loyalty were stripped away. Trump doesn’t like when people seem to be making money off him. “If he hears, you know, she just put down a hundred eighty thousand dollars for a new Land Rover, that would make him bananas,” the veteran political operative said. “It’d be the kiss of death for her.”\nShe led me to a converted bedroom where she films her show. Studio lights illuminated her version of a contemporary podcasting backdrop: potted plants, signed MAGA hats arranged on a shelf, an alligator skull. On the wall hung framed photos of Loomer with Roger Stone, Alex Jones, Trump—and the Clintons, from times when she Loomered them. I joined her as she listened to a roundup of the day’s TV news clips about her, which her producer compiles each night. “Laura Loomer, the conspiracy theorist . . .” She petted Mecca, one of her dogs, whom she says she rescued from a meat market in China. Mecca was seated atop a desk, paws on a yellow pad. “Laura Loomer takes responsibility for the deportation . . .” Loomer keeps a panic button, which automatically dials 911, in the studio, and in every other room in the house. The police recently arrested a man who had threatened her online, accusing her, in part, of secretly working on behalf of Israel. “I’m not a foreign agent,” she repeatedly told me, unbidden, throughout the evening. “I don’t even think these other people believe what they post about—they just do it because they get paid. They’re all Larping, like, ‘We’re Hitler Youth now that it’s cool. Oh, we’re Nazis now.’ It’s just this performative circle of content and rage bait. I have actually had strong views for years.”\nAt sunset, Loomer drove us to a seafood restaurant for dinner. As we waited for a table, she started fighting with a State Department spokesman on X. It is difficult to hold her attention. Over oysters, when my questions were met with silence as she typed on her phone, her boyfriend said, “She can’t hear you—she’s locked in.” (He and Loomer met on a plane to Belize. “I liked the abrasiveness,” he told me. Loomer occasionally shows him drafts of her posts. “She’s about to eviscerate someone, and I’m, like, Maybe leave a body part for their family?” He paused. “She doesn’t listen.”) Loomer read us a draft of a tweet thread about Elaine Chao, Mitch McConnell’s wife, attending a party at the Qatari Embassy. “This one’s ready to go,” she told me. She texted Andy Ogles, a maga congressman from Tennessee, to see if he could come on her show the next day. He called her. “You can talk about why you want to denaturalize Mamdani,” she told him, referring to the next mayor of New York City, who was born in Uganda. “Are you free?” She disappeared into her phone again, until a video by Benny Johnson popped up on her feed. The right-wing media sphere is often a sensitive subject. She talked without interruption for the rest of the meal. “I hate conservative commentary,” she said. Her peers were too performative, too pliable. She went on, “They don’t want me on the plane with Trump. The President has to be diplomatic and whatnot, but I’m exposing how our country is playing footsie with the most brutal Islamic regimes. Everything I do is in support of helping his Administration, even the things that might hurt to hear. My life is like an episode of ‘Survivor.’ I’ve been crawling through the mud by myself for years, eating berries.” (Last week, Loomer, who has been repeatedly denied access to the White House press room, got credentialled to cover the Pentagon—as did Kassam and Pool—after dozens of mainstream outlets refused to sign on to farcically strict reporting restrictions imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.)\nLoomer suggested that we head back to her house to “start breaking stories.” She said that she could lend me comfortable pants and a sweater—“Twitter clothes.” In the car on the way home, as her boyfriend tried to tell me what he liked about her documentary on the “great replacement” theory, she scrolled through loud videos on her phone, then took a call from a Politico reporter. (“That guy always wants to call me,” she said. He asked her who her “next target” was. “Sean Duffy,” she told him, the Secretary of Transportation.) Back inside, her boyfriend let the dogs out of their crates and brought tea and Diet Cokes for us. We set up with her phone, laptop, and iPad on a couch in the den, surrounded by dog fencing. The Real Disaster Channel was playing in the background, on mute, showing videos of plane crashes, until the TV eventually kicked into a screen saver of a fish tank. Loomer had entered a seemingly meditative state, tapping away frantically. “I’m pushing out this thing about Mitch McConnell’s wife,” she said a few minutes later, as if responding to a question.\nEventually, I moved to an office chair at her desk—her real one, not the one in the studio—where her boyfriend had set down my cup of tea. I glanced absentmindedly at some stacks of paperwork she had left out, pausing on a contract with a consulting firm whose name I recognized. “What are you looking at?” Loomer asked, suddenly focussed. She bustled over to clear the area, sweeping things into a drawer, handing files to her boyfriend, until only an asthma device with a mask attachment remained. “See, this is what my life is,” she said, gesturing at the couch, which was covered in a blanket for the dogs. “This is all it is. I’m going to do this until four in the morning.” She picked up the asthma mask. “Do you ever notice I’m out of breath on my show?” she asked. She put the mask over her face, paused, stared straight ahead, and inhaled the vapor. ♦","summary":"The President’s self-appointed loyalty enforcer inspires fear and vexation across Washington.

The effects were perhaps best seen in New Jersey, a state with a Hispanic population of nearly 22%, when counties with large Latino populations moved to the left following a rightward shift in 2024.\n\nIn Hudson County, which has a Hispanic population of 41%, Democrat Mikie Sherrill beat Republican Jack Ciattarelli by 50 points, compared to then-Vice President Kamala Harris' 28-point margin of victory over Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. And in Passaic County, where Latinos make up 43% of the total population, Sherril beat Ciattarelli by nearly 15 points; in the 2024 presidential election, Trump won the county by three.\n\n“For many years, I think, the Latino community and the vote of the Latino community has been taken for granted,” Passaic Mayor Hector C. Lora told ABC News. “Automatically, it would go a certain way. And that was proven wrong last year.”\n\nTrump was able to make inroads with Latino voters by centering his campaign around affordability. Maria Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of the Latino voting organization Voto Latino, called the rightward shift among Latino voters reflected in 2024 exit polling “a cry for help.”\n\n\"We are living in a populist moment, and whichever candidate can effectively communicate that they are going to help meet people's – not just basic needs, but an aspirational agenda – that is just going to move them forward. And I would say that Mikie Sherrill and Abigail [Spanberger] both did that,” Kumar told ABC News.\n\nIn Manassas Park, Virginia, a city that is nearly 40% Hispanic, the electorate swung 22 points to the left last week for Democratic Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger. Virginia state Delegate Alfonso Lopez, who is the first Latino Democrat elected to the Virginia General Assembly and the founder of the Virginia Latino Caucus, says part of the reason Democrats saw such success among Latino voters in this cycle was Trump’s failure to live up to his campaign promises.\n\n“For Latinos in Virginia, it really came down to the economy and jobs, prices, cost of living, as well as promises made by the Trump administration that turned out to be lies,” Lopez told ABC News.\n\nAnd while Trump’s handling of the economy certainly loomed over these two races, pollsters and political operatives have said the effect that the Trump administration’s large-scale immigration enforcement may have had on Latino voters - who have witnessed U.S. citizens become targets for speaking Spanish and watched families of mixed immigration status be separated - cannot be ignored.\n\n“We're witnessing people here who are documented, people who are American citizens, under incredible stress because of the militarization of ICE,” Kumar said, adding that many feel that “this is not what we signed up for.”\n\nHéctor E. Sánchez Barba, president and CEO of Latino voting organization Mi Familia Vota, told ABC News that “the terrorizing and the extremism of ICE – it's really affecting the quality of life of all Latinos in the nation.”\n\n“Latinos have been the main target of this president and of the MAGA agenda, and we’re saying enough is enough,” Sanchez Barba said.\n\nBut GOP strategist Mike Madrid, co-founder of the anti-Trump PAC the Lincoln Project, says that “Republicans on Tuesday night lost for exactly the same reasons that Democrats lost a year ago this past November, which is economic concerns.”\n\n“There is no question that the ICE raids, the deportation, the overreach by the Trump administration did have some impact, but not enough to increase turnout,” Madrid told ABC News.\n\nMadrid added that Tuesday’s Republican losses were “not an affirmation of the Democratic Party,” but rather “a rejection of the Republican Party.”\n\n“Latinos are the blue-collar working class, and that workforce is dramatically more impacted by tariffs,” he said, referencing the Trump administration’s controversial tariff policies.\n\nWith the 2026 midterms fast approaching, both Democrats and Republicans will be looking for lessons that can be learned from this cycle as both parties vie for power in Congress.\n\n\"She spent time in Passaic,” Lora said of Sherrill. “She spoke to business owners.

Additionally, the agreement does not guarantee that the government will continue to fund healthcare subsidies. \n\nHowever, the deal is expected to unlock funds for government services until January and could be tied to a larger package to fund several federal agencies. \n\nDespite this seismic shift in the shutdown stalemate, though, the deal still needs to be approved by the House before the government can officially reopen. \n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said that he will hold the ACA vote by the middle of next month, according to CNN, and said that he is “optimistic” that the deal will end the shutdown.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen from New Hampshire told the broadcaster that this was “the only deal on the table.”\n\n“Now I understand that not all of my Democratic colleagues are satisfied with this agreement, but waiting another week or another month wouldn’t deliver a better outcome,” she added.\n\nShaheen was just one of the Democrats to break with their party’s stance on the shutdown. Throughout the crisis, the Democrats have been staunch in their position that the Republicans should not be given an inch on the questions of Medicaid and the ACA. \n\nFor Senator Tim Kaine, a future vote on the future of the ACA was enough to convince him to agree to the deal. \n\nIn a statement shared on X, he said that he was guided particularly by the need to protect federal workers since Virginia is home to roughly 300,000 government employees.\n\nKaine went on to claim that the deal will “protect federal workers from baseless firings, reinstate those who have been wrongfully terminated during the shutdown, and ensure federal workers receive back pay.”\n\nSenator Dick Durbin said in a statement that “this bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown’s hurt,” as he broke with his party by agreeing to the deal. \n\n“For 40 days—the longest shutdown in U.S. history—federal workers went without paychecks,” he continued. “This includes our air traffic controllers, whose towers were already understaffed. \n\n“They continued to work 10 hour days, six days per week to keep our airspace safe, with this additional stress at a life-saving job.”\n\nHowever, by agreeing to the deal, Durbin opened up a split in his own state as Senator Tammy Duckworth, the other Illinois senator, voted against the agreement. \n\n“I simply cannot, and I will not, vote to do nothing to help protect them from Trump’s vindictive and malicious efforts in exchange for a vague promise from the least trustworthy Republican party in our nation’s history,” Duckworth wrote.\n\nDurbin has confirmed that he will not be seeking reelection in 2026, after serving in the U.S. Senate for almost three decades. \n\nJeanne Shaheen has announced that she will not seek reelection this fall, after becoming the first Democratic senator for New Hampshire since 1980. \n\n“Let’s be clear: This is a major step that was not predetermined,” she said in a statement. “I have spent years as the lead sponsor of this legislation. \n\n“There is no one in the Senate who wants to see these tax credits extended more than me. \n\n“But weeks of negotiations with Republicans have made clear that they will not address health care as part of shutdown talks.”\n\nShe added that “waiting longer will only prolong the pain Americans are feeling because of the shutdown.”\n\nSenator John Fetterman broke with his fellow Senate Democrats early by voting for a House-approved short-term funding bill. \n\n“Our party could be overplaying its hand,” he said, according to CNN. “I don’t think much anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval.”\n\nNow, Fetterman thinks that the shutdown has “more than run its course,” but acknowledged that the deal would probably get the \"minimum\" amount of votes to pass. \n\nIn a social media post, he claimed that allowing the shutdown to take place was a “failure.”\n\n“I’m sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven’t been paid in weeks,” he added.\n\nThe Senator’s home state is a key swing state which carries a staggering 19 electoral college votes, the fourth most votes after New York, California and Texas. \n\nFetterman has long been a controversial figure in his party, with representatives in Pennsylvania already gearing up to challenge him in the 2028 elections, according to CBS News. \n\nCritics have accused him of being too in line with Donald Trump, pointing to his strong support for Israel and for his absence from the “No Kings” rally in Philadelphia. \n\n\"We're looking to the leaders who will fight for us, because even today there are folks among the Democratic Party who think we should roll over and play dead,\" Indivisible PA founder Leah Greenberg said at a No King’s rally earlier this year, according to Newsweek. \"Anyone seen John Fetterman here today?\"\n\nSenator Maggie Hassan was reelected to her seat in 2022. Like Fetterman, her state plays a huge role in elections due to its large number of electoral college votes and its tendency to swing between voting for Democrats and Republicans. \n\nIn a statement, Hassan said that she had spoken with voters who were deeply affected by the shutdown, which led her to vote for the deal.\n\n“Our work to deliver relief for families now enters an important phase,” she wrote. “Congress has one month to engage in serious bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts that help people afford their health insurance.”\n\nHassan has not confirmed whether she will be seeking reelection in 2026, but is expected to become the senior senator following Shaheen’s retirement.\n\nSenator Angus King said that he voted for the bipartisan deal because it “appears” that a “solution on the ACA” is unlikely. \n\n“I think people are saying we’re not going to get what we want, although we still have a chance – because part of the deal is a vote on the ACA subsidies – but in the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt,” he added, according to CNN. \n\nKing is technically an independent, although he often caucuses with the Democrats and votes in alignment with the party. \n\nIn 2024, he was elected to a third term by residents in Maine and is expected to run for reelection in 2028.\n\nSenator Catherine Cortez Masto won a tight 2022 race, narrowly defeating Republican Adam Laxalt, and is expected to run for reelection in the future. \n\nShe told reporters on Sunday night that the government shutdown that she had witnessed “lines like I haven’t seen since the pandemic” for food banks and said that the vote could help in “stopping that pain.”\n\nCortez Masto added that she hopes to find a solution to “the impending health care crisis,” according to Politico.\n\nPreviously, she has voted to end the shutdown 15 times. \n\nCortez Masto has made headlines in the past for being a close ally of former Vice President Kamala Harris. The pair became close after they sued big banks during the 2008 Financial Crisis, alongside Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, for $20 billion. \n\nThe money won in the lawsuits was used to support their constituents who were disproportionately affected by the market crash.\n\nJacky Rosen joined her fellow Nevadan senator in voting to move the deal forward. \n\nIn her state, over 95,000 people receive credits from the Affordable Care Act, and she said that a vote on the ACA subsidies is “the concession we’ve been able to extract.”\n\n“Trump and his Republican cronies on Capitol Hill do not give a damn about hurting working people, and their conduct over the last month has been nothing short of appalling,” she added in a public statement.\n\nIt is unknown if Rosen will run again after her six years in office come to a close in 2030.","summary":"The decision by the eight Democrats has split their party’s position, with some divisions even being opened between senators from the same states","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-who-voted-to-end-shutdown-b2861979.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/05/15/Dearly_Departed_Data_40558.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/MmR0kuyI-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-10 10:09:18","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.54},{"id":377476214,"title":"Exclusive: Inside JD Vance&#039;s Strategy to Secure the MAGA Mantle","text":"After Donald Trump won the 2024 election, JD Vance and his close advisers came up with a guiding principle for his vice presidency and new, unofficial role as heir apparent to the Make America Great Again movement.\n\nThere would be no specific policy portfolio, according to three people with knowledge of the informal strategy sessions that took place during the transition, details of which have not previously been reported.\n\nKamala Harris’ tenure as vice president was viewed by Vance’s team as a cautionary tale. Joe Biden had tasked Harris with tackling the “root causes” of migration to the United States, among other goals, and the immigration assignment in particular backfired. Republicans dubbed Harris the “border czar” and Trump used the fight over immigration during the Biden years to attack Harris on the campaign trail.\n\nVance did not want to be “the Kamala Harris VP, where you have this portfolio of things. That was [seen as] pigeonholing him,” said a person familiar with Vance’s thinking.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee U.S. Sen. J.D.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)\n\nInstead, Vance entered office determined to serve as a political Swiss army knife and stalwart defender of Trump’s agenda, all while keeping the focus on a possible 2028 White House run at bay for as long as possible. \n\nNine months into Trump’s second term, the strategy appears to be working. Vance has emerged as one of the president’s fiercest supporters on television and social media; an influential voice on domestic policy inside the administration; and a trusted messenger of Trump’s America First vision abroad.\n\nWhen praising Vance to allies in private Trump is fond of referencing a quote about putting the best athletes on the field, which he attributes to the legendary football coach Vince Lombardi. “JD is an athlete,” Trump has said on several occasions since returning to power, according to two sources who’ve heard the comment firsthand.\n\n“The skill that’s most prized by the president is the ability to go out and defend and advocate for him and his agenda. Nobody has shown more dexterity in going into the toughest venues than JD,” said a Vance confidant. Whether it’s “sending him out on TV, to a debate, to a foreign country, with JD you don’t have to worry about, ‘Is it going to go well?’ He’s just good. He’s talented, and Trump trusts him.”\n\nThe president and vice president “definitely trust each other,” White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told Newsweek in an interview. “They definitely have a friendship, and have a common view of most if not everything.”\n\nVance’s ascension to the vice presidency represents the culmination of an unusual decade-long transformation from best-selling author and vocal Trump critic into the leading candidate to take over the Republican Party once the president leaves office. Now, Vance will find out if his all-in bet on Trump can elevate him to the presidency or torpedo his political career.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with 13 current and former White House advisers and other people in Vance’s inner circle, Republicans in Congress, former Trump campaign officials, GOP donors and other party operatives. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations with the vice president.\n\nRepublicans in Washington are already buzzing about a likely Vance presidential run in 2028, even though the election is still three years away. \n\n“There are a lot of us around here that are focused on JD being the next president,” Sen. Jim Banks of Indiana told Newsweek in a recent interview in his office.\n\nThere is also growing support in private among Vance allies for him to pick Secretary of State Marco Rubio as his running mate — chatter that spilled out into the open when Trump recently called a potential Vance-Rubio ticket “unstoppable.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump (C) takes a question from the press as Vice President JD Vance (L) and Secretary of State Marco Rubio (R) look on during a meeting with Argentina’s President Javier Milei at the White House in Washington, DC, on October 14, 2025.

This is the first time the country has had a 41-year-old vice president serving alongside a 79-year-old president who routinely deflects attention from his lame-duck status by signaling his interest in serving an unconstitutional third term in office.\n\nVance’s unconditional embrace of Trum...","summary":"The vice president entered office determined to serve as a political Swiss army knife and defender of President Trump’s agenda.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-jd-vance-maga-2028-strategy-trump-11016858","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2163348245.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-10 10:00:00","author":"Daniel Bush","authors":["Daniel Bush"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.354},{"id":377488208,"title":"Don’t Blame Immigrants for Mamdani’s Win","text":"Several major high-immigrant counties in the United States shifted sharply rightward from 2020 to 2024.

So large is the vacuum on the left of politics that his victory will occupy an outsized space for progressives beyond New York City. And so, before I lay too much on his head myself, some caveats. New York is a specific place. It has a specific demographic and economic profile. And Mamdani is a man of a specific background, racial, political and religious. But with that out of the way, I think the successful practice of “identity politics” during his campaign offers some universal lessons.\n\nI put identity politics in quote marks because the term now means little that is universally agreed upon. Broadly, it has come to mean something derogatory, kind of in the same way that “wokeness” has. It increasingly has negative connotations: a political appeal to race or other markers of identity that is shallow, rooted in perpetual victimhood, focused only on representation and disconnected from material reality. Seen this way, identity politics is not about universal goals, such as lifting people out of poverty and so mobilising broad coalitions of voters, but simply about visibility.\n\nBut identity politics as an organising political force has its origins in precisely the opposite idea. Coined by the Black feminist socialist organisation the Combahee River Collective in 1977, identity politics was defined as a path to a liberation that could only come about through the understanding that systems oppress many different people along the lines of their identity, and so could only be dismantled if all groups worked together. “We believe,” the collective declared, “that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity”, but that “we also often find it difficult to separate race from class from sex oppression because in our lives they are most often experienced simultaneously.”\n\nThat “simultaneous experience” is what I am talking about here. Mamdani tapped into that. He rooted his campaign solidly in the experience of being a New Yorker, and how the city needed to be made more affordable, then expanded that to include all the ways in which different groups live that experience. He released campaigning videos in Urdu, Hindi, Spanish and Arabic, and consistently made all of them about a retail economic message: rent freezes, free buses, universal childcare, making New York a place to raise your children and build small businesses. Then he threw in a bespoke little twist. In his Arabic message he quipped that something more controversial than his political message is his belief that the knafeh, an Arab dessert, is better on Steinway Street in Queens than it is in New Jersey. Talk about hitting a sweet spot.\n\nIncluding the languages of underrepresented identities is an exercise in enfranchisement. He quoted the Arabic phrase ana minkum wa alaikum – “I am of you and for you” – in his victory speech, and named those “forgotten by the politics of our city”, the “Yemeni bodega owners and Mexican abuelas. Senegalese taxi drivers and Uzbek nurses. Trinidadian line cooks and Ethiopian aunties”.\n\nHe combined that with being in the places that working-class people, many of whom are people of colour, occupy. Visiting those on the taxi ranks and working the late-night shifts, he forged a powerful metaphor of a city that is kept going by those who labour in the dark. And he drew that all together by bringing his own identity, as he himself put it, “into the light”. A Muslim who grew up in the shadows of Islamophobia, he suffered an outrageously racist campaign against him, but resisted the pressure to play down his identity in order to fit in, to succeed. “No longer will I live in the shadows,” he said.\n\nThose shadows are vast and, in this moment, encompass not only Mamdani, but huge swathes of people across all identities living under a regime of fear, economic struggle, deportations, suffocation of freedom of speech and an entire political establishment that has made bullying and cruelty its modus operandi. The coalition that Mamdani built, across all ethnicities, became about closing the yawning gap between people and power. In a revealing contrast to establishment Democrat politicians, when Mamdani was heckled last week over his position on Gaza, he did not say, as Kamala Harris did when she was heckled, “I’m speaking”. Mamdani smiled and said: “I want you to be able to afford this city too, my brother.”\n\nBut there is something else about Mamdani’s approach that reveals how identity done right is generative. His is a politics that is forged and defined by being on the margins, but not as a single individual who wants to escape alone. Those who see their identity as a way to become part of an establishment that can then hold them up as exemplars of inclusive politics will always have limited appeal, and therefore limited success as changemakers. To see those margins, racial, economic and political, as spaces in which a majority can be mobilised, as spaces where people don’t want to hear about victimhood but justice, is to create coalitions and escape together. It is to reveal to the voting public that the problem is not particular racisms or prejudices, but an entire system that excludes all those who don’t have capital in all its forms.\n\nThat message resonates with the college-educated white parents who are struggling with childcare costs, as well as the immigrant taxi driver struggling to pay rent. But above all, ironically, Mamdani exemplified the virtues of the American “melting pot”, a nation of immigrants at the sharp end of capitalism who together increasingly recognise all the ways in which the country is failing to live up to its ideals. All the ways in which Mamdani has been fought, not only by the right but by his own party, prove that American liberal politics has long lost its way in its service to capital and its preening approach to identity. What works in New York doesn’t necessarily map perfectly on to the rest of the US and beyond, but Mamdani’s win is a reminder that the people, whatever their identities, all want one thing – leaders who are of them, and for them.\n\n Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist","summary":"New York’s newly elected mayor rooted his campaign in the personal while, ironically, exemplifying the tradition of the American ‘melting pot’\n\nIt is inevitable that too much will be laid on Zohran Mamdani’s head.

He has questioned the editing of a Panorama programme on Donald Trump – which elides separate quotes to make it look like Trump said he would march on the Capitol and “fight like hell” with his supporters.\n\nPrescott also has concerns about what he regards as an anti-Israel bias within the corporation, as well as its coverage of certain transgender issues.\n\nTwo of Prescott’s complaints seem particularly questionable. The first is that the Panorama editing was “completely misleading”. Prescott argues that the fact that Trump did not explicitly exhort supporters to fight at the Capitol was one of the reasons he wasn’t prosecuted. \n\nBut the Congressional committee that examined the day’s events in detail recommended criminal charges on the basis that Trump did indeed incite the attack on Congress – a verdict backed by the only federal district judge to consider the case. The Senate voted by 57 to 43 to impeach the former president, with seven Republicans backing the motion. So, while the way the film was edited was wrong, it’s not clear it was “misleading” in the way that Prescott argues.\n\nSecondly, Prescott seems to have believed that an “equally aggressive” look at Kamala Harris should have been commissioned. He found it “shocking and alarming” that the aberrant behaviour of Trump should be singled out for especial scrutiny. But that suggests a bizarre notion of editorial equivalence. The deputy head of news, Jonathan Munro, was surely right to have dismissed Prescott’s idea of “due impartiality”.\n\nSimilarly, with criticism of the BBC over its coverage of Israel, there have been plausible and detailed critiques that suggest that the BBC is, contrary to Prescott’s own belief, actually biased in favour of Israel. But such analyses tend to sink without trace.

Dubbed “long-termism” by followers, those causes include climate change, preventing pandemics — and a near-obsession with heavily regulating artificial intelligence.\n\n“They believe that only a handful of people can control access – that AI, if not in their hands, will be leveraged to destroy the world,” said Nathan Leamer, a former FCC policy adviser and CEO of Fixed Gear Strategies. \n\n“Truly, they have a fully ‘doomer’ apocalypse worldview,” Learner added. “Effective altruism is a governing philosophy that is entirely built on godless progressive ideas.”\n\nCritics note that EA’s crusade to save humanity hasn’t put a crimp on the extravagant lifestyles of its adherents — among them Sam Bankman-Fried. The disgraced FTX kingpin known as “SBF” built a luxury Bahamas beach condo with stolen customer funds, offering staff free massages while he rubbed elbows with celebrities. Elsewhere, EA leaders have drawn flak over their taste for private jets and medieval English manors.\n\nAnthropic — the firm behind the Claude chatbot — is led by CEO Dario Amodei, a 42-year-old, Princeton-trained physicist who once called Trump a “feudal warlord” in a now-deleted social media post and who backed Kamala Harris to be president in 2024.\n\nThe San Francisco company has relied heavily on cash from left-wing EA leaders and Democratic megadonors like SBF since its founding – a fact that hasn’t escaped the notice of key figures in Trumpworld, sources close to the situation told The Post.\n\nThe firm’s lefty ties are “certainly on the radar” of key decision makers and have hampered Anthropic’s ability to gain traction with the administration — whether it’s pushing AI policies or vying to win big federal contracts, a source close to the White House said.\n\n“The government is not going to want to contract with companies that do not have the nation’s best interests at heart,” the source added.\n\nThe White House press office didn’t return a request for comment.\n\nWhile Amodei has seldom been spotted alongside other tech executives at White House events, he has recently stepped up efforts to build relations with Trump. The Anthropic boss jetted off to Tokyo in late October for a dinner with President Trump and other business leaders, another source close to the situation said.\n\nAnthropic officials have also been briefing White House officials in recent weeks about their plans to roll out a privately funded compute and energy strategy to support AI development, the source added.\n\nMeanwhile, an Anthropic spokesperson pushed back on the notion that the firm has a rift with the White House, asserting that the company is aligned with the Trump administration’s views on a number of policies. \n\nAmodei has said on several occasions that he doesn’t identify as part of the EA community, the spokesperson added.\n\n“As Dario said in his statement, Anthropic is committed to constructive engagement on matters of public policy,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “We fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development.” \n\nIn September, Semafor reported that Anthropic irked White House officials by barring federal contractors from using its tools for some law enforcement purposes, raising concerns that Anthropic could be “selectively enforcing its policies” over politics. \n\nAnthropic pushed back, noting that multiple federal agencies were currently using its models without issue. The firm’s policies bar the use of its AI tools for direct domestic surveillance and data collection, which is in line with rivals like OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft.\n\n“Anthropic is trying to smuggle ideology into federal rule-making under the banner of ‘safety’ and that is exactly what makes Trumpworld view them as hostile,” a former Trump administration official said. “It feels less like corporate engagement and more like political warfare.”\n\nSBF briefly became Anthropic’s biggest investor in April 2022 when he bought a $500 million stake using FTX customer funds. Prosecutors later blasted the now-jailed crypto fraudster for trying to float Effective Altruism as a justification for his misdeeds.\n\nAnthropic’s earliest backers included billionaire Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz, who enjoyed influence with the Biden White House while bankrolling Democratic causes and various AI safety initiatives. Moskovitz has since transferred his stake in Anthropic into a nonprofit vehicle to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interests.\n\n“The EAs and Anthropic were killing it during the Biden years. Any official that Biden brought in as an adviser, either official or unofficial, was from this effective altruist worldview,” said Leamer. “They were living large for the four years from 2021 to 2024, and it’s been a total game change for them.”\n\nMoskovitz also launched Open Philanthropy, an EA-focused charity that in 2023 alone poured $15 million into Rand Corporation. The think tank reportedly played a key role in crafting President Biden’s executive order imposing guardrails on AI – which was revoked by Trump on his first day in office.\n\n“We believe that technology and scientific progress have drastically improved human well-being, which is why so much of our work focuses on these areas,” an Open Philanthropy spokesperson said. “AI has enormous potential to accelerate science, fuel economic growth, and expand human knowledge, but it also poses some unprecedented risks — a view shared by leaders across the political spectrum.”\n\n“We support thoughtful nonpartisan work to help manage those risks and realize the huge potential upsides of AI,” the spokesperson added.\n\nDario Amodei’s sister, Daniela, is married to Holden Karnofsky, who is widely credited as a leader of the EA movement. He served as CEO of Open Philanthropy before stepping down to take a role at Anthropic last year.\n\nDaniela Amodei tried to distance herself from the EA movement as recently as March, when she told Wired that she was “not an expert on effective altruism” and called it a “bit of an outdated term.”\n\nMeanwhile, Dario Amodei’s frequent warnings about potential AI doom, such as his claim of a 25% chance that things go “really, really badly” for humanity, have put Anthropic at odds with Trump officials who argue that an overemphasis on AI safety risks stifling innovation.\n\nLast month, Amodei – once blasted by White House AI czar David Sacks as an AI “doomer” and “committed leftist” – published a blog post that slammed “a recent uptick in inaccurate claims” about Anthropic’s politics, insisting the company was aligned with the Trump administration on “key areas of AI policy.”\n\nAmodei said in his blog post that Anthropic has “publicly praised President Trump’s AI Action Plan” and recently secured a $200 million contract with the US War Department.\n\n“Our longstanding position is that managing the societal impacts of AI should be a matter of policy over politics,” Amodei wrote.\n\nOutside of the EA movement, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, a deep-pocketed Democrat, sits on Anthropic’s board of directors. Other big backers include LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, a major antagonist to the GOP. \n\nSacks ripped Anthropic’s association with Hoffman while alleging on Oct. 14 that Anthropic wanted to “backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California.”\n\nAs The Post reported, Anthropic’s investors also include the Ford Foundation, a left-wing group recently blasted by Vice President JD Vance for being part of what he called an “NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence” following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe Ford Foundation acquired the minor stake during FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings.","summary":"Anthropic’s recent scramble to convince Trump administration it isn’t “woke” could be an impossible task – thanks in large part to the artificial intelligence firm’s close ties to the cult-like “Effective Altruism” movement, sources told The Post.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/09/business/ai-giant-anthropics-ties-to-cult-like-effective-altruism-democrat-megadonors-on-trump-admins-radar/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/114983163.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LcpCCRfe-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-09 21:35:37","author":"Thomas Barrabi","authors":["Thomas Barrabi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.195},{"id":377357684,"title":"ELDER: Governor Gavin Newsom: I ‘hate’ politicians who lie (except Biden)","text":"— Accused ex-staffer Tara Reade of lying when she claimed that he sexually assaulted her.

The departures come as the British public broadcaster has faced criticism for its editing of President Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, speech before the Capitol riot and insurrection. The BBC investigative series “Panorama,” in a broadcast a week ahead of the U.S. presidential election last year, featured an edited video of Trump's speech. Critics said that the way the speech was edited was misleading in that it cut out a section in which Trump said that he expected his supporters would demonstrate peacefully. \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,\" Trump said in the speech, during which he also urged his supporters to \"fight like hell.\" In a statement, Turness acknowledged the controversy around the “Panorama” broadcast, noting, “In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down. While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong.” In a separate news release, Davie said, “In these increasingly polarized times, the BBC is of unique value and speaks to the very best of us. It helps make the UK a special place; overwhelmingly kind, tolerant and curious. Like all public organizations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. \"While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility.” Trump posted a link to a Daily Telegraph story about the speech-editing on his Truth Social network, thanking the newspaper “for exposing these Corrupt 'Journalists.' These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.” He called that \"a terrible thing for Democracy!\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reacted on X, posting a screen grab of an article headlined “Trump goes to war with ‘fake news’ BBC” beside another about Davie's resignation, with the words “shot” and “chaser.” Trump was impeached and criminally indicted over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and insurrection. The felony charges were dropped after he won the 2024 election, as U.S. Justice Department policy holds that a sitting president may not be criminally prosecuted. Pressure on the broadcaster’s top executives has been growing since the Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier complied by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. As well as the Trump edit, it criticized the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The 103-year-old BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters — and criticism from its commercial rivals — because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of $230 paid by all households with a television. The BBC airs vast reams of entertainment and sports programming across multiple television and radio stations and online platforms — but it's the BBC's news output that is most often under scrutiny. The broadcaster is bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial in its output, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed. It's frequently a political football, with conservatives seeing a leftist slant in its news output and some liberals accusing it of having a conservative bias. It has also been criticized from all angles over its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In February, the BBC removed a documentary about Gaza from its streaming service after it emerged that the child narrator was the son of an official in the Hamas-led government. The BBC shakeup comes as Trump has been extremely aggressive in pursuing lawsuits against U.S. media companies. Paramount Global forked over $16 million this summer after Trump complained about the editing of a Kamala Harris interview on CBS' \"60 minutes.\" Last year, ABC News paid $16 million to settle Trump's defamation lawsuit against anchor George Stephanopoulos.

While Democrats initially decried Mr. Trump's efforts as an attempt to create an unfair advantage for Republicans, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional districts to gain up to five seats for Democrats. The measure, known as Prop 50, passed Tuesday with more than 60% of the vote, and an energized Newsom held a rally in Houston on Saturday, where he said Texas had \"woke us up.\" Eight of Maryland's nine House seats are already occupied by Democrats, a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won by more than 28 points in 2024. A redistricting effort would target the single Republican-held seat in the eastern part of the state. Maryland's commission is chaired by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, a close ally of Moore's, and is comprised of Senate President Bill Ferguson, Maryland House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, former Attorney General Brian Frosh and Cumberland Mayor Raymond Morriss. Maryland law dictates congressional maps are drawn by the state Assembly, where Democrats have a supermajority. Moore would have to call a special session of the Assembly to move forward with the effort. But Ferguson, a Democrat, has opposed the redistricting effort, writing in a letter last month that \"mid-cycle redistricting for Maryland presents a reality where the legal risks are too high, the timeline for action is dangerous, the downside risk to Democrats is catastrophic, and the certainty of our existing map would be undermined.\"Ferguson said last week the Democrats' election victories \"shows we don't need to rig the system to win.\"But Moore insisted Sunday that \"fighting for democracy is never risky.\" He noted that he and Ferguson agree that there is a \"crisis that Donald Trump has put us in.\"\"Where we differ is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires,\" Moore said. \"And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.\"","summary":"Maryland Gov.

With these resignations, it has given in | Jane Martinson","text":"The resignation of the BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, over accusations of bias comes as a shock and leaves a gulf at the top of the corporation when it needs leadership most. Davie stressed that the decision was his alone – neither the board, nor even many of those who led the coordinated attack among rightwing press and politicians expected it.\n\nNow the resignations of both Davie and the CEO of BBC News, Deborah Turness, have shown that baying for blood gets results.\n\nThe biggest shock is that this saga began just a week ago with the leak of a 19-page “devastating memo” from Michael Prescott, a former political journalist who spent three years as an external adviser to the broadcaster, published in the Telegraph. The dossier alleges BBC Panorama doctored a speech by Trump, making him appear to support the January 6 rioters, that its Arabic coverage privileged pro-Hamas views, and that a group of LGBTQ employees had excessive influence on coverage of sex and gender. The Telegraph wrote that the BBC’s very silence “proves there is a serious problem”. Meanwhile, the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s “blast” at Nick Robinson, the only BBC staffer to publicly fight back against the accusations, leads the Mail on Sunday, and Donald Trump’s press secretary has called the BBC “100% fake news”\n\nLeave to one side for now the direct allegations about specific failures of BBC coverage, and the BBC’s own baffling inability or unwillingness to defend itself over the past week. But the row obscures the context that explains what is, at the heart of the matter, a political campaign against the BBC that could act as a textbook example of how to confuse and undermine the kind of journalism that is, at the very least, aiming for impartiality in a sea of spin and distortion.\n\nPrescott stresses he has never been a member of a political party and that his views “do not come with any political agenda” in the introduction to his 8,000-word note. Yet each criticism of BBC coverage comes from the anti-progressive culture-war playbook.\n\nFor example, he is “shocked” that after an hour-long Panorama documentary dealing with Trump and the January 6 insurgency, there was no “similar, balancing” programme about the Democrat presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. As someone who has spent years dealing with the issue of impartiality told me, this is an entirely wrongheaded and now discredited view of impartiality, the sort of view that led to airtime being given to climate denial.\n\nPrescott also accuses the BBC of amplifying “issues of racism”. Yet his own argument and suggested source material undermines his own claims of neutrality. He cites a 2022 report by History Reclaimed, also published in the Telegraph, which highlights four BBC programmes with “an overly simplistic and distorted narrative about British colonial racism, slave-trading and its legacy”. While some of its members are senior Oxbridge academics, History Reclaimed’s website makes clear that the group was formed to counter “culture war” narratives in the media that suggest British history is shameful.\n\nPrescott remains “mystified” that his requests for BBC producers and editors to meet the report’s authors were ignored. Yet in its own review at the time, the BBC concluded that History Reclaimed “cherrypicking a handful of examples or highlighting genuine mistakes in thousands of hours of output on TV and radio does not constitute analysis and is not a true representation of BBC content”.\n\nSadly, there has been no corresponding BBC response to the rehashed criticism in Prescott’s own extensive review of past complaints.\n\nNone of this is to say that the BBC has not made mistakes. At the very least, the Panorama documentary appears to have included a bad and misleading edit of an hour-long Trump speech, which is unacceptable even if that speech was subsequently found to have encouraged insurrection. The BBC is expected to apologise on Monday over the Trump edit. That should have been enough.\n\nPrescott’s 10 years as chief political correspondent and then political editor of the Sunday Times must have also helped his laser focus on two issues in particular that have divided even the BBC’s biggest supporters. Its reporting in Gaza, specifically that of the BBC Arabic service – given greater prominence recently not just because of the war but because of cuts in BBC News – has wounded many in the Jewish community, while the BBC’s handling of trans rights has divided even its own staff.\n\nYet pity the BBC that, while tiptoeing not always gracefully through these editorial minefields with thousands of hours of content, it has also to deal with enemies from within.\n\nConcerns about an apparent conflict of interest were raised when Johnson appointed Prescott to advise Ofcom over its new chair four years ago. Prescott, whose PR firm Hanover was involved in advising media companies such as Sky, has also been described as a friend of Robbie Gibb, a former Conservative government head of communications who joined the BBC board after helping to launch the rightwing news channel GB News. However, Prescott was allowed to continue in that role, and a government spokesperson said on Prescott’s behalf that the appointment was “fair and open and there are no conflicts of interest”. He was later appointed external adviser to the BBC standards board.\n\nGibb himself is understood to have written a long and critical note about BBC coverage to the board in early September, a few weeks before Prescott. BBC sources tell me that the chair, Samir Shah, immediately ordered Peter Johnston, the director of editorial complaints and reviews, to work on a response and a briefing was discussed at the board on 16 October.\n\nSo why has the BBC so far said nothing, apart from letting it be known that Shah is likely to apologise for the Trump edit when called to respond to the culture, media and sport committee tomorrow?\n\nGiven the sheer volume of the content it airs and criticism it receives, the BBC can sometimes be forgiven for not wanting to stir passions further. But by spending days insisting that it did not comment on “leaked documents”, the corporation has simply looked weak and cowardly, just when it needs to be robust and brave. October Films, the independent production company that made the Trump Panorama, is said to be working on a film about Nigel Farage.\n\nWith many of the criticisms already looked at and addressed internally, should it really take so long to come out with a response? These are difficult times for the BBC. About to enter into negotiations to renew its charter after more than a decade of licence-fee cuts, it is also caught in political and economic headwinds. Johnson’s threat to cancel his licence fee comes after 300,000 more households did so over the past year.\n\nTrump’s threat of a lawsuit against the BBC follows his successful cowing of the US media, with a succession of commercial broadcasters agreeing to pay damages on the flimsiest of charges. The BBC must be independent of government and political interference. But to do that, it needs the trust of everyone who pays for its services.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Davie pleads for a better future after 20 years at an organisation he loves. “We should champion [the BBC],” he writes. “Not weaponise it.” It feels as if this plea is already too late.\n\n Jane Martinson is professor of financial journalism at City St George’s and a member of the board of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian Media Group.

Gavin Newsom portrayed himself and members of his party’s leadership in Congress as heralding a new era for Democrats on Sunday, while declaring that the past was behind them.\n\nIn doing so, he took a clear shot at the buttoned-up “concern” and failure to meet the urgency of the moment that seemed to define his party’s leaders through the Biden era, which much of the American left now looks upon with frustration as it plans for 2026 and 2028.\n\nNewsom gave an extended interview to CNN’s Jake Tapper, which aired Sunday on State of the Union. It’s the governor’s third domination of Washington’s Sunday news cycle in a row, as clear a sign as any that the two-term Californian plans to pursue national ambitions after his term ends in 2026. During it, he once again stated that he’d make considerations about running for president in 2027, once the midterm election cycle was over.\n\nBut he was clear on one point regarding his party’s future: The California redistricting push, he said, exemplified the new “fight fire with fire” attitude that Democrats would carry into the next elections.\n\n“I think Donald Trump did not expect what Californians did. He thought we would just try to win an argument by writing an op-ed. Maybe express disdain and concern,” Newsom said, calling those a representation of “the Democratic Party of old”.\n\nHe added that Tuesday’s election victories, including in California where a ballot measure to grant state officials the authority to redraw congressional maps ahead of the midterms, were signs that voters were clearly on their side.\n\n“What happened on Tuesday represents a new moment of clarity, conviction, purpose, energy on our toes, not on our heels, a resurgent Democratic Party,” he said. “That kind of momentum and direction is, I think, really going to enliven people in the next year.”\n\nThe governor’s jab at the former president was indirect, but not subtle. The former members of the Biden White House and their associated allies throughout the Democratic Party continue to face questions not about the party’s future, but its past: Namely, regarding why they didn’t raise concerns about the toll the president’s age and diminished capacities were taking not just on Biden himself, as he ran for re-election, but the party as a whole. Before the president dropped out of the race in the summer of 2024, Democrats like Tommy Vietor (formerly of the Obama White House, now a Pod Save America host) were reporting internal polling that indicated their party was on track for a nationwide bloodbath that would purge Democrats from government up and down the ballot.\n\nBut they also face questions about Biden’s actual time in the White House off the campaign trail, too; many remain furious that the Department of Justice, under Biden, waited until 2022 to take any serious action aimed at holding Donald Trump and his cronies accountable for the January 6 attack and the efforts to overturn the 2024 election. That lack of urgency, many Democrats argue, persists today as congressional leaders like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have faced criticisms from their base over whether they are presenting an adequate opposition front against the president’s right-wing agenda.\n\nOn Tuesday, when Democrats swept the GOP in a number of highly-watched statewide elections, a feeling of anger on the left was palpable. Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, in New Jersey, used language very similar to Newsom’s in interviews after her victory, telling CBS’s Margaret Brennan about her plan to address cost of living issues: \"I'm not writing a strongly worded letter. I'm not doing a 10-year plan. I'm on Day 1 declaring a state of emergency.”\n\nNewsom, however, credited the two Democratic leaders in his interview with Tapper for capitalizing on the anger felt by Democrats and independents alike, many of the latter of which broke for Trump over Kamala Harris in 2024 amid the Democratic collapse. He pointed to their strategy in dealing with Republicans under the ongoing federal government shutdown as reason why.\n\n\"I give Jeffries and Schumer tremendous credit,” said Newsom. “They've galvanized people of all political stripes — rural, urban, suburban — on the issue that defines so many problems in so many ways, and that's healthcare, and the anxiety people are about to feel with 100% to 388% increase in premiums.\"\n\nUnmentioned by the governor was Schumer’s public opposition to refusing Democratic votes for legislation to prevent a shutdown in March, when Democrats pressed him to use leverage against the White House to halt the DOGE-led slashing and burning of federal agencies including USAID.\n\nThe governor went on to identify Trump as the main obstacle preventing the re-opening of the government, arguing that the president going back on his position that the White House should lead negotiations with Congress (which Trump expressed publicly in a 2011 tweet) to avert or end a shutdown was evidence that Trump simply didn’t care enough to work to end this one.\n\n“He went golfing that weekend before the shutdown...He had no interest or energy into avoiding this government shutdown. He has no interest or energy to end it today; he’s the president of the United States!” exclaimed the governor. “You have a responsibility to convene, to bring people together...full stop.”\n\nTrump has spent this latest weekend on Truth Social complaining about the Democrats’ demands for their votes. Schumer, alongside some Senate Democrats, is floating a one-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies (which are necessary to prevent huge premium spikes for millions of Americans) as his party’s demand for enough votes to end a shutdown; Republicans continue to refuse, publicly, to negotiate and the various involved lawmakers haven’t been to the White House a single time to discuss the matter with the president or his team.\n\nAs the shutdown approaches the end of its 40th day, the president is now raising the issue, once again, of scrapping the Affordable Care Act altogether — this time with the added enticement of suggesting that the money the federal government supposedly saved would go right back into Americans’ pockets. This almost certainly won’t happen; during Trump’s first term Republicans tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it, only to discover that the party had no unified vision of what that replacement should be. The vote failed in a major defeat that defined Trump’s first year as president in 2017.\n\nWith the president now openly spitballing on social media on the topic once again, Republicans are being forced to confront a reality that some in their own party, like the rebel GOP congresswoman of Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, have pointed out: that there still is no health care plan or Obamacare alternative with the endorsement of Republican leadership or a majority of their caucuses in Washington.\n\n“We don’t have a formal [health care] proposal,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent admitted Sunday on ABC’s This Week.\n\nHe added: “The president's posting about it, but we have got to get the government reopened before we do this.”","summary":"‘He thought we would just try to win an argument by writing an op-ed,’ Newsom says of Trump as states war over redrawing midterm maps","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/newsom-biden-old-democrats-2028-b2861785.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/09/19/37/newsom_cnn_1125.jpg?crop=426,284,x0,y0&trim=0,77,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HK3HW82O-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-09 19:21:54","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":377310850,"title":"Anthony Kim blames \"climate anxiety\" for his 'shitty' chipping and putting in recent golf events","text":"Anthony Kim hasn't been in his top form in recent weeks, and the golfer recently pointed out why.

Those most vulnerable to sexual harassment, assault and abuse are, unsurprisingly, those who have less power or are treated with less respect: undocumented migrants; women in precarious employment; women with disabilities; LGBTQ women; young women and girls.\n\nParadoxically, that helps to explain why the assault of Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, has drawn such outrage domestically and internationally. A drunken man tried to kiss her neck and grabbed her chest as she spoke to citizens in the capital’s streets. It is the proof, captured on camera, that no woman is safe. You can be the most powerful person in the land and a man will still feel entitled to grope you, in front of the world, because you are a woman. When you object, some will complain that you are taking it too seriously, or that it is all made up. As Ms Sheinbaum herself remarked: “If they do this to the president, then what will happen to all the young women in our country?”\n\nOne in five girls and women in Mexico said they had experienced sexual violence in the community (as distinct from home, schools and workplaces) in the previous year, according to official figures from 2021. Ten women are killed each day. Ms Sheinbaum, like others, has noted the country’s machista reputation previously. But the problem does not end there. In the US and the UK, surveys suggest four out of five women (and two out of five men) have experienced sexual harassment and assault. When those at the top are targeted, it sends a message to all women, and often deliberately so. Whatever their accomplishments – Ms Sheinbaum is also an environmental scientist who contributed to the reports of the Nobel peace prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – they can be reduced to their bodies.\n\nJulia Gillard, Australia’s only female prime minister, was described as “deliberately barren”. Kamala Harris has long faced explicitly sexual rhetorical attacks. When the then prime minister Theresa May met Nicola Sturgeon in 2017, the front page of the Daily Mail asked of the two national leaders: “Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!” Politicians in general face an increasingly angry and violent political culture – in Mexico, many are killed each year – but women also face growing and more open sexism. The Reykjavik Index for Leadership, which measures perceptions in the G7 and Iceland, found last year that in the US, less than half of respondents felt “very comfortable” with the idea of a female political leader.\n\nMs Sheinbaum is to be commended for pressing for charges and has rightly called for sexual harassment to be criminalised nationwide; many Mexican states have yet to do so. Yet, as mayor of Mexico City, when police cracked down on feminists demonstrating against gender-based violence, she referred to the protests as “provocations”. Women’s services have faced cuts under her administration. That does not lessen the importance of her stand this week. But it demonstrates that female leadership does not inevitably benefit women at the bottom, whatever they have in common with those at the top. Expanded social security programmes, initiated under Ms Sheinbaum’s predecessor, are already benefiting single mothers and others. But the president should seize this opportunity to embrace Mexico’s energetic grassroots feminist movement wholeheartedly, and work with it to tackle violence and misogyny, in the interests of all women.","summary":"A shocking incident should become an opportunity to address broader problems of misogyny \n\nWhat does the experience of women at the top tell us about the rest?

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on Sunday dismissed President Donald Trump's call this weekend for senators to redirect Affordable Care Act funds away from insurance companies and instead be sent \"directly to the people,\" telling ABC \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos that the proposal would undermine the ACA's protections for preexisting conditions. \n\n\"We have no idea what the president means by that, except it sounds like what he means is the same old, tired proposal of repealing the Affordable Care Act, giving people a benefit in the form of a health savings account, but allowing insurance companies once again to cancel policies and refuse to write policies for people who have preexisting health conditions,\" Schiff said. \n\nOn Saturday, Trump claimed on social media that Americans could purchase their own, \"much better healthcare,\" and have money \"left over\" if funds weren't allocated to \"money sucking Insurance Companies\" through the ACA.\n\n \"So the same insurance companies he's railing against in those tweets, he is saying 'I'm going to give you more power to cancel people's policies and not cover them if they have a pre-existing condition,' -- that was one of the main problems the ACA helped address,\" Schiff said. \n\nThe California Democrat said Trump's new proposal reveals the absence of a real health care plan from Republicans. He referenced a moment during Trump's general election debate against Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in September 2024, when he was asked if he had a replacement plan for the ACA and said he had the \"concepts of a plan.\"\n\n\"So, no, I think what the president is revealing, once again, you know, more than eight years after he came down that golden escalator, they still don't have a health care plan. They're still back to what Trump once called 'the concept of a plan,'\" Schiff said. \n\n\"In the middle of a shutdown, when people are really hurting, we need more than concepts of a plan,\" Schiff said. \"Let's just extend the ACA for a year, reopen the government, and then we can negotiate a more permanent fix to this crisis,\" he concluded. \n\nSchiff suggested on Sunday that Republicans would \"cheat\" on any agreement Democrats ultimately reach with them in order to end the shutdown. \n\nFollowing the Democratic proposal made on Friday by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that asks for a one-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies in order to reopen the government -- an offer that Republicans have called a non-starter, maintaining that any health care negotiations would need to still come after the government opens back up, Schiff said that any agreement Democrats eventually reach to end the stalemate would require \"really solid guarantees\" in legislation that wouldn't be able to be defaulted on.\n\n\"We have the president telling us now, Republicans telling us now: they're not going to honor any agreement we reach with them. They're telling us 'We'll put money in whatever, money we agree on for a continued resolution to fund the government. But we're telling you in advance, we are going to rescind the funding you want,'\" Schiff said. \n\n\"They're telling us they're going to cheat on an agreement, and we need in whatever agreement we reach, to have some really solid guarantees in that legislation that they simply can't go and renege after it's done,\" he added, noting that there have been \"some talks\" in the Senate between members of both parties on a possible compromise. \n\nOn the 40th day of the shutdown, Schiff blasted Trump for his refusal to negotiate with Democrats in order to end the standoff, claiming too that Republicans are unable to make any deals without his approval.\n\nTrump said as recently as Sunday morning on his social media platform that he \"stands ready\" to work with both parties to solve the issue of health care \"once the government is open.\" \n\n\"[An end to the shutdown is] not going to happen until the president gets off the golf course, gets out of his ballroom planning, and sits down and negotiates,\" Schiff said. \"Otherwise, I think this is going to go on because Senate Republicans are going to do anything without the president's agreement and approval, and House Republicans are just content to stay away while people suffer.\" \n\nSchiff, who has been a proponent in the past of ending the Senate filibuster, said he'd still be \"happy\" for the rule to be eliminated -- but questioned the motives for Trump, and some other Republicans, pushing to see it go. \n\n\"I have continued to oppose the filibuster, and would be happy to do away with the filibuster, but the question is…for what reason?\" Schiff said. \n\nSchiff didn't say outright whether he'd now vote to oppose the filibuster.\n\n\"I would do away with it so that we can expand and protect people's freedoms and their rights. The Republicans and the president right now are talking about doing away with a filibuster so they can raise people's health care costs. That is the wrong reason to do away with a filibuster. And ultimately, what's going to protect American people?\"","summary":"Schiff suggests Republicans would \"cheat\" on any agreement Democrats ultimately reach with them in order to end the government shutdown.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/schiff-republicans-cheat-shutdown-compromise/story?id=127350538","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8452853e-c439-4ce6-bcef-248a22762423/TW-SCHIFF-20251109-ABC-JH_1762698531479_hpMain_16x9.jpeg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-09 17:08:00","author":"Isabella Murray","authors":["Isabella Murray"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.485},{"id":377397390,"title":"They flew to New York to help Mamdani – now they want to bring the hope to LA","text":"While the excitement for mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has radiated through New York, his win has also energized young activists across the country – particularly some in Los Angeles, who flew to the east coast to canvass for Mamdani and now want to bring their experiences westward.\n\nStanding near the poll site at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Neda Davarpanah – a screenwriter and actor based in Los Angeles – was inspired by Mamdani’s campaign for mayor so she flew out to New York in late October to canvass on the Upper East Side.\n\nDavarpanah had walked alongside the picket lines in Hollywood in 2023 as a newly minted Writers Guild of America member. Despite initial momentum, she felt the energy from the frontlines of the strikes had dissipated in the last year. That energy reignited when Mamdani entered the picture.\n\n“We felt so motivated and energized to help people in a city we don’t even live in because of the broader impact on the country,” she said.\n\nMany of the people interviewed are part of the 4,000 young members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Los Angeles chapter who felt inspired by Mamdani’s campaign and its national implications. Looking ahead, they want to bring the hope and lessons from field organizing back to Los Angeles.\n\nNew York and Los Angeles have very different geographies and spreads of power. In Los Angeles, city council members’ elections tend to have more weight compared to a mayoral race. And given the DSA-LA chapter has endorsed five candidates so far in the city council and local school board elections, there are plenty of volunteer efforts for these hopefuls to work on in the coming year.\n\nLeslie Chang, who serves as the East San Gabriel Valley coordinator for Democratic Socialists of America, flew out during the primaries to canvass for Mamdani. She volunteered to canvass in Chinatown, where she spoke the language, and the Red Hook public housing projects.\n\n“These were tough conversations,” Chang said, noting residents felt left out in the city’s development. “They would say: look at the condition of this place that I live in. We are still waiting for repairs from the hurricane. Why should I give a shit who is running for office if my life hasn’t gotten better?”\n\nDuring her volunteer field training, Chang met two New York City council members who were vouching for Mamdani’s mayoral campaign. They told Chang to give out their phone numbers to start conversations with constituents.\n\n“I thought that was really powerful, because in almost all of the canvases that I do here [in Los Angeles], there isn’t that level of engagement,” she said. After canvassing, there was even a social event for volunteers to get to know one another and discuss what strategies worked best.\n\nPaul Zappia, an animator and illustrator who also serves in DSA-LA leadership, first met the mayor-elect in 2023 at the DSA national conference in Chicago, where Mamdani served as a keynote speaker. He flew out in late October to canvass with friends in Bushwick. At the beginning of his shift, the field lead asked why each volunteer had come out.\n\n“I shared with everybody that I was here from Los Angeles because the victory of Zohran Mamdani is bigger than New York City,” said Zappia, who attributes his involvement in politics to the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign.\n\nEven walking to lunch a few blocks away, he encountered another canvassing group. “It’s just a bunch of people who are there on their free time and want to spend a couple hours on their Saturday together with other people that also care about their fellow working class people. And it was just such a blast,” he said.\n\nThe geography and public transportation layout of New York’s five boroughs makes it easier to canvas in groups. Zappia said he could feasibly knock on hundreds of doors in a one-block radius there. In Los Angeles, a street could be filled with mostly single-family homes. And with the abundance of Ring doorbell cameras, people can easily decline a visitor from the comfort of their couch.\n\nClayton Ryles, 31, only canvassed for one afternoon in Manhattan’s Chinatown in late October and felt the contrast between Mamdani’s campaign and others. In September last year, Ryles canvassed for Kamala Harris with his fellow United Auto Worker labor organizers in Las Vegas. Knocks on doors yielded intrepid voters who were “upset and suspicious”. Despite many people being pro-union, they felt that their cost of living was too high under Joe Biden.\n\n“Nobody was excited about the election. Everybody was like this is being inflicted upon us. We have to decide one way or another. For Zohran, most of the people were enthusiastic about what could happen with his mayoral tenure,” Ryles said.\n\nDavarpanah agreed, pointing to the call and response levels of Mamdani’s speech when crowds could clearly repeat phrases such as “fast and free buses” and “universal childcare”.\n\n“You can name them. Harris 2024 was not successful in articulating a vision,” she said. “A policy vision that materially impacts your constituents is something every candidate should take to heart. This is what actually inspires people to get involved when they actually see what you’re going to deliver.”\n\nAcross social media, users have been making posts about how California, and Los Angeles specifically, needs a Mamdani.\n\nFor Zappia, that means bringing back hope after a tough year that started with the Altadena wildfires and has continued with ICE raids, cutbacks to Snap benefits, and rising inflation, among many other difficulties.\n\n“People are just really looking for a sort of sign that things can turn around. In order to actually affect the change that we want to see, we have to first believe that we can actually do it,” he said.\n\n“And what happened in New York City is proof that it can be done, it’s proof that organized people can beat organized money.”","summary":"Activists in Los Angeles say the energy from the Hollywood strikes has been reignited by the success of the mayor-elect\n\nWhile the excitement for mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has radiated through New York, his win has also energized young activists across the country – particularly some in Los Angeles, who flew to the east coast to canvass for Mamdani and now want to bring their experiences westward.\n\nStanding near the poll site at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Neda Davarpanah – a screenwriter and actor based in Los Angeles – was inspired by Mamdani’s campaign for mayor so she flew out to New York in late October to canvass on the Upper East Side.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/09/new-york-zohran-mamdani-los-angeles","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98d11e4d794a048c8f5112078db75d2db93a8875/418_0_4164_3333/master/4164.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-09 17:00:37","author":"Helen Li","authors":["Helen Li"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.239},{"id":377305338,"title":"How is race for California governor shaking out?","text":"Californians hoping for Sen. Alex Padilla to save them from the prospect of Gov. Katie Porter were certainly disappointed on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a news conference, the senator made official his decision to sit-out the 2026 gubernatorial race and to stay focused on his responsibilities in the United States Senate.\n\n“And so it is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I am choosing to not run for a governor of California next year,” Padilla said. “I choose not just to stay in the Senate, I choose to stay in this fight. Because the Constitution is worth fighting for. Our fundamental rights are worth fighting for. Our core values are worth fighting for. The American dream is worth fighting for.”\n\nPadilla, who previously served on the Los Angeles City Council, as a state senator in Sacramento and as secretary of state of California, was widely seen as a potential field-clearer if he chose to jump into the race for governor. But considering he was just elected to a full six-year Senate term in 2022, Padilla no doubt realized being a senator is much less of a headache than being governor of California. Who could blame him?\n\nWith Padilla and former Vice President Kamala Harris out, that leaves us with the current crop of candidates and a couple of lingering maybes.\n\nOn Friday, Nov. 7, polling from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley confirmed that former Orange County Rep. and failed U.S. Senate candidate Katie Porter did serious damage to her political prospects with her recent outburst during an interview with CBS News reporter Julie Watts.\n\nWhile the Berkeley IGS poll found Porter in the lead in August with 17% of the vote, her support has now plummeted to 11%, putting her in second place.\n\nIn first place is Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, with 13%, up from 10% in August.\n\nFormer United States secretary of health and human services Xavier Becerra stood at 8% along with Republican pundit Steve Hilton.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa came in at 5%. Everyone else, from former Controller Betty Yee, current state Superintendent Tony Thurmond and the unannounced potential candidates Rick Caruso and Tom Steyer got 3% or less support.\n\nWith Caruso and Steyer choosing to throw their own money in support of the Proposition 50 campaign, it seems obvious they are angling for something. But neither of them have announced anything yet and it’s not obvious either of them could clear the field if they did choose to run.\n\nIn the meantime, the Villaraigosa campaign has launched attacks on both Porter and Becerra. His most recent ad on Becerra took aim at his handling of the child migrant crisis under President Biden and calls him “not fit to be governor.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Becerra campaign has declared him “the most viable Democratic alternative to embattled Katie Porter” and touts his record “holding the Trump Administration accountable.”\n\nYee, meanwhile, has chosen to tack left, saying in a recent interview, “I think transgender athletes are women athletes and they should be able to compete.”\n\nNeedless to say, this editorial board isn’t particularly impressed with the field of candidates so far.\n\nKatie Porter can’t handle a follow-up question.\n\nBianco is a deputy union puppet with the worst crime-solving rate among sheriffs in the state.\n\nHilton is a talking head with no record to speak of.\n\nBecerra covered for dirty cops in California as state AG and then fumbled in the Biden Cabinet.\n\nVillaraigosa gets kudos for sticking up for school choice, but even he thinks the bullet train is a good idea.\n\nYee dragged her feet on fiscal transparency as controller.\n\nThurmond supports gutting taxpayer protections and was nowhere to be seen during the coronavirus pandemic as kids suffered learning loss.\n\nNot exactly an inspiring field. Tom Steyer will certainly be a dud even with Democratic voters. Which leaves Rick Caruso, who has annoyed many with his strategy of burning money in an act of forgiveness for having been a Republican. But even so, he’s probably the most compelling potential option.","summary":"Californians hoping for Sen. Alex Padilla to save them from the prospect of Gov.

Major changes may not be felt yet from those less involved in the media landscape, but let’s take a look at how these outlets might be making a shift to the right—and why.\n\nOne of the biggest changes began when the family of Larry Ellison, a billionaire buddy of President Donald Trump, took control of Paramount and, in turn, CBS News. It didn’t take long for top-down changes to begin. First, they tapped Kenneth Weinstein, the former head of conservative think tank Hudson Institute, to oversee public complaints as CBS News’ ombudsman. \n\nSoon after, Bari Weiss, the controversial creator of The Free Press—decribed as a “less shrill version of the anti-woke alarmism that permeates the right-wing media”—was brought on as CBS News’ editor-in-chief. \n\nAnd while it's all still hearsay, Weiss and her team are reportedly considering a move to bring Fox News on-air talent to CBS News should “CBS Mornings” anchor Gayle King make her primetime exit when her contract runs out next year.\n\nOver at the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post, though, matters have been moving more right for quite some time. \n\nIn February, the billionaire Amazon founder axed the Post’s balanced opinion section, informing readers and staff that they would only be publishing op-eds that address “personal liberties and free markets.” According to Bezos, the internet did enough supplying of other viewpoints. \n\nBut months later, Bezos passed the editorial mic to MAGA’s administration. One of the many former Fox News hosts who has turned into a Trump lackey, Jeanine Pirro, defended the president’s decision to invade Washington with the National Guard. \n\nNational Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya also took a spot on the Post’s homepage to argue in favor of ending research on the mRNA vaccine. To give you an idea where his loyalties lie, Bhattacharya’s wedding was officiated by Vice President JD Vance.\n\nThe New York Times has also faced plenty of criticism for its apparent softening on the Trump administration, both during his first and current administration. But if that wasn’t enough, the Times also has columnist Ezra Klein platforming far right conspiracy theorists like Ben Shapiro.\n\nAnd Time Magazine caved to the president after his role in securing a flimsy peace deal between Israel and Hamas. When Trump wasn’t satisfied with how he looked on the cover, the magazine changed its entire cover photo to appease him. \n\nCNN may be next, it seems. As the network is heading toward the buyers market, the Ellison family reportedly has the traditionally liberal outlet in their crosshairs. \n\nNow, the solemn, or comforting, fact of all of this is that legacy media doesn’t have the same editorial sway that it used to, especially now that social media and independent reporting has a seat at the table. \n\nHowever, these behemoth media outlets do control one aspect of news—what the world is focusing on. So as opinions and angles may differ across markets, an Ellison-controlled conservative media machine might be able to decide what they’re talking about.\n\nAs for why this shift is happening, there are a few possibilities. \n\nGiven Trump’s many multimillion dollar lawsuits against media outlets, a softer approach may just be the way to avoid lofty legal fees. \n\nAfter all, the president managed to squeeze $16 million out of Paramount, the parent company of CBS, while also coming after The New York Times and Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal for its reporting on the Epstein files.\n\nIn an unsurprising turn of events, Trump even appeared on the very show he clawed millions out of for editing an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. On Nov. 2, the president spent a whopping 90 minutes on “60 Minutes,” where he was even given the gift of an edited interview.\n\n“Actually, ‘60 Minutes’ paid me a lot of money, and you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t want to embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not,” Trump said during the “60 Minutes” interview. \n\nIn what critics said was an attempt to avoid said embarrassment, CBS cut that part of Trump’s segment. However, the full version made its way out of CBS later anyway.\n\nThen again, these companies—and their millionaire or billionaire owners—might just be looking at what they perceive as a conservative call for news representation. \n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing demand for conservative media as well. This need was ultimately cornered by Fox News’ sensationalized conservative sway that changed broadcast journalism into the sexualized entertainment network it is today, especially for its female Fox News hosts. \n\nAnd with more conservatives abandoning more left-leaning media outlets, a change of political values might be on their fiscal table.\n\nBut no matter the way you spin it, the underlying message stands true: Legacy media is just another business, and they will always protect their bottom line.","summary":"Most traditional media have long held a more left-leaning tone, but that’s changing. \n\n\n\nFrom on the ground reporting to the top executives, more conservative voices are making their way into the long-established outlets.
