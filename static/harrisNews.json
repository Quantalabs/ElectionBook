But he offered no immediate plan to address health care costs, a sticking point for Democrats who want Republicans to agree to extend government subsidies for the more than 20 million Americans with Obamacare.The shutdown began a month ago and is just a few days shy of the 35-day record set by the 2018-2019 shutdown, which took place during Mr. Trump's first term in office.Furloughed federal workers are going unpaid as the shutdown continues. Active-duty military personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over.The prolonged shutdown also puts millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits.Mr. Trump places the blame for the shutdown at the feet of Democrats. He said his plan to end the shutdown is to \"keep voting.\"\"The Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, 'Give us an extension, we'll work it out.'\"Without federal subsidies, the cost of insurance under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, could double. Mr. Trump called Obamacare \"terrible\" and said \"it's bad health care at far too high a price.\"\"We should fix that. Fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats,\" he said \"All they have to do is let the country open and we'll fix it.\"Mr. Trump has talked about fixing the health care system for years, including during his first term in office. \"We almost did it. We were one vote short,\" he said.That was in 2017, when Senate Republicans failed by one vote to partially repeal Obamacare. There has never been an agreed-upon plan to replace it, and Mr. Trump did not offer a plan in his interview with 60 Minutes.Mr. Trump helped end previous government shutdowns by bringing members of Congress to the White House for discussions. \"I'm not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There's something wrong with these people.\"Mr. Trump said he believes that Democrats will eventually capitulate and vote to end the shutdown. \"And if they don't vote, that's their problem,\" he said. Mr. Trump said he thinks \"we should do the nuclear option … ending the filibuster.\" It's something Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said he's unwilling to do. \"The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're not going to lose power.\"Mr. Trump discussed the shutdown during his first interview with 60 Minutes in five years. It's his first since he sued and then settled with CBS parent company Paramount over a 2024 interview with then Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. The settlement did not include an apology. Mr. Trump's wide-ranging conversation with Norah O'Donnell also covered China, Venezuela, tariffs and U.S. immigration policy.","summary":"President Trump offered no plan for health care costs, which has been a sticking point in ending a government shutdown, and says it will end when Democrats give in.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-government-shutdown-democrats-fault-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/02/e1af31ad-9a35-4b15-b8dc-e64a4ebea3b4/thumbnail/1200x630/a1a0eebeb821a9f07fe692f90461d369/stills-clean-7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 00:35:12","author":"Aliza Chasan,Andy Court,Norah O'donnell","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Andy Court","Norah O'donnell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":375123418,"title":"Trump pressed on government shutdown, nuclear weapons testing, ICE raids","text":"President Trump, in his first sit-down interview with 60 Minutes in five years, placed blame on Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, defended his decision to strike alleged drug trafficking boats, and discussed where the U.S. stands with China, Russia and Israel. He also addressed questions on his immigration crackdown, the indictments of several of his most prominent critics, and the 2028 presidential election. Mr. Trump spoke with 60 Minutes contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell on Friday at Mar-a-Lago.The interview also marked his first appearance on the show since he sued and then settled with CBS News' parent company, Paramount, over a 2024 election interview with then-Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris. The settlement did not include an apology. Trump says government shutdown is \"Democrats' fault\"As the government shutdown continues, hundreds of thousands of federal workers have gone unpaid, including air traffic controllers. The prolonged shutdown has put millions of Americans at risk of missing their November food stamp benefits.The shutdown, which has now surpassed a month, is nearing a record set during Mr. Trump's first term in office. Mr. Trump places the blame at the feet of Democrats and said his plan to end the shutdown is to \"keep voting.\"\"The Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, 'Give us an extension, we'll work it out.'\"He said Democrats have become \"crazed lunatics\" who have \"lost their way.\" Senate Democrats are blocking efforts to reopen the government until Republicans agree to extend government subsidies for over 20 million Americans who use Obamacare for their health insurance.What happens to the economy if the Supreme Court invalidates Trump's tariffs The stock market hit record highs this past week and overall economic growth has been steady, despite the ongoing government shutdown. Mr. Trump attributed the stock market's success to his tariffs, a signature part of his economic plan.\"Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had,\" he said. \"Because of tariffs, 401(k)s [are] at the highest level that — and this is millions and millions of people — that we've ever had.\"This week, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about whether Mr. Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs without congressional approval. The lower courts have ruled against Mr. Trump. The president warned that the \"country will be immeasurably hurt\" if the Supreme Court invalidates his tariffs.\"I think our economy will go to hell,\" he said. Trump says ICE raids \"haven't gone far enough\"Mr. Trump says the raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, undertaken as part of his crackdown on undocumented immigrants, \"haven't gone far enough.\" He said he's OK with the tactics being used by ICE agents \"because you have to get the people out.\"One video from New York shows a mother being tackled by an ICE agent, while tear gas was used in a Chicago residential neighborhood. Car windows have been smashed to grab drivers.Mr. Trump described many of the immigrants being targeted by his administration as murderers and criminals. But many of the people who have been arrested and deported aren't violent criminals. Landscapers, farmers, nannies, construction workers and the families of U.S. service members have been among those caught up in the raids. \"We have to start off with a policy, and the policy has to be, you came into the country illegally, you're going to go out,\" Mr. Trump said. \"However, you've also seen, you're going to go out. We're going to work with you, and you're going to come back into our country legally.\"Trump says he'd send Army, Marines to U.S. cities \"in a heartbeat\" if neededIn addition to ICE raids, Mr. Trump has also ordered the National Guard to five U.S. cities: Los Angeles, Washington, Portland, Chicago and Memphis. He told 60 Minutes that, if needed, he'd use the Insurrection Act \"in a heartbeat\" to send in the Army or Marines into American cities. \"And if I needed it, that would mean I could bring in the Army, the Marines, I could bring in whoever I want,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But I haven't chosen to use it. I hope you give me credit for that.\"Trump on indictments of James Comey, John Bolton, Letitia James In recent weeks, former FBI Director James Comey, former national security adviser John Bolton and New York Attorney General Letitia James have all been indicted on federal charges and pleaded not guilty. \"There is a pattern to these names,\" O'Donnell said to Mr. Trump. \"They're all public figures who have publicly denounced you.\"Mr. Trump said he did not instruct the Department of Justice to go after them.\"You don't have to instruct 'em because they were so dirty, they were so crooked, they were so corrupt that the honest people we have — Pam Bondi's doing a very good job. Kash Patel's doing a very good job — The honest people that we have go after 'em automatically,\" Mr. Trump said. In a Truth Social post from September addressed to Bondi, Mr. Trump endorsed the idea that Comey and James were \"guilty as hell\" and wrote \"justice must be served, now!\"Trump says he doesn't want U.S. to be the only country not testing its nuclear weaponsLast week, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to immediately resume testing of nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with other countries.The president said the U.S. needs to test its nuclear weapons because other countries test their nuclear capabilities. He pointed to North Korea, Russia and China, even though Vice Adm.Richard Correll, who was nominated by Mr. Trump to lead U.S. Strategic Command and if confirmed, would be in charge of the country's nuclear weapons, recently told Congress that neither Russia nor China was conducting nuclear explosive tests.\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it.\"Will Trump try to stay in the White House beyond 2028?When asked to set the record straight about a hypothetical run for a third term, Mr. Trump pivoted to praising members of his Cabinet. \"I don't even think about it. I will tell you, a lotta people want me to run,\" he said. \"But the difference between us and the Democrats is we really do have a strong bench.\"The 22nd Amendment in the U.S. Constitution prevents presidents from being elected to more than two terms.Mr. Trump said it was too early to name possible Republican candidates for the White House in 2028, but said he does like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\"I like so many people,\" he said. \"We have an unbelievable bench.\"Trump pardons Binance founder, says \"I don't know who he is\"Mr. Trump, who once called bitcoin \"a scam,\" pitched himself as the pro-crypto presidential candidate during his campaign. His family even launched a new cryptocurrency company called World Liberty Financial, run by his sons, which has added billions to the family's wealth. Last month, Mr. Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who pleaded guilty in 2023 to a money laundering-related charge.The government at the time said Zhao had caused \"significant harm to U.S. national security,\" essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around. Mr. Trump, who pardoned Zhao, said he doesn't know who the Binance founder is. \"I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch hunt,\" Mr. Trump said.In 2025, before Zhao was pardoned, Binance helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial's stablecoin. World Liberty Financial told 60 Minutes it had no involvement in the pardon.Trump on meeting with Xi Jinping, trade relations with China60 Minutes' interview with Mr. Trump came just after his return from a trip to Asia, which culminated with a meeting with China's President Xi Jinping and an easing of the trade war between the two countries.Taiwan has been a flashpoint in U.S.-China relations for years. Mr. Trump said that Xi knows \"the consequences\" of military action in Taiwan, but he declined to expand on how he would respond if China were to invade the island, telling O'Donnell: \"I can't give away my secrets.\"Trump and Xi struck a one-year trade deal that, for now, averts the escalating tensions between the two economic superpowers. Mr. Trump said that in exchange for lower tariffs, China agreed to sell the U.S. valuable rare earth minerals and to start buying American agricultural products again.\"This is a very competitive world, especially when it comes to China and the U.S.,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're always watching them, and they're always watching us. In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think we can be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to just knocking them out.\"Trump says Gaza ceasefire is \"not fragile\"Last month, Mr. Trump was instrumental in reaching an Israel-Hamas ceasefire, leading to the release of 20 living hostages and the remains of other hostages. In the weeks since, Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating terms of the agreement. The ongoing tensions have provoked fears that the U.S.-brokered peace deal could crumble.\"It's not fragile,\" Mr. Trump said of the ceasefire. He said Hamas \"could be taken out immediately if they don't behave.\"Efforts to resolve the war in UkraineIn August, Mr. Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a high-stakes summit focused on ending the war in Ukraine. The talks failed to produce the ceasefire that Mr. Trump had sought.O'Donnell asked Mr. Trump why Putin would not end the war — a war Mr. Trump said would never have happened if he'd been president when it began.\"That was Joe Biden's war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war,\" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump pointed to his success in ending other international conflicts since his return to office. \"You know how I solved 'em? I said, in many cases, in 60% I said, 'If you don't stop fighting, I'm putting tariffs on both of your countries and you're not going to be able to do business with the United [States],\" Mr. Trump said. The strategy is different with Putin \"because we don't do very much business with Russia,\" Mr. Trump said. Escalating U.S. tensions with VenezuelaCloser to the American mainland, the U.S. military has struck and destroyed at least nine vessels in the waters off Venezuela, killing more than three dozen alleged drug smugglers. U.S. lawmakers, including at least four Republicans, have questioned the strikes' legality. F-35 fighter jets, eight U.S. warships and an estimated 10,000 U.S. troops are now in the Caribbean. The Pentagon also recently directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the region.Mr. Trump declined to comment on potential land strikes in Venezuela. \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that,\" he said. \"Because I don't talk to a reporter about whether or not I'm going to strike.\"O'Donnell asked Mr. Trump if the U.S. was going to war against Venezuela.\"I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs,\" he said.","summary":"In his first sit-down interview with 60 Minutes in five years, President Trump spoke about the government shutdown, Russia, the Middle East and other key issues.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-60-minutes-interview-highlights/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/02/d1b2f7e2-f98f-4933-b246-ea2c61451c0e/thumbnail/1200x630/d9c81534dbba70d61047afbf27707bd2/stills-clean-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 00:34:50","author":"Aliza Chasan,Andy Court,Keith Sharman,Norah O'donnell","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Andy Court","Keith Sharman","Norah O'donnell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":375123420,"title":"Trump on nuclear testing, the government shutdown, immigration and tariffs","text":"It's been five years since President Trump appeared for an interview on 60 Minutes. A lot has happened since then, not least of which was his political comeback and triumphant return to the White House. On Friday, hours after he touched down from his whirlwind trip to Asia, Mr. Trump agreed to sit down with us for a wide-ranging conversation. It was exactly one year to the day since he sued Paramount, the parent company of CBS, alleging that 60 Minutes had deceptively edited an interview with his opponent, Kamala Harris. Paramount settled that lawsuit. The settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing. In our nearly 90 minute conversation this past week, we spoke with Mr. Trump about the country and the world. We met with the president at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, on the 31st day of the government shutdown.Norah O'Donnell: We are now approaching the longest shutdown in American history.President Donald Trump: Democrats' fault.Norah O'Donnell: Under your presidency, we're talking about more than a million federal workers who are not getting a paycheck, including our air traffic controllers. You see there's traffic snarls out at the airports now. This weekend food aid for more than 42 million Americans is set to expire. What are you doing as president to end the shutdown?President Trump: Well, what we're doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, \"Give us an extension, we'll work it out.\" They've lost their way. They've become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, \"Let's vote.\"Senate Democrats say they will vote to reopen the government if Republicans agree to extend subsidies for over 20 million Americans who use Obamacare for their health insurance.President Trump: Obamacare is terrible. It's bad health care at far too high a price. We should fix that. We should fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open and we'll fix it. Norah O'Donnell: But if ending the government shutdown—President Trump: —they have to let the country open, and I'll sit down with the Democrats, and we'll fix it. But they have to let the country— and you know what they have to do—Norah O'Donnell: So your plan—President Trump: All they have to do is raise five hands. We don't need all of 'em.Norah O'Donnell: But so you're saying your plan is to tell the Democrats to vote to end the shutdown.President Trump: Correct, very simple. Norah O'Donnell: And that you will put forward a health care plan? President Trump: No. We will work on fixing the bad health care that we have. Right now, we have terrible health care and too expensive for the people, not for the government, for the people.Norah O'Donnell: But Mr. President, with all due respect—President Trump: The people are paying—Norah O'Donnell: —you've been talking about fixing the health care since 2015—President Trump: Sure. And you can't do it because of the Democrats. That's right.Norah O'Donnell: Since 2015, you said you'd fix it.President Trump: I've been talking about it for a long time. We almost did it. We were one vote short. We woulda had great health care. That was in 2017, when Senate Republicans failed by one vote to partially repeal Obamacare.President Trump: We can make it much less expensive for people and give them much better health care. And I'd be—Norah O'Donnell: But where is that plan?President Trump: —willing to work with the Democrats—Norah O'Donnell: But where is that plan?President Trump: —on it. The problem is, they want to give money to prisoners, to drug dealers, to all these millions of people that were allowed to come in with an open border from Biden. And nobody can do that. Not-Norah O'Donnell: Can I just—President Trump: —one Republican would ever do that.Norah O'Donnell: My understanding is, if those health care subsidies are not extended, premiums will double for many of the people that are on it. And I was looking into it. Three quarters of these people will see their health care premiums double live in states where you won in the last election. I mean, even here in Florida has the highest number of residents on Obamacare in the country. If those—President Trump: And I'm saying we can fix it, Norah. Norah O'Donnell: You have helped end these government shutdowns in the past when it came about—President Trump: I did.Norah O'Donnell: And you did it by bringing back—President Trump: I'm very good at it, but I'm not going to do it by—Norah O'Donnell: You brought members of Congress to— President Trump: —I'm not going to do it by extortion—Norah O'Donnell: —to the White House.President Trump: I'm not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way. The - there's something wrong with these peopleNorah O'Donnell: So then what happens on November 15th—President Trump: Schumer— Schumer is a basket case.Norah O'Donnell: —when the troops don't get a paycheck?President Trump: Schumer is a basket case. And he has nothing to lose. He's become— I just left Japan. He's become a kaz— kamikaze pilot.Norah O'Donnell: Sounds like it's not going to get solved, the shutdown.President Trump: It's going to get solved, yeah. Oh, it's going to get solved.Norah O'Donnell: How?President Trump: We'll get it solved. Eventually, they're going to have to vote.Norah O'Donnell: You're saying the Democrats will capitulate? President Trump: I think they have to. And if they don't vote, that's their problem. Now, I happen to agree to something else. I think we should do the nuclear option. This is a totally different nuclear, by the way. It's called ending the filibuster.But to do that, he'd need Senate Majority Leader John Thune to change Senate rules.Norah O'Donnell: Did you see John Thune said today they're not going to do that—President Trump: I know John doesn't— well, John and a few others. But, you know what? The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We're not going to lose power. The theory is, oh, then we'll do it, but then when they get into power someday they'll do it. That's true. But you know what?Norah O'Donnell: So you think John—President Trump: We're here right now. No, I like John Thune. I think he's terrific, but I disagree with him on this point.Norah O'Donnell: He j— he said today he wasn't going to do it.President Trump: Well, that's too bad.So far, the shutdown hasn't spooked the stock market, which hit record highs this past week. President Trump: Perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. We're doing really wellNorah O'Donnell: Uh-huh. Can I ask you, Mr. President—President Trump: The smart people definitely—Norah O'Donnell: —on that point, though?President Trump: Yeah.Norah O'Donnell: When the stock market is doing well, that doesn't affect everybody. Not everybody's invested in the stock market—President Trump: It does. Oh, it does, it does.Norah O'Donnell: But there have been— grocery prices are up—President Trump: Look, 401(k)s. People have 401(k)s. Their 401(k)s are double what they were a year ago.Norah O'Donnell: But for people that don't have 401(k)s, who are not invested in the stock market—President Trump: Sure. But— but—Norah O'Donnell: —they've seen their grocery prices go up, inflation—President Trump: No, you're wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they're going down. Other than beef, which we're working on, which we can solve very quickly.Norah O'Donnell: On the economy, the signature part of your economic plan is tariffs. The Supreme Court is going to hear arguments this week on whether you have the authority to impose these sweeping tariffs without Congressional approval. The lower courts have ruled against you. That's why it's at—President Trump: Well, no.Norah O'Donnell: —the Supreme Court right now.President Trump: Very close rulings, yeah.Norah O'Donnell: What happens to your economic plan if the Supreme Court invalidates your tariffs?President Trump: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k)s at the highest level that — and this is millions and millions of people — that we've ever had 401(k)s. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years. Norah O'Donnell: I know your time is limited, so I do want to make sure I get through more of these topics.President Trump: Sure.Norah O'Donnell: Immigration. You campaigned on immigration. You largely won the election on a promise to close the border—President Trump: Did a great job, don't you think?Norah O'Donnell: —and you succeeded on that. Illegal crossings at the Southern border are at a 55-year low. More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows. Have some of these raids gone too far?President Trump: No. I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the— by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama. Norah O'Donnell: You're OK with those tactics?President Trump: Yeah, because you have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Norah O'Donnell: Well, you promised in your campaign that you were going to deport the worst of the worst, violent criminals—President Trump: And I know we're doin' that—Norah O'Donnell: —rapists.President Trump: Well, that's what we're doing—Norah O'Donnell: But a lot of the people that your administration has arrested and deported aren't violent criminals. Landscapers, nannies, construction workers—President Trump: Oh, no, no, landscapers who are criminals—Norah O'Donnell: —farmworkers.President Trump: Now, look, look.Norah O'Donnell: The family of U.S. service members—President Trump: I need landscapers and I need farmers more than anybody, OK.Norah O'Donnell: Is it your intent to deport people who do not have a criminal record?President Trump: We have to start off with a policy, and the policy has to be you came into the country illegally, you're going to go out. However, you've also seen, you're going to go out. We're going to work with you, and you're going to come back into our country legally. Norah O'Donnell: When will you declare mission accomplished on immigration?President Trump: Well, it takes a long time, because, you know, probably I say 25 million people were let into our country. A lotta people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was 10 or— I believe I'm much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here. But we're— we're cleaning up our cities. You know, I campaigned on crime, but I've done a much better job on crime than I thought. You know, the crime numbers are way down, even though we have a lot more people in our country that really shouldn't be here. And many of them are stone-cold hard criminals.The president has ordered the National Guard to five cities: Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Portland, Chicago and Memphis. Norah O'Donnell: This past Tuesday, while speaking to American troops in Japan, you talked about U.S. cities that are having trouble with crime. And you said, \"If we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard.\" What does that mean, send more than the National Guard?President Trump: Well, if you had to send in the Army or if you had to send in the Marines, I'd do that in a heartbeat. You know, you have a thing called the Insurrection Act. You know that, right?Norah O'Donnell: Uh-huhPresident Trump: Do you know that I could use that immediately and no judge can even challenge you on that. But I haven't chosen to do it because I haven't felt we need it. Norah O'Donnell: So you're going to send the military into American cities?President Trump: Well, if I wanted to I could, if I want to use the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act has been used routinely by presidents. And if I needed it, that would mean I could bring in the Army, the Marines, I could bring in whoever I want. But I haven't chosen to use it. I hope you give me credit for that.Norah O'Donnell: I want to ask you about— another matter. James Comey, John Bolton, Letitia James were all recently indicted. There is a pattern to these names. They're all public figures who have publicly denounced you. Is it political retribution?President Trump: You know what? You know who got indicted, the man you're lookin' at. I got indicted, and I was innocent. And here I am, because I was able to beat all of the nonsense that was thrown at me. And yet, when you go after a dirty cop like Comey or a guy like Bolton, who I hear has, I don't know anything about it, I hear he took records all over the place, who knows. Letitia James is a terrible, dishonest person, in my opinion. Norah O'Donnell: Did you instruct the Department of Justice to go after them?President Trump: No, and not in any way, shape or form. No. You don't have to instruct 'em because they were so dirty, they were so crooked, they were so corrupt that the honest people we have, Pam Bondi's doing a very good job. Kash Patel's doing a very good job. The honest people that we have go after 'em automaticallyBut in a Truth Social post from September addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi, President Trump endorsed the idea that former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, were, quote, \"guilty as hell,\" and wrote, quote, \" justice must be served, now!!!.\" Five days later, James Comey was indicted. He pled not guilty — and so did Letitia James and President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton.Norah O'Donnell: Is this retribution on your part?President Trump: No, it's the opposite. I think I've been very mild-mannered. You're looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap. Otherwise I couldn't have run for president. They tried to get me not to run for president by going after me and by indicting me. So far this year, the president has pardoned or shortened the sentences of more than 1,600 people. The latest pardon was for a cryptocurrency tycoon who is known as C.Z. The company C.Z. founded, Binance, helped boost the profile of the Trump family's crypto firm World Liberty Financial.Norah O'Donnell: He pled guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money-laundering laws.President Trump: Right.Norah O'Donnell: The government at the time said that C.Z. had caused \"significant harm to U.S. national security\", essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around. Why did you pardon him?President Trump: OK, are you ready? I don't know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch hunt.Norah O'Donnell: In 2025 his crypto exchange, Binance, helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial's stablecoin. And then you pardoned C.Z. How do you address the appearance of pay for play?President Trump: Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy doing the other—Norah O'Donnell: But he got a pardon—President Trump: I can only tell you that—Norah O'Donnell: He got a pardon—President Trump: No, I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government.World Liberty Financial has denied any involvement in the pardon.With state and local elections coming up Tuesday, we asked the president about the highly anticipated mayoral race that includes former NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani.Norah O'Donnell: Zohran Mamdani, 34-year-old democratic socialist. He's the front runner—President Trump: Communist, not socialist. Communist. He's far…Norah O'Donnell: Some…President Trump: He's far worse than a socialist.Norah O'Donnell: Some people have compared him to a left-wing version of you, charismatic, breaking the old rules. What do you think about that?President Trump: Well, I think I'm much better looking person than him, right?Norah O'Donnell: What if Mamdani becomes mayor?President Trump: It's going to be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there. So I don't know that he's won, and I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or another, but if it's going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I'm going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you.When we sat down with President Trump on Friday at Mar-a-Lago, he had just returned from a high-stakes meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, which culminated with a temporary truce in the trade war between the two countries. But before the meeting even began, Mr. Trump made news — as he often does — with a social media post.Norah O'Donnell: Less than an hour before your meeting with President Xi, you posted on social media that you instructed the, quote, \"Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons–President Trump: That's right.Norah O'Donnell: —immediately.\"President Trump: Yeah—Norah O'Donnell: What did you mean? President Trump: Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. And I think we should do something about denuclearization. And I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot. They have some. They have quite a bit, but—Norah O'Donnell: So why do we need to test– our nuclear weapons?President Trump: Well, because you have to see how they work. You know, you do have to— and the reason I'm saying— testing is because Russia announced that they were going to be doing a test. If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing. We're the only country that doesn't test, and I want to be— I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test. Norah O'Donnell: Are you saying that after more than 30 years, the United States is going to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing—President Trump: I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.Norah O'Donnell: But the only country that's testing nuclear weapons is North Korea. China and Russia are not—President Trump: Well, Russia's— no, no. Russia's testing nuclear weapons—Norah O'Donnell: So my understanding–President Trump: And China's testing 'em too. You just don't know about it.Norah O'Donnell: That would be certainly very newsworthy. My understanding is what Russia did recently was test essentially the— delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles, which we can do that but w— not with nuclear warheads—President Trump: Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report— they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do. However, this week the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM — the admiral who would be in charge of nuclear weapons — was asked about this very issue on Capitol Hill. He said neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.Norah O'Donnell: One potential flash point with China, probably the potential flash point with China in the coming years, is over the issue of Taiwan. The Chinese military is encroaching on Taiwan's sea lanes, its airspace, its cyberspace. I know you have said that Xi Jinping wouldn't dare move militarily on Taiwan while you're in office. But what if he does? Would you order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan?President Trump: You'll find out if it happens. And he understands the answer to that.Norah O'Donnell: Why not say it—President Trump: This never even came up yesterday, as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that. He never brought it up, because he understands it, and he understands it very well. Norah O'Donnell: Do you mind if I ask, when you say, \"He understands,\" why not communicate that publicly to the rest of us? What does he understand that—President Trump: Well—President Trump: —I don't want to give away— I can't give away my secrets. I don't want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what's going to happen if something happens. The other side knows, but— I'm not somebody that tells you everything because you're askin' me a question. But they understand what's going to happen. And— he has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, \"We would never do anything while President Trump is president,\" because they know the consequences.At the top of the agenda for President Trump and President Xi was a one-year trade deal that, for now, averts the escalating tension between the two economic superpowers. Mr. Trump told us that in exchange for lower tariffs, China agreed to sell the U.S. its valuable rare earth minerals – and to resume buying American agricultural products.Norah O'Donnell: This trade war, though, was hurting Americans. I mean, our soybean farmers. China had stopped buying the soybeans.President Trump: Yeah.Norah O'Donnell: China was withholding these rare earth materials that you need for everything from smartphones, to build submarines.President Trump: Sure.Norah O'Donnell: What was the crucial thing? I mean, how tough of a negotiator—President Trump: Well, when you say hurting—Norah O'Donnell: —is President Xi—President Trump: —it was a temporary hurt. It was a hurt because— I was takin' in a lot of money from China. We're doing very well against China. And all of a sudden they said, \"You know, we have to fight back.\" And so they used their powers. The power they have is rare earth because of the fact that they've been accumulating it and— and really taking care of it for a period of 25, 30 years. Other countries haven't. They use that against us, and we used other things against them. For instance, airplane parts. That's a big deal. They have— hundreds of Boeing airplanes. We wouldn't give them parts. We were both acting— maybe a little bit irrationally, but the big thing we had was tariffs ultimately. I said, \"Look, if you don't open up, then what we're going to do is we're going to impose a hundred percent tariff over and above what you're already paying.\" Norah O'Donnell: Mr. President, you just negotiated this one-year trade deal with China—President Trump: Yep.Norah O'Donnell: But as you know, the Chinese, they think in a hundred years.President Trump: Sure.Norah O'Donnell: They play the long game, including on our own soil.President Trump: We play the long game too.Norah O'Donnell: Our own intelligence agencies say the Chinese have infiltrated parts of the American power grid and our water systems. They steal American intellectual property and Americans' personal information. They bought American farmland. How big of a threat is China?President Trump: It's like everybody else. We're a threat to them too. Many of the things that you say, we do to them. Look, this is a very competitive world, especially when it comes to China and the U.S. And— we're always watching them, and they're always watching us. In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think it's— I think we can be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to just— knocking them out– Norah O'Donnell: Who's tougher to deal with, Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping?President Trump: Both tough. Both smart. Both— look, they're both very strong leaders. These are people not to be toyed with. These are people you have to take very serious. They're not— they're not walking in saying, \"Oh, isn't it a beautiful day? Look how beautiful. The sun is shining, it's so nice.\" These are serious people. These are people that are tough, smart leaders.Norah O'Donnell: And on that note, you talk about Ukraine. In August, I mean, you rolled out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin in Alaska. But there's been—President Trump: Well, I roll out the red carpet for everybody.Norah O'Donnell: OK. But is— but there's been no ceasefire—President Trump: I think I made— yes, there isn't—Norah O'Donnell: What's— is he ignoring you?President Trump: —because he thinks— because I inherited a country where he thinks he's winning. That was a war that would've never happened if I was president. Norah O'Donnell: So why won't Putin end this war?President Trump: —that was— but— but Norah, that was Joe Biden's war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war.As the bloodiest land war in Europe since WWII continues…President Trump: But I brought, just a little list of— look at this, wars. President Trump wanted to make sure we saw the list of eight international conflicts he says he's been able to end since returning to office.Norah O'Donnell: I mean, you have branded yourself the peace president.President Trump: Well, I think I did—Norah O'Donnell: What—President Trump: —pretty good. I— I solved— those are eight of the nine wars I solved. I—Norah O'Donnell: When—President Trump: —you know how I solved 'em? I said, in many cases, in 60% I said, \"If you don't stop fighting, I'm putting tariffs on both of your countries and you're not going to be able to do business with the United—Norah O'Donnell: So why isn't that— why isn't that working with Putin?President Trump: Uhh, it is working with Putin, I think. I did different with him because we don't do very much business with Russia, for one thing, you know? He's not, like, somebody that buys a lot from us because of— foolishness. And I think he'd like to be. I think he wants to come in and he wants to trade with us, and he wants to make a lotta money for Russia, and I think that's great. The commander-in-chief has directed the U.S. military to destroy at least nine vessels in the waters off Venezuela, killing more than three dozen alleged drug smugglers. U.S. lawmakers, including at least four Republicans, have questioned the strikes' legality.In the meantime, F-35 fighter jets, roughly 10,000 U.S. servicemembers, and multiple warships are in the Caribbean.Norah O'Donnell: And now the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, that is the world's largest aircraft carrier, on the way to the Caribbean. Are we going to war against Venezuela?President Trump: I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs— they've dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we didn't want, people from prisons— they emptied their prisons into our company— country. They also— if you take a look, they emptied their mental institutions and their insane asylums— into the United States of America, 'cause Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. Norah O'Donnell: But I just want to talk about the scale of the military operation around Venezuela, because it has been described to \"60 Minutes\" as using a blowtorch to cook an egg. Is this about stopping—President Trump: Well, I don't think so. Look—Norah O'Donnell: Is it about— let me ask you, though. Is it about stopping narcotics? Or is this about getting rid of President Maduro? President Trump: No, this is about many things. This is a country that allowed their prisons to be emptied into our country. To me, that would be almost number one, because we have other countries—Norah O'Donnell: We don't need to blow up boats in order to deal—President Trump: Look, Mexico has been very bad to us in terms of drugs, OK? Very bad. We have a closed border right now. You probably noticed that for five months in a row, they have zero— think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border. Norah O'Donnell: On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro's days as president numbered? President Trump: I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.Norah O'Donnell: And this issue of potential land strikes in Venezuela, is that true?President Trump: I don't tell you that. I mean— I'm not saying it's true or untrue, but I— you know, I wouldn't—Norah O'Donnell: Why would we do it?President Trump: —I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that. But— because I don't talk to a reporter about whether or not I'm going to strike.Norah O'Donnell: Let's talk about Israel — you got the remaining Israeli hostages out of Gaza.President Trump: I did.Norah O'Donnell: You arranged a ceasefire, however fragile that may be. Those are major—President Trump: It's not fragile. It's a very solid— you know, I mean, you hear about Hamas, but Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don't behave. They know that. If they don't behave they're going to be taken out immediately. They're know that—Norah O'Donnell: How do you get Hamas to disarm?President Trump: If I want 'em to disarm, I'll get 'em to disarm very quickly. They'll be— they'll be eliminated. They know that. Don't forget, you said I got the remaining hostages. I got all the hostages out. But I always said the last 10 or 20 are going to be tough. Norah O'Donnell: You pushed the Israeli Prime Minister to make this deal, to get a ceasefire, to apologize to Qatar. Can you push Bibi Netanyahu to recognize a Palestinian state?President Trump: Yeah, he's— he's fine. He's fine. Look, he's a wartime prime minister. I worked very well with him. Yeah, I mean, I had to push him a little bit one way or the other. I think I— I did a great job in pushing— he's a very talented guy. He's a guy that— has never been pushed before, actually. That's the kind of person you needed in Israel at the time. It was very important. I don't think they treat him very well. He's under trial for some things, and I don't think they treat him very well. I think it should— you know, we'll— we'll be involved in that to help him out a little bit, because I think it's very unfair. Um – I did, I pushed him. I didn't like certain things that he did, and you saw what I did about that. I also stopped— you know, I— we knocked the hell out of Iran, and then it was time to stop, and we stopped. President Trump told us he expects to expand the Abraham Accords, the historic agreement struck during Mr. Trump's first term, that normalized relations between Israel and some Arab states.Norah O'Donnell: I wanted to ask you about the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is coming to the White House—President Trump: That's right.Norah O'Donnell: —this month. He has said they won't join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution. Do you believe that?President Trump: No. I think he's going to join. I— I think— we will have a solution. I don't know if it's going to be two-state. That's going to be up to Israel and other people, and me. But— look, the main thing is you could've never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran. And I blasted the hell out of 'em, and no president is—Norah O'Donnell: Are you convinced they have no nuclear capability right now in Iran—President Trump: Do you want to know— do you want to know— they have no nuclear capability, no. Do you want to know that— the pilots, I invited them to the White House—Norah O'Donnell: I saw that.President Trump: —'cause they were very brave. I mean, I wouldn't have wanted to do it you know, getting in a plane, and they know you're coming, and you're going right into Iran airspace. And, you know, they're very experts, and you're flying in with machines. Personally I can think of other things I'd rather do. These guys are very brave people. I mean, they're real American heroes. And they told me something I didn't know. They said, \"Sir for 22 years we've been practicing this route… three times a year every year for 22 years, and you were the only president that let us do our job.\" As our time with the president was winding down, we asked him whether he'll try to stay in his job beyond 2028.Norah O'Donnell: There's been a lotta talk about 2028 and who will be at the top of the—President Trump: Yeah.Norah O'Donnell: —Republican ticket. Can you set the record straight? You're not going to try and run for a third term?President Trump: Well I don't even think about it. I will tell you, a lotta people want me to run. But the difference between us and the Democrats is we really do have a strong bench. I don't want to use names, because it's, you know, inappropriate. But it's too early. 3 and ¼ years –Norah O'Donnell: But people do like when you start talking about whether you like J.D. Vance or Secretary Rubio—President Trump: I do like J.D. Vance. I like—Norah O'Donnell: Or secretary—President Trump: —Marco Rubio. I like— I like so many people. We have an unbelievable bench. Norah O'Donnell: Mr. President, can I also ask you, we're now at the end of your first year.President Trump: Yeah. Norah O'Donnell: Of this second term. What do you hope to accomplish in the next three years?President Trump: I hope I can have the same year that we had. Look, we have been acknowledged to have the greatest nine months. You know, it's nine months. The greatest nine months in the history of the presidency. So if I can keep that going I'll be very happy. Produced by Andy Court and Keith Sharman.

WATCH His Reply","text":"US President Donald Trump has sparked fresh headlines after being asked whether New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani was a \"left-wing version\" of him. During an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, he also renewed his criticism of Mamdani, describing him as a \"communist\". When asked by anchor Norah O'Donnell about Mamdani's self-declared socialist identity, Trump interrupted to correct her. \"Communist, not a socialist — he's far worse than a socialist,\" he said. Pressed on comparisons that some have drawn between him and Mamdani — describing the New York politician as a \"left-wing version\" of himself — Trump replied: \"Well, I think I'm a much better-looking person.\" The comments come just a day before voters head to the polls for the New York City mayoral election, scheduled for Tuesday, November 4. Trump has been a vocal critic of Mamdani since he defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in June. In earlier remarks on his social media platform Truth Social, the president labelled Mamdani a \"100% Communist Lunatic\" and mocked his appearance. \"He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he's not very smart, he's got AOC+3, Dummies ALL, backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, is groveling over him,\" Trump wrote. Zohran Mamdani, the son of Indian-American filmmaker Mira Nair and Ugandan-Indian scholar Mahmood Mamdani, is on track to become the first Muslim mayor in US history if elected. His campaign has highlighted his Muslim identity and has resonated strongly with younger and progressive voters across the city.

I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary.\n\n“Let’s battle test this quickly and get it up and going. I think the mistake with it being Kamala is that she had to run against her own record, and it’s very hard to do if the point of running is to say, ‘I’m not that person’. It’s hard to do.\n\n“And so she was given a very tough task. I think it was a mistake, quite honestly.\n\n“But we are where we are. We were going to lose more house seats, they say.\n\n“To not do it would be to say, ‘I’m not going to tell the truth’.”\n\nFormer US president Mr Biden ended his bid for re-election in July 2024 following mounting pressure to step aside after a faltering debate with Republican rival Donald Trump a month earlier.\n\nHis son, Hunter Biden, accused Clooney of exaggerating the former president’s frailty.\n\nClooney said: “I could spend a lot of time debunking many of the things he said, because many things he said were just outright lies.”\n\nSpeaking about the importance of a free press, Clooney said: “I want our government to reflect us at our best and to step in when needed and I am watching a real attack on all the basic institutions, and I’m saddened by that.\n\n“And I’ve seen this pendulum swing so many times. People will talk about this being the worst time in the country for a lot of people, and it’s bad. There’s some things going on.\n\n“1968 was pretty rough, too.

Overall, 49 percent of respondents said that America’s best days are behind it, while 41 percent said they were still to come. Just 10 percent of Americans said that the second Trump presidency represented America’s “best days”, including only 14 percent of self-identified Trump voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the ABC News poll out Sunday shows that 67 percent of Americans still believe the country is on the wrong track, down from 75% in the leadup to the election in November of 2024. \n\nThe noticeable improvement comes after the defeat of Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party, who spent much of the year battling accusations that the president, Joe Biden, was mentally incapacitated and unable to fulfill his role at the top of his party’s ticket, forcing him to step down from his re-election bid late into the year.\n\nThe findings suggest that while a share of Americans saw the defeat of Biden and his allies in 2024 as a marked improvement in terms of setting the course for the country’s future, the vast majority of Americans still see more work to do. In the Politico poll, this view is supported by a greater-than-ever share of Americans who now believe that “radical” changes to America’s economy and government are required to avert disaster. This finding includes 46 percent of Trump voters and 58 percent of Harris voters.\n\nDemocrats in particular are panicked about the state of the country, with roughly half telling Politico that the U.S. was no longer a “functioning democracy” and a staggering 95% who told ABC News that the country was \"pretty seriously off on the wrong track\". But Republicans are not wowed by Donald Trump’s second term either: 48 percent of all Americans say that the country has gotten weaker under his second term, according to ABC, while the share who say he has shown strength was only one in three.\n\nSix in 10 voters overall told the ABC News pollsters that Trump’s management of inflation and tariffs were doing more harm than good to the American economy.\n\nThe share who said the economy is better under Trump is lower than both the share that thinks it got worse (52 percent) or has stayed roughly the same (27 percent). Even 20 percent of Republican respondents specifically laid the blame on Trump over Democrats like Joe Biden for the current rate of inflation, indicating that the president’s window for blaming his predecessor for the state of the economy has closed.\n\nIf Democratic leaders think those findings will translate cleanly into anti-Trump fervor with no blowback for them, think again: The share of voters who told ABC News that the Democratic Party was out of touch with average Americans was higher than the number who said the same about either Republicans or Donald Trump specifically. And on the issue of a generic midterm ballot, the Democrats held just a two percentage-point lead over Republicans in ABC’s polling.","summary":"Trump and Harris voters now agree: ‘Radical change’ is needed to stop the death of the American Dream","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-poll-maga-america-b2857074.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/18/EEUU-PRUEBAS_NUCLEARES_05952.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VrcuQaoS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-02 21:06:56","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":375102866,"title":"Gavin Newsom has high hopes — but rock-bottom results","text":"When New York was the most populous and economically dominant state in the 19th and much of the 20th century, it was natural its governors would be quadrennial contenders for the presidency.\n\nThe Empire State sent four of its governors on to the White House (Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt) but supplied nominees or serious contenders in numerous other cycles (Samuel Tilden, Al Smith, Tom Dewey, Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller, to name a few).\n\nAfter California became the most populous and prosperous state in the early 1960s, it was expected its governors would become top contenders for the Oval Office every four years. \n\nBut so far California has only sent Ronald Reagan from Sacramento to the White House. \n\nOther Golden State governors who’ve tried (Jerry Brown in 1976, 1980 and 1992; Pete Wilson in 1996) fell flat.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom is hoping to break the dry spell. \n\nNewsom can be opaque at times, but his ambition for the presidency is so obvious that he’s dropped the usual coy clichés about how “I’m focusing on my current job” and instead last week admitted that “I’d just be lying” if he said he wasn’t thinking hard about a presidential run.\n\nThis is a notable shift for Newsom, who for the last several years has repeatedly demurred from any hint, saying “I have no idea” “Fate will determine,” and even “Who the hell knows?” whether he would run someday.\n\nOne factor that may have forced Newsom’s shift was former Vice President Kamala Harris’s statement that “I’m not done” with public life, hinting she’s strongly considering another run in 2028.\n\nIt’s an open secret in California that Harris and Newsom are bitter rivals, and Newsom can’t let Harris get the jump on lining up support — and campaign-contribution pledges — from the state’s formidable Democratic money-and-influence machine.\n\nNewsom and Harris top the early opinion polls for the 2028 Democratic nomination, but at this early point such polls mostly reflect name familiarity. The past several presidential election cycles have featured early front-runners in both parties who fizzled out once real campaigning and primary voting started.\n\nNewsom, however, has been shrewdly positioning himself with aggressive steps to shore up support from the Democratic Party’s ascendant progressive base. He has been visiting early primary states and putting out cheeky social-media posts aping President Trump’s wild style, while Harris is content with a book tour that isn’t moving many copies of her book.\n\nBy far his most bold move is Proposition 50, which Californians vote on this week. Prop. 50 will take congressional redistricting out of the hands of an “independent” commission (that Democrats have largely gamed to their advantage already) and return it to the Democrat-dominated state Legislature.\n\nNewsom’s proposed district map will likely cost Republicans five of the nine House seats (out of 52 total) they currently have. It is meant to counterbalance moves in Republican states such as Texas to draw new congressional districts for next year that should yield big GOP gains in the House.\n\nSpecial-election initiatives in California have often backfired. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger tried a special election package of reforms that lost badly, and Ronald Reagan’s Proposition 1 in 1973 — a tax-and-spending-limitation initiative — also lost badly, damaging his planned 1976 presidential campaign.\n\nBut Newsom has promoted Prop. 50 as a way to “fight Trump,” and polls indicate his gamble is going to work, with the initiative likely to cruise to victory this week. It will be a major talking point for Democrats in other states.\n\nThere are other reasons, though, to think Newsom’s shooting star will flame out in 2028. New York and California used to be swing states of a sort, electing Democrats and Republicans in roughly equal numbers to statewide office. But California especially is a deep-blue state today and not representative of the nation as a whole.\n\nNewsom’s record is far to the left, with dreadful results on everything from crime to homelessness, deep budget deficits, poorly performing public schools, a high-speed-rail line to nowhere (that will never be completed), the nation’s highest energy costs, unaffordable housing and an economy seemingly designed to be hostile to the middle class.\n\nIt takes almost malevolent misgovernment to drive several hundred thousand residents to leave a state with such beauty and natural advantages, but somehow monopoly Democratic rule has accomplished it.\n\nWith Hollywood and Silicon Valley both shrinking their footprint in the state, “dynamic” no longer applies to California, and no one will believe talk of any kind of “California promise.” “Make America California” is not going to be a winning slogan.\n\nBy the end of the 2028 campaign Newsom will wish he had just booked more dinners at the French Laundry instead.\n\nSteven F.

The meeting largely focused on US-China trade tensions.\n\nAsked on US media outlet CBS’s “60 Minutes” programme whether he would order US forces into action if China moved militarily on Taiwan, Trump demurred.\n\nThe US, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, has maintained a policy of “strategic ambiguity” on Taiwan — trying not to tip their hands on whether the US would come to the island’s aid in such a scenario.\n\n“You’ll find out if it happens, and he understands the answer to that,” said Trump, referring to Xi.\n\nBut Trump declined to spell out what he meant in the interview conducted Friday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, adding: “I can’t give away my secrets. The other side knows.”\n\nThe US president claimed that Xi and those close to him had “openly said” that “‘we would never do anything while President Trump is president,’ because they know the consequences.”\n\nUS officials have long been concerned about the possibility of China using military force against Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy claimed by Beijing as part of its territory.\n\nThe 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed US relations with the island, does not require the US to step in militarily if China invades but makes it US policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status by Beijing.\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, did not respond directly to a query from The Associated Press news agency about whether Trump has received any assurances from Xi or Chinese officials about Taiwan. He insisted in a statement that China “will never allow any person or force to separate Taiwan from China in any way.”\n\n“The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair, and it is the core of China’s core interests. How to resolve the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people ourselves, and only the Chinese people can decide it,” the statement added.\n\nThe White House also did not provide further details about when Xi or Chinese officials have conveyed to Trump that military action on Taiwan was off-the-table for the duration of the Republican’s presidency.\n\nThe “60 Minutes” interview marked Trump’s first appearance on the show since he settled a lawsuit this summer with CBS News over its interview with then-Vice-President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview had been deceptively edited to benefit the Democratic Party before the 2024 election. Trump initially sought $10bn in damages, later raising the claim to $20bn.","summary":"US president claims Chinese leader would never act on Taiwan while he&#039;s in office &#039;because they know the consequences&#039;.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/2/trump-says-xi-assured-him-china-wont-take-action-on-taiwan?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25303126250287-1762115580.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 20:59:10","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":375104020,"title":"How Old Is J.D.

Dan Goldman (D-NY)” and “late-night host Jimmy Kimmel” insist that Antifa “does not exist as a group,” remarks Jonathan Turley at Res ipsa loquitur, yet self-identified Antifa individuals and groups recently “put out a hit list poster” against a Turning Point USA leader that resulted in his being “attacked by a person in the signature Antifa black outfit.” \n\nDemocrats are “ramping up denials of the very existence of Antifa” to deflect “criticism for their own increasingly rage-filled rhetoric.” \n\nAntifa “avoids typical leadership hierarchies and organizational structures,” but “law enforcement officials, like former FBI Director Christopher Wray,” affirm that “‘Antifa is a real thing.’”\n\nPension beat: Cali’s Losing Green Gamble\n\nCalifornia’s massive public-employee-pension fund CalPERS “lost 71% of its $468 million investment in a clean energy and technology private equity fund” but “won’t explain how,” notes The Center Square’s Kenneth Schrupp. \n\nThe pension fund “says its pension benefits are only 79% funded, leaving the state, and its taxpayers, on the hook for the other 21%.” \n\nTo try to close its “pension shortfall of approximately $180 billion,” CalPERS “has multiplied its investments in private equity” investments in solar power, which “have outperformed its other assets,” at least “on paper.” \n\nBut “public finance experts say private equity is too expensive, too risky and doesn’t provide enough transparency,” making them inappropriate investment vehicles for pension plans. \n\nFrom the left: Dems Toss Boomers with Bathwater\n\n“The Democratic Party’s generational police are coming after” the Boomers, frets Joe Klein at Sanity Clause: “The party’s leadership is too old, it is said,” so now “we have several races to demonstrate the energy and creativity of youthful candidates v. the woozy exhaustion of the elderly.” \n\nBut many younger candidates lack “real-life experience,” and resemble “Zohran Mamdani, a perfect dilettante,” or “Graham Platner in Maine,” a “faux proletarian.” \n\nNevertheless, “bring on the next generation, some of them,” while keeping in mind that “even the new Democrats are out of step with America, still playing 20th century politics.” \n\nThey have few candidates “who are willing to break the party’s identitarian straitjacket.” \n\nJustice watch: Bragg’s ‘Trial That Never Was’ \n\nIt was the trial that “never happened,” quips the Washington Examiner’s Byron York, referring to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s prosecution of President Trump — a topic that barely came up in his debate with his re-election challengers, even though it “was the biggest professional accomplishment of Bragg’s life.” \n\nWhy so little discussion? Bragg’s opponents know just 17.6% of Manhattan voters backed Trump in 2024, versus 82.4% for Kamala Harris. \n\nWhat’s in it for them if they “tear into Bragg for prosecuting a president so unpopular?” \n\nStill, under Bragg, some serious crime rose and “theft-weary stores” had to “put toothpaste under lock and key,” even as the DA poured resources into pushing a dubious case against Trump. \n\n“Shouldn’t that be something voters consider when deciding whether to reelect him?” \n\nLibertarian: City-run Grocery Stores Are Losers \n\nZohran Mamdani says “New Yorkers should think of city-run grocery stores as a ‘public option’ that would deliver cheaper food by saving on rent and taxes” — and not needing “to make a profit,” grumbles Reason’s Natalie Dowzicky. \n\nHmm: “In Kansas City, a government-run grocery store scheme lost nearly $900,000 just last year.” \n\nIf Mamdani wants to give New Yorkers “access to cheaper groceries,” he should simply “allow Walmart in the Big Apple.” \n\nMamdani says his plan will improve “access to fresh food” yet studies show all New Yorkers already have it; anyway, “new grocery stores don’t improve food access” or improve “the diets of their surrounding communities.” \n\nBetter to put resources into dealing with the homeless, rats and needles littering too many neighborhoods.\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Zohran Mamdani says “New Yorkers should think of city-run grocery stores as a ‘public option’ that would deliver cheaper food by saving on rent and taxes” — and not needing “to make a profit,” grumbles Natalie Dowzicky.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/02/opinion/city-run-grocery-stores-are-losers-antifa-is-all-too-real-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-jlpm6mzyn-1762115768356.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1762097962&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 20:55:04","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":375123414,"title":"Trump says ICE raids \"haven't gone far enough\"","text":"President Trump, who campaigned on immigration and closing the border, says Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids \"haven't gone far enough.\"As part of his crackdown on immigration, ICE agents have raided neighborhoods throughout the U.S. One video shows a mother being tackled by an agent.

But They Won’t Tell You What’s in It","text":"Skip to main content\n\nNovember 2, 2025\n\nMike Johnson on Friday, October 31, 2025.\n\nTom Williams/Getty Images\n\nRepublicans appear determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act, but what will go in its place? It’s a question the party has struggled to answer since the ACA passed. Remember Trump’s first term promise to “repeal and replace” Obamacare that never came to fruition?\n\nSince the government shut down a month ago, the party has refused to publicly discuss a plan, even as ACA subsidies expire at the end of the year, forcing Americans to pay astronomically higher monthly premiums. In New Jersey, some premiums will rise by more than 175 percent. One family’s premiums will spike 300 percent. Across the board, premiums are expected to increase by an average of 26 percent for a typical ACA plan, a recent KFF analysis revealed.\n\nThe Republicans’ so-called health care plans are so secret, in fact, they won’t share them with members of their own party. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who called out House Speaker Mike Johnson last week for not disclosing the party’s plans during a GOP conference call, said during an appearance on Friday’s Real Time with Bill Maher: “Mike Johnson, for a month now, cannot give me a single policy idea.”\n\nShe said at another point during the show, “I’m waiting for the [healthcare] plan. I haven’t seen it yet.”\n\n(In true MTG style, she also admitted to believing that aliens are space demons, saying, “That’s what makes sense in my worldview.”)\n\nConfronted with Greene’s criticism on Fox News Sunday, Johnson said, “I don’t know what to say about that. That’s absurd. Obviously, we’re not gonna be on a conference call explaining all of our plans and strategies for healthcare reform because they’re leaked in real time, literally… They’re supposed to be private, but they’re not.”\n\nMike Johnson talks about the Republican \"healthcare plan\" like it's highly classified information: \"We're not gonna be on a conference call explaining all our plans and strategies for healthcare reform, because they're leaked in real time.\"\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) 2025-11-02T14:59:34.708Z\n\nJohnson then claimed that Greene can visit his office “any day at any hour” and he will “lay out everything for her.” He then referenced a 2019 Republican Study Committee plan that proposed changes to healthcare, including re-establishing high-risk pools.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\n\nThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\n\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\n100 Best Movies of the 21st Century\n\nSen. John Kennedy floated the idea of high-risk pools in an interview on CNN last week.\n\n“There are a number of ideas being batted around association health plans,” the Republican senator from Louisiana said, adding, “bringing back high risk pools, which have been outlawed under the Affordable Care Act.”\n\nJohn Kennedy on Republican healthcare ideas: \"Bringing back high risk pools, which have been outlawed under the ACA.\"\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) 2025-10-29T20:32:54.952Z\n\nThese types of pools existed before the ACA banned them, and they were plagued with issues. Premiums in these pools were often twice the rate that lower risk people paid, they often excluded coverage for pre-existing conditions for the first 6-12 months, many had a lifetime coverage limit, and numerous states restricted how many people could join their pool, according to KFF.\n\nBringing back high-risk pools will only bring back the problems they caused.\n\nPerhaps GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew best summarized the state of the party’s plans: “It is politically stupid. It does not make sense to come up with no plan dealing with health care… The plan is to come up with something better.”\n\nSo the plan is to have a plan — eventually. But, Van Drew warned, don’t expect to see that plan anytime soon.\n\n“That’s going to take a good part of the year, to have something substantive and real that works,” he said.\n\nTrending Stories\n\n'SNL' Weekend Update Trashes Trump's White House Renovations, 'Weird' Halloween Habits\n\n'SNL' Cold Open: Trump Crashes NYC Mayoral Debate to Roast Each Candidate\n\nThe Burial of Black Genius (a.k.a.

Gavin Newsom backed off from speculation that he is planning to run for president on Sunday.\n\nOne of the Democratic Party’s most vocal leaders in the second Trump era, Newsom previously told CBS News that he would be “lying” if he said he wasn’t considering running for president in 2028 in an interview that aired one week ago today.\n\nBut on Sunday, the governor sounded much less inclined towards pulling the trigger on that specific venture.\n\nAsked by Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker, “why do you want to be president?”, Newsom’s answer was simple.\n\n“I don’t,” he said.\n\nHe went on to explain that while he tried to answer a question from CBS’s Robert Costa honestly, his focus was entirely centered on California’s redistricting process and what it would mean for his party in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Democrats are hoping to take back one or both chambers of Congress, allowing them the levers of power to challenge the president’s agenda directly.\n\n“I'm not suggesting I am [running for president],” Newsom told NBC. “It was in response to someone [who] talked about it.”\n\nHe added that there was “nothing I dislike more than a politician that sits there and lies to you”.\n\n“I'm focused on Prop 50. I'm focusing on fair and free elections. And to the extent, fate, the future, there's an alignment, you have a big enough why, you have a what and a how, you meet a moment and that moment presents itself in a year, year and a half, we'll see what happens,” said the governor, referring to the redistricting amendment set to be presented to California voters.\n\nDuring his interview, Newsom battled a skeptical Welker on several points.\n\nOne moment came as the two clashed over whether the U.S. Department of Justice could still be trusted to handle cases fairly; the governor expressed surprise at Welker’s suggestion that such a prospect was even possible, given how the White House and DOJ have launched a campaign to target a growing list of the president’s political enemies with cases that many experts describe as flimsy and obviously motivated by a desire to punish Democrats.\n\nThe two also clashed over whether Newsom was “normalizing” Donald Trump’s behaviour by mocking it with his “Governor Newsom Press Office” account on X, which has taken to mimicking Trump’s all-caps insult-throwing social media statements.\n\n“It reminds me of something Michelle Obama said once, ‘When they go low, we go high.’ Is there still room for that mindset for Democrats?” asked Welker.\n\n“I would love to go back to that, but politics has changed. The world has changed,” Newsom responded.\n\nDespite Newsom’s stated hesitance towards running for president, the governor did one thing in his interview with Welker that could, to political observers, be seen as taking another step towards that eventuallity.\n\nThe governor was asked by Welker about an issue that most journalists and Democratic officials believe will be a major issue in the 2028 presidential primary: Joe Biden. The party’s trust and popularity ratings with voters are at historic lows, and the bungling of the 2024 election campaign is chiefly to blame. Democrats refused to hold a primary after Biden announced that he planned to run for re-election in 2023, with one lone congressman, Dean Phillips, desperately pleading publicly for his party to change course. \n\nThen, the disastrous debate performance by Joe Biden in June revealed a president who appeared lost, confused and physically frail onstage, unable to effectively respond to his opponent’s points or finish his own coherently. By then, it was too late for a full primary contest and party figures like Rep. Jim Clyburn opposed efforts by the likes of Barack Obama to allow the party’s voters to decide the issue.\n\nNewsom told Welker that while he “never” had concerns about Biden’s ability to do his job, he had “privately” raised concerns about the president’s demeanor after a fundraiser in Southern California. At that event, in May of 2024, the sitting U.S. president reportedly failed to recognize megastar Hollywood icon George Clooney, one of the Democratic Party’s biggest supporters in the film industry.\n\n“The one exception, as it relates to the interaction I had with him, that gave me pause, one, was the fundraiser in Southern California. And all of us were a little taken aback,” Newsom explained to Welker. The governor added that during the June debate with Trump, “that person came back on that debate night and that certainly gave all of us pause.”\n\nHe went on to assert that he raised his concerns to the campaign “privately, with grace and humility,” while echoing what former vice president Kamala Harris said about her refusal to put more pressure on her running mate to drop out: “He was going to make the right decision. And so for me it wasn't my job to go out there.”\n\nThat move to address the concerns about Biden’s age puts the governor ahead of many of his potential rivals for the 2028 nomination, including Harris who struggled to enunciate why she herself refused to separate herself from the president and hadn’t spoken out before it was too late during the media tour for her recently-published memoir, 107 Days.\n\nHarris, in particular, is likely (along with others in the former administration) to face those questions going forward as the party’s voters largely blame leadership for fumbling what many believe should have been a winnable election for the Democratic Party and pushing the GOP into twin majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nHaving refused to say that she would do anything different than Biden had she been president for four years, Harris will shoulder the burden of the entire Biden-Harris administration’s record should she enter the field in 2028. This year, she declined to run for governor in California.","summary":"California governor backs away from 2028 speculation while taking first step to address why his party lost the White House: Joe Biden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/newsom-trump-obama-2028-president-b2857024.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/02/17/39/newsom_mtp_1125.jpg?crop=805.5,537,x74.7,y0&trim=0,75,0,74&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EGblCL2y-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-02 18:03:37","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":375064956,"title":"Trump says China's Xi assured him that he won't take action on Taiwan during Republican's term","text":"President Donald Trump says that Chinese President Xi Jinping has given him assurances that Beijing would take no action toward its long-stated goal of unifying Taiwan with mainland China while the Republican leader is in office.\n\nMr. Trump said that the long-contentious issue of Taiwan did not come up in his talks with Mr. Xi on Thursday in South Korea that largely focused on U.S.-China trade tensions. But the U.S. leader expressed certainty that China would not take action on Taiwan, while he's in office.\n\n“He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, 'We would never do anything while President Trump is president,' because they know the consequences,” Mr. Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the CBS' programme “60 Minutes” that aired on Sunday (November 2, 2025).\n\nU.S. officials have long been concerned about the possibility of China using military force against Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy claimed by Beijing as part of its territory.\n\nThe 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. relations with the island, does not require the U.S. to step in militarily if China invades but makes it American policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status by Beijing.\n\nAsked if he would order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan if China attacked, Mr. Trump demurred. The United States, both Republican and Democratic administrations, have maintained a policy of “strategic ambiguity” on Taiwan — trying not to tip their hands on whether the U.S. would come to the island's aid in such a scenario.\n\n“You'll find out if it happens, and he understands the answer to that,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Xi.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House also did not provide further details about when Mr. Xi or Chinese officials have conveyed to Mr. Trump that military action on Taiwan was off-the-table for the duration of the Republican's presidency.\n\nThe \"60 Minutes\" interview was taped on Friday at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Trump said that the long-contentious issue of Taiwan did not come up in his talks with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, which largely focused on U.S.-China trade tensions. But the U.S. leader expressed certainty that China would not take action on Taiwan while he's in office. “He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, ‘We would never do anything while President Trump is president,’ because they know the consequences,” Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the CBS program “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday. U.S. officials have long been concerned about the possibility of China using military force against Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. relations with the island, does not require the U.S. to step in militarily if China invades but makes it American policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status by Beijing. Asked if he would order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan if China attacked, Trump demurred. The United States, both Republican and Democratic administrations, have maintained a policy of “strategic ambiguity” on Taiwan — trying not to tip its hand on whether the U.S. would come to the island's aid in such a scenario. “You’ll find out if it happens, and he understands the answer to that,” Trump said of Xi. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House also did not provide further details about when Xi or Chinese officials have conveyed to Trump that military action on Taiwan was off-the-table for the duration of the Republican's presidency.

And Trump has said, don't spend a dime.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But all the Democrats have to do is say, let's go. I mean, you know, they don't have to do anything.\n\nRADDATZ: Federal programs start running dry as the month-long shutdown hits home.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, yet we're willing to let people go hungry.\n\nRADDATZ: The impacts of the spending freeze cascading into American life.\n\nTRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Our traffic will be snarled. But it will be a disaster in aviation.\n\nRADDATZ: As voters in several states prepare for the first major elections since President Trump's return to the White House.\n\nWINSOME EARLE-SEARS (R), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: As we all know, this race, the world is watching!\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: The results on Tuesday will be a reflection of what it is that we are for.\n\nRADDATZ: We visit New Jersey, a blue stronghold that saw one of the hardest shifts to the right in 2024.\n\nJACK CIATTARELLI (R), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: The closeness in my race and the closeness in the president's race last year were real eye-openers.\n\nMIKIE SHERRILL (D), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to take on Donald Trump when it comes to our economy here in New Jersey.\n\nRADDATZ: This morning, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Democratic Senator Tim Kaine join us. We break down the latest results from our brand-new poll, two days before Election Day. And analysis from our powerhouse roundtable.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANNOUNCER: This is a special edition of \"THIS WEEK,\" “Your Voice, Your Vote 2025.” Here now, Martha Raddatz.\n\nRADDATZ: Good morning and welcome to \"THIS WEEK.\"\n\nWe are just two days away from key election in several states across the country. Elections that will give us a sense of the nation's mood and potentially an early signal of what could come next in 2026 as Democrats seek to regain power in Washington after Trump's tumultuous return to office.\n\nAnd our new ABC News/\"Washington Post\"/Ipsos poll out this morning finds that the mood of the country is decidedly negative, with two-thirds of Americans saying the country is on the wrong track under President Trump. But that is an improvement from this same time last year under President Biden.\n\nThe economy is a major part of the current discontent, with more than six in ten Americans disapproving of how President Trump is handling the economy, as well as tariffs. And a similar share blaming him for the current rate of inflation. Overall, a majority of Americans disapproved of the president's handling of every issue we polled.\n\nAs for the Democrats, more Americans say the Democratic Party is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the U.S. today, than say the same about Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nAll of this comes as more Americans are starting to feel the fallout from the now month long government shutdown, which seems to have no end in sight.\n\nAnd that's where we start this morning with ABC's Jay O'Brien.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJAY O'BRIEN, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The government shutdown now on the brink of becoming the longest in U.S. history.\n\nMINORITY LEADER SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: Republicans are living in fantasy, pretending as if the issue will fix itself.\n\nSPEAKER OF THE HOUSE REP. MIKE JOHNSON: The blame for this lies 100 percent with the senators sitting over there on the Democrat Party.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice over): But Americans seem to be more critical of the GOP. ABC's new poll with \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" and Ipsos finds 45 percent of Americans blame President Donald Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, while 33 percent say the same about Democrats.\n\nNo matter who is to blame, the pain is getting worse by the day. On Saturday, funding for SNAP federal food assistance drying up. The benefits halted for 42 million Americans.\n\nSYMONE WILKES, SNAP RECIPIENT: I'm already struggling.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice over): Simone Wilkes, a single working mother from Detroit, has two young boys and relies on SNAP. She's now looking at taking a second job.\n\nWILKES: It has been days where the kids will eat, and I'll just survive off water.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice over): The Trump administration reversing an earlier plan to use the Department of Agriculture's emergency funds to cover the program during a shutdown.\n\nBROOKE ROLLINS, AGRICULTURE SECRETARY: It is a contingency fund that can only flow if the underlying appropriation is approved.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice over): But on Friday, a federal judge ordering the administration must continue funding SNAP during the shutdown. President Trump responding, writing, he's instructed government lawyers to “ask the court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.”\n\nBut this worsening food crisis now on a collision course with the issue Democrats are holding firm to fix in this shutdown, looming, skyrocketing health care costs for some 20 million Americans insured through the Affordable Care Act. And with tax credits set to expire, enrollees, on average, set to see their premiums more than double.\n\nSTACY COX, ACA MARKETPLACE ENROLLEE: It's devastating. Just that bill right there, that's more than our mortgage, our insurance, most of our food.\n\nO’BRIEN (voice over): A month into this shutdown, more than 1.4 million federal workers are going without pay, including air traffic controllers. And this week, airports across the country reporting more of those tasked with keeping the skies safe are calling out sick, leading to staffing shortages and delayed flights, expected to only get worse.\n\nPETE LEFEVRE, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: The prospect of going another pay period without pay is weighing on the minds of myself and all the people that I work with.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nO’BRIEN (on camera): And, Martha, several governors have now declared a state of emergency, trying to meet this surge in demand now that SNAP has been halted.\n\nMeantime, there's no end to this shutdown in sight. Democrats continue to withhold their votes on government funding, trying to compel Republicans to negotiate with them on health care. Republicans have said they won't do that while the government is shut down.\n\nRADDATZ: And for more on the impacts from this shutdown, including on air travel, I'm joined now by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.\n\nWe're so pleased to have you here this morning, Mr. Secretary.\n\nAmericans have experienced major delay. There's a ground stop this morning at Newark, all because air traffic controllers are calling in sick. The FAA is saying that “currently, nearly 50 percent of major air traffic control facilities are experienced staffing shortages, and nearly 80 percent of air traffic controllers are out at New York-area facilities.”\n\nWe know that safety is your greatest concern, but at some point, might you have to shut down portions of the U.S. airspace, maybe even airports? What point are we at, at that possibility?\n\nTRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: Well, so, first off, I've been traveling around talking to air traffic controllers and there really is frustration. The fact that there's a shutdown right now. The Democrats are focusing on illegal healthcare, and, you know, we've endangered the SNAP beneficiaries, and they don't get paid as air traffic controllers. There's a burning frustration like in the rest of the country.\n\nAnd so, you mentioned that safety is my top priority. And it is. We will delay, we will cancel any kind of flight across the national airspace to make sure people are safe.\n\nBut there is a level of risk that gets injected into the system when we have a controller that's doing two jobs instead of one. We manage that. We look out for it. And safety is the priority.\n\nWe'll take all steps necessary, though, to make sure that you get from point A to point B and you do it safely.\n\nRADDATZ: And just again, how close are we to this point where you might have to close airspace or airports as we watch air traffic controllers calling in sick?\n\nDUFFY: Well, so, first off, if you look at other shutdowns, our air traffic controllers, God bless them, they've been coming to work. They're frustrated, but by and large, they've come. They're not getting paid.\n\nAnd so, I can't predict, Martha, what's going to happen in the future. But as each day goes on, and again, it's not -- you miss a paycheck, but every day you have expenses, food and gas, and then bills come in. Whether it's Netflix or, you know, your YouTube TV, the expenses continue to roll, and the pressure continues to grow.\n\nAnd the problem is, these controllers, a lot of them are new controllers or they're trainee controllers. They don't make a lot of money. And so, they may be the only person that is bringing money into the household. They have to make a decision, do I go to work and not get a paycheck and not put food on the table, or do I drive for Uber or DoorDash or wait tables? Those are the real thoughts and conversations these controllers are having.\n\nSo, as I look forward, I hope Democrats are going to come to their senses and open the government back up. But I would just tell you, as bad as it is, the numbers you just gave, this -- we will look back if -- if the government doesn't open in the next week or two, we'll look back as these were the good days, not the bad days. It's only going to get worse.\n\nAnd, Martha, just one other point on our controllers. We -- as I think you've reported, we have really old, antiquated air traffic control equipment. We have the most efficient and safe airspace, not because of the equipment, but because the great men and women who control the airspace, and we should treat them like the professionals that they are and pay them.\n\nRADDATZ: Well -- well, let's talk about that. The Trump administration this week paid service members by using $2.5 billion in housing funds from the so-called big, beautiful bill. Why haven't you done something similar with air traffic controllers?\n\nDUFFY: Yes, so we've looked throughout our -- our funding mechanisms to see how we could pull money in and -- and pay our controllers. We kept essential air service operational. We're paying our academy students at Oklahoma City. They get a stipend as they go through the academy.\n\nWe're pulling in whatever dollar we can, but there -- there's real restrictions. When you don't fund the government, when you say there's no dollars available, it becomes really challenging to find dollars to pay the different components of really critical workforces that keep our country moving forward.\n\nAnd again, it's simple. Democrats, open up the government, negotiate a deal, have a conversation, introduce a bill, debate it, vote on it, but shutting the government down is not the pathway forward, I think, to make sure you get your way and you get your will.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Mr. Secretary, I want to read from our poll. ABC's new poll with “The Washington Post” and Ipsos finds 44 percent of Americans blame Donald Trump and the Republicans for the shutdown, while 33 percent say the same about Democrats.\n\nSo, people are looking at this because the Republicans obviously have both houses of Congress and the White House and putting the blame on Republicans. So, what should Republicans be doing?\n\nDUFFY: Well, I think it's important to say in September, we -- Republicans said we should have the same funding levels in September as we do in October. We didn't change anything.\n\nAgain, you don't use shutdowns to pass bills. You don't hold the American people hostage. You don't hurt the American people to get leverage. And that's exactly what Democrats are doing right now because people are getting hurt.\n\nAnd again, whether you're traveling home to see your family or go to a funeral or a wedding or you're on a business trip, the hours that people are spending in airports, Democrats see that as leverage. And, this not the -- this is not the pathway to get your way or get your will.\n\nAnd I would just note, Martha, Donald Trump had a historic election. He won the popular vote. He won the seven swing states. Democrats roundly lost.\n\nAnd so now to say, “I'm going to shut down the government to get my way, my will,” I -- listen, you can't cave to that. Otherwise, you're going to have a shutdown every -- every third month.\n\nAnd so again, the polling is one thing, but the process is another.\n\nRADDATZ: And let's talk about the process and President Trump's role. Demo -- you say Democrats have to come to the table. Republicans have not been negotiating. And Scott Bessent told me just a week ago he think -- he thinks it would be a waste of time for Donald Trump to hold another meeting.\n\nBack in 2011, when Donald Trump was considering a run for president, this is what he said about Barack Obama as a shutdown loomed. Let's listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, 2011)\n\nINTERVIEWER: So, how would you do it now? Now, you're in the Oval Office right now --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would get everybody together and we'd have a budget -- \n\nINTERVIEWER: They've all gotten together.\n\nTRUMP: Well, that's because they don't have the right leader. You don't have the right leader. This is the president of the United States has to get this done.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: And he went on to say, \"The president is the one that has to get people together, and it would be a tremendously negative mark on the president if they couldn't get it done.\" What's your reaction to that?\n\nDUFFY: Well, I'll just tell you that Barack Obama said, \"I'm not going to be blackmailed. I'm not going to be held hostage. This is not the way you negotiate a deal. You lost the election, Republicans,” that's what Barack Obama said. “Go through the process.”\n\nAnd I think that's the right philosophy right now. And again -- \n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Should President Trump -- given what he said, should President Trump be meeting? Would you like to see him hold another meeting?\n\nDUFFY: So, here -- here's the problem -- Donald Trump has nothing to negotiate with. We passed a clean funding bill, right? So, what do you negotiate with when you -- again money in September, same as October.\n\nDemocrats are trying to use this as leverage and again trying to change legislation that they don't like. But again, the changes they want to make want to fund healthcare for illegal migrants. That doesn't make sense to Republicans.\n\nIf you want to have a conversation, let's have it. The healthcare funding doesn't end until the end of the year. So why are you shutting the government down in October when you could have a conversation for three months until the end of the year?\n\nI think this doesn't make any sense. I think Democrats are angry. They're playing to the left-wing side of their base. Most commonsense Democrats, I think, would say, \"Open it up and negotiate, pass bills, debate it.”\n\nBut this is not the approach on how you pass legislation.\n\nRADDATZ: Okay, thanks so much for joining us, and we'll let Tim Kaine respond to what you just said. Thanks so much.\n\nDUFFY: Thanks, Martha.\n\nRADDATZ: And I'm joined now by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia.\n\nGood morning, Senator.\n\nI know you heard Secretary Duffy there talking about the onus is on the Democrats, and that you are fighting to get legal health care for immigrants.\n\nSEN. TIM KAINE, (D) VIRGINIA: Well, I just got to say, Martha, that’s a lie. The healthcare battle is not about healthcare for illegal immigrants, and Sean Duffy knows it. It’s about millions of Americans who, in the last few weeks, have gotten premium increase notices that tell them that Donald Trump’s Big, Beautiful Bill is delivering them big, ugly health insurance bills within the next few weeks unless we can find a fix.\n\nAnd so, what we’re taking for is, let’s find a path to a fix and let’s also have President Trump finally engage in the negotiation and guarantee that a deal is a deal. If we shake hands on a deal for 30 days or for three months, he won’t immediately start firing more people, clawing back economic development projects, going after blue states or blue cities, and allowing funds to be used in red cities.\n\nSo, look, we’re looking for a path to fix people’s health care costs, and we’re looking for the president to agree that a deal is a deal. Thus far he’s refused to engage, and we avoid shutdowns or get it out -- get out of shutdowns all the time when the president engages.\n\nRADDATZ: So -- so, Senator, it has been 33 days. Democrats chose not to support that short term CR, which would have kept the government open. You could have negotiated. Now there’s some pretty devastating impacts on -- on people looking at -- for SNAP, on air traffic controllers, on air travel. So, what have the Democrats gained from this?\n\nKAINE: Well, I don’t look at this as politics. I mean the president told the House, do a budget and, in his words, don’t deal with Democrats. So, Senate Democrats put an alternative on the table 12 days before September 30 that fixed the health care wreckage that the Republicans caused and that ensured that a deal would be honored, both by Congress and the White House. The president refused to meet until the day before the deadline. He had Democrats in the Oval Office. And as soon as they walked out, he put up an A.I.-generated video of them wearing sombreros and talking in A.I.-generated fake voices saying they didn’t say. The guy’s unserious. He’s willing to give $20 billion --\n\nRADDATZ: But -- but serious --\n\nKAINE: Hold on. He’s been willing to give $20 billion to the Argentinians and meet with them, wreck the White House, have a Great Gatsby party down at Mar-a-Lago. He has not done what he said needed to be done in 2011, sit down with Democratic leadership. If he (INAUDIBLE) --\n\nRADDATZ: Senator, I just want to go back to the --\n\nKAINE: Leadership, this thing (ph) will be resolved in a matter of hours.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Excuse me. I just want to go back to what Democrats have gotten during this period. Not talking about politics. What have Democrats gained during this period? And how long can this last?\n\nKAINE: I -- you know, Martha, I'm a United States Senator. And I -- yes, I run as a Democrat, and I'm a Democrat, but I just don’t approach my work that way. So, when you ask what Democrats have gained, what we’re -- what we’re focused on is the American people. We want President Trump to stop firing people, canceling economic development projects. We want them to stop raising everybody’s costs. You know, health care costs, energy costs, housing costs. Halloween’s more expensive. Thanksgiving is more expensive. The holidays are going to be more expensive.\n\nSo, we’re asking the president to simply sit down and do what all presidents do. We can find a budget deal that puts us on a path to a health care fix. I don’t need all the i’s dotted and t’s crossed. I just want to be on a path so that people’s bills don’t spike, and I want the president to agree, stop the wrecking ball. Stop the mass firings and the cancellations of projects you don’t like.\n\nAnd I think Americans understand that. And that’s why they look at Donald Trump’s lack of engagement and overwhelmingly say that he’s really more to blame for this.\n\nRADDATZ: We just have a couple of minutes here, but you recently said things are coming together. There are reportedly conversations among rank-and-file senators to try to reach -- to negotiate the reopening of the government for a few weeks. Is that going on right now? Are you part of those discussions?\n\nKAINE: I would say, Martha, I'm sort of at the edge of them. There is a group of people talking about these two issues, a path to fix the health care debacle and a guarantee that if we reopen government, I'm calling it a moratorium on mischief. If we agree to reopen, President Trump’s got to stop the firings.\n\nThe FAA, we’re talking air traffic control, they’ve forced 2,400 people out of the FAA during Trump’s first year, when they were already short 3,000 air traffic controllers. Stop the firings, stop the games playing, stop going after blue cities and helping red cities. Let’s have a moratorium on mischief during whatever this period is. Get on a path to fix people’s health care. If the president engages, we will be -- we will find a deal, I think, within hours.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Senator, just quickly, if you can, you’re there in Virginia. Virginia holds key elections on Tuesday. Are you confident the Democrats can sweep this?\n\nKAINE: I feel really good about it, Martha. And here’s why. In Virginia, we are the best red to blue turnaround in the country in the last 25 years. And the way we’ve done it is by focusing on the economy. Abigail Spanberger, our candidate, three pillars to her campaign, affordability, jobs, and education, which is about kids, but also about our workforce. Her opponent is running ads on offbeat cultural issues that don't really matter to the most people. In Virginia, Democrats focus on the economy, winning the economic argument, delivering economic results. And that's why the state has moved from red to blue so dramatically since 2000.\n\nRADDATZ: OK. Thanks so much. Good to see you this morning, Senator. Appreciate your time.\n\nKAINE: Thanks, Martha. Good to be with you.\n\nRADDATZ: Up next, our report from New Jersey, looking at what's driving voters there ahead of Tuesday's critical elections. Plus, Rick Klein breaks down the races from New York City to Virginia to California. We're back in two minutes.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We need leaders who will tell the truth and who will take responsibility and tackle hard problems and bring people together instead of tearing them apart. We need leaders who won't serve bosses in Washington or big corporate donors, but instead will serve the people who put them there.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: Former President Barack Obama hitting the campaign trail this weekend in Virginia and New Jersey. Tuesday's elections in several states will be a critical test of where the country stands one year after returning Donald Trump to the White House, and a potential signal on whether Democrats have a chance to re-take Congress one year from now. So ahead of Tuesday's final voting, we look at how both sides are making their closing arguments to voters.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D), VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Virginia, are you fired up?\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): From the high-stakes gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, to the contentious mayor's race in New York City, and California's consequential redistricting measure that Governor Gavin Newsom is counting on --\n\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D), CALIFORNIA: We're going to meet the moment not just with rhetoric, but through action.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): For Democrats, this will be their first try at redemption since President Donald Trump's re-election.\n\nIn Virginia, moderate Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, has maintained a modest lead over Republican nominee, Winsome Earle-Sears, the state's current lieutenant governor.\n\nZOHRAN MAMDANI (D), NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL CANDIDATE: New York is not for sale.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): And in New York, progressive Zohran Mamdani holds a substantial lead over his opponent including former governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent. But it is New Jersey that could hold the biggest challenge for Democrats, where moderate congresswoman and former Navy helicopter pilot, Mikie Sherrill's lead is anything but certain.\n\nWe met up with her in Asbury Park between campaign events, where her message is clear.\n\nREP. MIKIE SHERRILL (D), NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I'm going to fight incredibly hard for families, for kids to get costs down, and I'm going to take on Donald Trump when it comes to our economy here in New Jersey.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): But the historically blue state has moved to the right in recent years. Former vice president Kamala Harris won New Jersey by just six points last November, down 10 points from former President Joe Biden's lead in 2020.\n\nRADDATZ: What happened in New Jersey for that right turn in 2024 (ph)?\n\nSHERRILL: I think New Jersey is really representative of what's going on in America. We have a lot of middle class voters who are looking at their costs go up year after year after year, and who felt as if nobody was hearing them. And so, they decided to take a chance on a Trump administration because Trump promised to lower their cost.\n\nUnfortunately, he has done anything but. We've seen costs skyrocket here.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Republican nominee and former assemblyman, Jack Ciattarelli, came close to the governor's mansion last election, losing to Governor Phil Murphy by just three points.\n\nJACK CIATTARELLI, (R) NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: This is very different from 2021. I'm not running against an incumbent and there's a lot less indifference this time around, not only inside New Jersey, but around the country. The closeness of my race and the closeness of the president's race last year were real eye openers.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): The Trump administration's decision to withhold congressionally approved funds for the Gateway Tunnel Project, connecting New York to New Jersey, has faced major blowback.\n\nCIATTARELLLI: He's playing hard ball negotiation tactics with a very uncooperative Democratic Party. By the way, my opponent, if she feels that seriously about the Gateway Project, then vote yes and reopen up the government.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Down in Pennsville Township, we met Bishop Kendon Gibson, a former Democrat-turned-independent who voted for Trump in 2024 because of the economy.\n\nBISHOP KENDON GIBSON, NEW JERSEY VOTER: I voted for policy, change, lowering taxes.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): But this election, he's voting blue.\n\nGIBSON: I think that Mikie Sherrill is more for the people, the working people. I think that the Democrats deserve another chance.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): When you look at the progressive side of the Democratic Party and the moderate side, what do you wish the Democrats would do?\n\nGIBSON: I think we could have gotten more aggressive with healthcare because now we're stuck with a shutdown and we have to use that as leverage when we could have, you know, really protected Obamacare.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Not all New Jersey voters we spoke to felt the shutdown mattered in this race.\n\nKELSEY ANTHONY, NEW JERSEY VOTER: I think people's minds are sort of made up. Either you think it's a Republican's fault or you think it's a Democrat's fault.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Born and raised in New Jersey, lawyer and Ciattarelli campaign volunteer Kelsey Anthony already cast her ballot.\n\nANTHONY: I am a mom. I have two young children, and I believe that the public education system, specifically funding of the public education system, is broken in New Jersey. The school funding has been completely disproportionate around the state. And Jack has stated that he's going to fix that.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): And she knows this race is close.\n\nANTHONY: Generally, New Jersey has many more Democrats than it does Republicans, but I think that right now, the state of the state is not good. And I think that the last eight years have been really telling. And the current administration has really done a number on a lot of New Jersey families. And I think that if there was ever a time for change, it's going to be now.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): Over in Princeton, New Jersey, Democrat Chris Johnson voted early for Sherrill but isn't very excited about her candidacy.\n\nCHRIS JOHNSON, NEW JERSEY VOTER: There really was only one option, which is to vote for the Democratic Party. But to be honest, it feels to me a little bit like picking the least worst option. And the fact that we did put so much effort into canvassing and getting the word out and making the phone calls and it was that close in the presidential election and then even in the prior gubernatorial election is worrisome. You know, I think New Jersey is much more purple than people realize.\n\nRADDATZ (voice-over): He says Democrats need to focus less on Trump.\n\nJOHNSON: There's been far too much of an emphasis on continuing to run against Trump and not focusing on what they are going to do with their own messaging, their own platform to improve the lives of people. You know, I think running an ad saying, \"Hey, I'm a mom and I'm a helicopter pilot, so therefore vote for me\", that's not a winning message.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nRADDATZ: And we'll see about that on Tuesday.\n\nBut we want to drill down a little deeper right now. Our Washington Bureau chief Rick Klein is here now with the breakdown of what to look for around the country on Election Day.\n\nAnd, Rick, good morning. Let's start with those two marquee governor's races.\n\nRICK KLEIN, ABC NEWS WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF: Yeah. Good morning, Martha.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey, of course, both relatively blue states. So, Democrats losing either one of them would send a big message, but even if Democrats sweep on Tuesday, we're going to see how much the political winds have shifted since last year.\n\nIf you look at the polls in New Jersey, where you just spent some time on the ground, the Democrat Mikie Sherrill with a narrow but pretty consistent lead over her opponent Jack Ciattarelli. As you mentioned, Ciattarelli came close to winning the governor's race back in 2021, but it is still a heavily Democratic state. It's worth noting nearly every part of the state has shifted to the right between 2020 and 2024, particularly, you see this trend in North Jersey where large numbers of Black and Hispanic voters in particular reflected a national trend of voting Republican a year ago, far more than they have in recent elections.\n\nThe question Tuesday, Martha, is whether those voters show up again and vote Republican, or if Democrats have some momentum back with them now that Trump is in the White\n\nHouse again.\n\nRADDATZ: And what about Virginia, Rick?\n\nKLEIN: Yeah. In Virginia, the state has been trending Democratic over the last couple of decades. And if recent polls hold, the Democrat, Abigail Spanberger, is poised to defeat the Republican, Winsome Earle-Sears. She's the current Lieutenant Governor of the state. Now, that wouldn't come as a surprise. In governor's races, the state almost always votes against the party in the White House, including in 2021 when Governor Glenn Youngkin won just a year after President Biden was elected.\n\nRADDATZ: And Rick, let's not forget New York City, New York City's preparing for one of the most consequential elections in the city's history.\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, and this could easily be the biggest story coming out of Tuesday night. Polls show Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old self-described Democratic socialist, well ahead of his opponents. And what's striking here is how much interest has been in this election. Almost 600,000 New Yorkers have already cast their ballots in early voting. That has already smashed the record for a mayoral election in New York.\n\nMamdani represents generational as well as ideological change. National Republicans are actually probably even more eager than Democrats to see him rise to prominence, given his calls for higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, and his past calls which he has since reversed, to defund the police.\n\nRADDATZ: We certainly have seen him reverse those. And finally, Rick, Democrats are counting on California to approve new congressional maps on Tuesday.\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, Martha, we've seen this highly unusual redistricting nationwide, all of these states either considering or already have adopted new maps. This is Democrats' biggest chance to swing back at the Republican advantage. Until now, it has been all Republican. The new maps that have passed at President Trump's urgings in states, including Texas and Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, those moves could net Republicans as many as nine more seats in the midterms next year.\n\nBut Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, he pushed through a new map that could net his party up to five additional seats. This is what the map would look like. The number of Republicans would go down potentially from nine to four. And if voters make that a reality on Tuesday, it's a big, big change. Although, even if it passes, it's worth noting, Republicans are likely to get a lot more out of redistricting than Democrats.\n\nIt looks like they'll get a handful of seats at least, out of this in an election where the balance of power just could not be tighter next year, Martha.\n\nRADDATZ: And they will no doubt be trying to do that. Our Washington Bureau Chief, Rick Klein, thanks so much.\n\nUp next, our Business Correspondent, Elizabeth Schulze takes a deeper dive into how the economy could impact Tuesday's vote. And later, our Powerhouse Roundtable.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: In our new ABC News/\"Washington Post\"/Ipsos poll, some 52 percent of Americans say the economy has gotten worse since Donald Trump took office. Nearly double the 27 percent who say it has improved.\n\nABC’s Elizabeth Schulze takes a closer look at why the economy is front and center in voters' minds.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nELIZABETH SCHULZE, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Nearly a year since Donald Trump's economic pitch to voters helped propel his return to the White House --\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): A tale of two economies emerging.\n\nTRUMP: We're doing numbers that nobody's ever seen before.\n\nZOHRAN MAMDANI, (D) NEW YORK MAYORAL NOMINEE: This is the most expensive city in the United States of America, and it's time to make it affordable.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): On paper, the U.S. economy is humming along, growth is solid, unemployment remains near historic lows, and the stock market keeps hitting records. But prices are also increasing, and economists say President Trump's tariffs are a key reason why.\n\nJEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: There will be some additional increased inflation because it takes a while for tariffs to work their way through the -- through the production chain.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): In the past year, prices are up for most basic essentials. The latest government inflation report shows utility bills are up 12 percent in one year. Electricity bills up 5 percent, day care costs up 5 percent, rent up 3.5 percent, and food prices up 3 percent.\n\nJULIE LUSENI, CLINICAL TECHNICIAN: Everything has gone up. Everything.\n\nSCHULZE (voice over): We spent an afternoon with Julie Luseni, a clinical technician at a hospital, and single mom of three in Virginia, who's struggling to keep food on the table. After paying for groceries, bills, and rent, Julie says she only has $100 left until she receives her next paycheck.\n\nLUSENI: It's really tough, to the point that like even when school is about to start, my kids will literally just have either two pair of shoes for like the whole year.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSCHULZE (on camera): And, Martha, this really is a tale of two economies. The top 10 percent of households account for almost half of all consumer spending right now, in many ways propping up the broader economy. And those cost of living concerns don't appear to be going anywhere, with the typical household now spending $208 more per month on the same goods and services than they were at this time last year.\n\nRADDATZ: Thanks so much, Elizabeth Schulze.\n\nThe roundtable takes on Tuesday's elections and the shutdown stalemate when we come back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: And the roundtable's all here. Former DNC chair Donna Brazile, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and author and journalist, Molly Ball.\n\nGood to see all of you.\n\nAnd, Chris, I want to get right to you. Former governor of New Jersey, talk about this race in New Jersey and what you're seeing with Mikie Sherrill.\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, Martha, this is a really tough state for my party. Give you context. We've elected one Republican United States senator in the last 50 years, one Republican governor in the last 25 years.\n\nRADDATZ: And I think we know who that is.\n\nCHRISTIE: We do.\n\nAnd let me tell you, when I got -- when I ran, there was no road map for how to win New Jersey as a Republican in the 21st century. No one had done it. But we've laid the path for Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nThis is what he's going to have to do to beat Mike Sherrill -- 70 percent of the white vote, 21 percent of the black vote. We won 51 percent of the Hispanic vote. We beat a female candidate, as he is running against this time, by 15 points. And we won 58 percent of independents.\n\nWith 850,000 more Democrats than Republicans, that's what you need to do.\n\nSo, the question for him on Tuesday night is, can he hit those numbers?\n\nThose are the numbers you have to hit to win in a state like New Jersey. The path has been laid out. We'll see what he can do.\n\nRADDATZ: You think he can do it?\n\nCHRISTIE: I -- look, I think it's possible because the one other thing that's going on here, Martha, is Democrat excitement is not way up there regarding Mikie Sherrill. What you see happening is there's anger towards Donald Trump among Democrats. Will that translate into votes for Mikie Sherrill?\n\nRADDATZ: And, Donna, let's talk about the Democrats and in Virginia as well. What are you seeing in both races? Do you see Mikie Sherrill taking this and Spanberger in Virginia?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, New Jersey is seen as -- the electorate at least is seen as very -- is like elastic. Everybody thinks you can stretch it. Donald Trump came within six points. In 2020, Joe Biden beat Trump by 16 percentage points. Kamala Harris only beat him by six points. The Republicans made significant inroads in New Jersey, Chris.\n\nAnd I remember on election night a year ago, that at 10:45, I looked at him, and I said, \"What the hell is going on in Passaic County?\" I mean, I know New Jersey. And I was like, \"Chris, what's happening?\" Because Trump was shifting the electorate.\n\nMikie Sherrill had two main challenges. One, she's dealing with a relatively unpopular governor, so she had to become her own candidate. I think she's done a fantastic job, you know, talking about her past in the Navy, talking about being a prosecutor. I think she has made up a lot of difference and the enthusiasm is there.\n\nIn Virginia, there's no question. Early voting is really good for Democrats, but as you know, same day Republicans can make up a lot of ground.\n\nSo, I'm optimistic on both sides. \n\nRADDATZ: You really think the enthusiasm is there for Sherrill? Because you -- I didn't get a sense of that up there from some of those voters.\n\nBRAZILE: Look, right now, people are not in love with politics. They're not in love with anybody. They're so angry about the affordability crisis.\n\nThat's why I think what the congresswoman is doing and you know, “Drive Down the Cost” bus tour. She's really getting Democrats excited and I do believe that she has a slight chance of winning.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Molly, the other thing that Sherrill is doing is talking about Donald Trump nonstop. That -- she's obviously talking about the economy, a big deal, but Donald Trump, Donald Trump. She's running against Donald Trump.\n\nMOLLY BALL, POLITICAL REPORT AND AUTHOR & FORMER WALL STREET JOURNAL SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Because if there is any enthusiasm in the Democratic base, that is what it is for. It's the millions of people coming out for the “No Kings” protests. It's the people telling pollsters that they're excited to vote in the midterms next year. It's the overwhelming turnout we've seen in the special elections here and there over the past year.\n\nThe enthusiasm in the Democratic base is an anti-Trump enthusiasm. And so, that's what I think you see both Sherrill and Spanberger trying to tap into in order to try to get their base out.\n\nIt is, I think, though, a missed opportunity for both of these women, both of whom are sort of moderate, centrist, establishment Democrats. They've run very safe campaigns. And what they haven't done is really lay down a marker for their vision for the future of the Democratic Party -- a vision that is not the vision of a Zohran Mamdani, a vision that is much more I think they would say sort of unifying and centrist. And they haven't really articulated what that would mean for the party to go in that direction.\n\nRADDATZ: And, Chris, I want to get back to -- to the governor's races in particular. Donald Trump is not going to be out there on the campaign trail, and the base certainly wants to see Donald Trump and pulled out a lot of voters.\n\nWhen you look at the polling and you know how far New Jersey has lurched to the right, talk about that change and how that happened and what they do without a Donald Trump.\n\nCHRISTIE: Look, I think the move to the right in New Jersey was based on two things. One, it was a rejection of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I think they came in arguing that they were going to make the country more civil, more centrist, and in fact, they went very far to the left. And that angered the most important voters in New Jersey, Martha, the independents.\n\nThere are more independents than there are Democrats or Republicans in New Jersey, and you have to play to them. Secondly, it's affordability. And we've heard everybody talking about that, and that's a problem as well. The problem for Republicans is that Trump in New Jersey is anywhere right now from 12 to 15 points underwater.\n\nAnd Jack Ciattarelli has made his association with the president a big part of his campaign. So, those two things are in conflict, right? So what I'd say to you, Martha, is it's winnable for Jack Ciattarelli. Can he go out and mobilize the voters he needs to do it? If he does, he can win; if he doesn't, Mikie Sherrill will win.\n\nRADDATZ: And Molly talked about Mamdani. Donna, when you look at this race on Tuesday, if Mamdani wins, which he is projected to do, and Sherrill and Spanberger win, more moderates, what does that say about where the Democratic Party is and what does it say where you'll be next year with the midterms?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, first of all, in addition to the great city of New York, we have Detroit who will likely elect a female mayor. We also have Cleveland, Miami. So we have lots of elections, also in the state of Pennsylvania with Supreme Court Justice races and of course, California with that big redistricting bill.\n\nI think it is going to say to the Democrats, who have won a lot of special elections this year, that we have to be more organized, more focused, more organic. We have to speak in the now language, not the 20th century language. And if Democrats can engage voters year round, I think Democrats have a chance of coming back in 2026.\n\nCHRISTIE: Martha, can I just say? It will be generational. I think what's going on in New York is less about ideology than it is generational.\n\nBRAZILE: Yeah.\n\nCHRISTIE: In the Democratic primary, you ran, no disrespect to me, a lot of old white guys in the primary against Zohran Mamdani. He stood out in the way he communicated and how he appealed, less about his message I think than about that generational change. And I think Democrats need to look at that.\n\nRADDATZ: And Molly, I want to also talk about this shutdown and what effect that has. Nothing's going to happen until the government opens up again. And you heard everybody this morning, Senator Kaine and Duffy -- Secretary Duffy talk about this. Where is it? Senator Kaine mentioned kind of that there might be some progress.\n\nBALL: Well, the progress is all, as you said to Senator Kaine, it's all among the rank and file. The leaders still are not talking to each other. And nothing, as you know, happens in Congress until the leaders talk to one another. I do hear from my sources on Capitol Hill that they think there's a possibility for a breakthrough after the election on Tuesday. That that might be the impetus for people to try to come together in some way.\n\nBut this has been the strangest shutdown because there is just no urgency there. It's gone on for so long. It's starting to affect people. We see in the polling, Americans are not happy with it. They don't like shutdowns. But it just has not been the sort of consuming story that would light a fire under people. And even in this new polling that we have, we see that the numbers haven't really budged.\n\nPeople blame the Republicans slightly more, but that's not changing. There's no momentum for one side or the other. And so, I just think you have two sides that are so dug in and neither of them really sees any reason to come to the table and resolve it.\n\nBRAZILE: No reason to come --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRADDATZ: Very quickly, Donna, I got 10 seconds.\n\nBRAZILE: I miss the gangs. The Gang of Six, the Gang of Eight. They normally would come in at the last minute and pull things together. We need those gangs to come back, those gangs of leaders.\n\nRADDATZ: And maybe they will, because I think next week will be pretty bad, as Secretary Duffy pointed out, maybe that will be the catalyst. Thanks to all of you.\n\nUp next, President Trump says the U.S. will resume nuclear weapons testing. Senator Ed Markey warns that could lead to a new nuclear arms race. I'll speak with him when we come back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Are you talking about literally resuming underground nuclear detonation tests?\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You'll find out very soon, but we're going to do some testing. Yes. Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to do it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: But can -- you can't clarify whether we'll resume --\n\nTRUMP: I'm not going to say yet. I'm going to know exactly what we're doing, where we're doing it, but other countries are doing it and if other countries do it, we do it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRADDATZ: President Trump on Friday responding to questions about his call for the U.S. to resume nuclear testing.\n\nI'm joined now by Senator Ed Markey. He's the founder of the National Nuclear Freeze Movement and has been working to end proliferation of nuclear weapons since the beginning of his career. And he has introduced legislation to stop renewed nuclear testing.\n\nIt's good to see you this morning, Senator Markey. The president was quite clear midweek that he wants to resume nuclear testing and to keep up with those who are doing it. The U.S. hasn't had a test since '92. North Korea was the last to test a nuclear weapon in 2017.\n\nWhat do you think he's talking about, and what will happen?\n\nSEN. ED MARKEY (D-MA): Well, first, he's wrong. Other countries are not engaging in nuclear testing. The Russians, the Chinese, they have not tested since at least 1996, when the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was put into effect. And it would be a gift to China, it would be a gift to Russia. Chinese have only tested 45 times. We've tested more than a thousand times. So it would give them an ability to catch up to us with the sophistication of their nuclear weapons technology.\n\nWhat I think he's responding to is the announcement by Putin that they are testing missile delivery systems for nuclear bombs. That's a different subject altogether. And the reason that Russia, the reason that China is developing new missile delivery systems is that the United States pulled out of the anti-ballistic missile system. It is because Donald Trump has announced that he is going to deploy a golden dome over our country.\n\nThousands of satellites with interceptors on them to knock down incoming Russian or Chinese missiles, with nuclear bombs on them. And that has led those countries to develop more and more sophisticated nuclear missiles to circumvent the boondoggle, which will be the golden dome, which our own experts say will not work. It will be a golden sieve, which will allow ultimately for enough nuclear weapons to penetrate it to destroy cities across our country and kill at least 100 million people.\n\nSo Donald Trump and Trumpatomics is going to make our country less safe, it's going to make the world less dangerous, and the only way to avoid it is to go to a negotiating table, for Donald Trump to accept the invitation from Putin, to extend the New START Treaty which expires in 100 days, and to then put all of these other weapons systems, offensive and defensive, on the table for negotiations. And that's the only way we're going to make our country and the world safer.\n\nRADDATZ: And Senator Markey, on the show last week, we talked about a new film called \"A House of Dynamite\" by Director Kathryn Bigelow, depicts what might happen if a nuclear missile came to the U.S. was launched toward the U.S.\n\nAnd there's a line in the movie that says, it's a coin toss, whether we could intercept it. The Pentagon apparently has some problems with that, saying we've been a hundred percent successful in a memo that was leaked to Bloomberg. Your response to that quickly, if you can.\n\nMARKEY: That's inaccurate. Our own missile defense system, our own missile defense agency says that we're only effective 50 percent of the time and that's in ideal conditions. That's not with decoys, that's not with other means that would try to misdirect our interceptors from knocking down incoming missiles with nuclear warheads on them. So that's completely erroneous.\n\nWhat the movie says -- what the movie \"House of Dynamite\" is giving us as a Cassandra-like warning is that defense systems do not work against offensive weapons with nuclear warheads on those delivery systems. And the only way to avoid that catastrophic moment, that Armageddon-like moment is to sit down at the negotiating table in order to get agreements with other countries on a verifiable basis to make sure that we do not make the world more dangerous.\n\nThat's what Donald Trump's Golden Dome is doing. That's what the United States' pulling out of the ABM Treaty has done.\n\nRADDATZ: Senator, I'm going to have to stop you there, but we appreciate your time this morning. Thank you. We'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nRADDATZ: And thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us.

Mikie Sherrill in her campaign for the governorship. \"I heard Barack Obama was gonna be here. And I love Barack Obama, so I really came out here for that,\" one voter, Alexis from South Jersey, told Fox Digital. \"But I do support Mikie, as well.\" \"I want to hear Obama,\" Robert, from Spring Lake, told Fox Digital. \"I think a lot of people want to hear Obama. Wouldn't it be great to have a message of hope at this point in time?\" Hundreds of supporters wrapped around multiple blocks surrounding the Essex County College's gymnasium on Saturday to hear from Obama and Sherrill as the New Jersey election comes down to its final days. The packed auditorium hit capacity before the \"Get Out the Vote\" rally officially kicked off, with supporters also watching the rally from an overflow parking lot. SHERRILL INSISTS NJ A DEM STRONGHOLD AHEAD OF OBAMA VISIT, REJECTING GOP MOMENTUM: 'NOT A PURPLE STATE' Prominent rally speakers and attendees alike celebrated hearing from Obama on Saturday, but also repeatedly spoke about President Donald Trump, slamming him for efforts to deport illegal aliens, and pinning blame for the ongoing federal government shutdown on Trump and Republicans. A handful of voters who spoke to Fox Digital relayed that their ballot was not one solely focused on Sherrill, but also a vote against Trump and his administration. \"Well, the top issue is Trump,\" said Robert from Spring Lake. \"There's nothing else other than that. … Trump is absolutely the worst,\" he added, citing that Trump is allegedly \"anti-science\" and against education. \"To get Trump out of office, number one\" one female voter from South Jersey told Fox Digital of why she came out to the rally and her top voting concerns this election. \"I am voting for Mikie Sherrill because she actually understands all the people. She is not a minion for Trump,\" another South Jersey voter added. CLIFF-HANGER: CIATTARELLI, SHERRILL CLAIM UPPER HAND IN CRUCIAL NEW JERSEY SHOWDOWN FOR GOVERNOR Obama also leaned into slamming Trump during his remarks to the crowd, claiming the current economy has benefited \"Trump's billionaire friends,\" while \"ordinary families\" pay increased prices at check-out lines due to Trump's \"shambolic tariff policy.\" \"Let's face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,\" Obama told the audience on Saturday. \"It's hard to know where to start, because every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and carelessness and mean spiritedness. And just plain old craziness.\" Comments targeting Trump and his administration extended to attacks on Ciattarelli, as well, with Obama casting him as the president's toady and a \"suck up\" to the Republican Party. Trump made inroads with New Jersey voters just a year ago, in his decisive general election win over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump cut his 2020 loss from 16 points in the Garden State to six in 2024, and flipped five counties to the GOP, invigorating Republicans in the state to keep the momentum going as GOP gubernatorial candidate Ciattarelli launched his bid for Drumthwacket. \"Please go out and vote,\" Irvington Councilwoman Charnette Frederic told Fox Digital. \"And I'm hoping Obama is the last push to remind you.\" WITH LEGACY ON THE LINE, OBAMA HITTING CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO BOOST DEMOCRATS IN KEY GOVERNOR ELECTIONS Frederic has served as an Irvington councilwoman since 2012, and said that Obama's presence in the state for past campaign rallies spurred an influx of voters, remarking she's hopeful the same will unfold ahead of Tuesday. \"I am an immigrant, and I believe in treating people with respect and dignity,\" Frederic said. \"Whatever I'm seeing right now, this is not the kind of opportunity that we want for our people,\" adding that Sherrill will \"stand for the people\" against the White House's stances on immigration and other policies. Sherrill, DNC chair Ken Martin, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and other local Democrats took the stage of the auditorium to rally support for Sherrill, while also criticizing the Trump administration as top voter concern. NEW JERSEY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR HOPEFUL ATTENDS 'NO KINGS' PROTEST, VOWS TO FIGHT TRUMP 'TOOTH AND NAIL' \"But my fight doesn't and can't end at the border of New Jersey. We've got to take on all those hits coming from Trump and Washington, D.C. Because right now the president is running a worldwide extortion racket.

What pollsters are saying","text":"During a time of deep polarization and partisan division, the share of voters up for grabs may seem to be shrinking, but several pollsters who spoke with ABC News identified groups that could still tip 2026's consequential midterm elections.\n\nHispanic voters\n\nPresident Donald Trump made notable headway among Hispanic voters in 2024, particularly with promises on the economy. Now, with soaring inflation and skyrocketing prices, pollsters said the economy is the very issue that could pull these voters back.\n\nChristine Matthews, a pollster for former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, told ABC News that young Hispanic men will be \"really critical\" in 2026 -- a group Trump won last year by 10 points -- as they represent \"strong economic cost-of-living voters.\"\n\nTrump won 48% of Latino voters in 2024 -- nearly as many voters as Vice President Kamala Harris. The large Latino populations of Arizona and Nevada particularly played an outsized role in boosting Trump to victory and helping him secure these critical swing states.\n\nJennifer Benz, deputy director of the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, referenced immigration as another factor that might bring Hispanic voters back to the fringes. Much of their dissatisfaction stems from the immigration tactics being implemented, she said, even if voters are aligned with the president's views at a higher level.\n\nBlack voters\n\nWhile Black voters remain predominantly Democratic, their support for Trump nearly doubled in 2024. Black voters were likely influenced by the economy as well, according to Ashley Konig, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.\n\nYet Trump's economic promises appear to be falling short, with the Black unemployment rate climbing to 7.5% this year, its highest point since October 2021.\n\nMatthews referenced a \"notable [swing] among younger Black men\" toward Trump in 2024 -- a group that has been drifting away from the Democratic party since 2020. The way the economy shakes out over the next year is likely to influence their voting decisions, she said, similar to young Hispanic men.\n\nMarcus James, a 43-year-old from Alabama, told ABC News that he \"totally regret[s]\" voting for Trump in 2016, pointing to his identity as a Black man and criticizing the administration for their treatment of minorities.\n\n\"The big question leading into 2026 is, will those same inroads that [Trump] made in '24 carry over? Or will Democrats be able to win back their near-unanimous support among Black voters and their majority support among Hispanic voters?\" Konig said.\n\nSome voters could swing in the direction of not voting at all, with Lake pointing to a swath of reliably blue voters who sat out in 2024 due to disillusionment with both parties.\n\n\"They're sick of voting for the lesser two evils,\" Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who worked on former President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign, told ABC News. \"They're very anti-Trump. On the other hand, they want to see more of an alternative from the Democrats.\"\n\nLovette Howard, a former Democrat who voted for Harris in 2024, told ABC News that she is undecided in 2025 because she says both parties are not \"listening to what the taxpayers are saying,\" citing concerns over the economy and halts to SNAP benefits, among others.\n\nSome of these apathetic voters are even considering third-party ballots, with James telling ABC News that he voted for Independent candidates in the past two presidential races and will likely do so in 2026.\n\nAnd without Trump at the top of the ticket, corralling voters to the polls is expected to present a struggle for the GOP as well. In fact, the Republican State Leadership Committee recognized itself as \"the party of low-propensity voters,\" launching initiatives to combat midterm drop-off.\n\n'Weighted vest women\n\nAfter observing women in her neighborhood wearing weighted vests, Matthews conducted a national poll in which she discovered that such vests were common among educated, affluent, suburban white women with children.\n\nInterestingly, Matthews discovered that these women were perfectly politically split.\n\n\"This is a group of voters who report in '24 that -- just by a small margin -- that they had sort of been leaning towards Trump, but now they're split on the generic ballot,\" Matthews told ABC, nicknaming them \"weighted vest women.\"\n\nBecause these women are \"prolific consumers\" of politics and news, Matthews expects them to be a \"high-turnout cohort in an off-year election.\"\n\nThey are among the larger demographic of suburban white women, a constituency with blended political beliefs and physically located between urban and rural areas, she said.\n\nYoung voters\n\nWhile youth turnout is traditionally low during midterms, Lake notes that they are an \"increasingly higher proportion of the electorate\" and therefore a \"very important swing group.\"\n\n\"Young people are moving back pretty dramatically toward the Democrats,\" she said, before pointing out the growing gender and education gap.\n\nBill Galston, senior fellow of Governance Studies at the Brookings Institute, explained how youth discontent could prompt a Democratic \"protest vote,\" while the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk -- who is credited with galvanizing young conservatives -- might serve as a GOP \"rallying cry for voter participation.\"","summary":"Pollsters are tracking key swing groups that could tip the 2026 midterms.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/midterm-2026-swing-voters-play-pollsters/story?id=126900470","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6a2d65f9-e740-43be-a7b8-37f11956d1ed/voting-01-gty-jef-251029_1761747722934_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 11:04:27","author":"Emily Chang","authors":["Emily Chang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":375000904,"title":"Barabak: Payback? Power grab? Proposition 50 is California's political ink-blot test","text":"When it comes to Proposition 50, Marcia Owens is a bit fuzzy on the details. She knows, vaguely, it has something to do with how California draws the boundaries for its 52 congressional districts, a convoluted and arcane process that's not exactly top of the mind for your average person. But Owens is abundantly clear when it comes to her intent in Tuesday's special election. \"I'm voting to take power out of Trump's hands and put it back in the hands of the people,\" said Owens, 48, a vocational nurse in Riverside. \"He's making a lot of illogical decisions that are really wreaking havoc on our country. He's not putting our interests first, making sure that an individual has food on the table, they can pay their rent, pay electric bills, pay for healthcare.\" Peter Arensburger, a fellow Democrat who also lives in Riverside, was blunter still. President Trump, said the 55-year-old college professor, \"is trying to rule as a dictator\" and Republicans are doing absolutely nothing to stop him. So, Arensburger said, California voters will do it for them. Or at least try. \"It's a false equivalency,\" he said, \"to say that we need to do everything on an even keel in California, but Texas\" — which redrew its political map to boost Republicans — \"can do whatever they want.\" Proposition 50, which aims to deliver Democrats at least five more House seats in the 2026 midterm election, is either righteous payback or a grubby power grab. A reasoned attempt to even things out in response to Texas' attempt to nab five more congressional seats. Or a ruthless gambit to drive the California GOP to near-extinction. It all depends on your perspective. Above all, Proposition 50 has become a political ink-blot test; what many California voters see depends on, politically, where they stand. Mary Ann Rounsavall thinks the measure is \"horrible,\" because that's how the Fontana retiree feels about its chief proponent, Gavin Newsom. \"He's a jerk,\" the 75-year-old Republican fairly spat, as if the act of forming the governor's name left a bad taste in her mouth. \"No one believes anything he says.\" Timothy, a fellow Republican who withheld his last name to avoid online trolls, echoed the sentiment. \"It's just Gavin Newsom playing political games,\" said the 39-year-old warehouse manager, who commutes from West Covina to his job at a plumbing supplier in Ontario. \"They always talk about Trump. 'Trump, Trump, Trump.' Get off of Trump. I've been hearing this crap ever since he started running.\" Riverside and San Bernardino counties form the heart of the Inland Empire. The next-door neighbors are politically purple: more Republican than the state as a whole, but not as conservative as California's more rural reaches. That means neither party has an upper hand, a parity reflected in dozens of interviews with voters across the sprawling region. On a recent smoggy morning, the hulking San Bernardino Mountains veiled by a gray-brown haze, Eric Lawson paused to offer his thoughts. The 66-year-old independent has no use for politicians of any stripe. \"They're all crooks,\" he said. \"All of them.\" Lawson called Proposition 50 a waste of time and money. Gerrymandering — the dark art of drawing political lines to benefit one party over another — is, as he pointed out, hardly new. (In fact, the term is rooted in the name of Elbridge Gerry, one of the nation's founders.) What has Lawson particularly steamed is the cost of \"this stupid election,\" which is pushing $300 million. \"We talk and talk and talk and we print money for all this talk,\" said Lawson, who lives in Ontario and consults in the auto industry. \"But that money doesn't go where it's supposed to go.\" Although sentiments were evenly split in those several dozen conversations, all indications suggest that Proposition 50 is headed toward passage Tuesday, possibly by a wide margin. After raising a tidal wave of cash, Newsom last week told small donors that's enough, thanks. The opposition has all but given up and resigned itself to defeat. It comes down to math. Proposition 50 has become a test of party muscle and a talisman of partisan faith and California has a lot more Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents than Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Andrea Fisher, who opposes the initiative, is well aware of that fact. \"I'm a conservative,\" she said, \"in a state that's not very conservative.\" She has come to accept that reality, but fears things will get worse if Democrats have their way and slash California's already-scanty Republican ranks on Capitol Hill. Among those targeted for ouster is Ken Calvert, a 16-term GOP incumbent who represents a good slice of Riverside County. \"I feel like it's going to eliminate my voice,\" said Fisher, 48, a food server at her daughter's school in Riverside. \"If I'm 40% of the vote\" — roughly the percentage Trump received statewide in 2024 — \"then we in that population should have fair representation. We're still their constituents.\" (In Riverside County, Trump edged Kamala Harris 49% to 48%.) Amber Pelland, 46, who works in the nonprofit field in Corona, feels by \"sticking it to Trump\" — a tagline in one of the TV ads supporting Proposition 50 — voters will be sticking it to themselves. Passage would erase the political map drawn by an independent commission, which voters empowered in 2010 for the express purpose of wrestling redistricting away from self-dealing lawmakers in Washington and Sacramento. \"I don't care if you hate the person or don't hate the person,\" said Pelland, a Republican who backs the president. \"It's just going to hurt voters by taking the power away from the people.\" Even some backers of Proposition 50 flinched at the notion of sidelining the redistricting commission and undoing its painstaking, nonpartisan work. What helps make it palatable, they said, is the requirement — written into the ballot measure — that congressional redistricting will revert to the commission after the 2030 census, when California's next set of congressional maps is due to be drafted. \"I'm glad that it's temporary because I don't think redistricting should be done in order to give one political party greater power over another,\" said Carole, a Riverside Democrat. \"I think it's something that should be decided over a long period and not in a rush.\" (She also withheld her last name so her husband, who serves in the community, wouldn't be hassled for her opinion, she said.) Texas, Carole suggested, has forced California to act because of its extreme action, redistricting at mid-decade at Trump's command. \"It's important to think about the country as a whole,\" said the 51-year-old academic researcher, \"and to respond to what's being done, especially with the pressure coming from the White House.\" Felise Self-Visnic, a 71-year-old retired schoolteacher, agreed. She was shopping at a Trader Joe's in Riverside in an orange ball cap that read \"Human-Kind (Be Both).\" Back home, in her garage-door window, is a poster that reads \"No Kings.\" She described Proposition 50 as a stopgap measure that will return power to the commission once the urgency of today's political upheaval has passed. But even if that wasn't the case, the Democrat said, she would still vote in favor. \"Anything,\" Self-Visnic said, \"to fight fascism, which is where we're heading.\"","summary":"Where California voters stand on the state's redistricting measure depends where, politically, many of them sit. In the Inland Empire, opinion appears divided even as the measure seems headed to approval.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-11-02/redistricting-california-proposition-50-voter-voices-inland-empire","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8ce2089/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9d%2F7a%2F325d40e147c18675358b85e25fa1%2F1527761-me-barabak-pr","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 11:00:00","author":"Mark Z.

Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.\n\nNot to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.\n\nYet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.\n\nNow, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News. \n\nOne of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted. \n\n\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.\n\nOn June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views. \n\nThe salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views. \n\nThe mocking never let up. \n\n'Newsom Derangement Syndrome'\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham. \n\nSince then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.\n\nOne of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign. \n\nNewsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature. \n\nA key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"\n\n'It feels very unrestrained'\n\n\"When we see democracy hanging by a thread, we have to take risks. It feels very unrestrained, that's the kind of energy that I think Democrats need,\" said Butler, now a digital strategist and co-founder at Luminary Strategies. \n\n\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.\n\nWhen Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space. His interview with Charlie Kirk, for instance, has 1.3 million YouTube views. \n\n\"When we go low, or when they go low, we go high, doesn't work when they're trying to pull the rug out completely from under us,\" said Olivia Julianna, a Gen-Z digital strategist and activist who spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Julianna was outraged with Newsom at the start of the year, in part due to his right-wing podcast guests, but she now considers herself a huge fan -- she's even bought his merch. \n\n\"I did not take Gavin Newsom seriously until he made it clear that he was ready to take action,\" Julianna added.\n\n'Holding a mirror to the clown show'\n\nNewsom's longtime speechwriter and former deputy chief of staff Jason Eliott described the online mockery as a strategy of \"holding up a mirror to the clown show that is the Trump administration. We're not doing anything differently than what they are doing.\" \n\nElliott said the buzz around Newsom's posts creates space for the \"actual substantive work,\" like Proposition 50, the ballot initiative that, if approved by voters on Tuesday, will temporarily adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially flipping five existing Republican seats in the midterms. Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters. \n\n\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said. \n\nNewsom, in a recent interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, concurred. \n\n\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.\n\n\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained. \n\nJohn Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know who he is.

From gold-rimmed plates on gold-patterned tablecloths decorated with gold candlestick holders, they gorged on heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice-cream.\n\nOn 15 October, Donald Trump welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies for a dinner at the White House to reward them for their pledged contributions to a vast new ballroom now expected to cost $300m. That the federal government had shut down two weeks earlier scarcely seemed to matter.\n\nBut two weeks later, the shutdown is starting to bite – and throw Trump’s architectural folly into sharp relief. On Saturday, with Congress still locked in a legislative stalemate, a potential benefit freeze could leave tens of millions of low-income Americans without food aid. Democrats accuse Trump’s Republican party of “weaponising hunger” to pursue an extreme rightwing agenda.\n\nImages of wealthy monarchs or autocrats revelling in excess even as the masses struggle for bread are more commonly associated with the likes of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette of France, who spent lavishly at the court of Versailles, or Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos of the Philippines, who siphoned off billions while citizens endured deepening poverty.\n\nBut now America has a jarring split-screen of its own, between an oligarch president bringing a Midas touch to the White House and families going hungry, workers losing pay and government services on the brink of collapse.\n\n“Are you fucking kidding me?” exclaimed Kamala Harris, the former vice-president, during an interview on Jon Stewart’s Comedy Central podcast The Weekly Show. “This guy wants to create a ballroom for his rich friends while completely turning a blind eye to the fact that babies are going to starve when the Snap benefits end in just hours from now.”\n\nFor years Trump has cultivated the image of a “blue-collar billionaire” and, in last year’s presidential election, he beat Harris by 14 percentage points among non-college-educated voters – double his margin in 2016.\n\nYet he grew up in an affluent neighbourhood of Queens, New York, and joined the family business as a property developer, receiving a $1m loan from his father for projects in Manhattan. He attached his name to luxury hotels and golf clubs and achieved celebrity through the New York tabloids and as host of the reality TV show The Apprentice.\n\nAs a politician, however, Trump has successfully branded himself as the voice of the left-behinds in towns hollowed out by industrialisation. His formula includes tapping into grievance, particularly white grievance, and into “Make America Great Again” nostalgia . His speeches are peppered with aspirational promises that his policies will guarantee his supporters a share of the nation’s wealth.\n\nThis has apparently given him leeway with Trump voters who, despite their own struggles, turned a blind eye to the largesse of his first term and how it might benefit his family. But it was clear from his inauguration in January – when he was surrounded by the tech titans Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg – that part two would be different.\n\nTrump has made a personal profit of more than $1.8bn over the past year, according to a new financial tracker run by the Center for American Progress thinktank, which says the lion’s share came from launching his own crypto ventures while aggressively deregulating the industry. Other sources of income include gifts, legal settlements and income from a $40m Amazon documentary about the first lady, Melania Trump.\n\nThere have been brazen “let them eat cake” moments. In May, Trump said he would accept a $400m luxury plane from Qatar and use it as Air Force One despite concerns that it could violate the US constitution’s emoluments clause. In October, it was reported he was demanding the justice department pay him about $230m in compensation over federal investigations he faced that he claims were politically motivated.\n\nLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “There is a glaring gap between the life of Donald Trump, which is gold-plated and luxurious, and the life of so many Americans who are now being hit by the government shutdown.\n\n“You have to go back in history to examples in the 1920s or the Gilded Age in the late 19th century to find this kind of opulence that’s not just going on but being advertised. That goes along with all the other efforts to enrich Donald Trump and his family and his friends. It’s a shocking display of the use of public power for private gain.”\n\nIt is hard to imagine a more resonant symbol than the ballroom. Last month, Trump left presidential historians and former White House staff aghast by demolishing the East Wing without seeking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which vets the construction of federal buildings. He also fired all six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent agency that had expected to review the project.\n\nHe claimed the destruction was a necessary step towards building a long-needed ballroom which, at 90,000 sq ft, would be big enough to hold an inauguration and dwarf the executive mansion itself. It will be funded not by the taxpayer but the new masters of the universe.\n\nAmong the companies represented at the 15 October dinner were Amazon, Apple, Booz Allen Hamilton, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, Lockheed Martin, Meta Platforms and T-Mobile. The Adelson Family Foundation, founded by the Republican mega-donors Miriam Adelson and her late husband Sheldon, also had a presence.\n\nThe oil billionaire Harold Hamm, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, and crypto entrepreneur twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss – who were portrayed by the actor Armie Hammer in the film The Social Network – were all on the guest list.\n\nEthics watchdogs condemned the dinner as a blatant case of selling access to the president with the potential for influence peddling and other forms of corruption. Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, said: “It’s par for the course for Donald Trump. Millionaires and billionaires wine with him and dine with him and everything is fine with him. There’s a cost and there’s consequences.\n\n“They’re not donating this money because it’s a nice thing to do. Certainly there’s some sort of benefit to them and it could be the largest wealth transfer in American history with the big ugly bill [the Working Families Tax Cut Act] just a few months ago.”\n\nThat legislation delivers tax cuts for the rich while reducing food assistance and making health insurance more expensive for working families. The mood is only likely to darken as the second-longest government shutdown in history threatens to rip the social safety net away from millions of people. John Thune, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, warned on Wednesday: “It’s going to get ugly fast.”\n\nA number of essential public services are approaching the end of their available funds, a situation likely to be felt directly in households, schools and airports from this weekend.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, is set to lapse for 42 million people, raising the spectre of long queues at food banks. On Friday, two federal judges ruled that the Trump administration must continue to fund the programme with contingency funds. But the decisions are likely to face appeals. It was also unclear how soon the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded.\n\nSchemes that provide early years’ education for low-income families and subsidised air travel to remote communities are also set to run aground. At the same time, thousands of federal employees will soon miss their first full paychecks since the shutdown began, raising the prospect of staffing shortages in areas such as airport security and air traffic control.\n\nThe timing is awkward because Saturday also marks the start of open enrolment for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act. Premiums are expected to soar, reflecting insurers’ doubts that Congress will renew enhanced tax credits before they lapse at year’s end – one of the key points of contention in the current standoff.\n\nTrump can often appear immune to political crises. But in a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos opinion poll released on Thursday, only 28% of Americans say they support the ballroom project, compared with 56% who oppose it. The same survey found that 45% blame Trump and Republicans for the government shutdown while 33% hold Democrats responsible. Notably, independents blame Trump and Republicans by a 2-1 margin – handing Democrats an opportunity.\n\nJohn Zogby, an author and pollster, said: “For the first time in a while, they have an opening with rural voters. Medicaid and Snap are infrastructural necessities in the poorest counties. Without programmes like this being funded, you’re not just talking about hurting poor people or rural people who are invisible; you’re talking about shutting down hospitals and clinics, and that matters to people. Democrats should be fanning out in rural areas and people should be telling their stories.”\n\nIt is safe to assume that, had Barack Obama or Joe Biden built a ballroom during the crippling austerity of a government shutdown, Republicans and rightwing media would have gone scorched-earth against them. Trump’s ostentatious display of wealth and cronyism comes against a backdrop of widening social and economic inequality. Democrats, however, are often accused of lacking a killer instinct.\n\nJoe Walsh, a former Republican representative aligned with the conservative Tea Party who four months ago became a Democrat, said: “Democrats don’t know how to fight and I can see they’re already squirming on this ballroom issue. We’ve got a guy in the White House who every day is taking a blowtorch to this country and most Democrats don’t understand the moment. He ploughs ahead and tears down the East Wing because he knows he can get away with it.”\n\nWalsh believes that the next Democratic president should commit to demolishing Trump’s ballroom. “This is somebody who’s a tyrant who believes he can ignore all laws, rules, norms and processes,” he added. “You have to draw the line on that. No, he cannot unilaterally demolish the East Wing and build a big old ballroom. This guy has no clue what America is. We don’t have palaces in America.”","summary":"Schmoozing the super-rich to fund a $300m ballroom while cutting food aid for those on low incomes threw the president’s architectural folly into sharp relief\n\nIt was a feast fit for a king – and any billionaire willing to be his subject.

Harris said she couldn’t think of anything.\n\nThat shouldn’t be a destructive question. It’s an obvious question, even if the answer was exploitable.\n\nABC’s “Good Morning America” was no better. Co-host Michael Strahan tiptoed in with Democrat concerns: “There’s some Democrats who said that you don’t take enough responsibility for the loss. How do you respond to that?”\n\nMSNBC’s Rachel Maddow gushed over Kamala as the “patron saint of I Told You So,” and let her subject compare Trump to a communist dictator.\n\nAll these Americans looked dreadful when the Kamala Harris book tour went international. BBC interviewer Laura Kuenssberg noticed Harris said, “I’m not done,” suggesting another presidential run. She warned: “But when you look at the bookies’ odds, they put you, as an outsider, even behind Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson.” Harris claimed she’s never “listened to polls.”\n\nKuenssberg also went after Biden’s cognitive decline: “You write that President Biden didn’t raise his frailty with you, and you write that you didn’t really raise it with him. That’s extraordinary to read in your account.” Harris claimed she didn’t doubt his capacity to serve as president, but he lacked the capacity to run for reelection.\n\nThe BBC anchor was gobsmacked: “Isn’t it a strange message to the public to say, you know, what you need to be tougher and more able to run a political campaign than actually to be the person behind the desk in the Oval Office?”\n\nThen came Australia’s ABC. Interviewer Sarah Ferguson also pressed on the decline question: “Didn’t you also have a responsibility? You were one of the people in the room. … Didn’t you have a responsibility as an American to step up and say something at that point?”\n\nHarris insisted: “I did not question Joe Biden’s capacity to be president at all.”\n\nFerguson blamed Biden: “Wasn’t his refusal to recognize his own frailties the reason that you faced a nearly impossible task?”\n\nWhen Harris shifted to saying Trump was the real challenge, Ferguson called her out: “I want to interrupt you because that is a world-class pivot, but it is not the question that I asked you, which is about Joe Biden’s failure to recognize his own frailties and what that did to you. The question is about Joe Biden. Are you still reluctant to criticize the former president?”\n\nHarris answered: “In what regard, please?” Ferguson restated her thesis that Biden damaged her chances. Harris repeated: “He was not frail as President of the United States.”\n\nThis was about as accurate as comparing Trump to a communist dictator.

U razgovoru za britanski Guardian, glumac je poručio da ga američki predsjednik ‘plaši do srži’ te ga nazvao ‘instrumentom pohlepe i statusa quo’.\n\nUoči dodjele nagrade za vodstvo u očuvanju okoliša u Field Museumu u Chicagu, Harrison Ford je u intervjuu iznio niz oštrih riječi na račun Donalda Trumpa i njegove politike prema klimatskim pitanjima.\n\n‘Trump nema politike, ima samo hir. To me užasno plaši. Neznanje, oholost, laži, prevara… On zna bolje, ali je oruđe postojećeg poretka i zarađuje dok svijet propada. Ne mogu se sjetiti većeg zločinca u historiji’, izjavio je 82-godišnji glumac, prenosi tportal.hr.\n\nTrump je prošlog mjeseca u govoru pred Ujedinjenim narodima klimatske promjene nazvao ‘najvećom prevarom u historiji’, dodavši da će ‘svaka zemlja koja ne napusti tu zelenu prevaru propasti’. Njegova administracija tokom mandata sistemski je ukidala propise o čistom zraku, obustavila projekte obnovljive energije, poticala na bušenje novih naftnih polja te zabranjivala spominjanje pojmova ‘klimatske promjene’ i ‘emisije’ u vladinim dokumentima.\n\nFord, koji je već desetljećima aktivan u ekološkim inicijativama, istakao je da ga takva politika ne iznenađuje: ‘O ovome govorim već 30 godina. Sve što smo predvidjeli o klimatskim promjenama – dogodilo se. Zašto to ljudima nije dovoljno da promijene ponašanje? Zbog ukorijenjenog statusa quo.’\n\nUprkos svemu, glumac zadržava dozu optimizma: ‘Vjerujem da još imamo vremena da promijenimo ponašanje, razvijemo nove tehnologije i provedemo održive politike. Ljudi su nevjerovatno prilagodljivi i domišljati. Kad se usredotočimo na problem, najčešće ga uspijemo riješiti.’\n\nFord nije prvi put kritikovao Trumpa. Još 2024. otvoreno je podržao tadašnju demokratsku kandidatkinju Kamalu Harris na predsjedničkim izborima. U video poruci objavljenoj na X-u poručio je: ‘Kamala Harris će štititi vaše pravo da se s njom ne slažete, ali će raditi za sve Amerikance. Drugi tip traži slijepu odanost i govori o osveti. Imam jedan glas kao i svi drugi, i iskoristit ću ga da idemo naprijed.’\n\nNa kraju je dodao: ‘Trump je četiri godine proveo okrećući nas jedne protiv drugih i ulagujući se diktatorima. To nije Amerika kakvu poznajem. Ne moramo je ponovo učiniti velikom – već jesmo, ali moramo ponovo naučiti raditi zajedno.’\n\n(24sata.info)","summary":"Hollywoodska legenda Harrison Ford ponovo je oštro kritikovao Donalda Trumpa zbog njegovog negiranja klimatskih promjena i ukidanja ekoloških politika.

Between the two dozen photos of his newly refurbished guest polished marble toilet he posted on social media, the very talented women who danced around tables at his lavish Gatsby-themed Halloween Party or all the golf he'll play across the rest of the weekend, we're not sure which is the worst look while hundreds of thousands of Americans are about to lose their food assistance vouchers. Meanwhile in Trumpworld Here's everything you need to know... Donald Trump will appear on CBS' 60 Minutes on Sunday evening - marking his first return to the flagship current affairs programme since he sued it for $16 million over his nonsense claim the show had helpfully edited an interview with Kamala Harris. CBS settled the suit because they had business going before the FCC, and have since installed a new editor in chief for their division: Bari Weiss, a former conservative think tanker. Trump is slowly making his way through the hosts of Late Night comedy shows, trying his luck at unseating them. Stephen Colbert, host of CBS' The Late Show fell first - and despite still being on air until the end of his contract, those days are numbered. Last month saw Jimmy Kimmel briefly taken off ABC, before returning (with a helpful bump in ratings). And last night the subject of his ire is Seth Meyers, host of NBC's Late Night. Not a household name outside of the States, Meyers was head writer and a performer at Saturday Night Live for years before graduating to host the talk show in 2014. Trump has decided he doesn't like him. And also that Meyers is so mean to him on air that it might be illegal. \"Seth Meyers of NBC may be the least talented person to \"perform\" live in the history of television. In fact, he may be the WORST to perform, live or otherwise,\" he said. After catching the late-night show for the first time in \"years\" the other night, Trump moaned that Meyers had \"talked endlessly\" ...about his weird complaints about electric catapults on aircraft carriers. In one of the least self-aware moments in internet history, Trump complained of Meyers: \"On and on he went, a truly deranged lunatic.\" He went on to say: \"NO TALENT, NO RATINGS, 100% ANTI TRUMP, WHICH IS PROBABLY ILLEGAL!!!\" For clarity, it is not illegal to bang on about electric catapults for much longer than necessary, otherwise Trump would have been locked up long ago. Trump indicated on Truth Social that he had told \"secretary of war\" Pete Hegseth to be prepared to invade Nigeria. \"If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the USA will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria,\" he wrote. \"...and may very well go into that disgraced country \"guns-a-blazing\" to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\" He said he'd told Hegseth to \"prepare for action\" - and said the Nigerian Government had \"BETTER MOVE FAST\". The warning came after Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country “a country of particular concern” for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians. In a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality. “Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,” Tinubu said. “Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.” A troubling update from that 'Republicans only' briefing given to members of congress justifying the White House's deadly targeting of boats inn the seas surrounding Venezuela. Turns out the rationale for who gets targeted is even looser than feared. Officials said they reserved the right to kill people who are \"affiliated\" with a proscribed list of \"narco-terror groups\" without due process - which is a different thing from people being \"members of\" or \"working for\" said groups. There's topical costumes, and then there's constructing the entire White House complex, complete with half-demolished East Wing in the space of about a week. Bravo. Donald Trump hosted a wild, Gatsby-esque Halloween bash at Mar a Lago on Friday night. To give you an idea of the vibes, this lady reclining in a giant martini glass was part of the entertainment for the evening. Some 700,000 Americans are already starting to miss paycheques because of the shutdown, and within days the poorest of them will start to miss food assistance benefit payments through the SNAP programme. Meanwhile, Trump and his buddies - he sat next to Marco Rubio at the bash - dined on fine cuisine and booze, while women in revealing outfits danced for their amusement. Elsewhere, MAGA's costume game was definitely on point, if that point is to be as horrendous and racist as you possibly can. Take for example MAGA Congresswoman Lauren Boebert's effort. Classy.","summary":"For a man so obsessed with how things look, Donald Trump is very bad at optics - he held a very crass Halloween party at the same time as hundreds of thousands of Americans are losing their food stamps - and now he's threatening to invade Nigeria","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mikey-smith-8-unhinged-donald-36175811","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36175816.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_President-Trump-Spends-Weekend-At-Mar-A-Lago-Estate-In-Palm-Beach.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 07:02:56","author":"Mikey Smith","authors":["Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":374916990,"title":"Obama calls Mamdani, praises campaign ahead of New York mayoral election","text":"NEW YORK: Former Democratic President Barack Obama called New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani Saturday and offered to be a “sounding board” if the 34-year-old frontrunner wins the election.

We’re seeing the first signs of the battle over Trump's succession | Simon Tisdall","text":"Millions of Americans yearn for 7 November 2028, the scheduled date of the next presidential election. That’s the day the Trump era effectively ends. Probably. That’s the day the Democrats will atone for Kamala Harris’s calamitous 2024 failure. Possibly. That’s the day US democracy is reborn. Hopefully. Succession talk is tantalising Washington. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, has given the clearest sign yet that he’ll run and glossing over past blunders, Harris reckons she deserves a second chance.\n\nYet most attention is focused on the Republicans, after Trump, 79, again threatened to defy the constitution and seek a third term. “I would love to do it,” he said this week. He rowed back later, albeit unconvincingly. “We’ll see what happens,” he teased. This undignified narcissist’s electoral fan dance will drag on interminably. Of greater practical interest are the two names Trump picked out as his most likely successors: JD Vance and Marco Rubio, vice-president and secretary of state respectively.\n\nTrump predicted a two-horse race for the 2028 Republican nomination – although his favourites frequently fall, as Mike Pence, Rex Tillerson, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton and many others can testify. Nor are Trump’s opinions much shared beyond his base. Vance and Rubio have already shown themselves to be unsuited to high office. Yet as matters stand, the possibility one of these mediocre chancers will assume Maga’s mantle and seize the crown must be taken seriously.\n\nIt’s a choice between a pit bull and a poodle. Aggressive, noisy, nasty and occasionally jaw-droppingly ignorant, JD Vance, 41, is the bro to beat, the heir apparent and dauphin to King Don. He leads by huge margins in early polling in Republican primary states. His language is vulgar, his views simplistic. When it was suggested the US’s extrajudicial killing of alleged drug smugglers could be a war crime, he wrote on X: “I don’t give a shit what you call it.” Charming.\n\nVance habitually weaponises social media to defend Trump and vilify “crazy leftwing radicals”. In one notorious exchange, he tried to excuse racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments about “monkeys”, Hitler and rape made in a Republican online chat group. Challenged over a cruelly offensive AI video targeting a black Democrat congressman that was reposted by Trump, Vance said: “I think it’s funny. The president’s joking and we’re having a good time.”\n\nIn contrast, following the murder of his hard-right ally, Charlie Kirk, Vance demanded a nationwide crackdown on “far-left” dissent – meaning views he disliked. This display of double standards echoed his pitiful overseas debut in Munich in February, when he hypocritically lectured Europe on freedom and censorship while courting Germany’s far-right leader, Alice Weidel. Vance subsequently confirmed his reputation as a muddled, unmuzzled attack dog by savaging Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who knows more about defending liberty than he ever will.\n\nIf Vance does run, he will have to spell out what he believes. The problem is, he doesn’t know. He once dismissed Trump as an “idiot” he would “never” support. As an Ohio senator, he opposed foreign wars; as vice-president, he has backed unilateral attacks on Iran, Yemen and Venezuela. In his self-indulgent, self-promoting book, Hillbilly Elegy, he criticised white working-class communities for blaming their problems on China, migrants and “woke” elites. Now he himself does exactly that, all the time.\n\nRubio is an altogether quieter, strangely passive figure and possibly the most ineffectual secretary of state of recent times. While Trump runs the show and hogs the limelight on Israel, Ukraine and China, Rubio, 54, acts as prop, cheerleader and repairman. His job: to make sense of Trump’s ill-considered, hyped-up deals – an impossible task at which he fails daily. His dangerous tardiness in implementing security elements of the Gaza “peace plan” is a case in point.\n\nRubio wasn’t always so feeble. As a 2016 presidential candidate, competing against Trump (who ridiculed him as “Little Marco”), he championed traditional US alliances, human rights and foreign aid. Referencing Russia, he condemned efforts “by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbours”. Yet since he took the Trump shilling, his principled stands have mysteriously eroded. US overseas assistance budgets have been gutted, democracy promotion and human rights deprioritised, and direct US support for Ukraine eviscerated.\n\nHis tenure as secretary of state was initially overshadowed by Elon Musk, who slashed state department jobs and soft power programmes while Rubio looked away; and more recently by Steve Witkoff, the Trump crony dubbed “envoy for everything”. Yet in one policy area, this son of anti-Castro migrants is consistent: his antipathy to leftwing regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. In his other role as national security adviser, Rubio leads the increasingly militarised charge to topple Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship in Caracas.\n\nJustifying lethal maritime attacks on suspected drug smugglers from Venezuela and Colombia, Rubio declared in September that lawful interdiction didn’t work. “What will stop them is when you blow them up... And it’ll happen again,” he warned. Which it has, repeatedly. Rubio plays front man, too, for Trump’s crude pressure campaigns against Panama, Brazil and Mexico, mass deportations of migrants to prisons run by El Salvador’s repressive regime, and overall attempt to reduce Latin America once again to a semi-colonised US backyard.\n\nWhile all this may win Rubio support on the right, it risks alienating independent voters. His behaviour only makes sense if he, like Vance, plans to run for president as a second-generation Maga mini-me. Both these ever-malleable Trump chumps look set to do precisely that in 2028. Like their boss, they know nothing of statesmanship or a higher calling. Followers not leaders, they are united in unbridled ambition – and unfitness to rule.\n\nSurely the US can do better than this. Oops! That’s what they said about Trump in 2016.\n\n Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentator","summary":"It’s currently a two-horse race – and the next US leader is guaranteed to be a careerist who knows nothing of statesmanship\n\nMillions of Americans yearn for 7 November 2028, the scheduled date of the next presidential election.

A majority of Americans are also growing increasingly concerned over the government shutdown.\n\nFar more Democrats (95%) and independents (77%) say the country is \"pretty seriously off on the wrong track\" than Republicans (29%), along with larger shares of Black (87%), Hispanic (71%) and Asian (71%) Americans than white Americans (61%). Majorities of Americans in urban, suburban and rural areas say the country is moving in the wrong direction, as well as those with varying levels of education and income.\n\nAlthough 67% say the country is moving in the wrong direction, that is a decrease from November 2024, when 75% said the same in the lead-up to the presidential election.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans blame Trump for the current rate of inflation while more than 6 in 10 disapprove of how Trump is handling tariffs, the economy and managing the federal government; majorities also disapprove on how he is handling several other issues.\n\nAnd 64% of Americans say Trump is \"going too far\" in trying to expand the power of the presidency.\n\nAt the same time, even more Americans say the Democratic Party is \"out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today\" (68%) than Trump (63%) and the Republican Party (61%).\n\nNearly half of Americans (48%) say America’s leadership in the world has gotten weaker under Trump, while a third (33%) say it has gotten stronger and about 2 in 10 say it is the same (18%) -- numbers that have not shifted significantly during his second term.\n\nThough it's still a year from until the midterm elections, Americans’ negative ratings on the state of the country, the economy and the president do not bode well for the president’s party in congressional election voting.\n\nA slim 52% majority of Americans say the economy has gotten worse since Trump became president while 27% say the economy has improved and 20% say it has stayed the same. The share saying the economy is \"much worse\" outweighs the share saying it is \"much better\" by almost 3-to-1, 26% vs. 9%.\n\nWhile the share saying the economy is better overall has increased from April by 6 percentage points, the share saying it is worse has barely shifted. Fewer say it is the \"same\" now (20%) than in April (25%).\n\nNearly 6 in 10 of those with household incomes under $50,000 say the economy is worse since Trump became president (57%).\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans blame Trump for the current rate of inflation, including about a third who say he bears a \"great deal\" of blame, compared with 4 in 10 who say he does not bear much responsibility for inflation.\n\nMajorities of Democrats (92%) and independents (66%) say Trump is to blame for the current rate of inflation, along with 20% of Republicans. Majorities across income groups say Trump is to blame for inflation.\n\nThe share of Americans saying they are \"not as well off\" financially than when Trump became president outweighs the share saying they are \"better off\" by about 2-to-1, 37% to 18%. A 45% plurality says their finances are \"about the same.\"\n\nMore say they are doing better now than in April, when 10% said they were better off. \n\nTrump approval\n\nTrump’s disapproval rating has ticked up over the course of the year and he is underwater on that and on key issues measured in the ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.\n\nIn all, 59% of Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling his job as president while 41% approve, putting him 18 percentage points underwater for net approval, similar to where he was in an April poll (16 points underwater) and worse than the beginning of his second term in February (8 points underwater).\n\nCurrently, Trump’s strong disapproval rating outweighs his strong approval rating by more than 2-to-1, 46% to 20%.\n\nTrump issue approval\n\nMajorities of Americans also disapprove of how Trump is handling every issue measured in the poll. Over 6 in 10 disapprove of how Trump is handling tariffs, the economy and managing the federal government. About 6 in 10 disapprove of how he is handling the situation involving Russia and Ukraine and relations with other countries. More than half disapprove of how he is handling immigration, crime and the situation with Israel and Gaza. He does not have approval from most Americans on a single issue measured.\n\nTrump’s approval rating peaks on handling the situation with Israel and Gaza: 46% approve and 52% disapprove -- better than his September ratings, when 39% approved and 58% disapproved in a Post-Ipsos poll. Notably, Trump helped negotiate a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel since that September poll.\n\nHis approval ratings on other issues have either worsened or remained stable. He currently has his worst numerical rating on handling the economy over his two terms as president, with 37% approving and 62% disapproving. Trump’s approval rating on the economy peaked in March 2020 with 57% approving of how he was handling the issue and 38% disapproving. A majority has disapproved of his handling of the economy since February 2025.\n\nTrump’s approval rating on managing the federal government has also declined, according to the poll.\n\nThe president’s ratings on immigration, tariffs, crime, relations with other countries, Russia and Ukraine and crime have barely budged since September’s Post-Ipsos poll.\n\nMajorities of Americans also say Trump is \"going too far\" trying to expand the power of the presidency (64%), laying off government employees to cutting the size of the federal workforce (57%), sending the National Guard to patrol U.S. cities (55%) and trying to make changes in how U.S. colleges and universities operate (54%).\n\nAnd roughly half say he’s going too far trying to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the government and private workplaces (51%), deporting undocumented immigrants (50%), closing pathways for immigrants to legally remain (50%) and enter (48%) the United States and trying to end efforts to increase diversity in government and private workplaces (47%).\n\nAmericans are split over how much Trump has accomplished during his presidency, with 48% saying he has done at least \"a good amount\" and 51% saying he has done \"not very much,\" \"little or nothing.\"\n\nAmong those who say Trump has accomplished a good amount or more in the last nine months, more say that what he did was good for the country rather than bad for it -- just about 4 in 10 Americans overall.\n\nNegative ratings for an incumbent president are not positive indicators for his party come midterm elections.\n\nA year out from the 2026 midterms, voters are largely split between supporting the Democratic and Republican candidates, with 46% of registered voters saying they would support the Democratic candidate if the U.S. House of Representatives election were being held today, and 44% supporting the Republican candidate. Among the broader population of U.S. adults, 42% said they would support the Democratic candidate and 39% said they would support the Republican.\n\nIn a November 2021 ABC News/Washington Post poll, a year before the 2022 midterms, voters had a 10-percentage-point preference for Republican candidates, and Republicans won the House. In a November 2017 ABC News/Washington Post poll, voters had an 11-percentage-point preference for Democratic candidates. And in 2018, Democrats won the House.\n\nMore Americans see crime as a serious problem in large U.S. cities than where they live or the U.S. overall. About 6 in 10 Americans say crime is either \"extremely\" (29%) or \"very\" (32%) serious in large U.S. cities, while about half say crime is serious in the U.S. overall and just under 2 in 10 say the same for the areas where they live.\n\nThe share saying crime in the U.S. is \"extremely\" serious (17%) is down from 2023 and 2024 when about a quarter of Americans said the same, according to Gallup polling. \n\nJust 8% of Americans say crime is extremely serious where they live, a figure that has remained in the single digits since Gallup began tracking it in 2000 -- but numerically higher than it has been in the years since then.\n\nRepublicans are far more likely to say crime in large U.S. cities is \"extremely serious\" (42%) than Democrats (17%) or independents (27%).\n\nICE and National Guard\n\nAmericans are split over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detaining and deporting undocumented immigrations in the U.S. overall, in large cities and where they live.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Republicans \"strongly\" support the ICE surge in the U.S., large cities and where they live, while about two-thirds of Democrats strongly oppose them. More independents oppose expanded ICE deportations than support them. \n\nRoughly 6 in 10 Americans (57%) say that ICE and Homeland Security agents should not be allowed to wear masks or face coverings while on duty, while about 4 in 10 (41%) say it should be allowed. Majorities of Democrats (88%) and independents (64%) say it should not be allowed while a majority of Republicans (77%) say agents should be allowed to cover their faces while on duty.\n\nA similar share of Americans (58%) say that a U.S. president should not be able to order the National Guard into a state over the objections of that state's governor; 40% say a U.S. president should be allowed to. About 9 in 10 Democrats and two-thirds of independents say this should not be allowed; 8 in 10 Republicans say the president should be able to send the National Guard into a state even if its governor objects.\n\nTrump on international issues\n\nNearly half of Americans (47%) say Trump is spending \"about the right amount of time\" on international crises, while around one-third say he’s spending \"too much time\" (32%) and about 2 in 10 say he is spending \"too little time\" on international crises (19%).\n\nJust about 4 in 10 say Trump deserves \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount\" of credit for the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas (39%) and just over 4 in 10 say he deserves \"just some credit\" or \"none\" (43%).\n\nOn Russia and Ukraine, 46% say Trump is \"too supportive of Russia,\" 8% say he is \"too supportive of Ukraine\" and 41% say he is handling it about right.\n\nPolitically motivated violence\n\nBy 34% to 28%, more Americans blame the Republican Party than the Democratic Party for politically motivated violence in the U.S. with another 28% saying they are both equally to blame and 9% saying neither is to blame.\n\nSince 2022, more Americans have blamed the Republican Party for political violence than the Democratic Party, according to the poll.\n\n2024 vote regret?\n\nWide majorities of both Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris' supporters say that voting for their candidates was \"the right thing to do\" in 2024.\n\nIn all, 92% of Trump supporters say voting for him was the right thing to do, while only 7% say they regret it. An even larger share of Harris supporters say voting for her was the right thing to do, 97% to 3% who regret their vote. These numbers for Trump and Harris have not meaningfully shifted since this question was last asked in April.\n\nMethodology -- This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel® Oct. 24-28, 2025, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,725 U.S. adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points, including the design effect. Error margins are larger for subgroups. The partisan divisions are 28% Democrats, 31% Republicans and 41% independents or something else.\n\nSee more details on ABC News’s survey methodology here.","summary":"Over 6 in 10 say Trump and GOP are out of touch.

Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk, Virginia, on Saturday afternoon, Obama told a crowd of thousands, \"Our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now... Every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.\" \n\nObama hit Trump on his handling of the economy, and the effect that the administration's layoff efforts had on Virginia, a state home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n\n\"The economy has been really good for some of Trump's billionaire pals and for finance bros and well-connected corporations who've seen their tax bills go down and don't have to worry about all these pesky regulators anymore... Hundreds of thousands of federal employees, including a lot of people here in Virginia, have lost their jobs to pay for those billionaire tax cuts,\" Obama said.\n\nIn her remarks, Spanberger sought to link her opponent -- current Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears -- to Trump.\n\n\"We do not need someone who has been in lockstep with this administration every step of the way,\" Spanberger said. Earle-Sears has not campaigned with Trump and has received only a verbal endorsement from the president.\n\nObama later joined New Jersey Democratic candidate for governor U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill for a campaign rally in Newark on Saturday evening. He delivered similar remarks about Trump, Republicans and the state of the economy under the Trump administration.\n\nObama's remarks diverged when praising Sherrill for her qualifications, telling the crowd that Sherrill is \"the kind of leader who understands the mission, who knows who she is supposed to serve, who doesn't have a lot of time for excuses. And that is exactly what New Jersey needs right now.\" \n\nObama also took the time to link Sherrill's opponent in the race, Republican candidate and former state assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, to Trump. Ciattarelli has spoken in support of Trump but has also said he'd be willing to bring up differences with the president if needed.\n\n\"Donald Trump called Mikie's opponent '100% MAGA.' Not a great endorsement. When he was asked to give the Trump administration a grade, Mikie's opponent said they deserved an A,\" Obama said. \n\nBut Republicans are also making major moves in the gubernatorial races. \n\nPresident Donald Trump's political operation is investing millions in voter turnout for New Jersey and Virginia's gubernatorial races mere days before the election, as Democratic candidates lead in both contests, a source familiar confirmed to ABC News. \n\nThe source familiar with Trump's political operation told ABC that \"Trump aligned entities\" are spending seven figures to turn out the vote in each state, which they see as opportunities to test certain campaign tactics ahead of next year's midterms. \n\nAxios was the first to report the investments.\n\nFox News reported that Trump held a tele-rally on Thursday alongside outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin to boost Virginia's Republican candidates; he previously did the same to boost the Garden State's GOP gubernatorial candidate Ciattarelli.\n\n\"You have a very important election for governor coming up in your state, and you need to go vote for Jack,\" Trump said during the New Jersey tele-rally, calling Ciattarelli a \"special guy\" that will produce \"unbelievable results.\"\n\nThose involved with Trump's political operation understand they are working against tough odds, and even though polls are tightening in New Jersey, for instance, that Democrats hold a sizable voter registration lead -- by nearly 900,000.\n\n\"President Trump has held tele-rallies because no one energizes voters like President Trump. He is a turnout machine, as was demonstrated by the historic results of the 2024 election -- but he is not on the ballot,\" said the source familiar.\n\nAcross the country, former Vice President Kamala Harris joined other elected officials at a rally on Saturday in support of the ballot proposition in California that could redraw the state's congressional map -- in one of her first major political appearances since leaving office.\n\nCalifornians are voting on the proposition to determine if the state will adopt a new congressional map that redraws five Republican-held districts to potentially allow Democrats to flip them in the midterms. Opponents of the proposition have said the measure will take control over who represents residents out of the hands of voters.\n\nHarris told the crowd that the proposition \"is about reminding folks that we refuse to kneel at the foot of a tyrant.\"\n\n\"That's not what we do. We stand for the principles upon which our nation was founded. We believe in the Constitution of the United States. We believe in the power of the vote, and we are prepared, when necessary, to fight fire with fire.\" \n\nHarris added later that \"other states need to step up, too ... this fight is not about sitting by and complaining, 'Oh, they're cheating.' That's not what this is about. It's not that kind of party.\"\n\nABC News' Emily Chang and Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.","summary":"Barack Obama and Kamala Harris, in separate rallies on Saturday, called to turn out to vote -- as Donald Trump’s political operation invests millions in voter turnout.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/barack-obama-kamala-harris-campaign-democrats-donald-trumps/story?id=127101044","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b58ee409-6c98-4848-9ca6-41035f03600a/obama-ap-jt-251101_1762031617845_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 03:39:19","author":"Brittany Shepherd,Halle Troadec,Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Brittany Shepherd","Halle Troadec","Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.048}]}
