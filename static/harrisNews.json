Mikie Sherrill in the high-stakes race.\n\nGarden State Republicans have so far notched an 18.61% return rate for their mail-in ballots, outpacing the Democrats’ 16.55%, according to data compiled and analyzed by DecisionDeskHQ’s director of political science, Michael Pruser.\n\nGOP pollster Adam Geller, who has worked with the Ciattarelli campaign, told The Post that Republicans have historically been less inclined to vote by mail, meaning this lead in the rate of early ballot returns could be a hopeful sign.\n\n“Clearly, it’s encouraging for the Republicans right now,” Geller said. “You could argue that, in addition to coming around to vote by mail, it could be a measurement of the enthusiasm for the candidate.”\n\nBrent Buchanan, the president and CEO of Cygnal polling firm, said that the early mail-in data is interesting given President Trump’s growing popularity in the Garden State.\n\n“Republicans have gotten serious about participating in early voting,” Buchanan told The Post. \n\n“Pair that with the strong shift statewide toward Trump, and you have a growing recipe for Republican wins up and down the ticket.”\n\nKamala Harris only won New Jersey by a 6% margin in the 2024 presidential election, marking the narrowest Democratic margin in the state since 1992, according to the New Jersey Globe.\n\nPresident Trump is now also polling better than outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, according to a stunning recent survey by Emerson College.\n\nStill, despite the GOP mail-in enthusiasm, the pollsters cautioned against reading too much into early data.\n\n“The problem with voting by mail is that you don’t know from one day to the next what you’re going to get. Which counties may be lagging behind and may suddenly produce lots and lots of ballots,” Geller said.\n\nDave Wasserman, editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said that it is still too early to determine what the electorate will look like.\n\n“It may be that Democrats return their ballots later,” he noted.\n\nWasserman added that the GOP appeared “energized for change” after eight years of Democratic control of the Garden State’s government — but said the race will likely come down to independent voters no matter what.\n\nIndependent voters had a return rate of just 9.32% for their mail-in ballots, according to Pruser’s analysis.\n\nDemocrats dramatically outnumber Republicans in New Jersey, 2,391,043 to 1,568,949, with 2,161,088 Independents, according to data compiled by the Independent Voter Project. That data set was last updated in late August.\n\nFor much of the race, Sherrill had been the runaway frontrunner, with some polls pegging her with a near-double-digit lead. \n\nBut that began to shift last month. \n\nAn internal poll conducted by Geller showed Ciattarelli with a threadbare lead, and an Emerson College Polling survey pegged Sherrill and Ciattarelli as being neck and neck.\n\nOther polls have shown that the race is getting tighter, something that has spooked national Democrats. \n\nSherrill has a 3.3 percentage point advantage over her conservative counterpart, according to the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polling. Exactly one month ago, she had an 8.3 point lead.\n\nFor context, the RCP aggregate underestimated Ciattarelli’s support by some 5 points in the 2021 New Jersey gubernatorial race. Ciattarelli lost to incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy (D) by about 3 points. \n\nSherrill and Ciattarelli are set to square off in a debate on Wednesday. New Jerseyans head to the polls on November 4.","summary":"\"You could argue that, in addition to coming around to vote by mail, it could be a measurement of the enthusiasm for the candidate,\" a pollster said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/05/us-news/nj-republicans-are-mailing-in-more-ballots-in-encouraging-early-sign-for-jack-ciattarelli/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/112889390.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/A0HFl0YW-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-05 21:56:27","author":"Josh Christenson,Mikella Schuettler,Ryan King","authors":["Josh Christenson","Mikella Schuettler","Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.506},{"id":366495944,"title":"Carlsbad company among those hit by Trump’s cuts to energy projects","text":"The Trump administration is canceling about $8 billion in grants for energy projects in mostly Democratic-led states — but is allowing funding to continue for similar projects in states that voted for Trump.\n\nThe canceled grants, which were first announced last week by the Office of Management and Budget’s director, Russell Vought, don’t total anywhere close to all of the energy investments made by the Biden administration, which Vought called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”\n\nFor now, energy project money appears to be continuing to flow to companies and institutions located in red and swing states, even though the work these institutions are doing is very similar to the work that was cut, according to a NOTUS analysis of hundreds of projects across the country, including the latest cancellations.\n\nFor example, the administration canceled $460 million in funding for the Democrat-led state of Minnesota to build much-needed interregional transmission lines (power lines that connect the country’s separated parts of the grid).\n\nIt left in place a $700 million grant from the same program that will connect the Eastern and Western U.S. grids in Montana, a state that voted for Trump and is led by Republicans.\n\nThe administration also canceled funding to improve the resilience of the power grid in Hawaii from wildfires and other extreme weather, as well as $40 million in funding for a project to build a resilient backup microgrid for Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and the island of Oahu.\n\nIt did not cut the $160 million that was awarded in the same funding round from the same program for Georgia Power to make the state’s electric grid more resilient.\n\nAnd of the 17 projects the Department of Energy awarded for battery recycling and reprocessing innovations, the list of cuts included just three: one in Colorado and two in California. \n\nThere’s no obvious difference between those three projects and the remaining 14 that appear to still be funded, beyond the fact that some of the others are located at national labs or in states that either voted for Trump or are led by Republicans, like Utah, Virginia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\n\nAnd while the administration canceled billions in funding for hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, hubs that touch states including Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Ohio, South Dakota, Pennsylvania and Indiana appear fine for now.\n\nThe specific cuts suggest the Trump administration is using its grant authorities to pressure Democrats to vote for the government funding bill. There is discussion on the Hill between some Democrats and Republicans in the states affected by the cuts about pushing for a restoration of the funds as part of a deal to end the shutdown, one source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested as much to Fox News last week when asked about the program cuts.\n\n“Pass the clean, continuing resolution and all of this goes away,” she said, directed at Democrats.\n\nBut just hours later, Energy Secretary Chris Wright suggested that a reversal of the cuts was not on the table. In an interview on CNN on Thursday night, he said that the decision to cancel the funding had nothing to do with the shutdown.\n\nWhen asked about why the affected projects were all in states that voted for Kamala Harris last November, Wright denied that the administration was targeting Democrats and said that more cancellations were coming down the pipe — including in red states. “This is a partial list of an ongoing process. More project announcements will come,” he said.\n\nThe Trump administration’s announcement sowed confusion for the companies and states affected. After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day. Some local authorities said they have still not received official notice from the DOE, including the state of Colorado and the California Energy Commission.\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said he had lunch with Energy Secretary Chris Wright “minutes before” the cancellations were announced, but received no warning.\n\n“He had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included 10 projects in my state, projects that affect real jobs and real families,” Heinrich said in a statement. “That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions.”\n\nThe grant cancellations span projects aimed to improve electrical grid infrastructure, innovate on battery recycling, create new forms of energy storage, lower buildings’ energy usage and advance hydrogen and fuel cell technology. Many of the projects would carry benefits and jobs outside of the states they are based in, especially those that would affect the resilience and performance of the nation’s aging electric grid.\n\nA number of recipients are losing multiple projects, including some institutions whose goals could serve the Trump administration’s interests. GTI Energy, which is focused on modernizing the natural gas industry, lost 13 grants. Both GE Vernova, a maker of wind and gas turbines, and the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit electricity research organization, lost 11. The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.\n\nMany of the projects on this list have already begun operations, which means the money that has been distributed for these projects so far will be wasted if operations halt, another source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.\n\nLindsay VanLaningham, a spokesperson for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a community-owned electric utility, said in a statement to NOTUS that as of Thursday evening, the DOE had not yet notified them of any changes to their grant, which funds “a portion of a project already in flight.”\n\nSome of the canceled awards are listed by the Energy Department as targeting blue states, but the impacted projects themselves are located in red states. For instance, a $19.7 million federal award to IBM related to methane emissions research is categorized under awards cancelled to entities New York — but a description of the project published in 2024 said it will be carried out entirely in Western states that voted for Trump, including Utah, Montana and Alaska.\n\nThere are more areas for confusion: The list of cancellations includes some, but not all, grants that the DOE first announced in May that it was canceling, primarily for clean energy industrial demonstrations.\n\nAnd some of the affected entities are getting information that conflicts with the DOE news release. The department says entities have 30 days to appeal the cancellations, but one affected group told NOTUS their instructions say they have only 10 days to appeal.\n\nSome of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities. For example, the administration has issued executive orders and memos emphasizing the importance of mineral development and extraction in the United States. Recycling used batteries is one way to increase the availability of minerals and metals like lithium, but three of the grants in that program have been axed.\n\nSome companies have confirmed with NOTUS that they are now receiving cancellation notices. Those include Smartville, a Carlsbad, California-based company that was building a long-duration battery storage project, and Sublime Systems, which was originally told in May its grants had been cancelled and has been in the appeals process since then.\n\n“Regardless of the political fighting in Washington, D.C., hydrogen remains a viable product for energy dominance and represents a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars that generates millions of jobs. While we are disappointed in the Department of Energy’s decision to cut funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, there is still immense opportunity for our region to finish what we started,” a spokesperson for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen hub said.\n\nThis story was produced as part of a partnership between NOTUS — a publication from the nonpartisan Allbritton Journalism Institute — and NEWSWELL, home of Times of San Diego, Santa Barbara News-Press and Stocktonia.","summary":"The Trump administration is canceling about $8 billion in grants for energy projects in mostly Democratic-led states.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/10/05/trump-cuts-energy-projects-california/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP22251565296090-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-05 21:35:00","author":"Anna Kramer,Manuela Silva and Amelia Benavides-Colón • NOTUS,Rich Pedroncelli","authors":["Anna Kramer","Manuela Silva and Amelia Benavides-Colón • NOTUS","Rich Pedroncelli"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":366491958,"title":"Gen Z Revolt! Trump's Support Among Young Americans Dramatically Drops After His Tariffs Tanked the Economy and Cost of Living Continues to Rise","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump's approval rating has plummeted among young Americans, according to newly released survey data that raises questions about the durability of his support from a crucial voting bloc, RadarOnline.com can report.The PollData journalist G. Elliott Morris reported in his Substack blog Strength In Numbers that Trump’s net approval among voters aged 18 to 29 has fallen by 35 percentage points since November 2024. \n\nMorris, who analyzed 7,000 interviews conducted over five months and compared them to respondents’ reported 2024 election choices, found Trump’s standing with young voters has declined from -3 to -38 in less than a year.\n\nThe drop represents a sharp reversal from Trump’s gains with younger Americans in the 2024 election, when a notable conservative shift helped power his return to the White House. \n\nWhile voters ages 18 to 29 supported Joe Biden over Trump by 61 percent to 36 percent in 2020, four years later, the Democratic share fell. In the November 2024 contest, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won 51 percent of young voters compared with Trump’s 47 percent.White House ReactsWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended Trump’s record, citing achievements in border security and economic policy. \n\n“President Donald Trump is keeping his promises and Making America Great Again: whether it’s securing the border, securing historic investments in American manufacturing, taming Biden’s inflation crisis, or fighting against the Democrats’ radical demands of free health care for illegal aliens,” Jackson said. Referring to a Rasmussen Reports survey from September 25, she added: “That’s why over 57 percent of Americans approve of the President and the incredible job he’s doing!”Hispanic VotersMorris noted that much of the decline in Trump’s approval stems from young Hispanic voters, who have grown disillusioned with the administration’s tariff and immigration policies.\n\nStill, not all polls agree with Morris’s assessment. AtlasIntel reported that Trump’s approval among adults aged 18 to 29 improved by 35 points in just two months, while a YouGov/The Economist poll in July showed his net approval among Gen Z improving from -38 to -28.Growing frustrationYoung political activists argue that the erosion of Trump's support reflects growing frustration over living costs and his focus on cultural battles. \n\n\"Since Donald Trump took office, the cost of living has gone up everywhere — housing, groceries, fuel, utilities. If Republicans keep the government shutdown, health care prices will be next,\" Gen-Z activist Olivia Julianna told outlets.\n\n\"Many young people supported Trump because they thought he had real answers,\" they explained. \"Instead, they've seen a president more focused on culture war stunts — renaming the Department of Defense, fighting over the name of the Gulf of Mexico, and attacking celebrities from official accounts. All the while, he's been focused on enriching himself and his donors, not helping the people who believed in him.\"","summary":"Donald Trump's approval among voters aged 18–29 has dropped by 35 percentage points since November 2024.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/gen-z-revolt-donald-trump-support-young-americans-tanks-tariffs-economy/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/4tsLIB8DC/0x0/gen-z-revolt-donald-trump-support-young-americans-tanks-tariffs-economy-1759695281464.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-05 21:30:00","author":"Joshua Wilburn","authors":["Joshua Wilburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":366468550,"title":"In Virginia gov race, Abigail Spanberger exposes Dems’ woke weakness","text":"The off-year governor’s election in purple Virginia is almost always a win for the party that doesn’t hold the White House, but this year the race is showing how much Democrats have refused to learn their lessons from their massive culture-war losses of 2024.\n\nThe battle in the Old Dominion has all the hallmarks of Democrats’ White House defeat in November.\n\nAn uninspiring political-insider candidate, hand-picked by the party establishment, is running a campaign that relies on hype from friendly media.\n\nShe’s dodging questions about hot-button cultural issues — including trans athletes in school sports and men in girls’ dressing rooms — and betting she can coast to victory on resistance-fueled backlash to President Donald Trump.\n\nA month ago, Democrat and ex-CIA spy Abigail Spanberger’s lackluster basement campaign was chugging along, spending big money on a plethora of ads slamming her opponent, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, as too conservative for the state.\n\nEarle-Sears, a Marine Corps veteran, rode strong support from the Republican grassroots to become Virginia’s first female lieutenant governor and first woman of color elected statewide.\n\nThanks in part to a massive spending gap, Spanberger built up a double-digit polling lead over the summer; many in the GOP wrote off the race as lost.\n\nBut in recent weeks she’s stumbled badly over the case of Richard Cox, a biological man claiming transgender status who’s exploited local “bathroom laws” to repeatedly expose himself to women and children in Northern Virginia locker rooms.\n\nFairfax County police say they have no intention of charging Cox with any crime, despite public outrage — and even though his phone reportedly contained both child porn and a schedule tracking children’s swim classes.\n\nThis should be easy for a politician with any common sense to condemn.\n\nInstead, Spanberger has dodged.\n\nWhen local reporter Nick Minock asked her a yes-or-no question on the topic — “Do you support biological males who say they are women using women’s locker rooms and bathrooms and competing in women’s sports?” — the candidate looked like a deer in headlights.\n\nIn Minock’s now-viral video of the exchange, Spanberger gave a meandering non-answer blaming Trump for attacking Title IX, and blew off follow-up questions.\n\n“Uh, this is bad,” a top state Democrat groaned to the online magazine Puck. “And she’s considered one of our best candidates.”\n\nA week later, another reporter gave Spanberger a second chance.\n\nWhatever script she was supposed to stick to was lost in another mess of word salad, as she tried and failed to disguise that she favors a rollback of Trump’s executive order and would once again allow biological males to compete in girls’ sports in Virginia.\n\nKnown for her carefully prepared lines on the trail, Spanberger — touted as a moderate and considered a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate — is finding that on this issue, her talking points just aren’t connecting.\n\nSensing weakness on an issue of significant importance to suburban parents, Earle-Sears’ latest ads are making the most of Spanberger’s now-obvious leftist preferences.\n\nEchoing a charge that even Kamala Harris has admitted hurt her in 2024, the spot calls Spanberger’s policies “insane.”\n\n“Spanberger is for they/them,” it concludes. “Not for us.”\n\nWorse yet, the issue provoked an overheated and racist response from some Spanberger supporters.\n\nWhen Earle-Sears came before the school board in deep-blue Arlington to argue against its bathroom policies, she was greeted by a Democrat protester holding up a handwritten sign: “Hey Winsome, if trans can’t share your bathroom, then blacks can’t share my water fountain.”\n\nNow Spanberger has a new headache: Jay Jones, the Democrats’ state attorney general candidate.\n\nOn Friday, National Review revealed that Jones had sent violent text messages wishing death on the family of a prominent Virginia Republican, asserting that the GOP member was “breeding little fascists.” \n\nSpanberger condemned Jones’ language — but coming from a candidate who has repeatedly told her supporters to “let your rage fuel you,” her comments didn’t ring true.\n\nFor undecided independent voters, a significant swing bloc in Virginia, the ugly incident undermined Democrats’ claims that Earle-Sears is the extremist in this race.\n\nSo Spanberger is trying to change the subject.\n\nRather than lay out what she actually believes, her latest ads claim she wants to “take politics out of schools.”\n\nAnd she’s bringing on campaign help from Bill and Hillary Clinton, along with their buddy Terry McAuliffe — who lost the last gubernatorial race to Republican Glenn Youngkin over similar hot-button issues four years ago.\n\nMcAuliffe, too, failed to answer concerns about woke Northern Virginia school-board policies, pronouncing the controversies a distraction and proclaiming, “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.”\n\nRepublican insiders, mindful of Virginia’s history as a purple state with two entrenched Democratic senators, were wary of wading into the culture war.\n\nYoungkin leaned into that fight — and won handily.\n\nThe odds are still against Earle-Sears pulling off what would be a shocking political upset.\n\nBut on Thursday, a new poll from the Trafalgar Group had Spanberger’s lead cut down to five points, 47-42.\n\nSpanberger’s woes show that even after their 2024 drubbing, Democrats haven’t learned how to deal with questions that seem so obvious to the vast majority of Americans.\n\nAnd that Democrats’ fake centrists are still just trying to hide what they really believe.\n\nBen Domenech is editor at large of The Spectator and a Fox News contributor.","summary":"The battle between Abigial Spanberger and Winsome Earl-Sears in the Old Dominion is

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) revealed. \n\nTSA bloated the list of Jan. 6 suspects by tapping a George Washington University database of alleged extremists — which was as credible as randomly selecting names of Trump donors. \n\nA TSA privacy officer protested: “TSA is punishing people for the expression of their ideas when they haven’t been charged, let alone convicted of incitement or sedition.”\n\nNew dirt also came to the surface about the Quiet Skies program, which sent TSA air marshals to covertly surveil travelers on the flimsiest pretexts. \n\nIf you fell asleep, used the bathroom or glared at noisy kids during a flight, those incriminating facts might have been added to your federal dossier. \n\nAir marshals noted whether suspects gained weight or were balding or were paranoid about the undercover federal agents who followed them into the parking lot to their cars.\n\nQuiet Skies, which cost $200 million a year, provoked a scandal last year after targeting former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (now director of national intelligence) after she criticized Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. \n\nTurns out Quiet Skies was also tracking three Republican congressmen before the program was abolished in June. TSA has not yet revealed the names of those congressmen.\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared Quiet Skies had been used to “target political opponents and benefit political allies,” spurring her to remove five senior TSA officials. \n\n“President Trump promised to end the weaponization of government against the American people, and we are making good on that promise,” she said.\n\nBut will Noem make TSA less odious to average Americans? \n\nThus far, Noem’s biggest reform is that travelers no longer need remove their shoes at TSA checkpoints. This is progress, but not quite the equivalent of Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nWhat about other TSA vexations such as the pointless prying patdowns that do nothing for security? \n\nIt takes less than a minute to find busloads of women bitterly complaining on X/Twitter about heavy-handed TSA screeners grabbing their vaginas (“I swear it’s not a bomb!”) or breasts. \n\nBut screeners have legal immunity almost no matter how brazenly they abuse travelers.\n\nIf a woman pushes a TSA screener’s hands away from her breasts, she can placed on the TSA “95 list” of potentially troublesome travelers. \n\nThe agency’s official watchlist defines troublemaker to include someone who merely “loiters” near a TSA checkpoint or demonstrates any “concerning behavior.”\n\nTSA can also place people on the watchlist simply because they are “publicly notorious.” \n\nDid getting denounced by TSA chief John Pistole in 2014 for “maligning” and “disparaging” TSA agents in an op-ed qualify me for the list and endless TSA supplemental patdowns when I travel? \n\nOr maybe I got nailed by the most boneheaded terrorist warning sign ever: “Very arrogant and expresses contempt against airport passenger procedures.”\n\nHow many other secret watchlists has TSA or DHS not yet revealed? \n\nA 2023 Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report noted, “U.S. travelers may be screened for at least 22 different reasons.” \n\nDHS receives requests from almost 20,000 people a year complaining about being banned from flying or otherwise penalized, and 98% of those people are not on terrorist watchlists.\n\nIf Noem truly wants to reform TSA, she should cease shrouding probably its most damning failure. \n\nTSA whole-body scanners and checkpoints failed to detect 80% of the fake bombs and weapons smuggled past them by undercover agents in 2017. \n\nThe Trump administration tightened secrecy, and subsequent TSA failure rates have not leaked out. \n\nBut endless false alarms at TSA checkpoints are a clue the agency is still on par with a blindfolded drunk swinging at a piñata.\n\nWe have no idea how many Americans’ rights and liberties continue to vanish into TSA black holes. \n\nPrivatizing airport-passenger screening is the only way to prevent further outrages and future political weaponization of an agency that long ago forfeited its right to exist.\n\nJames Bovard is the author of 11 books, including “Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty.”","summary":"Only in Washington would an edict to banish all dissidents be labeled Operation Freedom to Breathe.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nOver the last half-century or so, California has had six elections for governor when the office was being vacated.\n\nUnderstandably, such incumbent-free elections to run the nation’s most populous and economically powerful state have drawn serious candidates, mostly holders of other high-profile offices who declared themselves as soon as decorum would allow.\n\nWhen, for example, Republican Ronald Reagan’s two terms as governor were ending in 1974, the Democratic secretary of state, Jerry Brown, narrowly defeated the Republican state controller, Houston Flournoy.\n\nThis bit of political history is offered because the end of Gavin Newsom’s governorship is approaching rapidly. In scarcely a year, California voters will choose a new governor. The June 2 primary, which will determine the two finalists, is just eight months away.\n\nYet the field of would-be governors remains very unsettled.\n\nFor months voters, political media and potential campaign financiers waited for former Vice President Kamala Harris to decide whether, after losing the presidency to Donald Trump, she would seek the governorship.\n\nHarris finally said no, with a rather odd remark: “I don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken.” She may have been referring to national politics, but since the issue was California’s governorship, she could also have been implying the state was broken after many years of dominance by her Democratic Party.\n\nHarris’ decision, whatever her motives, did not settle the question about who will be running for governor next year. There are declared candidates, of course, but none scores very high in preliminary polling.\n\nLt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis had been one of the first to declare her candidacy but shortly after Harris announced her decision, Kounalakis dropped out, opting instead to run for state treasurer.\n\nWith those two out of the picture, former Congresswoman Katie Porter became the frontrunner, more or less by default, but with underwhelming support — 17% in a poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, released in late August. Her standing may have reflected nothing more than name recognition from her losing campaign for U.S. senator last year.\n\nThis week Toni Atkins, former president pro tem of the state Senate, also ended her campaign, saying she could see no pathway to victory. A few other Democrats remain, most notably former Biden administration official and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.\n\nMostly, however, we are seeing just preliminary skirmishing among those still in the race, because we’re still waiting to see who else might run.\n\nAfter the departure of Harris and Kounalakis, another name popped up in media speculation: U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla.\n\nIt’s difficult to understand why Padilla, who holds one of the nation’s most coveted political offices and could remain in the Senate for the rest of his life, would want to seek no more than eight years as governor.\n\nDoes he really want to deal with California’s plethora of infinitely difficult, unresolved issues, such as homelessness, housing shortages, water supply uncertainty, economic stagnation and, perhaps trickiest of all, a chronic multibillion-dollar budget deficit?\n\nWere Padilla to give up his Senate seat for the governorship, as Republican Pete Wilson did in 1990, the only logical motive would be civic duty — he thinks California needs him to weather its crises.\n\nMeanwhile, we’re waiting for another potential candidate, Rick Caruso, to also declare intentions. The very wealthy Los Angeles businessman ran a credible but unsuccessful race for mayor of his city after switching his party identification from Republican to Democrat and could draw support from moderate voters and interest groups of both parties. He says he’s weighing a race.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

The majority of those who responded to the poll predicted that EV sales would fall off a cliff.\n\nNow, it’s too early to tell yet; we are just a few days past the end of the quarter. But the expiring tax credit did give many automakers a bit of a sales bump as consumers raced to buy EVs before the deadline. \n\nTesla, which has seen sales growth diminish, just registered its best quarter of deliveries ever at 497,099 vehicles. That’s a massive 29% jump from the second quarter, about a 7% increase over the same period last year, and more than it has ever delivered in a single quarter.\n\nFord Motor, General Motors, and Hyundai also reported record quarterly sales of EVs. Rivian saw deliveries jump to 13,201 vehicles, up from 10,661 and 8,640 in the second and first quarters, respectively.\n\nThe looming question is how will automakers navigate a possible slowdown in EV sales in this post-tax credit era? Rivian has already adjusted its guidance down for 2025. Others may follow. \n\nThe crux for automakers is how to get rid of inventory as the new 2026 models come in without reducing or eliminating profit margins (and in some cases deepening the losses)?\n\nA little bird\n\nThe Department of Energy canceled 321 clean energy projects but wasn’t sharing the details with TechCrunch or the public. Luckily, a little bird shared the complete list of awards the Trump administration had canceled, and the results were revealing.\n\nAltogether, the canceled awards totaled $7.56 billion, with California bearing the brunt, losing $2.2 billion worth of grants, including a $630 million grid-modernization program that could have become a template for the nation. Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Oregon rounded out the top eight, losing between $300 million and $600 million each.\n\nIt wasn’t until farther down the list that a red state popped up. Indeed, the majority of projects were sited in states that had voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, something many media outlets reported after Office of Management and Budget chief Russell Vought tweeted as much.\n\nBut even in blue states, some awards stuck, possibly due to political connections with the Trump administration or aligned interests. Whatever the case, the move by the DOE suggests the government might be a less reliable partner for businesses, especially small startups.\n\nGot a tip for us?

But perhaps it should be. \n\nThe Japanese automaker is committing $1.5 billion in new capital to focus on, and invest in, the life cycle of startups — from the first seeds of an invention through its growth stage and eventually to mature companies.\n\nToyota has created a strategic investment subsidiary called Toyota Invention Partners Co. with about $670 million in capital, while its growth-stage venture arm Woven Capital launched a second $800 million fund.\n\nI spoke to Woven Capital general partner George Kellerman about Toyota’s capital commitment and its investment strategy. He described Toyota Invention Partners as a bookend of sorts to the company’s other investment organizations. Check out my article to learn why. \n\nOther deals that got my attention …\n\nRemember Einride, the Swedish startup known for its unusual-looking electric and autonomous pods? The company is still plugging along and has now raised $100 million from several new and existing investors, including its largest shareholder, EQT Ventures. The raise included an undisclosed strategic investment from quantum computing company IonQ. It’s worth noting that while $100 million is a lot of coin, it’s far lower than the $500 million in equity and debt it raised a few years ago. \n\nElectroflow, a startup developing a cheaper LFP battery, raised $10 million in a seed round led by Union Square Ventures and Voyager with participation from Fifty Years and Harpoon Ventures.\n\nFlai, a San Francisco-based AI-for-car-dealerships startup, raised a $4.5 million seed round led by Liz Wessel at First Round Capital. YC, RedBlue Capital, Joe Montana’s Liquid 2 Ventures, and Innovation Endeavors also joined.\n\nThis highly unusual deal is becoming more common under the Trump administration. The Department of Energy took a 5% equity stake in Canadian company Lithium Americas and a 5% stake in its Nevada mining joint venture with General Motors as part of a renegotiation of a $2.26 billion federal loan. This follows the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel and MP Materials. \n\nThe U.K. government will guarantee a commercial bank loan of £1.5 billion ($2 billion) for carmaking giant Jaguar Land Rover after a hack forced the company to shut down its production lines and left downstream suppliers at risk of bankruptcy.\n\nEarly-stage deep tech fund Wave Function Ventures closed its first fund of $15.1 million. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane profiles its founder Jamie Gull and his path from aerospace engineer to VC.\n\nNotable reads and other tidbits\n\nTwo Amazon Prime Air delivery drones collided with the boom of a crane near its same-day site in Tolleson, Arizona — the company’s one commercial location. Federal agencies are investigating, and after a temporary pause, Amazon has restarted the service. \n\nDoorDash has spent years working on an autonomous delivery robot that can navigate roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks. Senior AI reporter Max Zeff spent time with “Dot” and Ashu Rege, a former executive at the Amazon-owned AV company Zoox, who now leads DoorDash’s autonomy division.\n\nFaraday Future still exists and we know this because one of the troubled EV startup’s electric SUVs caught fire at its Los Angeles headquarters, leading to an explosion that blew out part of a wall.\n\nThe Trump administration’s crackdown in Chicago is affecting the gig economy, the founder of e-bike subscription startup Whizz tells TechCrunch. \n\nWaymo scored a regulatory win in New York City and received an extension for its testing permit.\n\nWestJet, Canada’s second largest airline, said the personal information of 1.2 million passengers was stolen in a cyberattack and data breach.\n\nZoox will start mapping the streets of Washington, D.C., as it ramps up to begin testing its self-driving vehicles in the nation’s capital this year. \n\nOne more thing …\n\nTechCrunch Disrupt 2025is just a few weeks away.

But the exact location has not been announced.\n\nThe goal is to build an 'immersive' museum which will showcase his efforts to respond to the pandemic, his infrastructure policies, and his work in international relations.\n\nBoard members for the project include former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House adviser Steve Ricchetti.\n\nBiden had previously suggested the library could be built at the University of Pennsylvania, in the state where he was born.\n\n'University of Pennsylvania, which has the Biden School of Foreign Policy, wants me to do it up there,' he claimed in January.\n\nBut the university said there had been 'no conversations about hosting the library.'\n\nReports emanating from the Biden camp have suggested the goal is to raise several hundred million dollars, but there is skepticism about whether that will be possible.\n\nDonor John Morgan, a high-profile Florida lawyer who previously gave $1 million to Biden's campaign, said jokingly to NBC: 'I don’t believe a library will ever be built unless it’s a bookmobile from the old days. It is my opinion no significant building will be built.'\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have started mocking Biden over the plan.\n\nSean Spicer, Trump's former press secretary, said: 'I actually feel bad, and I'm being serious, he's going to get like a food truck for a presidential library if he's not careful.'\n\nSome Democrats feel Biden should have done more while in office to raise money for his library.\n\nFor comparison, Obama selected his site before leaving office, and Bush Sr announced more than a year before his term was up that his library would be at Texas A&M University.\n\nOne former Democrat official said: 'I think there's a sense he's not as relevant to the debates that we're having right now.\n\n'I do not expect that donors or organizations are going to seek him out in large numbers.'\n\nPresident Trump has already raised more than his predecessor for his library, with over three years of his term left.\n\nMoney left over from the $239 million raised for his inauguration, and a $15 million settlement from ABC News in a defamation case, will go toward Trump's eventual library.\n\nThere are fears among some of Biden's potential donors - individuals and companies - that they could be targeted by President Trump on social media if they give money to the project.\n\nBut Democratic fundraiser Rufus Gifford, who is on the board, expressed confidence that money would come in.\n\nGifford said: 'There’s certainly folks who may have been not thinking about those kinds of issues who are starting to think about them.\n\n'That being said, we’re not going to create a budget, we’re not going to set a goal for ourselves that we don’t believe we can hit.'\n\nIt comes as the costs for presidential libraries have soared exponentially, even before Obama's behemoth.\n\nIn 1997, the George HW Bush library cost $43 million. Bill Clinton’s was $165 million, and George W Bush’s $500 million.\n\nBiden's is expected to buck the trend by costing much less than its predecessor.\n\nIt is expected to be 'somewhere in the middle' between Bush Sr's and Obama's, according to Gifford.\n\nDelaware Governor Matt Meyer welcomed Biden's decision to base his library in the state.\n\nMeyer said: 'To Delaware, he will always be our favorite. The new presidential library here in Delaware will give future generations the chance to see his story of resilience, family and never forgetting your roots.'\n\nThis week, Florida officials set aside nearly three acres of prime downtown Miami real estate as a potential site for Trump's library.\n\nTrump has already indicated that a $400 million Air Force One replacement from the Qatar government will be donated to his future presidential library. Similarly, a former presidential plane already sits in Ronald Reagan's California library.\n\nRepublican Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet voted to hand over the plot, which may be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThey said the property - currently owned by the state-run Miami Dade College - would provide a 'greater benefit to the public' and 'increase economic development activities' if it were to become the library.\n\nThe property is flanked by glitzy condos in an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard. It overlooks the waterfront park and sits across the street from the Miami Heat's home court.\n\nMiami Dade College has used it as an employee parking lot.\n\nThe foundation overseeing Trump's library is led by three trustees including his son Eric Trump, and Tiffany Trump’s husband Michael Boulos.\n\nEric said: 'Consistent with our family's DNA, this will be one of the most beautiful buildings ever built, an icon on the Miami skyline.\n\n'It will be the greatest Presidential Library ever built, honoring the greatest President.","summary":"Potential donors to Biden's presidential library remain 'furious' about his decision to attempt to run for a second term in his 80s, which ultimately ended in Kamala Harris being defeated by Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15153429/joe-biden-presidential-library-bookmobile.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/03/18/102618153-0-image-a-8_1759511904294.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-05 15:57:32","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":366499274,"title":"Trump adviser: Layoffs will start if shutdown negotiations are \"going nowhere\"","text":"On Wednesday, Axios' Kate Santaliz reported that Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said the administration would start firing workers in a day or two.

Glenn Youngkin (R) called out Jones for the text messages he is accused of sending in 2022 that showed him wishing a now former state House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children would be killed, the New York Post reported.\n\n“This violent, disgusting rhetoric targeted at an elected official and his children is beyond disqualifying. Jay Jones said that ‘Gilbert gets two bullets to the head’ and then hoped his children would die,” Youngkin wrote.\n\n“Read those words again. There is no ‘gosh, I’m sorry’ here. Jones doesn’t have the morality or character to drop out of this race, and his running mates Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi, and every elected Democrat in Virginia don’t have the courage to call on him to step away from this campaign in disgrace,” the governor added:\n\nAfter the texts were revealed, the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) called on Jones to immediately withdraw his candidacy, according to Breitbart News.\n\nIn addition, Vice President JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson are also calling on Jones to step out of the race, the outlet reported on Saturday.\n\nJohnson stated, “There is no conceivable justification for wishing violence against a political opponent and their children.”\n\nIn her comments on the Jones issue, Virginia’s Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running against Democrat Abigail Spanberger for governor, said, “The calls for hate and violence are coming from the mouths of the Democrat Party’s leaders, and Jay Jones is just the most recent, and his wish for violent acts the most clear.”\n\n“So if you can’t solve a problem, you can’t name it. But I will.

Email bellis@denverpost.com. – Barbara Ellis\n\n“107 Days,” by Kamala Harris (Simon & Schuster, 2025)\n\nHarris uses a diary-like format, counting down the days to the 2024 election, from inside the shortest U.S. presidential campaign in modern history, to defend her decisions, actions and statements, with a scant salting of a few regrets that one can imagine rattling around in her 3 a.m. thoughts. Her loyalty to Joe Biden is unswerving; her appreciation for her staff, bottomless; her assessment of fellow Democrats, sometimes adoring, sometimes scathing. She relies on the words of others to deliver the negative assessments, however, with the exception of her obvious contempt for her opponents in the race. Although Harris does share a few emotional responses, this feels more like a checklist of selected events to relate, misperceptions to clarify. She even explains her paucity of emotion: “I couldn’t let down my guard, couldn’t take off my armor. If I unclenched, if I remembered what it was like to be normal, I might not be in shape to handle the next blow.” I only hope that she can, by now, remember what it is like to be “normal.” — 3 stars (out of 4); Kathleen Lance, Denver\n\n“How to Read a Book,” by Monica Wood (Mariner, 2024)\n\nA book club at a women’s prison is led by Harriet Larson, a retired English teacher. The group includes a wonderful set of characters/members who embrace Yeats, Morrison and Harriet herself. One inmate, Violet Powell, is released after serving time for vehicular homicide (while driving drunk). Imagine the complications when she enters a bookstore and encounters both Harriet and Frank Daigle, the husband of the woman killed in the accident. As Harriet and Frank’s relationship develops, Violet gets hired at a university lab where the PI is researching the intellect of parrots, a wonderful side plot. Beautiful descriptions. Well written, a joy ride. — 4 stars (out of 4); Jo Calhoun, Denver\n\n“Tracy Flick Can‘t Win,” by Tom Perrotta (Scribner, 2022)\n\nMore than 20 years have passed since Tracy Flick ran for office, and her ambitions are still being thwarted. She’s achieved motherhood, although of the unwed mother variety. She’s assistant principal at her public high school, but knows she can accomplish much more if she only has a chance. Then the principal announces his retirement, and Tracy is hopeful. But, just like in the past, fate interferes. Most of us aren’t fated to walk in the spotlight of world stages, but the spot where we can use our greatest talents for the greater good is a goal we all can reach for. This second act in a fascinating character’s life journey convinces us finally it’s Tracy’s time, and she deserves it. — 3 stars (out of 4); Bonnie McCune, Denver (bonniemccune.com)\n\n“Bring the House Down,” by Charlotte Runcie (Doubleday, 2025)\n\nThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe is a three-week maelstrom of performances and exhibits that draws artists, visitors and critics into its vortex. Runcie sets her novel there as two journalists share a corporate flat. Alex becomes a notorious sensation; Sophie, our narrator, records the events that impel her to examine her life even as they inform her actions. Which is the protagonist? You decide. (Footnote: I considered not finishing this book. That would have been an error. Literary fiction is not always easy to read, nor should it be.

Welch tells Sullivan to get that vape out of her mouth. They talk about their kids, the ones who originally brought them together in the trenches of motherhood years ago.\n\nThis purple city in a deep red state is an unlikely spot for a rising voice on the left in new media. But as the left grapples for its counter to the rightwing media ecosystem, the two blonde suburban moms – who admit they look “Fox-coded” – offer one inroad. Across all platforms, they have several million followers, including 1.3m on YouTube and nearly 1m on Instagram. On the weekly Apple podcast charts in early October, they ranked as the second-most listened to among society and culture shows. On YouTube’s charts, their news show, IHIP news, ranked 18th among podcasts. They regularly chart as one of the fastest-growing podcasts.\n\n“Everyone always talking about we need to find the Joe Rogan of the left when they’re right here!” Gibson Johns, a podcaster and pop culture aficionado wrote on X with a photo of Welch and Sullivan.\n\nTrying to find a singular Joe Rogan on the left is the wrong question, Welch said. It’s “too myopic” – the left isn’t devout to a leader, like the right is to Trump. “The left needs to have a very large, diverse tent.” Their “cult,” as they often call their community, brings in “some of the gays, some of these white ladies that are getting radicalized”. They see other liberal podcasts as allies, with the more people consuming liberal media, whoever it is, the better.\n\n“Liberals have hobbies,” said the 51-year-old Welch. “Our whole identity isn’t hating conservatives … the Republican party presents the enemy, and they can just feast on it.”\n\nThe show launched in 2022 as an entertainment podcast, drawing followers who remembered their Bravo reality TV show. Its first episode, “Toddlers are Assholes,” focused on how toddlers are, well, assholes. They went viral for their funny rants soon after, but quickly blended politics into the show. Their political content caught the eyes of big-name Democrats, and they snagged guests including Mary Trump, Donald Trump’s niece, in 2023, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in early 2024, then Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, Gavin Newsom and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThey’re quick with salty language and nicknames. Trump looked “puffed up like a bubble tick”. JD Vance is “Lil Smokey,” a shorter version of “Smokey Eye Failed Drag Queen”. Childish people are “titty babies”.\n\n“You want to go low, we’re gonna go lower,” Welch said. “The integrity politics of being perfect as a liberal needs to stop, and we need to bully the shit out of these guys, because they respond to it.”\n\nTheir language and commentary elicits pushback and vitriol from liberals at times, said Sullivan, who is 55. But, Welch added, while they don’t want to punch down, they are “still going to play a brand of fuck-you politics”, something she wishes elected Democrats would do more often.\n\nTheir pivot from entertainment to politics happened naturally. Welch is a lifelong Democrat and atheist who grew up defending her beliefs in Oklahoma. For Sullivan, a former Republican who shed religion in recent years, the supreme court’s Dobbs decision, overturning the right to an abortion across the US, made her “so fucking mad at white women”.\n\nIn early episodes, listeners wrote in to tell them to stay out of politics and use fewer swear words. The president of a company they partnered with to sell ads told them not to talk about politics. In turn, they started talking about politics more and more. They dropped the “dead weight” of people who only came for entertainment, Welch said.\n\n“And it turns out, when you believe in something and you defend it vigorously, some people are going to dislike you for your beliefs, and that’s fine, but the people who like you, that turns into love, and you create a community,” she said.\n\nWelch’s first child and Sullivan’s second child were each other’s first best friends. They wanted to be together all the time, so Welch and Sullivan were together all the time while their husbands were “crazier than shithouse rats”. Welch’s husband, who Sullivan met in law school, was battling addiction, while Sullivan’s husband was frequenting sex workers and spending through their money. They’d pile into Sullivan’s three-row white suburban and cart the kids to gymnastics or pizza buffets.\n\nWelch became Sullivan’s “lifeline,” Sullivan said, “like the only person on the planet that I could trust with what was going on with me, so that made her safe no matter what.”\n\nSullivan described their bond in their book Life is a Lazy Susan of Shit Sandwiches: “The reason Jennifer and I banter so well is that we’ve been through a lot together. We have an Olympic-sized pool of combined tears, but there’s also been a lot of laughter.\n\n“We’ve traded in Jen’s porch for the podcast studio these days, and we’ve both quit smoking, but it’s basically the same idea: we talk through everything, even the scary stuff.”\n\nReligion at times stood between them, when Sullivan was still religious and right-leaning. At lunch, over chips and queso, Sullivan asked Welch: “Religion didn’t always come up with us, did it?” Welch responded: “You were always trying to get me to go to Bible study.” Sullivan described a “gradual evolution” away from her faith, which she told Welch about in 2020. “You could have knocked me over with a feather,” Welch said of the big reveal.\n\nNow, their podcast often includes laments against the conservative Christians seeking to use their religion to govern. “Once you get out of it, you become more turned off by it,” Sullivan said. Welch quipped: “She’s gotten worse than me.”\n\nWelch and Sullivan’s Bravo show, Sweet Home Oklahoma, ran for two seasons from 2017-2018, which gave them a small but dedicated built-in audience when they launched the podcast. Welch still works as an interior designer on high-end homes, though she’s more selective in what she takes on. Sullivan recently left her job as a divorce attorney because juggling a court schedule and clients with the growing podcast became too much.\n\nWelch financed the podcast, paying herself back over the course of a year. They use her building as a studio. She bought all the equipment. She didn’t want to be beholden to anyone or feel hesitant to dish out criticisms to whomever she chose. They can say what people are thinking, in terms they choose, because they are “untethered to anybody”.\n\nClips of them taking Democrats to task have gone viral this year, including a heated interview in which Welch went after Rahm Emanuel for abandoning trans people. Emanuel said of Democratic messaging: “The only room we were doing really well was the bathroom, and that’s the smallest room in the house.” Welch reacted with “pure, unadulterated anger,” enraged that Emanuel would throw trans people under the bus. At one point, Emanuel suggested people in red states with harsh anti-trans or anti-gay laws could move somewhere else if they wanted. Welch’s only regret about the interview is that she “didn’t chew his ass out over that”.\n\nIn a recent episode, she repeatedly asks a Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia whether he will take donations from the pro-Israel AIPac, a clip of which spread widely with the comment “Damn this is intense.” In another, she ran down a list of Democrats who took AIPac money. They regularly call for the party to embrace “moral clarity” on the Gaza war.\n\nOther clips in which they bashed Republicans sometimes make it into rightwing media. One rant where Welch said she’s had it with Trump voters who go to Mexican or Chinese restaurants while supporting deportations drew a comment from the White House: “Rich liberal white women love to pretend to be champions of diversity.”\n\nWhen their clips have ended up on rightwing media, they’ve received threats and harassing messages. “We voluntarily get up every day, we choose to do our podcast, so we’re not victims of any of what the commentary in the aftermath is,” Welch said. Comments will focus on their appearances or intellect. But what goes too far, Welch said, is receiving wishes of sexual violence, both against her and her children. She shut down email inquiries to her design firm. She doesn’t read her direct messages anymore.\n\n“Are my feelings hurt? Do I live in fear? No. Is it helpful for me to read all of this shit? No,” she said.\n\nThe life of the podcast\n\nI’ve Had It gets big-name guests through a combination of the politicians reaching out to pitch them and them seeking out people they want to talk to.\n\nKaren Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, joined an episode in September, to talk about her city under federal occupation. At the start of I’ve Had It, the hosts and guest say one thing they’ve “had it” with, and for Bass, it’s false depictions of Los Angeles. At one point, when they refer to Trump as “Canks,” Welch notes, “I know it’s probably beneath you, mayor.” They also play a game called “had it or hit it,” where guests weigh in on what they are cool with or sick of.\n\nWelch’s younger son is now in college in Los Angeles, she tells the mayor, and she’ll be there soon to visit. She’d love to meet in person, she says. Bass warmly agrees.\n\nIn addition to I’ve Had It, their flagship, they do a regular news video series called IHIP News for YouTube. In September,\n\nWhen rumors of Trump’s demise were rampant, they launched a “Canks Watch”, volleying over how much longer they expected the president to live and how they’d feel once he was gone. “Straight-up elated,” Sullivan said.\n\nTens of thousands tuned in live to hear their banter, and the video netted more than 400,000 views. The president, though, looked pretty normal. “He sounds almost coherent for him,” Sullivan said. “Goddamn it, he’s doing a lot better than I thought,” Welch said.\n\nTheir podcasts are not really for moderates - in an episode with Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayoral candidate, where Mamdani talks about his strategy of not browbeating voters who went for Trump, Welch responds with “guilty”.\n\nThey also run a Patreon and host a livestream with their Patreon subscribers weekly. They thank their “patriots, gay-triots, Black-triots, brown-triots” of about 100 people who sign on for an open Q&A-style conversation about their views on political topics and updates on their lives.\n\nGroups of their most ardent fans have met up to go for cocktails before their live shows. During meet-and-greets, they have had young queer people come up to them crying because they stand up strongly for the LGBTQIA+ community. Some have told them they see them as the mothers they wish had.\n\n“You go from an 18-year-old marginalized kid all the way to a Boomer, and there’s a unity in the messaging of being irritated about something, petty shit-talking, fighting for what’s right, and not giving a fuck what anybody thinks about it,” Welch said of their supporters.\n\nAfter one day of recordings, I jump in the car with Sullivan, who has some errands to run. We hit up a vape shop, where she restocks on cartridges and spearmint chapsticks. We then pick up her dogs – two French bulldogs and a Siberian husky, her divorce dog. “I’d much rather have the Siberian husky than the husband. It’s not even a close second,” she said. We chat a bit about her dating life, which sometimes comes up in their podcast, too. “My picker is so bad. Serial killer is the bar, and I continue to fall under it every time.”\n\nI then hang out with Welch, going to tennis lessons where she engages in friendly shit-talking with the instructor. Some journalists embed in warzones, she joked, and “we’re about to have a war right here”. She started playing tennis daily to combat long Covid after her doctor recommended a sport that included hand-eye coordination. We pick up her two Frenchies, one of which has his own Instagram page.\n\nThey both, on separate occasions, refer to the “yin and yang” of their relationship. Sullivan said she will defer to Welch on decisions if they’re on the fence. While it’s hard to be around anybody all the time, she said, they know how to communicate. “We rarely have disagreements,” Sullivan said. “When we do, we’re able to rationally talk about them. So overall, I would say far more positive than negative. But to say, oh, it’s easy, it’s all unicorns and rainbows, no.”\n\nDecamping to New York\n\nThey’ve grown their podcast in a a state that boasts how every county voted for Trump in 2024. Around Oklahoma City, which remains purple, they’re sometimes recognized loudly and proudly, or via whispers from “Democrats in the closet” afraid to outwardly show their politics.\n\nAt the tennis club recently, an older woman who Welch thought for sure was a Republican squeezed her hand and said “keep doing what you’re doing,” she recounted. “This is anecdotal, but if this is happening to rich white women in Oklahoma City, I can’t help but think that this isn’t happening all over the place,” she said.\n\nWhen Welch talked about these events in the Patreon stream, Sullivan said they gave her hope. But, she added, “I just found hope to be dangerous in these times.”\n\nThey want to keep expanding the podcast. Welch has become a frequent guest on TV news and commentary shows. The more she appears on these shows, the more requests she gets for others. But, she added, “we’re at an interesting intersection where our YouTube gets as many views as nighttime television does.”\n\nStill, the time is right for a big move – Welch is heading to New York City, renting an apartment starting in October and planning to spend most of her time there now that her kids have graduated from high school. Sullivan plans to do the same, looking for an apartment to rent there later this year. The podcast will continue.\n\nWelch has always felt like an outsider in Oklahoma as a progressive and an atheist. She’s found community there, building a group of like-minded friends, but still is bothered by the “hypocrisy” she sees among mutual friends who vote against their gay or lesbian friends.\n\nShe’s giving the New York experiment a year to decide whether it’s a good fit, with no expectations. It’s been a lifelong dream of hers, and she’s able to realize it now.\n\n“I’ve always been stuck here, and I’ve always felt like an outsider. I’ve always been harassed and ridiculed for my belief system, and it’s going to be nice to be around people where it’s not a big deal that I’m an atheist.”","summary":"Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan’s podcast I’ve Had It has risen up the charts and created a community with ‘a brand of fuck-you politics’\n\nWhen Donald Trump scheduled a press conference after a weekend in which rumors about his health swirled, two women in red-state Oklahoma launched a livestream for their more than 1 million followers on YouTube to speculate about the condition of “Cankles McTacoTits”, shortened to Canks “for expediency and spite”.\n\nIt was fitting for the profanity-laced, straight talking liberal podcast I’ve Had It that quipped, after interviewing Barack Obama, that the former president has “big dick energy”.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/05/ive-had-it-podcast-democrats-liberals","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f24d3acd1b368429381a72c2d5eb669e275395a5/0_46_2034_1627/master/2034.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-05 11:00:32","author":"Rachel Leingang","authors":["Rachel Leingang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.193},{"id":366397372,"title":"Beyond the fight for the House, here's what at stake in the Senate","text":"There's a reason for the fearsome redistricting fight raging across America. It's about Democrats trying to rein in Donald Trump and his rogue-elephant regime. Or, if you're the country's aspiring strongman, it's about avoiding accountability and sanction. That's why Trump and fellow Republicans are trying to rig the midterm election, by gerrymandering congressional lines in hopes of boosting the GOP's chances of keeping its tenuous hold on the House past 2026. California Democrats are seeking payback by redrawing the state's congressional lines in hopes of swiping five or more GOP-held seats. Voters will have their say on the matter Nov. 4, when they decide Proposition 50. Of course, there are two branches of Congress. Why, then, is there so much focus on the House? Simply put, it's because of the steep odds Democrats face trying to win control of the Senate, which are somewhere between slim and none — with slim last seen cinching his saddle before cantering out of town. Let's take a moment for a quick refresher. Every two years, all 435 House seats are on the ballot. Senate terms are staggered and run six years, so roughly a third of the chamber's 100 seats are up for a vote in each federal election. In 2026, there will be 35 Senate contests. Most won't be remotely competitive. In fact, more than two dozen of those races are effectively over before they begin, given the advantage one party holds over the other. Mississippi, for instance, will send a Democrat to the U.S. Senate the day that Delaware elects a Republican; both will occur right after Trump and Adam Schiff get inked with matching \"I Love L.A.\" tattoos. That leaves nine Senate races that are at least somewhat competitive. Of those, three are considered toss-ups: open-seat contests in Michigan and North Carolina and the race in Georgia, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is seeking a second term. Democrats need to gain four seats to take control of the Senate, meaning even if they win all three of those even-steven races — which is far from certain — they still need to successfully defend seats in Minnesota and New Hampshire and pick up at least one other GOP-held seat. That's where the going gets tough. Kamala Harris won Maine, which suggests Republican Susan Collins could be vulnerable. But the five-term senator has repeatedly managed to hang on, even in good Democratic years. The three other races are tougher still. Ohio used to be a major Midwestern battleground, but it's grown solidly Republican. Democrats landed their prized recruit, former Sen. Sherrod Brown, who narrowly lost his 2024 reelection bid and may be the only Democrat with a realistic shot at the seat. Still, he's facing an uphill fight in the special election against Republican Jon Husted, an ex-lieutenant governor who was appointed to replace Vice President JD Vance. In Iowa, where Republican Joni Ernst is retiring, GOP Rep. Ashley Hinson starts out the favorite in another state that's grown increasingly red. (Hinson, a USC grad and former KABC-TV intern, has taken to trash-talking the Golden State — \"I don’t want to see the country look like California\" — because that's what Republicans do these days.) Which leaves Texas, land of shattered Democratic dreams. It's been more than three decades since the party has won a statewide election. Ever since, Democrats have insisted this is the year they'd end their losing streak. They've tried various approaches. A \"dream team\" that consisted of a slate of Black, white and Latino nominees. A ticket topped by political celebrity Wendy Davis, of filibuster fame. An out-of-nowhere phenom by the name of Beto O'Rourke. All failed. This time, Democrats are hoping for an assist from the GOP. Republican Sen. John Cornyn is seeking his fifth term and faces the state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, in a primary that's already grown fierce and ugly. Paxton is MAGA down to the soles of his feet, which would normally give him a big advantage in a GOP primary. But his history — allegations of bribery and corruption, an impeachment trial, a messy divorce — have left him in bad odor with many Republicans. The GOP's Senate campaign committee and Majority Leader John Thune have aggressively thrown their weight behind Cornyn, though Trump has so far remained neutral. Democrats would love to run against Paxton, given polls suggesting a competitive race if he's the nominee. First, though, they'll have to sort out their own primary. Colin Allred, the former NFL linebacker who lost in November to Ted Cruz, is running again and faces James Talarico, a state representative and seminarian from the Austin area, who's became an online sensation with his godly persona and viral take-down of conservative pieties. O'Rourke also hasn't ruled out another try for Senate. Garry Mauro, a Democrat and former Texas land commissioner, is clear-eyed in assessing his party's prospects. \"If you run on the right issues and don't leave yourself a crazy radical ... then I think you have a real chance of building a winning race,\" he said. But \"to say this isn't a leaning-R state would be Pollyannish, and I'm not Pollyannish.\" Which means counting on the Lone Star to deliver a Democratic-run U.S. Senate is a bit like trusting a drunken gambler to preserve and protect your rent money. That's why Democrats are betting the House in hopes of corralling Trump.","summary":"Democrats need four seats to win control of the Senate but face a daunting political map.

As Democrats and Republicans spar over funding demands, hundreds of thousands of civil servants have been furloughed, including half of the nearly 86,000 employees at the US Department of Agriculture. The essential functions of the agency, like food inspections, will continue. However, other programs, such as the Farm Service Agency, which is responsible for distributing loans and financial aid to farmers, will be forced to furlough two-thirds of its employees. \n\nFor some US farmers — a group that Trump claims to champion — the shutdown, combined with one of the president’s central policies, couldn’t have come at a worse time. \n\nThe agriculture business can be volatile, as bad weather, pests, and disease can significantly reduce the amount of money a grower will bring in. Normally, the USDA would be tasked with easing some of the economic pain for farmers through various programs. The agency provides loans, offers disaster assistance and makes other payments. USDA also plays a role in international trade agreements and negotiations. However, all those programs and negotiations are now on hold. \n\nThis time, the financial hit is purely political. \n\n“The tariffs are an insult to injury,” Paul Mitchell, a professor of agriculture and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told HuffPost. \n\nOn the campaign trail, the president spoke endlessly about enacting tariffs, a type of tax on goods imported from other countries that consumers eventually pay. When he returned to power in January, he began zealously pursuing the policy, including by slapping massive tariffs on China, one of our biggest trade partners.\n\nHe assured farmers, who rely on China to purchase their crops, that this would be a financial boon. \n\n“Our farmers are going to have a field day,” he said in March during a joint address to Congress. “...to our farmers, have a lot of fun, I love you.”\n\nBut while Trump has been bragging about how tariffs are making the US extremely wealthy, China has made its own move: imposing its own tariffs on the United States, sparking a trade war and causing the price of everyday items like toys and clothing, many of which are manufactured in China, to jump. Additionally, the Chinese government is now refusing to buy soybeans from the United States — a significant blow to the farming community.\n\n“Corn and soybeans dominate US agriculture. It’s half of the country’s crop revenue,” Mitchell said. \n\n“China buys about 60% of the world’s traded soybean,” he added. “So, when China says they’re not buying our soybean that really hurts our exports.”\n\nDuring the 2024 soybean season, which typically runs from September to February or March, China purchased $12.6 billion worth of soybeans from the United States, according to an analysis by the New York Times. This season, that number is $0.\n\nTrump, at least, knows there’s a problem. \n\n“The Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for ‘negotiating’ reasons only, not buying,” he wrote on Truth Social. He has suggested a bailout for farmers, stating that the aid could be funded by the revenue generated from tariffs. So far, Trump’s tariffs have raked in more than $188 billion, which is nowhere near enough to replace federal income taxes as Trump has suggested.\n\nIt’s a belated attempt at softening the blow for a constituency that Trump looks to as part of his base. An Investigate Midwest analysis of the 2024 election found that nearly 78% of farming-dependent counties voted for Trump. In Iowa, which is the second-largest soybean producer in the country, Trump beat Kamala Harris by 14 points. \n\n“More than 75 million Americans — including many farmers — voted for President Trump in 2024. Many of his priorities — from reducing wasteful spending and cutting regulatory red tape to expanding biofuels — are widely supported in rural America,” Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam, said on Thursday in a lengthy statement. “But the administration’s trade strategy has been a bitter pill for agriculture and Iowa farmers.”\n\nWhile farmers wait for assistance, Trump and Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, are looking for ways to punish Democrats for the shutdown and pin the blame on their political opponents. \n\nThe Trump administration has threatened to permanently lay off government staffers as punishment for the shutdown, including those at the USDA. Even though Republican senators are reportedly uneasy with the prospect of doing something so politically toxic, Vought told agencies to prepare plans to permanently lay off workers in the event of a shutdown.\n\nOn Thursday, Senate majority leader Senator John Thune (Republican, South Dakota) acknowledged that the shuttering of offices at USDA would, once again, impact farmers, including those in his state, who already needed help. Trump won South Dakota by 20 points.\n\n“They’re being put into a situation where they’re going to have to make decisions that are not good for some of the constituencies that people represent out there,” he said about the Trump administration.\n\nBut Trump has sought to shield his own priorities from shutdown fallout. According to Politico, the administration has ensured government departments involved in immigration and trade — his pet issues — are relatively unscathed during the shutdown.\n\nThe White House responded to HuffPost’s request for comment first with a boilerplate automatic reply blaming the press office’s staff shortage on the “Democrat Shutdown,” following up with another email referring HuffPost to the USDA. The agriculture department also sent a similar automatic reply blaming “Radical Left Democrat shutdown” for any delays.\n\nThen the agency sent HuffPost a lengthy statement continuing to blame the Democrats for the shutdown and linking to which programs are still functioning during the shutdown. \n\n“The Democrats are blocking billions in disaster relief payments from reaching farmers – relief they voted for. Senate Democrats shut down the government on the eve of one of the worst farm economies,” a USDA spokesperson said. “America’s farmers and producers are left stranded because the Democrats are prioritizing billions in healthcare for illegal immigrants and transgender surgeries.”\n\nThe Republican Party has repeatedly and baselessly claimed that the Democrats want to fund health care for undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn the meantime, Republicans are assuring farmers that help is coming, while not explicitly mentioning why exactly farmers need help. \n\nUS Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins acknowledged the pain farmers were feeling on Tuesday. “Right now, the farm economy is not in a good place. We’re working around the clock,” she said during an interview on Fox Business. “The president has committed to supporting our farmers, and we’ll have an announcement on that very soon, likely next week.”\n\nShe was likely alluding to Trump’s proposed bailout, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also said to expect news on the bailout next week. Trump is reportedly weighing aid to the tune of $10 billion.\n\n“The farmers will take the money, but they’re upset,” Mitchell said. “They’re wondering why we can’t just have a fair market.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Trump’s trade war has led to economic pain for the country’s agriculture sector. During his first term, the Trump administration shelled out $16 billion in aid to farmers stuck in the middle of his trade war with China in 2019.\n\nTrump has for years insisted that he loves farmers, but he’s got a funny way of showing it.\n\nWhile soybean growers are feeling the financial pressure, Bessent was touting a bailout — but to Argentina, which recently sold a large amount of soybean to China at a discounted rate. The Trump administration views the country as an ally since the election of Javier Milei, a right-wing former pundit who advocates for hardline immigration policies and unfettered capitalism.\n\n“Argentina is a systemically important US ally in Latin America, and the @USTreasury stands ready to do what is needed within its mandate to support Argentina. All options for stabilization are on the table,” Bessent posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, late last month. The bailout is reportedly set to be a $20 billion aid package. \n\nSenator Chuck Grassley (Republican, Iowa), who represents a state with a lot of soybean farmers, wasn’t pleased. \n\n“Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers’ biggest market???” Senator Chuck Grassley (Republican, Iowa) said on X. “We shld use leverage at every turn to help hurting farm economy Family farmers shld be top of mind in negotiations by representatives of USA”\n\nAnd some farmers are speaking out specifically against Trump’s trade policies.\n\n“Agriculture is our foundation here in Nebraska and many states in the Midwest,” one farmer who produces corn and soybeans told ABC News. “If agriculture is failing here, everything is going to fail.”\n\nThere is unlikely to be a big rebellion amongst farmers in MAGA country — Trump’s last tariff debacle during his first term, when he similarly imposed a levy on Chinese goods, causing the country to retaliate, didn’t seem to dissuade farmers from voting for him. And the Republican senators worried about their constituencies seem unwilling to place the blame directly on Trump. \n\nBut Mitchell says farmers are now quietly rethinking the Trump administration’s strategies. \n\n“We already have enough problems,” as he puts it. “Why are you making more for us?”","summary":"President Donald Trump listens to a question from a reporter as he speaks after signing an executive order regarding TikTok in the Oval Office at the White House, Thursday, Sept. 25, 2025, in Washington. Donald Trump’s policies are screwing over a core part of his base — again. \n\nThe nation is only a few days into a government shutdown, with no clear end in sight. As Democrats and Republicans spar over funding demands, hundreds of thousands of civil servants have been furloughed, including half of the nearly 86,000 employees at the US Department of Agriculture. The essential functions of the agency, like food inspections, will continue. However, other programs, such as the Farm Service Agency, which is responsible for distributing loans and financial aid to farmers, will be forced to furlough two-thirds of its employees. \n\nFor some US farmers — a group that Trump claims to champion — the shutdown, combined with one of the president’s central policies, couldn’t have come at a worse time. \n\nThe agriculture busi","url":"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/trumps-tariffs-hurt-farmers-who-voted-for-him_uk_68e215d6e4b060c19f1aa603","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68e0242a18000078d35d10e5.jpeg?cache=64engcifOC&ops=500_281%2Cscalefit_1200_630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-05 06:56:06","author":"Nathalie Baptiste","authors":["Nathalie Baptiste"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":366313340,"title":"Bill Maher rips Kamala Harris for playing victim over campaign loss in her new book: ‘Nothing is Kamala’s fault’","text":"Bill Maher ripped former Vice President Kamala Harris for blaming everyone else in her new book for her own shortcomings and failed presidential campaign.\n\n“The Real Time with Bill Maher” host accused Harris of playing victim over naming her first-person memoir, which tackled her abbreviated White House campaign, “107 Days,” where she notably targeted former President Biden and running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \n\n“It should’ve been called ‘Everyone Sucks But Me,'”Maher quipped during the show, which aired on Friday night.\n\n“She only had 107 days to win.

Gavin Newsom to get his backing among a handful of other Democrats.\n\nThe presidential hopeful contacted the blue state leader using an unknown number, but Newsom said he was “hiking” and never returned the phone call, according to the memoir.\n\n“He was asked for his endorsement but texted back, ‘Hiking, will call back,’ but then never did,” Maher said. “And then he didn’t even ask her to prom.”\n\nHarris also revealed that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was her first choice as her running mate instead of Walz, but said that the country wasn’t ready for both a black, female president and a gay vice president.\n\nButtigieg “would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man,” Harris wrote. \n\n“America itself lets Kamala down by not being ‘ready’ for the running mate she really wanted, Pete Buttigieg, so she’s stuck with the Home Depot paint salesman,” Maher said, referring to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “And the rest is HERstory.\n\n“Poor Kamala. We made her the star of a rom-com and didn’t even give her a gay best friend.”\n\nIn the memoir, Harris recalled platters of cupcakes decorated with the words “Madame President” for the election watch party, but the ill-fated decorations were removed by an aide before they were handed out to the losing campaign staffers.\n\n“Oh, jeez, it’s like a scene from ‘Bridget Jones Runs for President,” Maher said.\n\nThe host chided his own talk show television colleagues at “The View” for being quiet about Jimmy Kimmel’s three-day suspension from the air after his comments following the assassination of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“It wasn’t a good look for the women party that all the guys were speaking out for Jimmy Kimmel when Trump went after him, except on the women’s show, where for five days the outspoken hosts were suddenly as quiet as a geisha,” Maher said.\n\n“Then on the fifth day they rose and said, ‘No one silences us.’ No one had to; you silenced yourself,” he added. “Five days?

Largely in lockstep about these matters, the candidates highlighted their political resumes and life stories to try to create contrasts and curry favor with attendees. Former state Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon, in his first gubernatorial forum since entering the race in late September, leaned into his experience as the first millennial elected to the state Legislature. “I feel like my experience and my passion uniquely positioned me in this race to ride a lane that nobody else can ride, being a millennial and being young and having a different perspective,” said Calderon, 39. Concerns about his four children’s future as well as the state’s reliance on Washington, D.C., drove his decision to run for governor after choosing not to seek reelection to the Legislature in 2020. “I want [my children] to have opportunity. I want them to have a future. I want life to be better. I want it to be easier,” said Calderon, whose family has deep roots in politics. State leaders must focus “on D.C.-proofing California. We cannot continue to depend on D.C. and expect that they're going to give a s— about us and what our needs are, because they don't.” Former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who also served as the state’s attorney general after a 24-year stint in Congress, argued that it is critical to elect a governor who has experience. “Would you let someone who's never flown a plane tell you, ‘I can fly that plane back to land’ if they've never done it before?” Becerra asked. “Do you give the keys to the governor's office to someone who hasn't done this before?” He contrasted himself with other candidates in the race by invoking a barking chihuahua behind a chain-link fence. “Where's the bite?” he said, after citing his history, such as suing President Trump 122 times, and leading the sprawling federal health bureaucracy during the pandemic. “You don't just grow teeth overnight.” Calderon and Becerra were among six Democratic candidates who spoke at length to about 150 California leaders of multiple chapters of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The union has more than 200,000 members in California and is being battered by the federal government shutdown, the state’s budget deficit and impending healthcare strikes. AFSCME is a powerful force in California politics, providing troops to knock on voters’ doors and man phone banks. The forum came as the gubernatorial field to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom is in flux. Former Vice President Kamala Harris announced earlier this summer that she has opted against running for the seat. Former state Senate leader Toni Atkins suspended her gubernatorial campaign in late September. Rumors continue to swirl about whether billionaire businessman Rick Caruso or Sen. Alex Padilla will join the field. “I am weighing it. But my focus is first and foremost on encouraging people to vote for Proposition 50,” the congressional redistricting matter on the November ballot, Padilla told the New York Times in an interview published Saturday. “The other decision? That race is not until next year. So that decision will come.” Wealthy Democratic businessman Stephen J. Cloobeck and Republican Riverside Sheriff Chad Bianco declined an invitation to participate in the forum, citing prior commitments. The union will consider an endorsement at a future conference, said Matthew Maldonado, executive director for District Council 36, which represents 25,000 workers in Southern California. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa leaned into his longtime roots in labor before he ran for office. But he also alluded to tensions with unions after being elected mayor in 2005. Labeled a “scab” when he crossed picket lines the following year during a major city workers' strike, Villaraigosa also clashed with unions over furloughs and layoffs during the recession. His relationship with labor hit a low in 2010 when Villaraigosa called the city’s teachers union, where he once worked, “the largest obstacle to creating quality schools.” “I want you to know something about me. I'm not going to say yes to every darn thing that everybody comes up to me with, including sometimes the unions,” Villaraigosa said. “When I was mayor, they'll tell you sometimes I had to say no. Why? I wasn't going to go bankrupt, and I knew I had to protect pensions and the rest of it.” He pledged to work with labor if elected governor. Labor leaders asked most of the questions at the forum, with all of the candidates being asked about the same topics, such as if they supported and would campaign for a proposed state constitutional amendment to help UC workers with down-payment loans for houses. “Hell yes,” said former Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine, who teaches at UC Irvine’s law school and benefited from a program created by state university leaders to allow faculty to buy houses priced below the market rate in costly Orange County because the high cost of housing in the region was an obstacle in recruiting professors. “I get to benefit from UC Irvine's investment in their professionals and professors and professional staff housing, but they are not doing it for everyone,” she said, noting workers such as clerks, janitors and patient-care staff don’t have access to similar benefits. State Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who entered the gathering dancing to Dr. Dre and Tupac’s “California Love,” agreed to support the housing loans as well as to walk picket lines with tens of thousands of Kaiser health employees expected to go on strike later this month. “I will be there,” Thurmond responded, adding that he had just spoken on the phone with Kaiser’s chief executive, and urged him to meet labor demands about staffing, pay, retirement and benefits, especially in the aftermath of their work during the pandemic. “Just get it done, damn it, and give them what they're asking for.” Former state Controller Betty Yee agreed to both requests as well, arguing that the healthcare employers are focused on profit at the expense of patient care. “Yes, absolutely,” she said when asked about joining the Kaiser picket line. “Shame on them. You cannot be expected to take care of others if you cannot take care of yourselves.”","summary":"Democratic candidates for governor focus on affordability and healthcare at labor forum in San Diego.

I am for you'.\n\nHer rhetorical pivot comes after many national Democrats, including Newsom, have said it is unfair for trans girls to play high school sports.","summary":"Bill Maher slammed Kamala Harris for not taking responsibility for her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

In the official trailer, he jokes about how much shoplifting has changed since he were a kid.\n\nWhat Comedy Specials Will It Remind You Of?: His onstage confidence may draw favorable comparisons to the late great Bernie Mac, and when you notice how Earthquake loves to slap the microphone on his leg to punctuate his own enjoyment at a punchline, you can see how his mannerisms have influenced Chappelle.\n\nMemorable Jokes: While he opens by reminding the crowd that Atlanta “is my comedy home,” he makes his actual home in Los Angeles, which means friends and fans alike wondered whether his place survived the fires from this January. \n\nIf only?!? “Divorce took my house!” he jokes, adding he wishes the fires had claimed his former property.“Give me the justice that the courts refused to do.”\n\nYou likely haven’t heard rationale for releasing R. Kelly from prison like you’ll hear from Earthquake. He not only cites Sean “Puffy” Combs in his peculiar defense, but also suggests that he’d never befall the same fate as those infamous hip-hoppers. “I’m confident because I paid for all my pussy,” he cracks.\n\nHe also defends LeBron James as a great father for getting his son, Bronny, on the Los Angeles Lakers to play alongside him, comparing it to how he treated his own son when he was attending and then graduating from college.\n\nAnd he name-drops Jamie Foxx and his recent health scare as proof to bolster his case that every man needs a reliable woman by his side in case everything goes away, whether it be financially or physically.\n\nOur Take: You’re not likely to see too many comedy specials that double as both life advice and financial planning, but perhaps that’s testament to Earthquake’s elder status now. He can still get down and dirty describing his sexual exploits. And yet he now finds himself wondering whether he should be saving up for an unknown amount of years ahead of him, or going balls-to-the-wall and enjoying whatever time he has left.\n\nThough he doesn’t quite go after Trump and make this an explicitly political performance, race and politics is always connected to his observations.\n\nHe does advise Latinos in America to go into hiding for the next few years, joking: “I think I speak for all black people right now: Good luck.” But he’s not really joking, noting that he knows that cruel injustice is always just around the corner for black Americans.\n\nOf the current president, Earthquake claims: “he ain’t playing.” His diagnosis of the 2024 election results isn’t so much an indictment of the Democrats, as it is befuddlement over what happened to the expected wave of support from women’s groups, from sororities to the Swifties and the Beyhive, who were supposed to sweep Vice President Kamala Harris into the Oval Office? He believes they were no match for the white man, saying there’s no such thing in America as an unqualified white man: “His pigmentation is his qualification.” \n\nHow deep does white privilege still run in these streets in 2025? In a bit much earlier in his set, Earthquake suggests he has seen it even while walking the streets of Portland, Ore., and remarking on how many unhoused white folks he saw there. Somehow he wasn’t worried about their welfare as he still was about his own.\n\n“You could just tell they had mothers and fathers and dreams,” he jokes of them, adding: “All you need is a shower and a suit and you’ll be my supervisor by tomorrow.”\n\nOur Call: STREAM IT. His catchphrase of a refrain has long been “these ain’t jokes.” Somehow that feels truer now more than ever. \n\nSean L. McCarthy works the comedy beat.

'In the United States, President Donald Trump launched more than 100 verbal attacks on the media during his election campaign.'\n\nSuch sentiments might be expected from a liberal speaking in Scandinavia but the man's words will reverberate at the White House.\n\nThey were spoken by Jørgen Watne Frydnes who, above all others, will determine whether President Trump is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nFrydnes, a human rights advocate, is the Secretary General of PEN Norway, a charity defending freedom of expression, and was appointed by the country's parliament as the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAt 11am local time on October 10, he will make the announcement at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo.\n\nThe winner is decided by Frydnes and four other members of the committee, also appointed by parliament. If they cannot reach a consensus, it will be decided by a majority vote.\n\nAn analysis of past statements by the five voters suggests three are likely to be against Trump.\n\nHowever, despite that, there is still a chance it could go his way.\n\nThe vice chair of the committee has previously expressed sentiments that could be viewed as sympathetic by the White House.\n\nAnd where the fifth vote stands is unclear, but it is held by an anti-EU former politician who is not considered a liberal in Norway.\n\nAccording to the prediction website Kalshi the current favorite for the prize, with a 24 percent chance, is Sudan's Emergeny Response Rooms, which has provided humanitarian aid during the civil war.\n\nOther top contenders include Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the International Court of Justice, and Doctors Without Borders.\n\nPresident Trump is the joint fifth favorite, roughly tied with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThis week, Thunberg, 22, was arrested when Israel intercepted a flotilla of 40 boats on the way to Gaza. She is expected to be deported back to Europe.\n\nTrump has previously mocked Thunberg as a 'strange person' who should 'go to an anger management class.'\n\nAdding spice to the mix, in the background, an extraordinary war of words has been going on between the influential left-wing husband of one of the committee members, and the vice chair.\n\nThe anti-Trump sentiment on the committee is perhaps not surprising, considering the president's lack of popularity in Norway.\n\nResearch by Statista shows only 10 percent of Norwegians would have cast a ballot for Trump over Kamala Harris in the 2024 election if they had been eligible to vote.\n\nA Nobel committee vote not expected to go to Trump belongs to Gry Larsen, the former leader of the Norwegian Labour Party's Workers' Youth League.\n\nOn November 2, 2020, the day before the US election, Larsen posted a picture of herself on Facebook wearing a Trump-style red hat, but emblazoned with the words 'Make Human Rights Great Again.'\n\nEarlier, in 2017, writing on X about Trump's abortion policies, she said: 'Trump is putting millions of lives at risk.'\n\nA third vote considered unlikely is Kristin Clemet who, even though she has been a prominent figure in Norway's Conservative Party, seems to have made her opinion of Trump clear on social media.\n\nThe day after the January 6, 2021 riot at the U.S, Capitol she wrote on social media: 'Strange to hear that no one has understood that Trump is dangerous.'\n\nIn 2022 she posted that an 18-year-old had said: 'I'm happier that we can have a king and queen than that we could have such presidents who can suddenly wreck the country.'\n\nIn May this year she wrote: 'After just over 100 days as president (Trump) is well underway in dismantling American democracy and he is doing everything he can to tear down the liberal and rules-based world order.'\n\nBut there is hope for Trump yet.\n\nIn 2017 Asle Toje, an academic now the vice chair of the committee, wrote an article headlined: 'Trump is no Hitler.'\n\nIn it, he said: 'The American president is part of a broader change. It is the liberal order that is falling.'\n\nSince then he has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from Clemet's husband, Michael Tetzschner, a major figure in the Conservative Party and the former mayor of Oslo.\n\nIn April, Tetzschner savaged Toje in an article in Norway's biggest newspaper, Aftenposten, suggesting he would 'thrive well' in right wing European movements like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) or with French politician Marine Le Pen.\n\n'The anxiety of America's allies and best friends that the values ​​that the United States and the rest of the West have built on are now being attacked daily by Trump and his circle,' Tetzschner wrote.\n\n'When Toje is silent about this, I perceive him as a supporter of a political direction that the Americans themselves will distance themselves from when the dust has settled, as they also did after the McCarthy era.'\n\nTetzschner went on: 'True friends of the United States should be concerned that the United States...has been given a leadership that undermines its own institutions.\n\n'It treats allies as enemies, endangers the economy and people's savings, and strengthens the enemies of the United States and the rest of the West. That Toje is not worried speaks for itself.'\n\nA month earlier, at the Conservative Party's national conference, Tetzschner called Trump 'frighteningly incompetent.'\n\nBut there remain signs that Trump is not out of the running.\n\nLast month, Toje said the ultimate winner ends up being 'very rarely anyone's first choice.'\n\nAsked by a newspaper in Dubai about the prospects of a 'political figure' getting the prize, he pointed out that one of the first Nobel Peace Prizes was awarded to President Theodore Roosevelt for brokering peace between Russia and Japan in 1905, and that it had been 'hugely controversial.'\n\nToje added: 'Even then there was so much tension about the dangers of giving the Nobel Peace Prize to politicians. But ultimately, it is practicing politicians who have the power to bring about change.\n\n'It is one of the challenges we are always facing. You would be right in saying the prizes awarded to practicing politicians have been most controversial but also most important.'\n\nToje did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Mail. \n\nThe fifth vote on the committee belongs to Anne Enger, 75, a former acting Prime Minister of Norway.\n\nShe previously led the Centre Party which, as its name suggests, is in the political middle and also particularly represents the interests of farmers.\n\nEnger also led the 'No to EU' campaign against Norway joining Europe in a referendum in 1994.\n\nShe appears to have never made any public comments about Trump. President Trump himself has spoken many times about the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nPrevious US Presidents who have won it are Barack Obama, Jimmy Carter, Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nBut Trump. perhaps having been made aware of the makeup of the committee, seems resigned to not winning.\n\nOn Tuesday he said he had solved eight wars in eight months, including a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\n'That's pretty good. Nobody's ever done that. Would you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,' he said.\n\n'They'll give it to some guy that didn't do a damn thing, they'll give it to a guy that wrote a book about the mind of Donald Trump and what it took to solve the war.\n\n'But we'll see what happens. But it's be a big insult to our country. I don't want it. I want the country to get it, should get it.'\n\nThere are 338 nominees for the prize in 2025, consisting of 244 individuals nd 94 organizations\n\nAccording to the 1895 will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel the prize should go to 'whoever 'has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.\n\nKristian Berg Harpviken, the committee's secretary, who takes part in the deliberations but does not vote, said: 'They will look at the world, see what is happening, what are the global trends, what are the main concerns, what are the most promising processes that we see.\n\n'And processes here can mean anything from a specific peace process to a new type of international agreement that is under development or that has recently been adopted.'\n\nAccording to the prediction website Kalshi the current favorite for the prize, with a 24 percent chance, is Sudan's Emergeny Response Rooms, which has provided humanitarian aid during the civil war.\n\nOther top contenders include Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the International Court of Justice, and Doctors Without Borders.\n\nPresident Trump is the joint fifth favorite alongside Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, but ahead of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.","summary":"Five Norwegians will decide if Trump wins the Nobel Peace Prize and what they really think about him is astonishing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15148761/trump-nobel-peace-prize.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/30/18/102579571-0-image-a-18_1759251819547.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/02/666598203428224801/1024x576_MP4_666598203428224801.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-04 20:44:12","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.007},{"id":366223332,"title":"In Every Government Shutdown, the Media Are Eager Democrat Helpers","text":"If the national media can be counted on to spin anything dramatically toward the Democrats, it’s a government shutdown. They feel passionately that the Democrats are the party of government, and the Republicans are the haters of government, so who naturally favors shutting it all down?\n\nEven before the shutdown occurred, NPR and PBS issued their poll warning Republicans would get more of the blame than Democrats. That’s why those partisan hacks deserved defunding. A substantial minority would blame both parties, because the independents told NPR, “They’re just fighting like two little kids.”\n\nBut pinning blame on Republicans is the perennial goal of press coverage. During the 1995-1996 shutdown, ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts (and CNN’s World News) ran 48 stories in which reporters assigned blame: 23 blaming Republicans, and 25 blaming both Republicans and then-President Bill Clinton. Not one single story blamed Clinton alone.\n\nBroadcast networks blamed Republicans in the 2013 shutdown under Barack Obama, and the 2019 shutdown under Donald Trump. It was’’t just there. In 2013, Republicans were “putting on their suicide vests,” said British journalist Tina Brown on CNN. They’re called “the suicide caucus,” proclaimed NBC anchor Brian Williams on David Letterman’s show. It’s “economic terrorism,’ insisted MSNBC blowhard Ed Schultz.\n\nThey don’t hide whose side they are taking. CNN anchor Pamela Brown—whose dad was a Democrat governor of Kentucky—tried to “fact-check” Speaker Mike Johnson on Thursday morning.\n\n“All right, we’re listening here to Speaker Johnson. He’s trying to frame the shutdown as a Democratic shutdown. He also falsely claimed that Democrats want to give health care, extend health care to illegal immigrants. That is not true. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for federal health care programs.”\n\nHours later, after House Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke on the Capitol steps, CNN turned to repeater-not-reporter Arlette Saenz on the Hill, and she merely regurgitated all the Democrat talking points. No one “fact-checked” anything.\n\nThe “independent fact-checkers,” including CNN’s Daniel Dale, pounced on any claims that the Democrats shut down the government over their favoritism toward illegal aliens. PolitiFact threw a “False” flag at Vice President JD Vance. Actually, it is true that the federal government currently pays for health care for “noncitizens.” Democrats object to Trump’s moves to stop it.\n\nRepublicans posted video of a 2019 Democrat presidential debate where Savannah Guthrie nudged: “Raise your hand if your government plan would provide health insurance for undocumented immigrants.” Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and everyone else on that stage raised their hand.\n\nRepublicans also posted the state government of New York—home of Jeffries and Senate Democrat Leader Charles Schumer—advertised that it has an insurance program through “Medicaid Managed Care” that gives health insurance to illegal immigrants over 65. They promoted “a more comprehensive benefit package for this population. … The new insurance adds preventive and primary care benefits, including routine doctor visits, recommended screenings, lab tests, wellness services, prescription drugs and supplies, and more.”\n\nThe actual details over the trend of federal spending—always rising dramatically —are treated as boring. How many journalists fixate on the annual deficit, or the accumulated national debt? That’s not a serious question. Don’t be a nerd. Reporters just want to cover this like it’s a rhetorical boxing match that Republicans are always going to lose.\n\nDemocrat politicians feel the media bias enables them to be self-righteous holdouts in a shutdown, knowing they have a protection racket in the press corps. They pose as the reasonable moderates facing extremist “terrorists.” Then they wonder why the media’s trust ratings are in the toilet.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Mikie Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign is imploding","text":"Quantus Polling, which was the most accurate of the 2024 presidential election, nailing the exact number of electoral votes President Donald Trump would receive (312), shows Sherrill and Ciattarelli in a dead heat. That same polling firm showed Sherrill with a 10-point lead back in early September. Emerson’s most recent poll also has the candidates tied. \n\nLIVE UPDATES: GOVERNMENT ENTERS SHUTDOWN WITH NO DEAL IN SIGHT\n\nSo why is the race tightening? Three factors are in play, and none are good for Sherill. \n\nFirst, Sherrill had a patently horrible debate against Ciattarelli last month, with the lowlight coming when Sherrill, after voting for a House resolution honoring Charlie Kirk‘s legacy, proceeded to lie about the slain activist while dumping on his memory in one of the most disgusting displays we’ve seen out of any politician lately. \n\n“Charlie Kirk was advocating for a Christian nationalist government and to roll back the rights of women and Black people — this flies in the face of every value I hold dear and that I fight for,” she declared. \n\nRoll back the rights for women and Black people? When did he even remotely advocate for anything like that? She said this just one week after Charlie was executed in front of his family. She then took the opportunity to criticize Trump.\n\n“On one hand, he denounced Kirk’s politically motivated killing, while on the other hand, he is instigating a witch hunt worthy of Joseph McCarthy to shut down the free speech rights of anyone who disagrees with Kirk’s racist, anti-American views,” she said.\n\nAnti-American. \n\nCharlie Kirk was arguably the biggest advocate of the First Amendment and the free exchange of ideas. Sherrill has yet to offer even one example of racist or anti-American rhetoric from Kirk, because there aren’t any. \n\nProblem No. 2 for the Democrat is her Kamala Harris-like explanation about how exactly she made $7 million in stock trades in recent years after being elected to Congress seven years ago. “I also don’t trade individual stocks,” she said in a radio interview with Charlamagne Tha God. “It’s been widely reported, [but] we don’t trade individual stocks. I don’t think anybody in Congress should quite frankly.”\n\nThat also is a lie. In 2021, Sherrill paid a $400 fine for violating the federal STOCK Act by failing to disclose stock sales. \n\nCharlamagne followed up by asking her to explain the $7 million she made in the market. “I haven’t. I don’t believe I did, but I would have to go and see what that [report] was alluding to…”\n\nTRUMP ADVISES THAT ANYONE BURNING AMERICAN FLAG WILL BE IMPRISONED FOR A YEAR \n\nYou don’t believe you did? Not exactly a strong defense. This is also a devastating development when considering most polls show about 90% of registered voters do not think Congress should trade stocks. Sherrill made her boatload already, hence why she would have no problem voting for such a resolution now because there’s an election that needs to be done. \n\nA New York Times investigation in 2022 found that Sherrill had 12 potential conflicts with the stock trades she claims she never made. “Ms. Sherrill reported both buying and selling shares of several defense contractors while she was a member of the House Armed Services Committee. She also sold shares of Alphabet and Meta in 2019 while she was the chairwoman of the oversight subcommittee of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, which has held hearings about online disinformation,” the report reads. \n\nOverall, Sherrill bought and sold several major defense stocks during her time on the Armed Services Committee, including Raytheon, Honeywell, and General Dynamics. And given the amount of money she made in such a short period of time, it’s fair to question if she simply has the stock picking prowess of Gordon Gekko-meets-Paul Pelosi, or if something nefarious happened here. \n\nProblem No. 3 for Sherrill is the fact that she wasn’t allowed to participate in her own graduation ceremony due to a cheating scandal, nor was her husband. “I didn’t turn in some of my classmates, so I didn’t walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor,” Sherrill explained after a report in the New Jersey Globe called her out on it.\n\nUntil the report came out, Sherrill never talked about the scandal publicly. \n\nWhen asked if she would release her disciplinary records publicly to show that her explanation around not ratting out her classmates checked out, she refused to do so. \n\n“What we learned today is that she was part of it in some way, shape or form. Come clean, release the records. Tell us what’s in your disciplinary records. I think the people of New Jersey deserve that,” Ciattatrelli said on Fox News this week. \n\nAnd he’s right. \n\nAttacking Charlie Kirk and lying in the process. \n\nShady stock trades of defense and technology companies while on the Armed Services Committee. \n\nA cheating scandal that isn’t going away, while Sherrill is acting like someone with something to hide. \n\nIt’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. \n\nAnd as the race in this blue state heads to the finish, Ciattarelli has all the momentum while his opponent is barely hanging on. \n\nAnd she has no one to blame but herself.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Wade was overturned.\n\nOnly 2 percent of Americans say abortion is their top concern, according to a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll, down from 7 percent in the same poll a year ago and 5 percent in 2023. Among them, 57 percent want abortion mostly or completely outlawed; 39 percent say abortion should be banned in all cases, compared with only 10 percent of the general population.\n\nThe findings suggest a possible reversion to the status quo before Roe’s fall. People who prioritize abortion now appear more conservative than Americans generally.\n\n“If there is a candidate who is not for protecting life — which is the very basic foundation of everything, is life — then I cannot support that person and could not vote for that person,” said Lisa Gormont, 58, who lives outside of State College, Pennsylvania, and said abortion is her top issue.\n\nHistorically, voters who prioritized abortion wanted politicians to outlaw it. But the 2022 Supreme Court decision ending federal abortion rights — which ushered in near-total bans in conservative-led states across the country — inverted that trend.\n\nRelated | Anti-abortion groups have a new strategy to end telehealth abortion\n\nFor the past two years, most voters who made abortion their top issue said they believed it should be legal in most or all cases. Last year, the 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll found that 59 percent of voters who said abortion was their top issue wanted it legal in all cases, and another 22 said it should be legal in most cases. In 2023, 48 percent of those abortion-prioritizing voters said it should be legal always, and another 20 percent said it should be in most cases.\n\nDemocrats campaigned furiously on abortion rights, with many candidates highlighting the issue in the 2022 midterms and then-Vice President Kamala Harris making abortion protections a centerpiece of her 2024 presidential bid. Republicans, by contrast, largely avoided the issue, with President Donald Trump distancing himself from conservative calls for national abortion restrictions.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has spoken little about abortion. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has indicated some openness to limiting access to the procedure, most recently in a September 19 letter saying that the federal government is reviewing the approval for a key abortion drug and may restrict when it can be used.\n\nAbout 56 percent of Americans who called abortion their top issue said they approve of Trump, compared with only 43 percent of the general public, the poll found. But some, like Gormont, expressed some dissatisfaction with his approach to abortion. In general, she said, Trump appears less focused on abortion than on other issues — and as a result has done less to restrict it than she would like.\n\n“There are so many other things that take his attention, and I don’t think that is something he ever really put on his platform as a top-tier concern,” she said.\n\nRelated | RFK Jr. is coming for abortion pills\n\nAnd beyond abortion, she voiced particular concern over Trump’s comments on in vitro fertilization, which she opposes. Trump has said he might support expanding the availability of IVF, even campaigning on the issue, though that has not translated into actual policies. Because IVF generally involves the creation of multiple embryos — not all of which will necessarily be implanted in someone’s uterus — it has attracted the ire of some abortion opponents, who believe the discarding of excess embryos is immoral.\n\nVoters prioritizing abortion now appear to be more conservative on issues of gender. Of people who said abortion was their top priority, 57 percent also said society would be better served by reverting to “traditional gender roles,” seven percentage points above the general population. The same share also said they believe a fetus has rights starting at conception — a conservative philosophy known as “fetal personhood,” compared with 43 percent of the general population. And 55 percent said they believe transgender adults shouldn’t be able to get gender-affirming care, compared with 42 percent of Americans at large.\n\nSurveyMonkey conducted this poll online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, with a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1 percentage point.\n\nOverall, most voters still support abortion rights. About 62 percent of voters said abortion should be legal in most or all cases. Majorities of Democrats and independents said they support abortion rights. So did most men and most women. Abortion also retained majority support across education and income levels.\n\nEven if abortion rights supporters did not name it as a singular top issue, some may still struggle to vote for a candidate who is not committed to protecting reproductive rights.\n\n“If somebody came in and was saying we needed to ban abortions across the map, that would totally not be something I’m in for,” said Tiegan Paulson, a 22-year-old student living in Portland, Maine, who voted for Harris last fall.\n\nAbortion wasn’t his main concern in the past election; foreign policy was, and in particular effective plans to resolve international conflicts. But moving forward, he said, “personal freedoms” — a category in which he includes abortion rights, free speech and LGBTQ+ rights — are on a short list of non-negotiables for a candidate to win his support.\n\n“It would need to be a fairly high priority,” he said. “I would want to see some sort of action plan for abortion and just for personal freedoms more generally: the right to choose what you do with your voice, with your body, with your life, at the very least to the extent that it doesn’t impact anybody else. That seems like a pretty fundamental right that people in this country should have.”","summary":"A 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll suggests that abortion rights supporters are now less likely to prioritize the issue.\n\n\n\nBy Shefali Luthra for The 19th\n\n\n\n\nAmericans who call abortion their top voting issue are now more likely to support banning it, a reversal from the energized reproductive rights supporters who turned abortion into a key election issue after Roe v.

Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.\n\nThree other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.\n\nThose market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?\n\nThe question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.\n\nRushing to approve projects\n\nThe upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.\n\nOfficials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.\n\nTrump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.\n\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.\n\nThe administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.\n\n“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”\n\nCoal demand plummets\n\nThe AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.\n\nEnergy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.\n\nBut it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\n“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”\n\nThe coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.\n\nTwenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.\n\nIn filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.\n\nThat is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.\n\nNTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.\n\n“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.\n\nIn central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.\n\nAmong them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.\n\nAging plants and optimism\n\nThe largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.\n\nPeabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.\n\n“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”\n\nNo large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.\n\nThat leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.\n\n“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.","summary":"“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market.

Some fear Trump’s cuts may change that","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has embraced the federal shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to slash spending and shrink government, but new rounds of targeted spending cuts from the White House aimed at Democratic states and priorities are raising concerns among Republicans that they may be at risk of ceding their political advantage.\n\nRepublicans in Congress believe they hold the upper hand in four-day-old stalemate, as Democrats voted against measures to keep the government open because they want to attach additional policy measures. But the sweeping cuts to home-state projects — and the threat of mass federal firings — have some in the GOP worried the White House may be going too far and potentially give Democrats a way out of their tight spot.\n\n“This is certainly the most moral high ground Republicans have had in a moment like this that I can recall, and I just don’t like squandering that political capital when you have that kind of high ground,” GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told reporters this week.\n\nAs hopes faded Friday for a quick end to the shutdown — with Democrats holding firm in a key Senate vote — the White House signaled more layoffs and agency cuts could follow. Trump shared a video Thursday night portraying budget director Russ Vought as the grim reaper. The cuts are raising fresh questions about whether voters want a government that uses discretionary power to punish political opponents — and whether Republicans may face electoral consequences for the White House’s actions.\n\n“There’s the political ramifications that could cause backlash,” Cramer said in another interview. “It makes everything going forward more difficult for us.”\n\nSince the shutdown began, Trump has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in clean energy grants across 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. On Friday, the administration announced an additional $2 billion cut, this time to a major public transit project in Chicago. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is also reviewing funding to Portland, Oregon.\n\n“He’s just literally took out the map and pointed to all the blue states,” Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, told The Associated Press.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the shutdown and cuts as evidence of Trump’s overreach. There could be near-term fallout, including in next month’s governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. Democratic candidates in both states have linked their GOP opponents to Trump’s policies and criticized them for not standing up to his latest moves.\n\nIn New Jersey, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill blasted Republican Jack Ciattarelli over Trump’s move to block funding for a long-delayed rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, saying it will hurt commuters and put thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk.\n\n“What’s wrong with this guy?” Sherrill said Friday.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger noted the state already has been hit hard by job cuts made by Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. She said Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is “refusing to stand up for our workforce and our economy.”\n\nEarle-Sears said Democrats are to blame for the shutdown, and said Spanberger did nothing to encourage the state’s Democratic senators to stop it.\n\nThe administration’s targeting of blue states has already begun to ripple through states like California, where $1.2 billion in funding for the state’s hydrogen hub was scrapped. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said it threatens more than 200,000 jobs.\n\nThough Harris won California handily in 2024, the state includes several competitive House districts that could decide control of the chamber in 2026. Similar districts exist in other states affected by the cuts, including New York and New Hampshire, which also has key gubernatorial and Senate races.\n\nDemocratic groups have moved quickly to tie local Republicans to the fallout. American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic group, has highlighted swing-district Republicans in states where cuts have occurred, accusing them of having “sat by and let it happen.”\n\n“The cruelty that they might unleash on everyday Americans using the pretense of a shutdown is only going to backfire against them,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in an interview with The Associated Press and other outlets at the Capitol.\n\nThe cuts are also complicating Senate negotiations, prolonging a shutdown that could leave thousands of federal workers without pay and halt key programs. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat whom Republicans have tried to sway, said “there’s no question” the cuts have damaged talks.\n\n“If you’re trying to get people to come together and try to find common ground, that’s the absolute wrong way to do it,” said Peters.\n\nSen. Angus King, a Maine independent, broke from Democrats earlier this week to support the GOP funding bill. He called the cuts “so utterly partisan as to be almost laughable.”\n\n“If they overreach, which is entirely possible, I think they’re going to be in trouble with Republicans as well,” said King.\n\nMany Senate Republicans have not endorsed Vought’s approach directly, instead blaming Democrats for rejecting funding bills and opening the door to the White House’s more aggressive moves.\n\n“It’s the reason why Republicans have continued to support a continuation,” said GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota. “If you’ve noticed, Republicans have solidly supported this short-term continuing resolution because we do not want to see this.”\n\n“It’s not like we promoted it,” said Rounds. “We’ve done everything we can right now to try to avoid it.”\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Last month, his social media account mocked one of Trump’s Truth Social posts, parsing all the lives, with a zinger on top: “Take your dementia meds, Grandpa. You are making things up again.” (Newsom has also said there’s something wrong with Trump. He suggested his cognition has decayed dramatically since his first term.)\n\nBut that’s as close as Newsom got, and as far as I can tell, no Democrat as high as Pritzker has said outright that Donald Trump is demented.\n\nThis is not to say no one has been talking about it directly. I have. USA Today’s Rex Huppke has. The New Republic’s Greg Sargent has. The Hill’s Chris Truax has. There are dozens more examples. (There’s also a repertoire of wink-wink-nudge-nudge that the Democrats have used since Joe Biden dropped out of the campaign. Kamala Harris talked a lot about Trump’s “stamina” and “weakness.” Others followed her lead.)\n\nBut that’s pretty much the extent of it. Despite wall-to-wall coverage of Joe Biden’s mental state, now to the point where some respectable journalists are claiming there was a vast conspiracy to cover it up, the Washington press corps seemed to have priced into their coverage of Trump his obvious deterioration. There’s barely a hint of anything about it. Absolutely no one has used the d-word in their reporting. It’s enough to make you wonder if there’s a vast conspiracy to cover it up.\n\nI will say that something changed this week, at least in terms of coverage by the New York Times, which tends to be a bellwether for newspeople. A piece on his gathering of top military brass resulted in this reaction from a seasoned Times-watcher: “I assert that The New York Times has changed its approach to writing about Trump.”\n\nThe article, headlined “Trump Gave the Military’s Brass a Rehashed Speech. Until Minute 44,” was about how difficult it is to pick out the newsworthy bits from Trump’s speeches, as they tend to be retreads of the same things he’s always going on about. Despite addressing elites of the American military, Trump twaddled on about Biden and the “infamous autopen”; about the unfair media; about tariffs; about the border; about “the time he went to a restaurant in Washington to eat dinner”; and even the “Nobel Peace Prize he felt he had earned.”\n\nAs Times reporter Shawn McCreesh said: “These were pretty much the same things he talked about a day earlier while standing next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in the State Dining Room at the White House, which were the same things he talked about at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service in Arizona, which were the same things he talked about at Windsor Castle and at Chequers in England.”\n\nBut then, out of that miasma of mangled words, broken thoughts and disconnections arose “something new. Something different,” McCreesh wrote. The president of the United States said that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”\n\nTo make sure you don’t miss it, McCreesh repeats those words in italics. “‘We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,’ the president of the United States said.”\n\nMcCreesh is reporting, not commenting. He’s not saying directly that Trump looks like an old man whose brain is so broken he can’t stop perseverating on the same five topics or that out of that word salad, he sometimes spews the pristine proclamations of a dictator. Instead, he takes a reportorial approach toward arriving at a similar conclusion. He’s showing, in other words, not telling, and the showing is clear.\n\n“It has become harder to perceive the occasionally revealing things the president says … because of the way he sometimes says them,” McCreesh wrote. “For a 79-year-old, he’s often shown a great deal of energy, but he seemed a bit sapped Tuesday. As his remarks went on and on, his voice took on a more monotonous quality. A day earlier, when he spoke … Mr. Trump sounded out of breath at times.”\n\nMcCreesh could have taken a different reportorial approach.\n\nHe could have backgrounded the word salad and focused on how the “training ground” remark is in keeping with all the other dictatorial things Trump has said, which altogether are in keeping with Project 2025, published prior to the election. McCreesh could have focused on how, with each of these statements, the president seems to be coming around to publicly embracing that manifesto, after having renounced it. Indeed, such an approach would have gone viral. Just today, Trump said, in essence, he lied when he said he had nothing to do with it.\n\nIn short, McCreesh could have set aside the word salad to establish continuity between, say, the president who led an attempted insurrection and the president who said, years later, “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”\n\nInstead, McCreesh foregrounds Trump’s word salad to suggest that something has changed, and that such change could itself suggest that his dictatorial statements are the exception to the rule. “Thousands of words pour forth from the president’s mouth,” he wrote. “Sometimes, he tucks in a wild insight about the direction he is taking the country.”\n\nWhich brings me back to JB Pritzker. He’s why I’m dwelling on this piece and the way Shawn McCreesh wrote it. In being the first leading Democrat to use the word “dementia,” he’s doing something similar – foregrounding Trump’s deteriorated mental state such that all the crazy things that he’s doing in defiance of reason, morality, the Constitution and the law are downstream from there. (McCreesh’s foregrounding is, of course, implicit while Pritzker’s is explicit).\n\nWhile other Democrats are making what seem to be ideological or policy-based arguments against the president – he’s a threat to your freedoms or he’s failing to protect your health care – Pritzker can take what you might call a position of big-hearted centrism. He can stand against Trump’s tyranny while at the same time genuinely lament that his disease has turned him into a despot. Now the dementia has set in, Pritzker said, Trump is copying Putin. “I'm concerned for his health.”\n\nThis won’t be fully convincing to a lot of people, myself included, but its effectiveness with independent voters might bring us around in time. Pritzker, or another ambitious Democrat, could easily pivot this framing to include all those things that swing voters thought he was going to do but didn’t. Why is food still so expensive? Why did my electric bill go up? Why didn’t Trump do what he said he was going to do? You could, as liberals often do, say that he lied, or that he actually wants to immiserate the middle class. But that would require changing swing voters’ minds. It would require them to admit they were wrong. Probably more effective to say, well, he’s gone mad with the dementia.\n\nIt’s the difference between the patient and his sickness. He isn’t saying “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds,” because he’s a fascist. He’s saying it because he’s sick. While the symptoms are the same, the diagnosis is politically what matters.\n\nConsider comments made by Jack Cocchiarella. A CNN host asked the young YouTube influencer for his thoughts on the government shutdown. “Trump to me is kind of this dementia-addled nursing home patient in the White House right now,” he said. “He’s leaning on [budget director Russell] Vought, he’s leaning on [Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller, because he doesn’t want to get the job done.\n\n“He just doesn’t seem interested in negotiating. He’s taking pleasure in what Russ Vought said, which would be the traumatizing of federal workers. That was their goal coming into this administration. So it seems like that’s all they wanna do. And I don’t know how that gets any Democrat, who actually cares about people who are gonna see their premium double, triple, to come to the table, and why would you?\n\n“This Administration doesn’t want to engage.”\n\nNothing here about Trump being fascist. Cocchiarella merely thinks he doesn’t want to negotiate with Democrats because he’s old and mean.\n\nSince last year’s election, the Democrats have been in debate with themselves. Some say they need to keep sounding the alarm about Trump’s threat to democracy. Others say that didn’t work last time and they should focus on “kitchen-table issues,” which is to say, economics.\n\nDementia, in the way that Pritzker used it, could be the link between them. Why is Trump acting like a dictator? Why didn’t he do more to bring down my grocery bill? Same answer. It’s as elegant as it is simple.","summary":"I could be wrong, but JB Pritzker may be the first Democrat to apply the d-word to Donald Trump.

He suggested his cognition has decayed dramatically since his first term.)\n\nBut that’s as close as Newsom got, and as far as I can tell, no Democrat as high as Pritzker has said outright that Donald Trump is demented.\n\nThis is not to say no one has been talking about it directly. I have. USA Today’s Rex Huppke has. The New Republic’s Greg Sargent has. The Hill’s Chris Truax has. There are dozens more examples. (There’s also a repertoire of wink-wink-nudge-nudge that the Democrats have used since Joe Biden dropped out of the campaign. Kamala Harris talked a lot about Trump’s “stamina” and “weakness.” Others followed her lead.)\n\nBut that’s pretty much the extent of it. Despite wall-to-wall coverage of Joe Biden’s mental state, now to the point where some respectable journalists are claiming there was a vast conspiracy to cover it up, the Washington press corps seemed to have priced into their coverage of Trump his obvious deterioration. There’s barely a hint of anything about it. Absolutely no one has used the d-word in their reporting. It’s enough to make you wonder if there’s a vast conspiracy to cover it up.\n\nI will say that something changed this week, at least in terms of coverage by the New York Times, which tends to be a bellwether for newspeople. A piece on his gathering of top military brass resulted in this reaction from a seasoned Times-watcher: “I assert that The New York Times has changed its approach to writing about Trump.”\n\nThe article, headlined “Trump Gave the Military’s Brass a Rehashed Speech. Until Minute 44,” was about how difficult it is to pick out the newsworthy bits from Trump’s speeches, as they tend to be retreads of the same things he’s always going on about. Despite addressing elites of the American military, Trump twaddled on about Biden and the “infamous autopen”; about the unfair media; about tariffs; about the border; about “the time he went to a restaurant in Washington to eat dinner”; and even the “Nobel Peace Prize he felt he had earned.”\n\nAs Times reporter Shawn McCreesh said: “These were pretty much the same things he talked about a day earlier while standing next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in the State Dining Room at the White House, which were the same things he talked about at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service in Arizona, which were the same things he talked about at Windsor Castle and at Chequers in England.”\n\nBut then, out of that miasma of mangled words, broken thoughts and disconnections arose “something new. Something different,” McCreesh wrote. The president of the United States said that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”\n\nTo make sure you don’t miss it, McCreesh repeats those words in italics. “‘We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,’ the president of the United States said.”\n\nMcCreesh is reporting, not commenting. He’s not saying directly that Trump looks like an old man whose brain is so broken he can’t stop perseverating on the same five topics or that out of that word salad, he sometimes spews the pristine proclamations of a dictator. Instead, he takes a reportorial approach toward arriving at a similar conclusion. He’s showing, in other words, not telling, and the showing is clear.\n\n“It has become harder to perceive the occasionally revealing things the president says … because of the way he sometimes says them,” McCreesh wrote. “For a 79-year-old, he’s often shown a great deal of energy, but he seemed a bit sapped Tuesday. As his remarks went on and on, his voice took on a more monotonous quality. A day earlier, when he spoke … Mr. Trump sounded out of breath at times.”\n\nMcCreesh could have taken a different reportorial approach.\n\nHe could have backgrounded the word salad and focused on how the “training ground” remark is in keeping with all the other dictatorial things Trump has said, which altogether are in keeping with Project 2025, published prior to the election. McCreesh could have focused on how, with each of these statements, the president seems to be coming around to publicly embracing that manifesto, after having renounced it. Indeed, such an approach would have gone viral. Just today, Trump said, in essence, he lied when he said he had nothing to do with it.\n\nIn short, McCreesh could have set aside the word salad to establish continuity between, say, the president who led an attempted insurrection and the president who said, years later, “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”\n\nInstead, McCreesh foregrounds Trump’s word salad to suggest that something has changed, and that such change could itself suggest that his dictatorial statements are the exception to the rule. “Thousands of words pour forth from the president’s mouth,” he wrote. “Sometimes, he tucks in a wild insight about the direction he is taking the country.”\n\nWhich brings me back to JB Pritzker. He’s why I’m dwelling on this piece and the way Shawn McCreesh wrote it. In being the first leading Democrat to use the word “dementia,” he’s doing something similar – foregrounding Trump’s deteriorated mental state such that all the crazy things that he’s doing in defiance of reason, morality, the Constitution and the law are downstream from there. (McCreesh’s foregrounding is, of course, implicit while Pritzker’s is explicit).\n\nWhile other Democrats are making what seem to be ideological or policy-based arguments against the president – he’s a threat to your freedoms or he’s failing to protect your health care – Pritzker can take what you might call a position of big-hearted centrism. He can stand against Trump’s tyranny while at the same time genuinely lament that his disease has turned him into a despot. Now the dementia has set in, Pritzker said, Trump is copying Putin. “I'm concerned for his health.”\n\nThis won’t be fully convincing to a lot of people, myself included, but its effectiveness with independent voters might bring us around in time. Pritzker, or another ambitious Democrat, could easily pivot this framing to include all those things that swing voters thought he was going to do but didn’t. Why is food still so expensive? Why did my electric bill go up? Why didn’t Trump do what he said he was going to do? You could, as liberals often do, say that he lied, or that he actually wants to immiserate the middle class. But that would require changing swing voters’ minds. It would require them to admit they were wrong. Probably more effective to say, well, he’s gone mad with the dementia.\n\nIt’s the difference between the patient and his sickness. He isn’t saying “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds,” because he’s a fascist. He’s saying it because he’s sick. While the symptoms are the same, the diagnosis is politically what matters.\n\nConsider comments made by Jack Cocchiarella. A CNN host asked the young YouTube influencer for his thoughts on the government shutdown. “Trump to me is kind of this dementia-addled nursing home patient in the White House right now,” he said. “He’s leaning on [budget director Russell] Vought, he’s leaning on [Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller, because he doesn’t want to get the job done.\n\n“He just doesn’t seem interested in negotiating. He’s taking pleasure in what Russ Vought said, which would be the traumatizing of federal workers. That was their goal coming into this administration. So it seems like that’s all they wanna do. And I don’t know how that gets any Democrat, who actually cares about people who are gonna see their premium double, triple, to come to the table, and why would you?\n\n“This Administration doesn’t want to engage.”\n\nNothing here about Trump being fascist. Cocchiarella merely thinks he doesn’t want to negotiate with Democrats because he’s old and mean.\n\nSince last year’s election, the Democrats have been in debate with themselves. Some say they need to keep sounding the alarm about Trump’s threat to democracy. Others say that didn’t work last time and they should focus on “kitchen-table issues,” which is to say, economics.\n\nDementia, in the way that Pritzker used it, could be the link between them. Why is Trump acting like a dictator? Why didn’t he do more to bring down my grocery bill? Same answer. It’s as elegant as it is simple.","summary":"I could be wrong, but JB Pritzker may be the first Democrat to apply the d-word to Donald Trump. More importantly, the Illinois governor may be the first to link his criminality to his dementia. And! He may be the first to explain America’s existential crisis in context of a remedy.\n\nA threefer! He said:\n\n\"It appears that Donald Trump not only has dementia set in, but he's copying tactics of Vladimir Putin. Sending troops into cities, thinking that that's some sort of proving ground for war, or that indeed there's some sort of internal war going on in the United States is just, frankly, inane, and I'm concerned for his health. There is something genuinely wrong with this man, and the 25th Amendment ought to be invoked.\"\n\nLike I said, I could be wrong. California Governor Gavin Newsom came close to saying it.

Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: In the days after President Donald Trump took office in 2017 during his first term, George Orwell’s 1984 came a best-seller in the U.S. The classic 1949 dystopian work introduced the world to the terms “Big Brother,” “thought police,” “newspeak” and “doublethink.” Orwell wrote 1984 as a cautionary tale more than 75 years ago, and some say it has even greater relevance now in Trump’s second term and around the world.\n\nNow a new film by the Oscar-nominated director Raoul Peck is opening Friday in theaters, that explores the life and legacy of George Orwell. It’s called Orwell: 2+2=5. This is the trailer.\n\n GEORGE ORWELL: [voiced by Damian Lewis] When I sit down to write a book, I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose. \n\n O’CONNOR: [played by Michael Redgrave] Again, how many fingers? \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: My starting point is always a feeling of injustice. The very concept of objective truth is fading out of this world. \n\n WINSTON SMITH: [played by Edmond O’Brien] I’m going to set down what I dare not say aloud to anyone. \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: This prospect frightens me much more than bombs. The words “democracy,” “freedom,” “justice” have, each of them, several different meanings, which cannot be reconciled with one another. Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful. \n\n PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The love in the air, I’ve never seen anything like it. \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: And murder respectable. Freedom is slavery. War is peace. Ignorance is strength. Totalitarianism, if not fought against, could triumph anywhere. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? \n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: That’s the trailer for the new film, Orwell: 2+2=5. And this is a clip that features the voices of President George W. Bush’s Secretary of State General Colin Powell and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It begins with the words of Orwell as read in a 1956 British film adaptation of his novel 1984.\n\n BIG BROTHER: [voiced by John Vernon] We’re at war with the people of Eurasia, the vile and ruthless aggressors who have committed countless atrocities and who are guilty of every bestial crime a human being can commit. They’ve laid waster our land, destroyed our factories, looted our homes, massacred our children and raped our women! \n\n SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL: When Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit, about this amount, this is just about… \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: [voiced by Damian Lewis] This kind of thing happens everywhere. But it is clearly likelier to lead to outright falsification in societies where only one opinion is permissible at any given moment. \n\n PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN: [translated] I’ve made the decision to conduct a special military operation. Its aim will be to protect those who have been persecuted in the Kyiv region’s genocide these past eight years. Our goal, therefore, will be to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine. \n\n GEORGE ORWELL: The organized lying practiced by totalitarian states is not, as is sometimes claimed, a temporary expedient of the same nature as military deception. It is something integral to totalitarianism, something that would still continue even if concentration camps and secret police forces had ceased to be necessary. Totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth. \n\n VICTOR OTTO: [translated] Had we not engaged in our special military operation, they would have attacked Russia. They, the Nazis, had long been preparing an attack. \n\n O’BRIEN: [played by Lorne Greene] How many fingers am I holding up, Winston? \n\n WINSTON SMITH: [played by Eddie Albert] Four. \n\n O’BRIEN: And if Big Brother were to say not four, but five, then how many? \n\n WINSTON SMITH: Four. \n\n O’BRIEN: How many fingers, Winston? \n\n WINSTON SMITH: Stop it. Anything. Five. \n\n O’BRIEN: No, no, Winston. \n\n WINSTON SMITH: Stop the pain! \n\n O’BRIEN: Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think you see four. \n\n WINSTON SMITH: How can I help, when it’s — five! \n\n O’BRIEN: Two and two do not always make four, Winston. Sometimes they make five. Again, how many fingers am I holding up? \n\nAMY GOODMAN: That’s a clip from the new documentary Orwell: 2+2=5. That last part is from a 1953 film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984.\n\nFor more, we are joined by Academy Award-winning director Alex Gibney, producer of Orwell: 2+2=5, and by the film’s director, Raoul Peck, the acclaimed Haitian filmmaker. His past films include Exterminate All the Brutes, I Am Not Your Negro — that’s one of my favorite documentaries of all time — The Young Karl Marx, Lumumba: Death of a Prophet and Haiti: The Silence of the Dogs. Raoul Peck served as Haiti’s culture minister in the 1990s.\n\nWe welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Raoul, talk about the origins of this film, why you decided to make this.\n\nRAOUL PECK: Well, Alex is better to answer that first question. You want to tell it?\n\nALEX GIBNEY: Well, no, I got a call from a man who had assembled all the rights to Orwell’s works and wondered if I wanted to executive produce it. I said, “Yes, on one condition: if we can get Raoul Peck to direct it.” And so, I turned to Raoul. And luckily, he answered my call and said yes. So, that’s how it started. But it also seemed like a film — I mean, it began some years ago. It was like two or three years ago we started on this project. It was relevant then. We had no idea how relevant it was to become.\n\nRAOUL PECK: Yeah, and I remember when we start working on it. For me, Kamala Harris was going to be president, so — and despite that, I knew that this country and many other countries around the world needed Orwell to come back and — because he had been one of the incredibly analyzer of how a totalitarian regime, but also any type of abuse of power function. You know, he teached how the signs — how to recognize the signs. And, you know, coming from Haiti as a young man and young boy, I also recognize the signs — you know, the attack on the press, the attack on justice, the attack on academia, the attack on any institution that can be a bulwark against totalitarian. And we are living again and again — not only in the United States, but in many other countries, including in Europe, in Latin America, in Africa — the same playbook playing again and again.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: So, Raoul, you’ve said in another interview, “I don’t make biographies. I choose a moment in the life of a character that allows me to tell the bigger story. For Orwell, I found that moment quite rapidly.” So, if you could elaborate on that? So, Alex comes to you with the idea of this film, and what do you think of Orwell?\n\nRAOUL PECK: An idea to which I say “yes” immediately. I don’t know why, but that happened. But you’re not offered every day to be able to immerse yourself in the whole body of work of an author that that you revere and that is important, like James Baldwin was important for me, too. But I know that before going, plunging into it, I had to find a story. I had to find — indeed, I don’t do biography. I try to find a story with a character, with emotions, with contradictions, and a story that allows you to see a film multiple times, not just for what is happening now currently, but also that you can watch in 30 years, and you will learn as much.\n\nSo, the story for me was Orwell in the last year of his life, where he’s struggling to finish 1984. And he will finally finish it, but will die four months later. And he’s only 49. So, the drama of that, you know, and the struggle to finish that, you know, for an author, I thought, was — would give me the fine line of the story and allow me to revisit all his body of work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Writing through dealing with tuberculosis before he died. But for especially the younger generation, who he was, why he came to have this view, this warning to the world about totalitarianism, authoritarianism?\n\nRAOUL PECK: Well, because it’s — you know, people have thought, including myself, you know, reading Orwell when I was young, always thought of him of a sort of dystopian and science fiction author. But in fact, he was writing about things that he went through in his life, being born in India, and that’s why I use that photo of Orwell as a baby in the hand of a Black nanny. And then he went to Myanmar today, you know.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Burma, yeah.\n\nRAOUL PECK: Burma at the time, which was a British colony. And he went there as a 19-year-old, as a soldier there, and he realized the price of colonialism. He was himself the bully. He was on the wrong side. And that experience, I think, shaped his whole thinking. And he wrote about it in a very candid and open way and self-critical way.\n\nAnd then the Spanish War, again, as a young man in his thirties, to volunteer to fight with the republic against the putschists, Franco, etc. So, all those moments shaped his mind. And, you know, there is a phrase where he said, you know, “After the Spanish Civil War, I knew where I stand.” And that was the turning point for him and of — as well, for the film, to establish who he actually was, and his whole writing, saying that “I want to — you know, to write about politics and art together.” It was never a contradiction for him.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And indeed, he said the decision not to make art about politics is itself a political decision —\n\nRAOUL PECK: Of course.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: — which you —\n\nRAOUL PECK: Yeah, and, as he said, neutrality cannot be — is also a political position. You know, you can’t be neutral. Neutral of what? You know.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: But the other — you talked a little bit about his time in — he was born in India, but I think he was just a few months old when his mother brought him back to England. But then he spends, as you said, from 1922 to '27, five years working as a policeman in, at the time, British-colonized Burma. And as a policeman, he says that he was part of the actual machinery of despotism, and as a result of which — another quote from the film — that he operates, quote, “on a simple theory that the oppressed are always right and the oppressors wrong: a mistaken theory, but the direct result of being one of the oppressors yourself.” So, if you could talk about that? And then, also we'll get into, you know, the extent to which, of course, this experience with colonialism, a direct one, as one of the colonizers, but then also the question of class. Throughout the film, he explains his own formation by his position, as he calls it, being lower-upper-middle class.\n\nRAOUL PECK: Yes. Well, the first part of the question, you know, I have — I had a very good friend, the writer Russell Banks, and we had had that discussion many times. And he said the real story of racism in America can only be told by somebody who was a member of the Klan. And it’s a little bit the same way. If you have been in the belly of the beast, you have learned how the beasts think. You have no — you know all the instruments. You know how they function, etc. And that’s what Orwell was able to do. You know, he was doing things that he would come to regret, but he knew them intimately. And about the second part of your question, I forgot. It’s about —\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: About class.\n\nRAOUL PECK: About class. You know, that’s — I was thinking recently about how every politician in this country is using prominently the middle class, as if it’s like something — you have the middle class, and then you have the very rich and the very poor. And so, every citizen wants to be in that middle class. But it’s a way also to erase all class distinction, all the nuance of being in one or the other, is to erasing the working class, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Let’s go to a clip, again, from your film, Orwell: 2+2=5.\n\n GEORGE ORWELL: [voiced by Damian Lewis] I do not think one can assess a writer’s motives without knowing something of his early development. His subject matter will be determined by the age he lives in. At least this is true in tumultuous, revolutionary ages like our own. \n\n When I was not yet 20, I went to Burma in the Indian Imperial Police. In an outpost of empire like Burma, the class question appeared at first sight to have been shelved. Most of the white men in Burma were not of the type who in England would be called “gentlemen.” But they were “white men,” in contradistinction to the other and inferior class, the “natives.” \n\n In the free air of England, that kind of thing is not fully intelligible. In order to hate imperialism, you have got to be part of it. But it is not possible to be part of such a system without recognizing it as an unjustifiable tyranny. Even the thickest-skinned Anglo-Indian is aware of this. Every “native” face he sees in the street brings home to him his monstrous intrusion. But I was in the police, which is to say that I was part of the actual machinery of despotism. \n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: So, that’s a clip from Orwell: 2+2=5. And there, we hear about Orwell’s experience with colonialism and how that shaped his ideological formation, so — which Raoul just talked about. So, Alex, I’d like you to talk a little bit about, you know, a comment that — an Orwell quote that’s also in the film, the fact that leaders can claim that something that happened didn’t happen, or that two and two is five. This fact scares me “more than bombs,” and this is not a “frivolous statement.” So, if you could elaborate on the significance of and the importance of this in our present moment?\n\nALEX GIBNEY: Well, I think that what Orwell was talking about was the idea of authoritarian leaders’ assault on common sense. In other words, what you instinctively know to be true is upended by the authoritarian leader, so that everything flows from him — usually “him.” And that’s the — that’s what we’re experiencing in this moment. We have a president who you can’t even say that he’s a liar, because he just invents things on the spot, but he expects them to be revered as true. Two plus two equals five. That is the the effective —\n\nRAOUL PECK: Slogan.\n\nALEX GIBNEY: Well, it’s a slogan, but that’s how he impresses us with his power, that he can make us rudder against our own common sense. That is — and that’s the danger we must all, you know, rise up against. That’s the problem at this moment.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And also, he makes — I mean, the point that also you have in the film, Orwell saying, “To be corrupted by totalitarianism, one does not have to live in a totalitarian country.”\n\nALEX GIBNEY: Right. And I think also — you know, the other thing to remember, I think, that’s important here is that what we’re living through in this country is not unique, and it’s kind of a playbook that authoritarian leaders go through throughout the world. But also, you know, one of the geniuses — one of the things that’s great about Raoul’s film is that there’s a juxtaposition of present and past, and also country to country, and you can see these same patterns emerge over and over and over again. And it’s a kind of a simple playbook to make us all believe that two plus two equals five, or at least to assert that the — that’s the pledge of allegiance, “two plus two equals five.” But it’s not unique to Donald Trump. And I think that it’s one of the great triumphs of the film.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Raoul Peck, you told Variety, “We are in the hands of a bunch of crazy people who have an agenda totally written out in Project 2025, the same way that Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.” And you also — I mean, just talking about Orwell saying, “Totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth.”\n\nRAOUL PECK: Well, exactly. And I think everybody remembers when Ms. Conway came with the phrase “alternative facts,” you know, and everybody started laughing about that. But that was what we call the beginning of newspeak, you know, and where you’re actually saying one thing and doing the contrary, the same when Netanyahu at the U.N. said Israel wants peace, while they are bombarding Gaza. So, the absurdity and the contradiction of this is — have invaded our lives. And I know, as — again, coming from Haiti, I remember as a young boy hearing Kennedy and other presidents talking about democracy. And at the same time, they were financing and supporting the dictatorship in my country, or in Congo supporting Mobutu, when we were there, and at the same time talking about peace, talking about the good thing that democracy was bringing. So, that double language have always existed for the imperialist countries and colonialism. You know, there is the talk, and there is the reality. And Orwell, if we can learn something from him, is that he wrote about the reality, not some dystopian future, you know. And we can relate to that, and we can understand how this machine functions.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And so, Raoul, you mentioned newspeak. And in the film, you give several examples from the contemporary moment: “special military operation,” which includes — which equals “invasion of Ukraine”; “vocational training center,” which equals “concentration camp,” a reference to the Uyghurs in China; “legal use of force,” “police brutality”; “antisemitism,” 2024, equals “weaponized term to silence critics of the Israeli military.” Now, if you could talk about, in particular — because you do include it in the film — the proliferation of these terms through a totally new form, social media?\n\nRAOUL PECK: Absolutely. It multiplied that by the million. And we are being bombarded by so-called information, which are absolutely not information. And there is no checking about that. And there is this sequence with Ocasio-Cortez, as well, criticizing or asking Zuckerberg, you know: What is his fact-checking department doing on Facebook? So, it’s such an enormous problem. Like, Orwell tells us that at the moment where you cannot trust language anymore, you’re not in a democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Did you leave this film more hopeful or less?\n\nRAOUL PECK: Well, it’s — “hopeful” is not a word I can function with. For me, it’s about what do you do once you see that something is not functioning. And I think about what response should we make, what alliance should — \n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And what is the response?\n\nRAOUL PECK: Yes, well, that will be the responsibility of each one of us, you know, wherever we are, journalists, as well politicians, but also the civil society. The response, you know, like Orwell said, 84% of Oceania, you know, they are the one who has — or, he calls them the proles, and they are the one who has to bring a response, like the civil rights movement. You know, it was a coalition of very different people, very different movements, and they succeeded in changing this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, I encourage everyone to see this film. It’s at IFC, opening tomorrow night here in New York, and then moving on to Los Angeles and then to the rest of the country. Raoul Peck, director of Orwell: 2+2=5. Alex Gibney produced the film.

And he was not going to run without the DSA.”\n\n“We weren’t even planning to run someone for mayor,” he added, answering a question whether it was Mamdani who came to the DSA seeking an endorsement – or the other way around.\n\nOne leader at the meeting trumpeted the endorsement as “one of the most important moves in modern American history.”\n\nIn fact, power-mad party leaders gloated about their newfound influence.\n\n“We’re getting more power!” exalted Goldner. “People are asking us what we want for things – that doesn’t happen all the time, and that’s really important. There are lots of other left organizations, they aren’t necessarily building power in the same way.”\n\nThe NYC chapter – the DSA’s largest and fastest growing – has ballooned to nearly 11,000 dues-paying members from 8,000 earlier this year, mostly Brooklyn-living Gen Zs and Millennials, and the occasional Boomer – with Mamdani’s campaign fueling the surge in recruits. Mamdani himself proudly announced the 10,000th member in July.\n\nThe meeting, in a small and dingy ground-floor room on Jefferson Street where walls were painted communist red, started with distribution of nametags that included pronouns, featured references to Karl Marx — the “OG communist,” and ended with new recruits given “Zohran for mayor NYC DSA” buttons if they scanned a QR code to join the party.\n\nAround 50 people showed up, which was all the room could handle. The “101” meetings are held several times a month, and leaders noted how they’ve outgrown the space and are looking for a new HQ.\n\nIt was revealed at the gathering that Mamdani will be expected to meet weekly with party elders if he’s elected.\n\nThrough what it calls its “Socialists in Office Committee,” the NYC DSA regulalry meets endorsed lawmakers to “coordinate on what the DSA elected officials should be doing and how they should vote,” according to documents handed out at Wednesday night’s gathering.\n\nThe weekly directives have been given to Mamdani in his capacity as a Queens state assembly member since 2021.\n\nAs a state politician he has pushed their extreme agenda. He’s personally introduced several bills featured on the NYC DSA legislative platform, like Cecila’s act, a bill to decriminalize prostitution; legislation to shut down ICE facilities in the state, and a bill to authorized more “supervised injection” sites.\n\nThe speakers on Wednesday blasted the Democratic Party for being out of touch, admitting to using the Democratic line on the ballot only as a means to an end, the only way to get a socialist elected.\n\n“In New York State, it’s very difficult to get a party line that is not the Democratic Party,” Goldner said, answering a question about the DSA’s position on running candidates as independents instead of Democrats. \n\n“It’s just not something that’s feasible for us in New York at this time,” he added, calling running as a Democrat “favorable.”\n\nHe pointed to the DSA’s failed attempt at electing Jabari Brisport to the City Council in 2017 as a Green Party candidate and then endorsing his 2021 comeback for state Senate as a Democrat.\n\nIt’s been a contentious point for the left’s growing socialist base, with Long Island Dem Rep. Tom Suozzi recently saying they should leave the Democratic Party to create their own.\n\nMany attendees Wednesday made it clear they didn’t necessarily see themselves as Democrats.\n\n“For me, why I left the Democratic Party to come to the DSA, is this insistence on a class-based analysis of everything first – which I think is missing from the Democratic Party,” said one comrade.\n\n“I’m here because I come from a very Democratic family, and I guess I’ve had a growing sense of disillusionment with the establishment Democrats and was very inspired by Zohran’s campaign,” added another new DSA member.\n\nMembers blasted the Dems for “throwing their trans and immigrant comrades under the bus” to please the more moderate elements of the party – and blamed Kamala Harris’ failed presidential bid on a campaign based on what they called “imagery” rather than “material issues.”\n\nThe NYC DSA and Mamdani’s campaign did not return The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani is expected to be a party apparatchik who will follow the radical agenda of the Democratic Socialists of America, power mad members of its NYC chapter declared at a meeting infiltrated by The Post this week.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/04/us-news/mamdani-expected-to-follow-will-of-nyc-dsa-membership-if-elected-groups-leaders-say/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/www-instagram-com-p-dcpibe-112665110.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/t6E4uwmO-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-04 12:34:44","author":"Gabrielle Fahmy","authors":["Gabrielle Fahmy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.195},{"id":366144192,"title":"Trump is reviving large sales of coal from public lands. Will anyone want it?","text":"U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.\n\nThe sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows. \n\nThree other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.\n\nThose market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?\n\nThe question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.\n\n Rushing to approve projects \n\nThe upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields. \n\nOfficials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.\n\nTrump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful\" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nIn response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.\n\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.\n\nThe administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.\n\n“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”\n\n Coal demand plummets \n\nThe AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007. \n\nEnergy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands. \n\nBut it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump's actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\n“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”\n\nThe coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.\n\nTwenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.\n\nIn filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000. \n\nThat is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.\n\nNTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.\n\n“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said. \n\nIn central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.\n\nAmong them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.\n\n Aging plants and optimism \n\nThe largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.\n\nPeabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years. \n\n\"U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,\" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”\n\nNo large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.\n\nThat leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.\n\n“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,\" Kumar said.\n\nGruver reported from Wellington, Colorado.

Despite the fact that as many as 140 people who’d worked in his first administration—including Paul Dans, Heritage’s director of Project 2025—had a hand in its creation, Trump said: “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.”\n\nThis was demonstrably untrue, even at the time. Media Matters for America dug up a clip from as far back as May 2023 of Dans stating that “President Trump’s very bought in with this,” speaking of the program.\n\nProject 2025 was almost inconceivably unpopular. An NBC News poll from September 2024 showed that while 57% of registered voters viewed the plan negatively, just 4% viewed it positively.\n\nBut in the critical months leading up to the election, many media outlets took Trump’s denial at face value, publishing fact checks and other commentary that painted Democrats’ warnings about his connection to the plan as alarmist or misleading.\n\nResponding to a social media post in July stating that “Trump has made his authoritarian intentions quite clear with his Project 2025 plan,” a fact check by USA Today rated the statement “false,” because, as the headline said, “Project 2025 is an effort by the Heritage Foundation, not Donald Trump.”\n\nIn September, after Harris confronted Trump about Project 2025 at the first and only debate between the two, the paper published another fact-check with the headline: “Harris repeats claim that Project 2025 is Trump’s plan. That’s still not right.”\n\nIn response to Harris’ claim during the debate that Project 2025 was “a detailed and dangerous plan... that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected,” Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, whose coverage received a fair bit of criticism during the 2024 cycle, reported in bold text that “Project 2025 is not an official campaign document.”\n\nA CNN fact check of the Harris campaign’s social media in September remarked that one account “frequently invokes Project 2025,” before caveating that “Project 2025 is not Trump’s initiative, and he has said he disagrees with some of its proposals.”\n\nIn an October interview on CBS‘s “Face the Nation,” anchor Norah O’Donnell, Harris attempted to warn about Project 2025, before O’Donnell responded: “You know that Donald Trump has disavowed Project 2025. He says that is not his campaign plan.” \n\nAfter nine months back in power, the website Project 2025 Tracker estimates that Trump has already implemented approximately 48% of the objectives outlined in the policy document.\n\nIn addition to his key campaign promises many of his second administration’s policies are highly specific to Project 2025, such as his pledge to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), his efforts to privatize the National Weather Service (NWS), his reconfiguration of Title X funding to promote pregnancy, and his elimination of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.\n\nTrump is no longer hiding his connection to Project 2025, having brought in many of its hiring picks and authors to staff his administration almost immediately after his victory last November.\n\nThis week, he began to boast about it openly. As his Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director, Russ Vought, one of Project 2025’s architects, began using the current government shutdown to unilaterally cut off funding to infrastructure projects in blue states and cities, Trump lauded him as “he of PROJECT 2025 Fame.”\n\n“This was always the plan,” Harris responded on social media.\n\nWhile many commentators expressed outrage that Trump blatantly lied about his connections to Project 2025, others dredged up old clips of newspapers and anchors taking him at his word.\n\n“All those 2024 media fact checks that said, ‘Donald Trump and the Trump campaign deny any connection to Project 2025’ look pretty ridiculous right now,” said MeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski. “A Trump denial is not a fact. You just used his lies to ‘debunk’ a reality that was obvious to anyone paying attention.”\n\nMehdi Hasan, the founder of the independent media company Zeteo, highlighted the CBS interview, saying Trump’s embrace of Project 2025 was “embarrassing not just for Norah O’Donnell but a whole host of leading American anchors and reporters who echoed Trump’s false denials.”\n\n“Nothing showed the difference between mainstream and independent media better than the response to Trump’s obvious lie about not knowing anything about Project 2025,” said David Pepper, author of the book Saving Democracy: A User’s Manual. “Most mainstream media started fact-checking those who claimed a connection to be somehow false. Others ‘both sides’ed’ it. Far more in independent media called it out as a whopping lie.”","summary":"As President Donald Trump openly embraces Project 2025, mainstream media outlets are facing criticism for their role in helping him downplay his ties to the wildly unpopular far-right governing playbook in the lead-up to his reelection last year.\n\nAfter she became the Democratic nominee in July, former Vice President Kamala Harris made the Heritage Foundation’s over 900-page manifesto for “the next conservative president” central to her case against Trump during the 2024 election, often referring to it as “Trump’s Project 2025.”\n\n\nShe and other Democrats warned that if he retook power, he would swiftly enact many of its most extreme and unpopular proposals and dramatically expand executive power while doing it.\n\nAmong those proposals were steep cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the “mass deportations” of millions of immigrants, the elimination of the Department of Education, new restrictions on abortions, the gutting of climate protectio","url":"https://www.alternet.org/trump-lie-project-2025/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61617884&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C295%2C0%2C296","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 11:16:14","author":"Stephen Prager","authors":["Stephen Prager"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.382},{"id":366125076,"title":"How Donald Trump’s Approval Rating Has Changed Since Government Shutdown","text":"President Donald Trump‘s approval rating is creeping back up amid the first government shutdown in six years, polling shows.\n\nAn RMG Research poll of 3,000 registered voters, conducted September 23 through October 1—the day the government shutdown began—found that 51 percent of respondents approved of Trump’s job performance, with 48 percent disapproving. \n\nThe net of +3 points marks a one-point uptick from the previous week, though the results largely reflect opinions collected before the shutdown took effect. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points.\n\nNewsweek‘s tracker also showed an improvement in Trump’s approval rating, with his net approval now standing at -8 points—44 approving and 52 disapproving. That is up from -11 points on October 1.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe slight rebound suggests Trump’s standing with voters remains resilient despite ongoing political turbulence.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe federal government shut down this week after Congress failed to break a funding deadlock and pass a measure to keep agencies running.\n\nThe government funding dispute largely centers on whether to include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies in the spending bill. Democrats say health care protections must be preserved, while Republicans say funding and policy should be handled separately.\n\nWith funding lapsed, agencies must furlough all “nonexcepted” employees, while those deemed essential to protecting life and property continue working without pay until the shutdown ends. \n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that about 750,000 federal workers could be sidelined each day, with daily lost compensation amounting to about $400 million.\n\nTrump has also threatened to use the shutdown to slash government spending and carry out mass firings instead of furloughing federal workers, as is the usual practice during a shutdown.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that layoffs were imminent.\n\n“If they don’t want further harm on their constituents back home, then they need to reopen the government,” Leavitt said of Democrats on Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks from Marine One after arriving on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on September 30. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nAccording to a YouGov survey of 3,376 U.S. adults, conducted on October 1, 36 percent said they would be personally affected by the shutdown.\n\nPolls have also shown that Americans think Republicans would be more to blame than Democrats for the shutdown.\n\nA PBS News/NPR/Marist poll of 1,477 U.S. adults found that 38 percent said Republicans would be most to blame for a shutdown, while 27 percent said Democrats would be to blame.\n\nYouGov polling showed that 45 percent of Americans said Trump was very responsible for the shutdown, 45 percent blamed congressional Republicans, and 36 percent said congressional Democrats were responsible.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have sought to blame the opposing side for the shutdown.\n\n“Democrats have officially voted to CLOSE the government,” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X.\n\nHe added: “Democrats could have worked with us. Instead they prioritized taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.”\n\nLeavitt said, “Democrats put us in this position.”\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X: “President Trump and Congressional Republicans just shut down the government because they refused to stop your health care costs from rising. Let me be clear: Republicans are in charge of the White House, House, and Senate. This is their shutdown.”\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said the shutdown amounted to “the clearest sign yet that Republicans are inept, incompetent, and lack any respect for the American people.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, there appears to be little hope the shutdown will end anytime soon.\n\n“There’s nothing to negotiate. There’s nothing we can pull out of this bill to make it any leaner or cleaner than it is,” Johnson said on Wednesday.\n\nOn Friday, Republicans and Democrats failed for a third time to reach an agreement on legislation to fund the government.\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nWhether Trump’s approval holds up in the coming weeks will depend on how long the shutdown lasts, how much it disrupts the economy, and whether voters ultimately blame him, Republicans or Democrats.\n\nThe shutdown is expected to continue into next week. Johnson has designated next week as a district work period, meaning no votes are scheduled.","summary":"President Donald Trump&#039;s approval rating has crept back up amid the first government shutdown in six years, according to polling.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-donald-trump-approval-rating-has-changed-since-government-shutdown-10828337","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25273554960231-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 11:06:22","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.548},{"id":366122632,"title":"Amid national glare, Broadview mayor keeps focus on her 8,000 residents: ‘I can’t be afraid’","text":"Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson starts her day in the western suburb at 4 a.m. with silent meditation and prayer, but she ends the more stressful days belting out an Ice Cube diss track on her way home from the Village Hall. There’s been a lot of Ice Cube lately.\n\n“It just charges me up when the attacks come and I know I don’t deserve that,” she says in her office near Tupac and Snoop Dogg prayer candles, both given to her by a constituent as a nod to her West Coast roots and love for hip-hop.\n\nThe morning meditation, the car karaoke, a strict 9:30 p.m. bedtime are all part of a regimen she’s keeping to help navigate a new national spotlight as President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively responds to protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center tucked into Broadview’s industrial corridor.\n\nOn Friday, Thompson almost came face-to-face with U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who appeared unannounced at Village Hall asking for a meeting. In turn, Thompson went to the ICE center looking for Noem, but was told she was unavailable. Top U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino also visited the Broadview site on Friday.\n\nStanding just 5 feet 3 inches tall, Thompson comes off as sturdy as the water tower outside her office bearing the town’s unofficial slogan, “Broadview Strong.”\n\n“We are the strongest in the state. And I mean it,” she said in a lengthy interview Thursday with WBEZ. “We don’t fold. Broadview’s not scared. … Leave Broadview alone.”\n\nAs immigration enforcement has ramped up in the Chicago area, federal agents have shot pepper balls, deployed tear gas and used physical force to quell repeated demonstrations outside the Broadview facility. The town’s own police chief, Thomas Mills, says he was verbally accosted by an ICE officer. The department has opened three criminal investigations into federal agents’ actions.\n\nThe confrontations are the highest profile set of episodes to shake the 8,000-resident village and its mayor.\n\nBut in a morning spent with WBEZ at a coffee shop and in her office, Thompson remained unflappable, adamant that she is prepared to protect Broadview from aggressive federal tactics, even if it means going toe-to-toe with President Trump.\n\n“I feel comfortable wherever I am, because I’m Katrina first. That means I know who I am,” says Thompson, first elected mayor of the majority-Black, working class village in 2017. “I can’t be afraid, because I have so many people relying on me.\n\n“The residents, our business[es], all of the visitors — we’re responsible for them,” says the native Californian. “We’re responsible for the protesters, their well-being, their safety. We are responsible for the journalists that come to our town.”\n\nFor guidance, Thompson, 55, has leaned on other local leaders, including Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, County Commissioner Tara Stamps, former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, neighboring mayors and State Rep. La Shawn Ford, whom she’s known for 15 years.\n\n“She’s the caregiver of Broadview,” Ford says. “Her focus has always been on the residents of Broadview. And I think that what’s happening to her is going to test her ability to lead, and she’s doing a great job.”\n\nFord describes Thompson as “not political” and focused solely on hyperlocal, constituent needs. That shows in an early spar she had with Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, who protested at Broadview in his capacity as a congressional candidate.\n\n“Broadview would be better served by the presence of Evanston police officers helping to bolster our small force to protect demonstrators rather than a candidate … boosting his campaign,” she said in a statement. Biss refuted the accusation.\n\n A lifetime of preparation\n\nThompson was built for this moment in key ways. She was raised in Inglewood, Calif., by a single mom who taught her to be fiercely self-assured, and grandparents who grew up in the 1930s American South.\n\nThemes of resiliency and resistance were woven into the fabric of the childhood she shared with her now-late sister.\n\n“We learned Black history at home,” Thompson says.\n\nThompson’s office is lined with testaments to her heritage, along with cherished mementos from constituents: a portrait of a Black woman running her hands through her Afro, a chain necklace with the outline of Africa in the red, yellow and green colors that symbolize Black identity. On display are the kinds of Black history children’s books Trump has sought to excise from American education, like “The 1619 Project: Born on the Water” and “Black is a Rainbow Color.”\n\nThompson sees a direct tie between the experiences of immigrants being detained or deported, and those of Black Americans who lived through Jim Crow, redlining and other facets of modern-day systemic racism.\n\n“We’ve been here before, and what has changed? Now it’s just immigrants, but prior to this, it was Black people,” she says.\n\nBroadview is 63% Black, 21% Latino, 11% white, firmly working class and deeply blue. In the voting precincts that cover Broadview, 88% of the 2024 presidential vote went to former Vice President Kamala Harris, with 10% for Trump, according to an analysis by WBEZ. A high school diploma is the highest degree for about 40% of the town, and another 20% take some college classes while 10% earn a bachelor’s. The median income is $60,000, according to a 2025 snapshot of U.S. Census data from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning.\n\nThe town is a third industrial, a third commercial and a third residential, a mix is reflected in the town’s official slogan: “A balanced community.”\n\nAlong the industrial 25th Avenue, the squeaks and roars of semi-trucks dominate. The commercial strip is peppered with a few vacant storefronts, along with signs of new retail life and community anchors. “View,” a fancy new restaurant, serves up “elevated comfort food.” A block down on Roosevelt Road a school uniform and trophy supplier, once a full-scale sporting goods store, has been open since 1952.\n\nA community of neighbors, and opinions\n\nResidential streets are lined with trees and two-story brick homes. People know their neighbors — and their mayor. One evening last week a WBEZ reporter knocked on doors to hear from residents. One man answered his intercom, but said he couldn’t talk. The man then called the mayor to tell her a reporter was sniffing around.\n\n“That’s Broadview,” Thompson says with a laugh. “We don’t let anybody come and not say nothing” about it.\n\nIn the same neighborhood, a woman named Georgia had her front door open to let the breeze in.\n\n“It’ll be 30 years next year” in Broadview, says Georgia, declining to share her last name. “And it was clean when I moved here, and it’s clean now, and it’s quiet here.”\n\nShe likes how Thompson is speaking out. She saw her first news conference about the immigration protests earlier that week. The mayor urged the Trump administration to “stop unprovoked chemical arms attacks on peaceful protesters and on journalists.” \n\nThompson has spoken out strongly about the effect of tear gas and other aggressive tactics on residents, cops, firefighters and paramedics. She called on ICE to dismantle a fence it had constructed outside the facility, which the fire department said could impede emergency responders. State and Cook County agencies set up new barricades on Thursday at the request of the Broadview police to clear the roadway and to create “designated protest areas.”\n\nBut resident Arnettra Westbrooks wants her mayor to do more. She would like Thompson to institute a curfew on protesters “because there’s a lot of senior citizens living around there.”\n\n“On Fridays they are there until 10 or 11 o’clock and all that’s doing is pissing ICE off. Go home,” she says.\n\nThe criticism is mild compared to some of the insults cropping up from across the country from Trump supporters and other critics on Thompson’s Facebook page.\n\nFinding solace and inspiration\n\nThe last few weeks have brought “real heavy days,” the mayor says, and she worries that escalated violence at the facility will lead to severe injuries or worse.\n\nBut as Thompson continues to find her footing on a bigger stage, the faithful Baptist says she has seen signs of encouragement from guardian angels — her sister, who died in 2011, and her grandparents.\n\nThe other day an orange and black butterfly flew across 25th Avenue, “something I’ve never seen across a major street,” Thompson says, adding that she “likes butterflies, because it’s a real birth to freedom.”\n\nShe thanked her sister, Rolisha, for what she saw as “confirmation that I’m gonna be OK.” She also heard her grandma’s voice in her head.\n\n“My grandmother was like ‘Just stand. Don’t take sh-t … from nobody.’”\n\nContributing: Bob Chiarito","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/04/broadview-mayor-katrina-thompson-ice-detention-center-arrests-kristi-noem-gregory-bovino","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a03939/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5458x3639+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F87%2F9e%2F7a58b34a4e1c991215acbbd86d54%2Fbroad","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 11:00:00","author":"Mariah Woelfel | WBEZ","authors":["Mariah Woelfel | WBEZ"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.07},{"id":366364610,"title":"Trump officials cut nearly $8bn in clean energy projects in Democratic states","text":"The Trump administration is cancelling $7.6bn in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.\n\nThe move comes as Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.\n\nThe energy department said in a statement on Thursday that 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Officials did not provide details about which projects are being cut, but said funding came from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and other energy department bureaus.\n\nThe cuts are likely to affect battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and carbon-capture efforts, among many others, according to the environmental non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nRuss Vought, the White House budget director, highlighted the cutbacks in a social media post late on Wednesday, saying money “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled”.\n\nHe said projects are on the chopping block in: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.\n\nVought and the energy department did not explain how they came up with their list of targeted states, considering that dozens of states have clean energy projects. But all 16 targeted states supported Harris, and in each of those states, both US senators voted against the Republican’s short-term funding bill to keep the government working.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2bn for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1bn for a hydrogen project in the Pacific north-west. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean energy supporters who obtained a list of the energy department targets.\n\nTrump said in an interview taped on Wednesday with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects Democrats want – “favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut”.\n\nTrump’s comments show that he and Vought are treating American “families and their livelihoods like pawns in some sort of sick political game”, said Patty Murray, a Democratic senator for Washington.\n\n“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” she said in a statement. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”\n\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom said the private sector has committed $10bn for the state’s hydrogen project, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, (Arches). The cut threatens more than 200,000 jobs, Newsom said.\n\nAlex Padilla, a Democratic senator from California, called cancelation of the project “vindictive, shortsighted and proof this administration is not serious about American energy dominance”.\n\nThe California project is one of seven clean energy projects from West Virginia to Washington state selected by the Biden administration for a $7bn program to kickstart development and production of hydrogen fuel, part of former president Joe Biden’s agenda to slow the climate crisis.\n\n“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” energy secretary Chris Wright said.\n\nWright told CNN on Thursday night that the cancellations had nothing to do with the shutdown or politics. “These decisions are made – business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not. So, no, these projects will not be restored” when the government reopens, he said.\n\nWhile the current cancellations are in Democratic-led states, Wright said other projects, including hydrogen proposals in West Virginia, Texas and Louisiana, are being evaluated.\n\n“We’ve announced project cancellations before in red and blue states. And as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright said. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”\n\nAward recipients have 30 days to appeal the energy department’s termination decision.\n\nThe Trump administration has broadly targeted climate programs and clean energy grants, and is proposing to roll back vehicle emission and other greenhouse gas rules it says can’t be justified. Last week, the energy department rescinded $13bn that was intended for clean energy projects. The money was authorized by Congress in the 2022 climate law signed by Biden but had not yet been spent.\n\nDemocrats and environmental organizations were quick to slam the latest cuts, saying they would raise energy costs.\n\n“This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong, a senior vice-president at NRDC.\n\nConrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the move “pulls the rug out” from dozens of communities and workers that are counting on the projects. It also “weakens the US’s position in the global marketplace” for innovative energy technologies, he said.","summary":"Democrats and environmental groups slam move as ‘sick political game’ and say it will drive up energy bills\n\nThe Trump administration is cancelling $7.6bn in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.\n\nThe move comes as Donald Trump threatens deep cuts in his fight with congressional Democrats over the government shutdown.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/04/trump-clean-energy-cuts-democrat-states","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c689f48353fa0c9571b62b484e4bc58317924386/335_0_3331_2664/master/3331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 10:00:04","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":366140276,"title":"Trump slashed $8 billion for energy projects in blue states. In California, that could be felt in red areas as well","text":"The Trump administration this week escalated its efforts against renewable energy when it announced the cancellation of $7.56 billion in funding for projects in 16 states, including California. The U.S. Department of Energy said the 223 canceled projects — all of which are in states that favored Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election — were terminated because they \"did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.\" But while the cuts took aim at blue states, they will affect Trump's base as well: The terminated projects span districts represented by 108 Democratic members of Congress and 28 Republicans. In California, that includes large swaths of the Central Valley and Inland Empire, which largely leaned toward Trump in 2024. Russell Vought, director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget and a top Trump administration official, said in a post on X that the canceled projects were using \"Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda.\" The biggest cut was $1.2 billion for California's ambitious project to develop clean hydrogen known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. It was awarded by the Biden administration as part of a competitive nationwide effort to develop hydrogen projects. The idea is that the hydrogen, which burns at a very high temperature, will be able to replace planet-warming fossil fuels in some industry and transportation uses. The ARCHES project is a public-private partnership that would create at least 10 hydrogen production sites around the state, primarily in the Central Valley. It would also help transition two large gas-fired power plants — Scattergood in Los Angeles and the Lodi Energy Center in San Joaquin County — to 100% renewable hydrogen, and develop more than 60 hydrogen fueling stations in areas including Fresno, Riverside, Orange and San Joaquin counties. In all, it would deliver an estimated 220,000 jobs, including 130,000 construction jobs and 90,000 permanent jobs, according to the state. California is pursuing hydrogen in addition to renewables such as offshore wind, solar power and geothermal energy to help diversify its supply, meet growing demand driven by artificial intelligence data centers, and reach its target of 100% carbon neutrality by 2045. The Trump administration said terminating the clean energy projects will save taxpayers money. One district with a project that's been cut is the northern San Joaquin Valley, represented by Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove). McClintock said he strongly supports the Energy Department's decision. \"$7.5 billion comes out to about $60 taken from the average earnings of every family in America,\" McClintock said. \"Call me old fashioned, but I think that companies should make their money by pleasing their customers and not by using government to take money that families have earned.\" The Times also reached out to Reps. Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield), Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale), Keven Kiley (R-Rocklin), Ken Calvert (R-Corona), Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills) and Jay Obernolte (R-Big Bear Lake), whose districts are touched by the ARCHES hub and other terminated projects. A representative for Fong said his office was dealing with issues related to the U.S. government shutdown and so was unable to comment. None of the others responded. Jesse Lee, senior advisor with the nonprofit group Climate Power, said the cancellations may not save taxpayers money, but cost them. The administration this year has canceled a $7 billion program to help low-income households install solar panels on their homes and halted the development of off-shore wind projects, among other efforts. \"Having these projects come to fruition is really the only chance we have at insulating people from skyrocketing utility bills year after year,\" Lee said — particularly in the face of energy-thirsty AI. \"The only way to have a prayer of meeting that demand is through these kinds of clean energy projects.\" Lee believes the actions could come back to haunt the party in the midterm elections. Since Trump took office in January, at least 142 clean energy projects have been canceled affecting what his group estimates is at least 80,500 jobs — not including the latest round of cuts announced this week. About 47% of those jobs were in congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Clean Power’s energy project tracker. Democratic officials in California said the Energy Department's latest cuts amount to political retaliation. They were announced on the first day of the shutdown, which the administration blames on Democrats. \"The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof that this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,\" California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla wrote in a joint letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright dated Thursday, in which they urged him to restore its funding. \"The cancellation of this award threatens the future promise of hydrogen energy, leaving us behind the rest of the world,\" the senators said. \"The ARCHES hub is a key strategic investment into American energy dominance, energy technology prominence, manufacturing job growth, and lowering energy costs for American families.\" The cuts come as the Trump administrations eases the path for production of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, including this week's announcement that it will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to recommission or modernize coal-fired power plants. Coal has become increasingly uncompetitive with either natural gas or solar power. Large-scale renewable energy and carbon capture projects in red states such as Wyoming, Ohio, Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota that received funding from the Energy Department were not subject to the cuts. Other canceled awards in California include $630 million to the California Energy Commission for grid resilience upgrades; $500 million to the National Cement Company of California for a carbon-neutral cement production facility; $87 million to Redwood Coast Energy Authority for grid updates benefiting tribal communities; $50 million to Southern California Edison for a battery energy storage project; and $18 million to the Imperial Irrigation District to modernize its electrical grid, bolster resiliency against power outages and catalyze renewable energy usage. \"We are disappointed as we did a great deal of work to win the $18.3 million matching grant from the DOE to help modernize our electrical grid and enhance reliability for our customers,\" said Robert Schettler, a spokesman for the Imperial Irrigation District located in southeastern California. \"Despite this setback, we will reevaluate the scope as the project is a necessity.\" Officials with ARCHES called the administration's decision a \"short-sighted move that abandons America's opportunity to lead the global clean energy transition.\" They said they hope to keep the project moving forward even without the federal grant; ARCHES has also secured more than $10 billion in private funding agreements. \"Despite the loss of federal funding, we will press forward with our state, private, and international partners to build the infrastructure, train the workforce, and establish the supply chains that will power a modern, resilient energy economy,\" ARCHES board chair Theresa Maldonado said in a statement.","summary":"The terminated projects span districts represented by 108 Democratic members of Congress and 28 Republicans.

New York mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared with firefighters. When producer Lorne Michaels asked: “Can we be funny?”, Giuliani replied: “Why start now?”\n\nIt was September 2001 and, just 18 days after the worst terrorist attack in US history, Saturday Night Live’s blend of satire, silliness and live music was back on the air. “In bad times, people turn to the show,” Michaels told Rolling Stone magazine 20 years later.\n\nSNL turns 50 this month and must once again try to meet the moment. This time, the crisis is not external but taking place in late-night TV comedy itself. In recent weeks, the genre has become the canary in the coal mine of US democracy.\n\nOver the summer, CBS announced the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ostensibly for financial reasons, though notably Colbert is a longtime Trump critic and CBS owner Paramount had been seeking government approval of an $8bn merger with Skydance.\n\nOn 17 September, ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel’s show over comments he made after the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. Hours before the suspension, the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, warned that local broadcasters who aired Kimmel could face fines or loss of licences and said: “It’s time for them to step up.”\n\nThe move prompted an outcry over freedom of speech. ABC parent Disney faced pressure from Kimmel’s fans, some of whom cancelled subscriptions to the company’s streaming services Disney+ and Hulu. Kimmel returned to the air six days later and mocked Trump: “He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show.”\n\nNow the spotlight shifts from CBS and ABC to America’s other major network: NBC. When SNL returns on 4 October, Bad Bunny will host with Doja Cat as the musical guest and five new featured players following several cast departures. But no moment will matter more than the “cold open” in how it deals with the current climate.\n\n“This would be one of the biggest, most important cold openings in the 50-year history of the show,” says Stephen Farnsworth, a co-author of Late Night With Trump: Political Humor and the American Presidency. “But in the past, when Saturday Night Live has faced a major challenge, like they did in the wake of 9/11, they’ve risen to the occasion.”\n\nSNL’s mockery of Trump has at times earned the wrath of his supporters and the president himself, but Farnsworth advised against pulling punches, saying: “Saturday Night Live will face charges that it isn’t going far enough or that it went too far pretty much no matter what they do, so there’s no reason not to be all in.”\n\nFarnsworth, the director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, adds: “It’s striking that a man who desires the spotlight as much as the president does, who wants to be a public figure as badly as he has over the years, doesn’t understand that criticism is part of the package that comes with power.”\n\nLaunched a year after the Watergate scandal toppled Richard Nixon, SNL features sketches and live musical performances. But it is also known for covering politics and featuring politicians. The weekend update segment provides ongoing commentary while cast members often parody presidents, candidates and other figures.\n\nThe most famous include Gerald Ford (Chevy Chase), George HW Bush (Dana Carvey), Bill Clinton (Darrell Hammond), George W Bush (Will Ferrell), Sarah Palin (Tina Fey), Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin) and Joe Biden (various cast and guest actors). Trump is now portrayed with aplomb by James Austin Johnson.\n\nSusan Morrison, author of Lorne, a biography of Michaels, recalls: “When Alec Baldwin was doing him, Trump was furiously tweeting right about SNL: it wasn’t funny, FCC should investigate, Lorne was over. Watching Alec Baldwin do his thing, it almost felt like bear baiting. It was so fun to watch the back and forth, and don’t anticipate that they’re going to pull back.”\n\nPoliticians have also appeared as hosts or in cameos. Al Gore, John McCain, Jesse Jackson and Sarah Palin have all featured. Trump hosted in 2004 and, more controversially, in 2015 during his presidential run. Hillary Clinton appeared multiple times, including alongside her impersonator, Kate McKinnon, and Kamala Harris took part before last year’s election.\n\nThe show picked up 12 Emmys recently for its 50th season and anniversary programming, including an award for outstanding variety special. Saturday’s episode will be scrutinised closely for how it deals with Trump’s attack on comedy, free expression and democracy – and whether it can make a serious point in a funny, unsanctimonious way.\n\nMorrison continues: “Lorne and his very smart writers will come up with some clever but on-the-nose way of dealing with this. The thing that it’s important to remember about Lorne is he’s been doing this for so many decades. He’s outlasted so many slates of executives. He’s a survivor. As Conan [O’Brien] told me, in the Game of Thrones of show business, Lorne would be the last man standing.\n\n“That isn’t to say that he’s going to cave but he will figure out a way to address this and stay on the air. I also don’t think the people at NBC or Comcast or the FCC are going to mess with him. He’s too much of a statesman in the TV business. But he’s going to come up with a way of dealing with it and addressing it and he’ll be funny about it.”\n\nConservatives have long accused SNL of bias, arguing that the show disproportionately lampoons right-leaning figures while going easier on Democrats. Former head writer Tina Fey openly acknowledged a “liberal bias” in a 2003 interview, fueling the narrative. But Michaels insists that it is nonpartisan and willing to mock both sides.\n\nMorrison adds: “It isn’t to say he would ever be an apologist for the Trump regime; nobody could have expected that politics would jump the shark in quite this way. But he certainly would not hesitate to make fun of Democrats even now if they merit it and that’s part of it.\n\n“To quote Jim Downey, one of the show’s longtime writers, you never want the show to seem like it’s the comedy division of the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Lorne is committed to that and that will help here as well.”\n\nDavid Litt, aformer speechwriter for Barack Obama dubbed “the comic muse for the president” for his work on White House Correspondents’ Association dinner monologues, acknowledges that he has been on the receiving end.\n\n“I was in the audience at SNL when their cold open was about the Obamacare website crashing,” he said. “I was working at the White House at the time and I remember thinking, I’m not having fun. Everyone else in the audience seemed be having a better time than I was.”\n\nWriting comic material under time pressure is tough, Litt says, and that will be the SNL team’s top priority for the new season. He said: “This is a show that rises to a pretty intense challenge every week and I assume they’re going to be thinking about rising to the exact same challenge, which is, how do we turn around a show that is good and funny because that’s hard enough without having the president of the United States breathing down your neck.\n\n“That’s part of what infuriates Trump so much about comedians. It’s not that they’re making fun of him, it’s that the audience is laughing. It’s connecting. If Kimmel or Colbert or weekend update was making a joke about Trump and the audience was rejecting that joke, I don’t think Trump would care. It’s the fact that it exposes him as still, despite everything, a fundamentally laughable person, or at least a human person.”\n\nLitt, whose new book, It’s Only Drowning, is about his unlikely friendship with a Joe Rogan fan, adds: “I can’t imagine that people are going to be sitting around a writers’ room saying, how do we address this as though they were journalists. I think they’re saying, how do we do funny stuff? Because doing funny stuff is really hard.”\n\nSNL has already used up one potential Trump gag. Its cold open on 9 November last year, the first weekend after Trump won the presidential election, was entitled SNL for Trump and had cast members sarcastically trying to get on Trump’s good side, singing: “We will, whatever you want.” The sketch was a satirical take on the public figures and institutions that had shifted their stances or expressed deference to Trump for political or personal gain.\n\nBill Carter, author of the book The Late Shift and executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, says: “The gauntlet has been thrown now and, if they don’t do something, they will disappoint people. People will be expecting their take and their take won’t be the most obvious one. It’ll be some creative way of approaching it. They have a very good Trump right now so they ought to use him.”\n\nTrump has frequently railed against SNL over the years and is likely to be watching its return with fingers poised for a hot take on the cold open. But like Morrison, Carter thinks it unlikely that SNL will suffer the same fate as Colbert or Kimmel.\n\n“Unlike those shows, Trump cannot say this has terrible ratings and does not make money,” he says. “Saturday Night Live does not have terrible ratings. In fact, with the right host, it will often be among the most watched shows on television. And it has the best demographics on any show on television except for sports.\n\n“The idea that they would abandon that show is nuts, because if they did, some streaming service would say, we’ll put on Saturday Night Live. It’s 50 years that show’s been on. It’s had an audience all those times of a new generation of viewers. It continues to do that so it’s a tremendously valuable franchise. NBC is not walking away from that show. I don’t care what pressure they put on it.”","summary":"The return of the long-running series lands at a difficult time for late-night comedy – and free speech\n\nPaul Simon sang The Boxer.

Leftist Media Blame Kirk Assassination on Conservatives","text":"In the immediate aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, there were sickening statements made by both journalists and celebrities that either blamed Kirk himself or conservative rhetoric for his death. \n\nBefore Kirk’s death was even confirmed, MSNBC contributor Matthew Dowd criticized Kirk for constantly pushing “hate speech” and added: “hateful words….lead to hateful actions.” \n\nCBS Mornings host Nate Burleson pressed former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy: “Not everyone took to his [Charlie Kirk] words or his rhetoric….They were offensive to specific communities….Is this a moment for your party to reflect on political violence?”\n\nFormer MSNBC host Keith Olbermann actually put the onus on the President: “Charlie Kirk is dead – as so many others are dead or threatened or wounded or living in fear – because there is a Donald Trump.”\n\nThe Hollywood Left also pushed the angle that conservatives were at fault. ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel’s spreading of this disinformation got him briefly suspended: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”\n\nSadly, the calls for the left to tone down their rhetoric (in the wake of the Kirk shooting) went largely unheeded as they quickly returned to their attacks on “authoritarian” Trump’s attacks on democracy. \n\nThe following are just some of the most obnoxious outbursts by leftist journalists and celebrities from the past month:\n\n[LANGUAGE WARNING]\n\nMSNBC: Charlie Kirk’s “Hate Speech” Got Him Shot\n\nHost Katy Tur: Talk to me about the environment. You know, we are — there are the reports of exactly what happened — are not confirmed yet, but talk to me about the environment in which a shooting like this happens.”Contributor Matthew Dowd: “Yeah. And again, I emphasize what you just emphasized. We don’t know the full details of this. We don’t know if this was a supporter shooting their gun off in celebration or — so, we have no idea about this. But following up on what was just said, he’s [Charlie Kirk] been one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures in this who has constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech or sort of aimed at certain groups and I always go back to hateful thoughts, lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions. And I think that’s the environment we’re in that, that people just — you can’t stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and not expect awful actions to take place and that’s the unfortunate environment we’re in.”— Conversation between Tur and Dowd just moments after the first report of Charlie Kirk being shot, as aired on MSNBC’s Katy Tur Reports, September 10.\n\n“Offensive” Kirk Was Shot, Is This a Time for GOP to “Reflect on Political Violence?” \n\n“Not everyone took to his [Charlie Kirk] words or his rhetoric. You know, at times they were offensive to specific communities. But with that said, this is not the time to focus on that, we are focused on this tragedy. Speaking of tragedy, is this a moment for your party to reflect on political violence?”— Co-host Nate Burleson to former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on CBS Mornings, September 11.\n\nKeith Olbermann: Kirk Is Dead Because of Donald Trump’s Rhetoric\n\n“Charlie Kirk was killed in Donald Trump’s America. It is not just that Trump is the leading threat in this country, in this moment, to the safety and the lives of conservatives and Republicans and MAGA. It is that he has been for a decade. Charlie Kirk is dead – as so many others are dead or threatened or wounded or living in fear – because there is a Donald Trump.”— Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann, after listing various past Trump statements, on his Countdown podcast, September 18. \n\nDon Lemon: Can’t Excuse Kirk’s “Behavior,” Most of Political Violence Is Done by Right-Wingers\n\n“I want Charlie Kirk to be okay. But, no one is excusing Charlie Kirk’s behavior and what he’s done and what he stands for. And, a lot of that political violence, if not most of it — it happens on both sides of the aisle—but a lot of that political violence comes from the right….The MAGA right can say what they want, but most of the political violence, especially the shootings, have been done….by young, white men who are usually right-wingers, and some of them far right-wingers.” — Former CNN anchor Don Lemon on The Don Lemon Show podcast, September 10. \n\nKirk Has Become a “Symbol of the Toxic Culture” That We’re In Now\n\n“He [Charlie Kirk] said a lot of things that got a lot of people riled up, right? And that was part of his style about race, about gender, about affirmative action and Islam and things like that…..He’s – you know – become in this last few days, I think, a symbol of the toxic culture that we’re in right now, in politics.”— The New York Times’s Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker on PBS’s Washington Week in Review, September 12. \n\n“Divisive” Kirk Was “Known to Make Racist Statements” \n\n“The reason that he [Charlie Kirk] is seen as a divisive figure, and why the left has had a reaction as well in this is because he has been known to make racist statements….and has definitely lobbed a number of attacks on transgender individuals. And so there's a lot across the LGBTQ advocacy space who are opposed to him.”— MSNBC White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez on PBS’s Washington Week in Review, September 12. \n\nAt Least Kirk Wasn’t As “Caustic” As Rush Limbaugh\n\n“Charlie Kirk, I think, kind of patented almost was the ability to do this and seem likable, friendly, open….He modeled himself early on after Rush Limbaugh, but without Limbaugh’s hard edges. I mean, Limbaugh was, you know, caustic constantly.”— Atlantic staff writer Tom Nichols on PBS’s Washington Week in Review, September 12. \n\nJohn Dickerson: “Shooter’s Motive Remains Elusive”\n\n“Five days after Charlie Kirk’s murder, the shooter’s motive remains elusive. No writings left behind. Vague, secondhand testimony. That uncertainty, and the risk of drawing sweeping conclusions, suggests the murder may share similarities with recent violence not driven by an obvious political ideology.” — Anchor John Dickerson on CBS Evening News Plus, September 15.\n\nKirk Assassin’s Texts Were “Touching”\n\n“The other thing that stood out to me, David, is those text messages….It was very touching in a way that I think many of us didn’t expect — a very intimate portrait into this relationship between the suspect’s roommate and the suspect himself, with him repeatedly calling his roommate, who is transitioning, calling him ‘my love’ and ‘I want to protect you, my love.’ So, it was this duality of someone who the attorney said not only jeopardized the life of Charlie Kirk and the crowd….and then, on the other hand, he was, you know, speaking so lovingly about his partner.”— Correspondent Matt Gutman on live ABC News Special, September 16.\n\n“Snowflake Fascism” of MAGA Got Get Kimmel Removed\n\n“It’s another day that ends in Y and Donald Trump’s assault on American democracy. We have entered a new era of snowflake fascism, ladies and gentlemen, in the U.S., where the snowflakes on the far-right whine and complain every time somebody hurts their feelings. The weak-kneed corporate executives who only know how to smooch Trump’s butt simply go along with the dear leader’s demands. The latest example, the canceling of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night TV show. All Kimmel did was call out MAGA for attempting to capitalize on the death of Charlie Kirk – which of course, they did.”— Former CNN correspondent Jim Acosta on The Jim Acosta Show podcast, September 18.\n\nYou Know Who Else Went After Comedians? Putin!\n\n“[Vladimir] Putin came to power on New Year’s night, 1999-2000. And, you know who he went after first? This will sound a little familiar to you: comedians.”— The New Yorker editor David Remnick to host Stephen Colbert on Jimmy Kimmel being suspended by ABC, as aired on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, September 18.\n\nOlbermann’s Hateful Outburst\n\n“Burn in hell, Sinclair. Alongside Charlie Kirk.”— Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann on his X.com account responding to Sinclair statement calling for action against Jimmy Kimmel for lying about Charlie Kirk’s killer motives, September 17. \n\nThe Biggest Threat From Kirk’s Assassination? Conservatives Imperiling Democracy\n\n“Today’s conservatism is animated by resentment, fear, and a consequent will to dominate its opponents. Kirk’s assassination has reinforced these authoritarian impulses and provided a pretense for indulging them. In doing so, it has thrown our already imperiled democracy into even greater jeopardy.”— Columnist Eric Levitz in a September 11 article for Vox. \n\nTrump Declares War on an American City\n\n“On Friday, President Trump rebranded the Department of Defense the ‘Department of War.’ Saturday, he announced the department’s first target, an American city. The President’s words: ‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of War.’ A chorus of criticism followed.”...And this chilling threat from President Trump comes after a week of challenges.”— Moderator George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week, September 7.\n\nICE Going After “Anne Franks” In Chicago\n\n“I posted about the fact that there are little Anne Franks, right? Anne Frank in Chicago – her name is Anita Franco, and she is terrified.”— NPR’s Latino USA anchor Maria Hinojosa on MSNBC’s The Weekend, September 20.\n\n“Trump’s Retribution Campaign” Reached A “New and Ominous Level”\n\n“President Trump’s retribution campaign reached a new and ominous level late yesterday. The first criminal indictment of a man Trump considers a political enemy. Since the Watergate scandal, more than 50 years ago, presidents have refrained from interfering directly in criminal prosecutions by the Justice Department. The facts surrounding the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey showed that those norms have been shattered.”— Co-host George Stephanopoulos opening ABC’s Good Morning America, September 26. \n\n“Authoritarian” Trump’s “Unsavory, Unconstitutional” Retribution on James Comey\n\n“We now have a president of the United States that has an authoritarian bent like we’ve never seen before and that he feels that retribution is his job in his second term….People in the Justice Department, careerists, are looking to leave. Why would you want to have a boss to tell you to make things up or behave in this sort of unsavory, unconstitutional way just to serve the whims of the President?” — Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley on CBS Mornings, September 26.\n\nTrump Out to “Shatter Norms and Carry On” \n\n“Trump allies like Stephen Bannon tell me there is anxiety instead among some inside about not moving fast enough to overhaul the Justice Department and ramp up investigations, and the president is telling aides and allies to do more because he’s confident he does have the executive power to shatter norms and carry on.”— Correspondent Robert Costa on CBS Evening News, September 26. \n\nTrump’s Second Term Is an “Efficient, Ruthless” Turn Toward “Authoritarianism” \n\n“The [Trump] first term was filled with impulses, and the second term is efficient, ruthless, and it’s happening every day. This movement toward authoritarianism is very distinct and needs to be taken seriously.”— New Yorker editor David Remnick on NBC’s Meet the Press, September 28.\n\nWe Aren’t Sliding Into Authoritarianism Under Trump, We’re Already In It \n\n“We’re talking about yet another level deeper into what lots of academicians and others have said, you know, the march to authoritarianism. People say we’re sliding into it. I say, no, we’re in it.”— Contributor Jonathan Capehart on PBS’s News Hour, September 19. \n\nEddie Glaude Attacks “Evil” and “Monstrous” MAGA\n\n“We are awash with monstrous behavior that suggests that what Trumpism and MAGA-ism – what they have tapped into is something that has been a part of this nation since its founding that has allowed us to look the evil of what we’ve done squarely in the face and to move on.”— Contributor Eddie Glaude on Trump administration’s deportation policy on MSNBC’s Deadline: White House, September 15. \n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos to Speaker of the House: Why Are You Against Americans Having Health Care? \n\nCo-host George Stephanopoulos: “The Democratic proposal is designed to prevent millions of Americans from losing their health insurance, losing Medicaid coverage, or paying higher healthcare premiums.

Let’s be clear about what happened last night, George.”Stephanopoulos: “It’s a factual statement.”— Co-host George Stephanopoulos to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on ABC’s Good Morning America, October 1.\n\nKamala Harris Gets Hard-Hitting Questions on Her Book Tour\n\n“You’ve become the patron saint of ‘I told you so,’ in terms of people understanding the sort of warnings and predictions that you made about what Trump would be like.”— Host Rachel Maddow to former Vice President Kamala Harris on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show, September 22. \n\n“Madam Vice President, since Trump has taken office, everything that you warned about has happened. Do you sometimes just want to scream, ‘I told y’all so!?’ — and feel free to do it right now.”— Co-host Sunny Hostin to former Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC’s The View, September 23. \n\nTrump Has Declared War Against People in His Own Country\n\n“Didn’t he [Donald Trump] run on being an anti-war candidate? The MAGA people who voted for him, one of the reasons they liked him is because he was against war. He took on Bush. I guess that didn’t include war against your own people in your own country.”— Co-host Joy Behar during a discussion about Trump’s crime crackdown in cities, as aired on ABC’s The View, September 8. \n\nJoy Behar: I’m “Skeptical” That America Will “Survive” Trump \n\n“If you guys think that we can survive another three-and-a-half years of this, I think you’re delusional….Every day, this guy is undoing something in this country that we value. Every day! It’s every day is a shock and awe here. And I, for one, am skeptical that we will survive this.”— Co-host Joy Behar on ABC’s The View, September 30.\n\nJimmy Kimmel: MAGA “Desperately Trying” To Portray Kirk’s Killer As Not “One of Them”\n\n“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”— Host Jimmy Kimmel on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!, September 15.\n\nPunk Rock Singer Bobby Vylan Calls Charlie Kirk a “Piece of S***”\n\n“I wanna dedicate this next one to an absolute piece of shit of a human being.

You piece of shit!”— Punk rock singer Bobby Vylan on the stage of Amsterdam’s Club Paradiso, September 13.\n\nTrump Is “Amassing Power In A Way That Will Destroy Our Democracy”\n\n“No president has ever sent troops into the Democratic cities across the country, saying ‘full force.’ No president, as far as I know, has tried to control the Federal Reserve, the central bank. He is amassing power in a way that will destroy our democracy.”— Actress/activist Jane Fonda on CNN’s Inside Politics with Dana Bash, October 1. \n\nRosie O’Donnell’s Crazy Ear Conspiracy Theory \n\n“His [Donald Trump] assassination attempt, a man died during that assassination attempt. A man died. And it wasn’t him. And his ear miraculously healed. Ladies and gentlemen, will anyone in the news ever say that without couching it? His ear miraculously regenerated. People, what else do you need?”— Comedian/former ABC’s The View co-host Rosie O’Donnell on The Jim Acosta Show podcast, September 5.","summary":"In the immediate aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, there were sickening statements made by both journalists and celebrities that either blamed Kirk himself or conservative rhetoric for his death. \n\nBefore Kirk’s death was even confirmed, MSNBC contributor Matthew Dowd criticized Kirk for constantly pushing “hate speech” and added: “hateful words….lead to hateful actions.” \n\nCBS Mornings host Nate Burleson pressed former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy: “Not everyone took to his [Charlie Kirk] words or his rhetoric….They were offensive to specific communities….Is this a moment for your party to reflect on political violence?”\n\nFormer MSNBC host Keith Olbermann actually put the onus on the President: “Charlie Kirk is dead – as so many others are dead or threatened or wounded or living in fear – because there is a Donald Trump.”\n\nThe Hollywood Left also pushed the angle that conservatives were at fault.

Elliott Morris posted in his Substack blog Strength In Numbers, Trump’s net approval among people aged 18 to 29 has declined by 35 percentage points since November 2024.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Newsweek: “President Donald Trump is keeping his promises and Making America Great Again: whether it’s securing the border, securing historic investments in American manufacturing, taming Biden’s inflation crisis, or fighting against the Democrats’ radical demands of free health care for illegal aliens.” Referring to a Rasmussen Reports poll from September 25, she added: “That’s why over 57 percent of Americans approve of the President and the incredible job he’s doing!”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nYoung people tend to support the Democratic Party, but a conservative shift among younger voters proved key to Trump’s success in the November 2024 elections.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to senior military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico on September 30, 2025 in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, voters ages 18 to 29 supported Joe Biden by 61 percent to Trump’s 36 percent in 2020. But four years later, the proportion of Democratic-supporting young people declined and 51 percent voted for then Vice President Kamala Harris and 47 percent opted for Trump.\n\nIf the trend toward the GOP is reversing and the Democrats are seeing success among young people once more, Republicans may struggle to hold onto gains they made in 2024.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nMorris analyzed 7,000 interviews delivered over the course of five months and compared them to previous reports from the poll respondents about their 2024 election choices to track changing opinions.\n\nHe found that Trump’s approval rating among this group has declined by 35 percentage points, from -3 to -38.\n\nHe said that in particular, Trump had lost the support of young Hispanic voters, something he said had occurred because of Trump’s tariff and immigration policies.\n\nHowever, other polls suggest Trump’s fortunes with young people are less bleak. As per new polling by AtlasIntel, Trump’s approval rating among adults ages 18 to 29, has improved by 35 percentage points in two months.\n\nMeanwhile, in July, YouGov/The Economist polling found that Trump’s favorability among Gen Z was improving. His net approval among this group stood at -28 percent percentage points, an improvement on July when this figure was -38.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek Olivia Julianna, a Gen-Z political activist said: “Since Donald Trump took office, the cost of living has gone up everywhere—housing, groceries, fuel, utilities. If Republicans keep the government shutdown, health care prices will be next.\n\n“Many young people supported Trump because they thought he had real answers. Instead, they’ve seen a president more focused on culture war stunts—renaming the Department of Defense, fighting over the name of the Gulf of Mexico, and attacking celebrities from official accounts.\n\n“All the while, he’s been focused on enriching himself and his donors, not helping the people who believed in him.”\n\nThomas Whalen, an associate professor who teaches U.S. politics at Boston University, told Newsweek: “Well, they weren’t enthused with Biden, so it’s no surprise they’re not crazy for Trump, who is equally ancient and out of touch in their eyes.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTrump’s popularity among young people and other voting demographics will likely fluctuate throughout his presidency. The midterm elections in November 2026 will test this popularity in earnest.","summary":"Survey data shows Trump&#039;s approval rating among young people has declined by around 35 percentage points since November 2024.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-approval-rating-plummets-among-young-10816838","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238300075.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 08:00:00","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":366100346,"title":"‘Trump’s decomposing ear of corn’: what does ‘hair certainty’ tell us about our leaders?","text":"Labour has an image problem. In a recent YouGov survey, people expressed a view that the party is “dishonest”, “only interested in themselves”, and “the same as the rest”. It’s no wonder that they are currently, terrifyingly, 10 points behind Reform in the polls. They also, by a slightly different – you could say less data-driven – metric, have a different kind of image problem. They lack “hair certainty”, from the top down.\n\n The idea of “hair certainty” was coined by the writer Simon Doonan. Writing in the buildup to the 2016 presidential election that would see Donald Trump first take office, he explained: “Presidential hair = hair with certainty … Hair-certainty describes hair that is what it appears to be. No illusions. No Greco-Roman fakery. Presidential hair can be thick or thin. Presidential hair can be messy. Presidential hair can be sparse, naff, and filled with dandruff. But, whatever it is, it just needs to have that certainty.”\n\nBack then, Doonan discounted Trump’s “iconic coiffure”, saying: “It’s Liberace’s candelabra. It’s Mick Jagger’s lips … But is it presidential? I am rather afraid not.”\n\nSpeaking now, he explains: “I put him in the category of ‘not going to get elected’, because his hair is a bit of an enigma; overly complex and requiring salon maintenance.” Subsequently, Doonan realised “where his hair certainty lies. It’s in the idiom of the 50s pompadour. It’s Elvis. It’s Johnny Hallyday.” It is, he says, “attention seeking … a showbiz kind of do. I thought, ‘Oh, that’ll never fly in Washington’. But then, bingo, it did.” Keir Starmer’s, by contrast, is, “unnoteworthy”.\n\nLast week afforded the perfect opportunity to see the contrast. As Trump and Starmer brandished their freshly signed tech prosperity deal at a joint press conference during Trump’s state visit to the UK, they also gave us a chance to see, side by side, their signature coifs. Trump’s wispy champagne top gave way, as usual, to a Mr Whippy swirl, in turn descending into a duck’s arse flip. Starmer’s, by contrast, was rigor mortised up into its usual stiff, baklava-like crest.\n\nWhile both of these coifs are “signatures” – recognisably their own – one is far larger than life than the other. Trump’s hair, variously described as “a decomposing ear of corn”, “an airboat skimming the Everglades” and a “complex superstructure”, takes centre stage in merch and on the blimp that hovered over anti-Trump protests. Like his bombastic written signature, it demands attention.\n\nHair matters, according to Rachael Gibson, who goes by The Hair Historian on Instagram: “There’s not many body parts which tell people about us … hair reflects anything from your status, your place in society, your religion.” None of which is new. “Since day one people have done strange things to their hair for the sake of wanting to be interpreted differently, or to pass a message about themselves.” (She points to Louis XIV’s “big brown curly wigs [as] showing wealth and status”.)\n\nFar from it being a nonsense to think about political hair, it is yet another lens through which we can scrutinise politicians and the prevailing political winds. “It’s another form of nonverbal communication,” says Washington DC-based image coach and style strategist Lauren A Rothman. Consistency is all. “The language that I’ll use with my clients is ‘clothing, hair, makeup; your appearance that feels intentional, even if messy, creates trust’.”\n\nWhile Doonan stresses that hair certainty can’t get you elected, he thinks it can help. He takes Kamala Harris’s, which was read by some as a symbol of black hair autonomy, as an example. Not to say her success wasn’t down to her capabilities (or to forget that she went on, of course, to lose), but, he says, her hair “played a role in propelling her forward”.\n\nIt now feels like a salon’s worth of Republicans have hair certainty by the pound. Take the hair of newly minted “secretary of war” Pete Hegseth. While not a million miles from Starmer’s, it is different in ways that make it far more certain: it is extra stiff, extra pomaded; extra. Or the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and her grey streak. “It’s like Mrs Robinson or Cruella de Vil, or Susan Sontag, that stripe … that seems to resonate with that theatricality the Republicans uninhibitedly embrace,” says Doonan.\n\nFor men in power in particular, having a healthy head of hair, according to Gibson, “suggests that you’re a healthy person, you’re virile, you’re strong, you’re in good shape … all things that we want from a leader”. It’s enmeshed with masculinity. Hegseth, a former national guard officer, makes a hair-based performance of his; his mop is unruffled by the winds of a chopper, or by a work out. (Proof of how important of all this is to him came earlier this year, when he passed new rules and regulations about “standards” of grooming and appearance for the US army.) “He’s using hair and appearance as a proxy for discipline, order and tradition,” says Rothman.\n\nMuch of the hair certainty trend is a symptom of the glossy Maga aesthetic. “There’s a showbiz overlay that isn’t normally there in politics,” says Doonan, although US politics is consistently glossier than the UK’s. Hegseth is a former Fox News host, Trump is a former reality TV star.\n\nIt also fits with the dominant politics of the day. As Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, told the Guardian in 2023: “All politicians have a brand, but when you’re a populist politician, it has to be outsize, and outsize hair is part of that brand. It makes you recognisable to people who pay little attention to politics.”\n\nThere is a fine line between good grooming and looking as if you’re spending too much time in the salon, and too little in the Senate or the House – particularly for women, and particularly in the UK, where we saw fit to reward Boris Johnson, a man who appeared a stranger to a hairbrush, with the top job. British politicians, says Doonan, “have to be self-denying. You can’t seem like you’re spending all day agonising about your look.”\n\nWhile Doonan would argue that hair certainty is largely “an American phenomena”, he thinks that’s changing: “The media and social media has propelled all of us into this world where everything is about hair, basically.”Thankfully for us, whatever you think about Starmer’s cut, Nigel Farage’s hair is distinctly lacking too.","summary":"From Starmer’s stiff quiff to the Maga movement’s glossy TV locks, a politician’s mane can speak volumes – it says as much about what side of the divide they sit on as it does about the prevailing political winds\n\nLabour has an image problem.

The 44th President of the United States and his accomplished wife have been together for more than three decades, celebrating their 33rd wedding anniversary on October 3, 2025. To mark the occasion, Barack shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram, calling his marriage to Michelle “the best decision I ever made.”\n\nFrom his early days as an Illinois State Senator to two historic terms in the White House, and now through bestselling books, global projects, and family milestones, the Obamas continue to inspire with their enduring bond. Take a look back at Barack and Michelle’s love story with this timeline of their relationship.\n\nMeeting In 1989\n\nAt just 25 years old, Michelle was working as an attorney in the Southside of Chicago when she was asked to mentor Barack. While their relationship remained strictly professional at first, Barack eventually built up the courage to ask Michelle on a date. “Once [Barack and I] started talking and became friends, he was very clear — just like, ‘I want to date you.’ At least in my experience up until then, men would be coy. They would, you know, sort of look around the room. It was all so complicated, and it felt, a little immature,” Michelle recalled to Conan O’Brien.\n\n“What struck me about Barack was his, lack of pretense,” Michelle said. “I mean, he was somebody who knew what he wanted, and wasn’t afraid to say it. And, I thought, ‘well, if he’s that in tune with his emotions that he can say out loud to somebody that doesn’t know.’ He didn’t know whether I liked him back! He was like, ‘look, let me tell you, this is what I think about you: I think you’re special, I think you’re different, and I would like to take you out.’ And that was rare. And it was attractive.”\n\nWedding Bells In 1992\n\nThree years after their first date in the Southside of Chicago, Michelle and Barack exchanged their ‘I dos’ on October 3, 1992. Over the course of their nearly three-decade marriage, the couple have reflected on that day in the fall when they pledged their love for one another in front of family and friends. “You can’t tell it from this photo, but Barack woke up on our wedding day in October, 1992 with a nasty head cold,” Michelle began the caption to a photo she posted a few months before their 26th wedding anniversary.\n\n“Somehow, by the time I met him at the altar, it had miraculously disappeared and we ended up dancing almost all night. Twenty five years later, we’re still having fun, while also doing the hard work to build our partnership and support each other as individuals. I can’t imagine going on this wild ride with anybody else.”\n\nWelcoming Malia In 1998\n\nSix years into their marriage, Michelle and Barack welcomed their first of two daughters after years of difficulty conceiving. In the past, the former First Lady of the United States has been so incredibly forthcoming about what she and Barack endured in order to welcome their two amazing girls. “I felt like I failed because I didn’t know how common miscarriages were, because we don’t talk about them,” Michelle shared during a November 2018 interview.\n\n“We sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we’re broken. That’s one of the reasons why I think it’s important to talk to young mothers about the fact that miscarriages happen. I think it’s the worst thing that we do to each other as women, not share the truth about our bodies and how they work.” Thankfully, after IVF treatment, Michelle and Barack welcomed daughter Malia Ann Obama on July 4, 1998. But the family-of-three would soon have a new member to welcome!\n\nSasha Is Born In 2001\n\nOn June 10, 2001, Sasha made the Obama clan a family of four! Both Sasha and Malia have handled growing up in the spotlight with so much grace, having matured in the White House and lived on the national stage since they were just youngsters. But Barack and Michelle couldn’t be prouder of the young women their daughters have become.\n\n“They’re reflective of their generation in the sense they want to make a difference and they think about their careers in terms of: How do I have a positive impact? How do I make the world better?” the former president shared in a November 24, 2020 interview. “What particular paths they take in doing that, I think are going to change and vary between the two of them.”\n\nIllinois Senate In 2004\n\nBy 2004, the Obamas were steadily rising to the national stage. Barack announced himself as the newly-elected Illinois State Senator in 2004, and began to mold his legacy by working with his constituents. For her part, Michelle was always at Barack’s side on the campaign trail, while still holding down her job at the University of Chicago Hospitals. But in a few short years, the Obamas lives would be completely upended by one of the biggest decisions of Barack’s life.\n\nThe 2008 Election\n\nAs if Barack and Michelle hadn’t already proven that their union would go down in the history of American politics as one of the most supportive romantic partnerships on the national stage, the couple made history in November 2007 when Barack was elected as the 44th President of the United States. For the first time in American history, an African American family was the first family of the nation. The couple felt the pressure to meet all of the challenges that were ahead of them. But it did take a toll on their union.\n\nRe-Election In 2012\n\nAfter four years leading the United States in global and domestic politics, Barack was re-elected to a second term as the President of the United States. But upon reflection, the former commander in chief new that his marriage was struggling through the constant scrutiny. “I continued to sense an undercurrent of tension in her, subtle but constant, like the faint thrum of a hidden machine,” the former president recalled in his latest memoir, A Promised Land.\n\n“It was as if, confined as we were within the walls of the White House, all her previous sources of frustration became more concentrated, more vivid, whether it was my round the clock absorption with work, or the way politics exposed our family to scrutiny and attacks, or the tendency of even friends and family members to treat her role as secondary in importance.” Since leaving the White House, Michelle and Barack have been open about their marital struggles and have been completely transparent about attending marriage counseling. But after two terms in office, everything they endured made them so much stronger.\n\n30 Years Later\n\nAs soon as one chapter started another one came to a close. Michelle and Barack Obama left the White House in January 2017, following the election of President Donald Trump in November 2016. At first, the couple went back to private life — dropping off their daughters at college and spending some time together while pursing their new, individual goals. But as time passed under the Trump administration, the couple chose to use their voices once again, campaigning for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris with everything they had.\n\nAfter 30 years of marriage and counting, Michelle and Barack Obama are seemingly as in love as ever. The two regularly gush about one another on social media, and there is no denying that the spark of their love is still very much alight. “Even with everything going on, I wanted to take a moment to say happy anniversary to the love of my life. Every day with [Michelle Obama] makes me a better husband, a better father, and a better human,” Barack wrote in a caption for the couple’s 28th wedding anniversary.\n\n“I love [Barack Obama] for his smile, his character, and his compassion,” Michelle scribed for her own post on October 3. “So grateful to have him as a partner through everything life throws at us.” We cannot wait to see the Obamas love story continue to unfold for years to come.\n\nDespite their now close-knit bond, the lovebirds aren’t afraid of speaking out about previous hard times they had in their marriage. In 2022, Michelle talked about how there was a period of “10 years” when she “couldn’t stand” Barack. “People think I’m being catty by saying this — it’s like, there were 10 years where I couldn’t stand my husband. And guess when it happened? When those kids were little,” she told Revolt.\n\n“And for 10 years while we’re trying to build our careers and, you know, worrying about school and who’s doing what and what, I was like, ‘Ugh, this isn’t even.’ And guess what? Marriage isn’t 50/50, ever, ever,” she continued.\n\n“There are times I’m 70, he’s 30. There are times he’s 60, 40, but guess what? Ten years — we’ve been married 30,” she added. “I would take 10 bad years over 30 — it’s just how you look at it. And people give up … ‘Five years; I can’t take it.’”\n\nIn 2023, Barack reacted to Michelle’s comments by admitting that he was glad to be out of the White House because it’s made things better for them. “Let me just say this: it sure helps to be out of the White House. And to have a little more time with her,” he told CBS Mornings‘ Nate Burleson.\n\nThe doting husband said it also helped that their two daughters, Malia and Sasha are now adults. “Michelle — when our girls were growing up, that was priority number one, two, three and four,” he explained. “And so, I did not fully appreciate, I think, as engaged of a father as I was, the degree of stress and tension for her, knowing that not just me and Michelle were under scrutiny and in this strange environment, but that we were raising our daughters in a kind of situation that just wasn’t normal.”","summary":"View gallery Image Credit: Getty Images There has never been a First Couple quite like Barack and Michelle Obama.
