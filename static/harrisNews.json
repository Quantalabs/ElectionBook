She claimed to the Daily Mail that she believes Democrats will try and stop him from being sworn in as commander in chief.\n\n“It will revolve mostly around lawfare and trying to get declarations that he’s an insurrectionist, something along those lines,” Kelly dished to the outlet.\n\nKelly also called out the media for “ignoring” the abuse allegations against second husband Doug Emhoff.\n\n“There’s only one reason this one didn’t get coverage, and it’s because it’s Kamala Harri’s husband… It totally undermines the story they’ve been trying to sell us about this guy being our new version of masculinity.”","summary":"Conservative firebrand Megyn Kelly issued a dire warning ahead of Tuesday’s Presidential Election — painting a grim picture of life under a Kamala Harris regime.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/02/us-news/megyn-kelly-paints-grim-picture-of-potential-kamala-harris-presidency/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/92857523.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/g0sQGent-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-02 04:19:58","author":"Shane Galvin","authors":["Shane Galvin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.401}]}
