Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes.\n\nThe surprisingly low ranking places Fetterman in the same unfavorable category as ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith, who garnered a negative net favorability of -16.9 among Democrats.\n\nBoth men were the only two figures tested with negative net favorability ratings among Democrats, according to the poll.\n\nThe survey's shocking findings, however, may come as a surprise to Fetterman, who has been considered a potential frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic nomination.\n\nHis poor favorability among young voters - a demographic that has increasingly become a cornerstone of the Democratic base - now raises questions regarding the embattled Senator's actual viability as a candidate in the upcoming election cycle.\n\nThe Spring 2025 Yale Youth Poll, which surveyed over 2,000 self-identified registered voters aged 18 to 29, found that Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman (pictured) registered a dismal -17.2 net favorability among young voters\n\nThe blatant disliking of the Pennsylvania senator stood out as a stark contrast to the +60 net favorability enjoyed by other Democratic figures like former Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes\n\nPolitical analysts suggest Fetterman's struggles with young voters may stem from several factors, including his centrist positions and past collaborations with Republicans.\n\nSuch stances may not resonate with the more progressive leanings of the younger electorate, who have demonstrated a preference for candidates with more liberal stances on issues like immigration and social justice.\n\n'It seems like [Fetterman] really does not want to open his mind at all,' Kinnan Abdalhamid, a Palestinian-American student at Haverford College on Philadelphia's mainline told Teen Vogue in June 2024.\n\n'I was very bewildered and aggravated [by his stance],' another student by the name of Mitch, disclosed to the teen-centric publication last year.\n\nMitch, who asked to withhold their last name to protect their privacy, also said: 'He ran this whole stance on being progressive.\n\n'Now it's just really shocking to see how he's completely turned on a dime to betray all of the people who voted for him. I definitely feel like he has betrayed the trust of his constituents.'\n\nThe Yale Youth Poll also highlighted the rising influence of alternative figures within the Democratic party like the Former United States Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg.\n\nMeanwhile, Smith's unexpected appearance in the 2028 presidential polls has since sparked discussions about the party's 'bench strength' and its appeal to younger voters.\n\nSmith himself - a longtime sports television personality - has expressed skepticism about his inclusion in the polls, suggesting that his presence suggests a 'lack of compelling options' in the ailing party.\n\n'They talk and they talk and they talk. But what can they do? They position themselves to do absolutely nothing,' Smith said during an interview with ABC News on Sunday.\n\nThe surprisingly low ranking places Fetterman in the same unfavorable category as ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith (pictured), who garnered a negative net favorability of -16.9 among Democrats\n\nThe poll also highlighted the rising influence of alternative figures within the Democratic party like the Former United States Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg (pictured)\n\n'What is it? What is it going to take to get the job done? That's why somebody who's a sports analyst, for crying out loud, is in the daggone on polls. Yeah, it's not, it's not somebody big upping in me. It's an indictment against a Democratic Party that doesn't have leadership. It doesn't have a vision,' he concluded.\n\nHowever, the telling poll also showed a slight favoritism toward the struggling Democratic party with a +6.4 net favorability among voters aged 22 to 29.\n\nBut, among voters ages 18 to 21, the generic ballot came in at +11.7 net favorable lean in favor of the Republican party.\n\nThe survey also found that if the 2028 Republican primary were held now, 50 percent of Republican voters under the age of 30 would support Vice President JD Vance.\n\nThe Yale Youth Poll was conducted entirely online between April 1 to April 3, pulling from a sample of 4,100 registered voters, of which 2,025 were under the age of 30.\n\nThe survey reported a margin of error of +/- 1.9 percentage points for the full sample of 4,100 respondents and +/- 1.8 percentage points for those under 30.\n\nAnother poll conducted by polling guru Nate Silver earlier this month revealed the most likely Democrat to challenge President Donald Trump's 'MAGA dynasty' as New York Rep. Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nSilver made the bold claim in a video for his Silver Bulletin Substack on Wednesday alongside journalist Galen Druke, who actually brought up AOC as a viable contender first.\n\n'That was going to be my f***ing pick!' Silver exclaimed. 'We both are on the AOC bus.'\n\nPolitical analysts suggest Fetterman's (pictured) struggles with young voters may stem from a myriad of factors, including his centrist positions and past collaborations with Republicans.\n\nPolling guru Nate Silver (left) and journalist Galen Druke (right) both picked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as their dark horse pick to lead the Democratic Party's presidential ticket in 2028 \n\nSilver made the bold claim in a video for his Silver Bulletin Substack on Wednesday alongside journalist Galen Druke, who actually brought up AOC (pictured) as a viable contender first\n\nSilver explained that he picked AOC 'because of some of the polling, because she has this kind of progressive lane, probably not to herself, because she is younger and media savvy.'\n\nHe pointed to polls that showed her leading Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer should she try to challenge him for his New York Senate seat.\n\nSilver said he thought this could mean that she has appeal beyond the progressive left as New York Democrats are actually 'a pretty moderate lot.'\n\n'I think there's a lot of points in her favor at this very moment,' Druke argued. 'In a Yale poll just out late week, AOC has the highest net favorability rating of any of the Democrats that they asked about.'\n\nOcasio-Cortez had a 62 percent positive rating among Democrats in the survey, with former Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, trailing her slightly.\n\nHowever, an earlier poll, conducted back in March, showed the failed presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, as the likely 2028 frontrunner.\n\nIn a political twist few would have predicted in the aftermath of 2024, Harris - was for a short time - leading the early 2028 Democratic primary field by a staggering 26-point margin, according to the Morning Consult poll.\n\nThe Morning Cosult poll also noted the Former United States Secretary of Transportation as the likely second.\n\nPennsylvaniaDemocratsSteve SmithNew York\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nShocking poll reveals the 2028 Democratic hopeful who is the LEAST liked candidate among young voters\n\nAdd comment","summary":"A shocking poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 registered voters aged 18 to 29, found that one aspiring Presidential candidate registered a dismal net favoribility among young voters.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14628335/worst-2028-democratic-candidate-young-voters-poll.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/21/97470787-0-image-a-93_1745095024026.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 21:36:02","author":"Editor,Samantha Rutt","authors":["Editor","Samantha Rutt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":312833718,"title":"Jill Biden aide's brutally honest advice to the former president and first lady","text":"Jill Biden's former aide dished out some brutal honesty to his former boss and her husband as he encouraged them to stick to retirement and leave politics behind. \n\nMichael LaRosa, who worked as Jill's press secretary from 2021 to 2022, believes the Biden camp's team is pulling all the wrong moves since Biden left office on January 20. \n\n'I love both Bidens dearly, but staff loyalty means there is a responsibility to provide them with an honest situational awareness, especially when it comes to their public image, no matter how hurtful it is to hear,' LaRosa told The Hill. \n\n'Biden’s reemergence, while it changed very little in the news cycle, provided a detour for the president to distract his cadre of supporters with Biden taunts and blame, giving Fox News nearly 48 hours of fresh new programming, taking editorial aim at the former president instead of the current one.' \n\nThe former aide accused the Bidens' advisors of not having their 'hand on the pulse of the Democratic Party or national politics' with their timing of the former president's reemergence. \n\n'They would have understood the intense level of anger or indifference to them that remains inside our party and isn’t going away anytime soon,' he told The Hill of what a competent advisor would have noticed. \n\n'It’s a heartbreaking and tragic ending to their time in public life, but it’s also the truth, and they should index the political realities into their decision-making.' \n\nJoe stepped back into the public spotlight on Tuesday for his first post-presidential address to criticize President Donald Trump's dismantling of Social Security.\n\n'Who in the hell do they think they are?' Biden loudly asked.\n\nWhile it was clear he was aiming his ire at Trump and Musk, he refused to say their names during his nearly 30-minute speech.\n\n'Why are these guys taking aim at Social Security now?' the former president asked. 'They're following that old line from tech startups - the quote is \"move fast, break things.\" They're certainly breaking things. They're shooting first and aiming later.'\n\nTrump took the hit personally and went back at his predecessor, whom he called the 'worst president in the history of the United States.' \n\nDespite that Biden did not bring up immigration, Trump hit back: 'Sorry, but it’s my job to get these killers and thugs out of here,' the president added. 'THAT'S WHAT I GOT ELECTED TO DO. MAGA!' \n\nLaRosa also hit out on Jill posting a photo of her in a pasta aisle of a grocery store ahead of Easter. \n\n'Getting ready for Easter...I can't wait to see our kids and grandkids,' Jill wrote on her Instagram Story. \n\n'Ugh. Even in their post-presidency, they're surrounded by staff with primitive instincts for PR or communicating publicly in ways that broaden and enhance their images,' LaRosa wrote on X. \n\n'Whose idea was it to pose for a picture in a grocery store, as if it's somehow novel or unique to the rest of us?' he continued. \n\n'The biggest problem for the Bidens, still, is the staff who keep them disconnected from modern and authentic means of speaking to their supporters and followers.' \n\nOther strategists agreed with LaRosa that Biden peeking his head out now was not the right time as the Democratic party is desperate trying to rebrand to battle Republicans. \n\nA CBS poll showed that Americans have reared their heads back on Trump over his economic policies, shifting the blame from Biden. \n\n'The CBS News poll shows that Americans have directed their anger about the economy away from Biden and redirected it towards Trump,' Brad Bannon told The Hill. \n\n'So it’s a bad time for Biden to reemerge and remind them of the bad old days.' \n\nJoe and Jill have largely kept a low profile since leaving the White House, popping up a Broadway show and a few other places, but it seems the former president is wishing to seek a more visible platform in the last week. \n\nLast month, it was revealed that Democrats had been secretly preparing for Joe to die in office as far back as 2023. \n\nTop party officials, led by former Vice President Kamala Harris' communications director Jamal Simmons, drew up contingency plans for a slew of possibilities leading up to the 2024 election.\n\nOne scenario included that 'Biden might die in office,' according to Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes' upcoming book Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House.\n\n'They wanted to make sure the party was ready for every possible circumstance if Biden launched his campaign and then stepped aside before the primaries; if he had won a bunch of primaries and then could not continue,' the book reads, according to The Guardian. \n\nThe 'hush-hush' meetings focused on what the party rules said would happen in any of these circumstances 'and how [those rules] might need to be changed, if the president no longer had the desire, or the ability to run.'\n\nAmong the plans they drew up was a 'death-pool roster' of judges who could swear Harris into office if the then 81-year-old president passed away, the book claims, citing two unidentified sources.","summary":"Michael LaRosa, who worked as Jill's press secretary from 2021 to 2022, believes the Biden camp's team is pulling all the wrong moves since Biden left office on January 20.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14628369/michael-larosa-advice-joe-jill-biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/21/97470029-0-image-m-103_1745095404830.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 20:53:15","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":312840042,"title":"Far-Right Activist Who Vowed “Retribution” Lands Role at the FCC","text":"For the past six years, Gavin Wax has held court as the president of the New York Young Republican Club, a group he helped turn from a small, stodgy establishment outfit into “a vanguard of the Trump movement,” as he said last year. Under his leadership, the club has moved far to the right. It’s hosted events attended by white nationalists, budding foreign authoritarians, and of course, George Santos, whose congressional campaign it endorsed before he became a convicted felon.\n\nWax announced this month that he was stepping down as the club’s president, and on Friday he revealed that he would be taking a post in the Trump administration as chief of staff and advisor to Federal Communications Commissioner Nathan Simington. The 31-year-old former day trader has long been a die-hard Trump loyalist.\n\n“Once President Trump is back in office,” Wax said at the 2023 NYYRC annual dinner, according to Politico, “we won’t be playing nice anymore. It will be a time for retribution. All those responsible for destroying our once-great country will be held to account after baseless years of investigations and government lies and media lies against this man.”\n\nLike Trump, Wax was once a staunch opponent of media censorship and “Big Tech,” and had called for an end to legal protections for social media companies. An online libertarian magazine Wax founded, Liberty Conservative, once devoted quite a bit of ink to trolling Trump’s new benefactor, Elon Musk. (“Elon Musk: The Corporate Arm Of The Deep-State,” was one such 2017 article.)\n\nMuch of that rhetoric seems to have vanished since Musk bought Twitter and most of the tech world has gotten on board in support of Trump. Now, Wax’s focus at the FCC, like Trump’s, appears to be mainstream media outlets. In an email, he told me, “The issues of censorship, content moderation, and platform accountability remain important—not just in the context of individual CEOs, but as broader questions of public policy and civil liberties. We’re also focused on ensuring that licensed broadcasters are truly serving the public interest, as required by law. That includes holding legacy media to account just as much as newer tech platforms, and ensuring that all players in the communications space operate on a level playing field.”\n\nIn 2023, Mother Jones identified Wax as one of a number of MAGA influencers who’d been defending the exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui with op-eds suggested by Guo’s supporters. Guo was convicted of racketeering and fraud last year. Wax had once been the marketing director for Gettr, a social media site allegedly controlled by Guo. But Wax told me that an important part of the FCC’s work now is “defending against foreign influence in our information ecosystem.”\n\nWax’s ascension to the FCC was met with cheers in MAGA world from everyone from Steve Bannon to Kari Lake. \n\nThank you Kari! https://t.co/JXWES8zUR6— Gavin Mario Wax 🇺🇸 🗽 (@GavinWax) April 19, 2025\n\nHe seems a natural fit for the FCC under its Trump-aligned chairman Brendan Carr. Carr has touted his own MAGA credentials and has taken up Trump’s call for the agency to investigate NPR and PBS over their sponsorship practices, and ABC and NBC over DEI efforts. The FCC also recently reinstated a complaint against CBS over an interview with Kamala Harris during the presidential campaign that Trump has alleged was deceptively edited to influence the election. Trump is suing the network for $20 billion over the interview. Trump’s FCC also revived complaints against NBC for allowing Harris to appear on Saturday Night Live during the campaign.\n\nLast month, several congressional Democrats launched a probe of what they called the FCC’s “sham” investigations designed “to target and intimidate news organizations” that were unpopular with Trump and Musk.\n\nEven at this FCC, however, Wax is likely to be a controversial hire. His ties to the more extreme fringes of the far-right are unusual credentials for a government job, though less so in this administration. For instance, in 2018, Wax penned a column in the American Thinker headlined, “We are all Proud Boys now,” in which he decried “Antifa” and “leftist terrorist” attacks on conservatives like himself.\n\n“Out-of-context quotes from Gavin McInnes are being used to paint him as a right-wing militant leader when he in all actuality he just runs a patriotic fraternal group who like America and beer,” he wrote, defending the founder of the far-right militia group whose members later helped orchestrate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.","summary":"For the past six years, Gavin Wax has held court as the president of the New York Young Republican Club, a group he helped turn from a small, stodgy establishment outfit into “a vanguard of the Trump movement,&#8221; as he said last year.

That’s why we have seen such an increase in the importance of short-form video.”\n\nFans of podcasts gravitate towards the medium in part because of their perceived authenticity.\n\nUnlike traditional media, hosts are not expected to be objective and guests are allowed to talk more casually and at greater length.\n\nMs Grantham said the format favoured politicians who were able to present themselves as “the guy or girl you can have a drink with”.\n\n“That only works for some personalities,” she said.\n\nPodcasts with politicians have been criticised — at times unfairly — for being lightweight.\n\nNot every podcast favours a softball approach to politicians, although Ms Grantham said the need to “keep people entertained” lent itself to a more light-hearted approach.\n\nNor is a perceived light touch necessarily an obstacle to political journalism.\n\nHowever, if podcasts focused more on personality than politics are allowed to replace more in-depth media scrutiny, society may have a problem, according to Cardiff University media and culture PhD candidate Maxwell Modell.\n\n“Traditional candidate interviews are meant to be combat zones, where journalists and politicians spar over key issues,” he wrote for The Conversation website.\n\n“They are democracy in action — and should be serious and focused on policy, political record and suitability for office — everything these podcasts are not.\n\n“There is value in getting to know politicians better as everyday people outside of politics. But this can become a problem when podcasts flood the media landscape or fully replace meaningful media scrutiny.”","summary":"‘I can’t believe you took the time to come on my silly podcast.’ That was how Abbie Chatfield, the host of It’s a Lot started her recent interview with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/federal-election-2025/federal-election-2025-tune-in-to-australias-first-podcast-election-c-18250712","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18250712/6b023a6cb7bf22ed7f25db20097db6075cf81740-16x9-x0y25w2990h1682.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 18:00:00","author":"Kate Emery","authors":["Kate Emery"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.166},{"id":312805476,"title":"Kamala Harris under fire as secret payments to millionaire celebrities come to light, including one who said she got nothing","text":"The recently released campaign finance reports of former vice president Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign are triggering concerns about payments made to firms connected with high-profile celebrities who openly endorsed her, including some who claim that were not paid for endorsing, as per a report.Some of the most striking disclosures include a $50,000 payment to NBA superstar LeBron James' production firm, SpringHill Entertainment, according to Daily Mail. The payment was made on January 28, 2025, just days after US president Donald Trump was sworn in as president following his election victory, and the paymemnt was only revealed months later, as per the report. James, who never actively campaigned for Harris, shared a post to his more than 200 million followers on X and Instagram supporting Harris' candidacy, he posted a video suggesting that Trump was racist against black people and even made an advertisement called Hate Takes Us Back , as per Daily mail.

Meanwhile, New York ranked in last place in the “Economic Outlook Ranking.”\n\nNew York is notably one of the states with the highest income taxes, which ranges from 4% to 10.9%, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank. Meanwhile, Utah has a flat 4.55% individual income tax rate.\n\nNotably, several of the states that notched high marks on ALEC’s economic scorecard voted for President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election by large margins. Trump swept Utah in the November presidential election, securing 59.4% of the vote to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 37.8%.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris won New York in the 2024 presidential election, notching 56.3% of the vote to Trump’s 43.7%.\n\nMoreover, the report found that states that spend less—especially on income transfer programs—as well as states that tax less—particularly on activities such as working or investing—generally experience higher growth rates than states that tax and spend more.\n\n“This ranking reflects what happens when we trust Utahns to lead, solve problems, and shape their own future,” Republican Utah Gov.

Cillizza, on his YouTube channel, said Harris should run for governor rather than president, citing two new Democratic presidential polls in which she leads the field, but not in a commanding fashion.\n\n“Kamala Harris absolutely should not—should not—run for president in 2028 … Any poll that’s done right now … is going to show Kamala Harris in first place,” Cillizza said. “Okay? And the reason for that is not because lots and lots and lots of people want Kamala Harris to be president again—Democrats, that is—but because they know her name more than they know the names of anybody else.”\n\n“But there’s been two polls out in the last four days that I think should be a bright siren, a red flashing warning for Kamala Harris as she looks at what she wants to run for next—and the presidency,” he continued.\n\nCillizza first referenced a Wednesday Zeteo/Data for Progress poll that found Harris leading with 18% support in a hypothetical Democratic presidential primary among likely Democratic primary voters. Former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg had 14% support while Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker each had 12%.\n\nHe then referenced the Spring 2025 Yale Youth Poll, which found Harris leading the field with 27.5% support among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. Ocasio-Cortez had 21.3% support, while Buttigieg had 14% and other Democrats failed to obtain over 5% support.\n\n“Alright, what conclusion should you draw from that? You should draw the conclusion that despite the fact that Kamala Harris is totally known by Democrats in this country, somewhere between 1/5 and less than a third of Democrats say, ‘Yes, I would vote for her.’ So 28% in the Yale polling, 18% in the Zeteo/Data for Progress polling,” Cillizza said. “That is not a good sign. Right?”\n\nThe NewsNation political contributor asserted that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was polling at around 60% in 2013 and completely dominating the field of potential Democratic presidential candidates.\n\n“Kamala Harris is at 28% and 18%. Now, I’ve seen her as high as sort of the mid-30s in some of this very early 2028 polling,” he said. “But if I’m her campaign or people advising her, I look at that and I say: ‘You’re totally known. Right? So you’re much better known than any of these other people. You’re better known than Pete Buttigieg, you’re better known than AOC, you’re better known than Cory Booker, and yet you’re basically running even or close to even with these people.’ That does not bode well.”\n\nCillizza argued that since Harris is already well-known, she is unlikely to persuade voters to support her. He said other candidates who are less known will have the opportunity to sway more voters.\n\n“So if I’m Harris’ campaign, I look at this early, early polling and I say, ‘This is not telling me I can’t win, but it is suggesting that at least right now, there is not a clamor within the Democratic Party for me,’” he said.\n\nTherefore, Cillizza said Harris should seek the California governorship in 2026, arguing she would be much more likely to win that race.\n\nOriginally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation.","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—NewsNation political contributor Chris Cillizza said Thursday that former Vice President Kamala Harris definitely should avoid making a 2028 presidential run based...

Many are now grappling with the consequences of their choice as it affects them and their loved ones—and possibly regretting their vote.\n\nWe all know the meme:\n\nThe leopards have been feasting. Today we’re checking in on two big Trump-loving constituencies: truckers and soy farmers. \n\nTruckers love Donald Trump. Per FEC donation data, truck drivers are nearly three-quarters Republican, making it one of the reddest professions. You can imagine why. This group is mostly rural, mostly white and male, and tied to a job that lives and dies by the cost of fossil fuels, particularly diesel—which can account for up to 40% of costs. They also hated environmental mandates to electrify their fleets. \n\nIn 2014, truck driver was the most common job title in most American states—and a significant one in pretty much all of them. I wasn’t able to find more recent statistics, but demand for shipping has only intensified in the e-commerce age. Truck driving is one of the last professions that provides a path to financial security without a college degree. \n\nAnd Trump is single-handedly breaking that path. \n\nPer Econ 101, as demand for products craters in the face of Trump’s chaotic tariffs and the supply of truckers remains the same, what does that mean for prices? Exactly. \n\nIt is also not surprising that Mack Trucks is laying off about 20% of its workforce in response to the economic havoc Trump’s tariffs are generating. And if you follow that link, you’ll see plenty more terrible news for the trucking industry. \n\n“I think they’re all smart enough to know that if you go all in on tariffs, there’s the potential for counter tariffs and inflation as a result,” said the Trump-supporting Chris Spear, who heads the American Trucking Association. “So I don’t think they want to do anything that’s going to have an adverse impact on the economy,” Spear said back in December.\n\nHa ha! Imagine thinking Trump and his team of degenerate sycophants are “smart.” Now, the full horror of Trump’s tariffs is dawning on the guy.\n\n“The 100,000 full-time hardworking truckers hauling 85% of the surface trade in goods with Mexico and 67% of the goods traded with Canada will bear a direct and disproportionate impact,” Spear whined.\n\nCanadian truckers will suffer as well, of course. But don’t worry—they’re also assholes. \n\nRelated | West Virginians love Trump—and he's screwing them anyway\n\nNow let’s check out the soy industry. \n\nDuring the first Trump administration, his tariffs on China cost American soybean growers billions, all to Brazil’s delight. The economic damage was so severe that Trump had to bail out farmers to the tune of $28 billion. So what did these farmers do?\n\nVote for Trump again, of course! \n\nTrump has now killed what was left of the Chinese market, dramatically increased the cost of fertilizer thanks to his idiotic trade war with Canada, and turned the world against American goods. And these idiot soy farmers are relegated to penning columns like this one: “I’m a Soybean Farmer Who Voted for Trump. I’m Begging the President to End the Trade War.” \n\n“Like many of my fellow farmers, I voted for President Donald Trump in the past three elections,” wrote Kentuckian Caleb Ragland. “The president won me over with his commitment to business-friendly tax cuts as well as his track record of reducing regulation and cutting government spending.”\n\nYou see, Farmer Caleb was voting to kill other people’s jobs, not his own! \n\n“I am one of the 500,000 soybean farmers in America who feels the pain,” he wrote. “I rely on my own farm for 100 percent of the income for my family and the families of our three full-time workers. We have 1,500 acres of soybeans on my farm. At $600 an acre, our production costs are $900,000. But in the current climate, an acre brings in only $500 of revenue, which means we’re yielding $750,000—a $150,000 loss.”\n\nYup, sure sucks. But don’t worry—he blames Biden. Really.\n\n“Back in 2018, President Trump negotiated a trade deal with China that would have been very good for our farmers. We had one problem, though, that derailed its effectiveness: Joe Biden.”\n\nBailouts needed in 2018: Trump made a good deal! \n\nNo bailouts needed between 2021 and 2024: Boo, Joe Biden is bad!\n\nFarm going bankrupt in 2025: Begging Trump to change course but still, the president is operating “in good faith.” \n\nDon’t weep for the guy. He is literally reaping what he sowed. \n\nAnd unfortunately, that kind of wilful ignorance appears to be incurable. Take three-time Trump voter and Ohio soybean farmer Josh Yoder. \n\n“The world is trying to figure out if Trump is playing chess or checkers,” he said. “If it’s the former, it would be a cool, long-term benefit. If it’s the latter, we’re going down a path we’ve never gone down in my lifetime.”\n\nThe world isn’t trying to figure it out. \n\nThe world knows.\n\nBut Josh and his fellow MAGA drones refuse to acknowledge the reality, despite all the evidence staring them in the face. \n\n“The worst thing our farmers run into is that we can’t plan for anything,” said Texan grain manager Andy Riffe. Planning is a thing they could’ve done—had they voted for Kamala Harris. \n\nAt least trans kids are being bullied and innocent people are being sent to a Salvadoran gulag, which is what Trumpers were really voting for anyway.","summary":"This is an occasional roundup of people who voted for Donald Trump and are shocked to find out no one is immune from the damage and pain he causes.

Next would be Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, at 8% support and Republican Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco was third with 4%, as per the report. The survey included 18 hypothetical candidates for the June 2026 primary, reported KTLA5.Kamala Harris’ Decision Could Reshape the RaceDirector of Emerson College Polling, Spencer Kimball said, “How competitive the 2026 gubernatorial primary in California is depends on whether Harris runs. Other candidacies, like Katie Porter’s, are contingent on whether the former vice president enters the race,” as quoted in the report. Kimball mentioned that, “Harris garners 49% of Democrats, while Porter gets 13%. Without Harris in the race, Porter’s support among Democrats rises to 21%, which would make her an early frontrunner in a crowded field,” quoted KTLA5.Voters Are Split on Whether Harris Should RunHowever, voters have a divided opinion on whether Harris should run for this position. Voters are tied 50-50 on whether they really want her to. Other Topics on Voters’ MindsThe Emerson College/Inside California Politics survey didn't only examine Kamala Harris' prospects for the 2026 governor's race, it also took a peek at what Californians think about a couple of other topics, including the political future of Gavin Newsom, US president Donald Trump's trade policy, and even the upcoming Los Angeles 2028 Olympics, reported KTLA5.According to the report, the majority of the respondents do not want Newsom to run for president in 2028, with 59% voting against him but 41% think he should. With respect to party affiliation, 61% of registered Democrats voted that Newsom should run, while 78% of Republicans and 75% of independents voted he should not, as per KTLA5.When California voters were asked about the president’s tariffs, most consider it as more of a tax on the consumer than a tax on trade partners, 60% to 22%, and 18% view it as neither as per the report. However, Kimball also shared that, “A majority of Democrats, 77%, and half of independent voters see tariffs as more of a tax on the consumer, while 48% of Republican voters see them as more of a tax on the foreign country,” as quoted by KTLA5.When the participants were asked about the 2028 L.A. Summer Games, 32% said they are very interested in the games, 44% are somewhat interested , and 24% are not interested at all , reported KLTA5.According to the KLTA5 report, a majority of California voters, 58%, would want to see the Olympic Games in person if they could afford it, while 42% would not.FAQsHow much support does Harris have among voters right now?According to the poll, 31% of voters say they’d vote for her in the 2026 primary.

The Logan Act – named for former Pennsylvania Sen. George Logan – stipulates a fine and/or imprisonment for Americans corresponding with foreign officials \"with intent to influence the[ir] measures … in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States.\" Logan met with French diplomat Charles de Talleyrand after Paris rebuffed President John Adams, and he attempted to entreat him – in part via a letter from Vice President Thomas Jefferson – to end the Franco-American hostilities of the so-called \"Quasi War.\" In that way, several prominent conservatives questioned whether Van Hollen’s actions similarly violated the law.

AAF’s Thomas Jones said Garcia \"is essentially an enemy combatant in the ongoing invasion … by transnational gangs.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Lankford for comment. The act was last invoked by Trump critics after a book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward claimed the mogul held several calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin between his terms in the White House. Trump was lambasted by the \"Never-Trump\" Lincoln Project and Kamala Harris over Woodward’s book’s claims.

'Way to go, way to stand up to the bully.'\n\nThose remarks earned a strong rebuke from venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, who bought a 10 percent stake in the team in 2010 before ultimately selling off his ownership last year. \n\n'Normally, when an executive at a company where I own equity speaks on topics beyond their knowledge and reveals themselves to be an idiot I usually just fire them or sell my equity,' he wrote on X.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr infuriated Donald Trump supporters by publicly supporting Harvard\n\nTrump has launched a widely condemned crackdown against top American universities\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, a former stakeholder in the Warriors, called Kerr a 'hapless rube'\n\n'Fortunately, I already sold all my equity in the Warriors last year at the-then all time high so this isn't my problem but the total ignorance of his comments still stands.'\n\nPalihapitiya accused Kerr of 'blindly defending' Harvard, which he called 'a Corporation with a $53B balance sheet masquerading as a non profit' and said the school had 'the absolute worst scores for freedom of speech amongst ALL colleges in America.'\n\nThe Sri-Lankan born investor also said Harvard had been 'admonished' by the Supreme Court for discrimination in their admissions process, and accused the school of allowing antisemitism to 'fester unchecked on campus.' \n\nPalihapitiya also blasted Kerr's basketball acumen, saying owner Joe Lacob, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson deserve all of the credit for the team's four titles under Kerr.\n\n'my 4 [year old] could have won as many championships with the talent Joe assembled,' Palihapitiya said.\n\nHarvard came under immense scrutiny over campus antisemitism in response to Israel's war against Hamas, forcing then-President Claudine Gay to resign amid mounting pressure from forces outside the university. \n\nThe Trump administration has been campaigning to eradicate antisemitism from college campuses, and got Columbia University to agree to several policy changes with the school fearing it could lose $400million in funding.\n\nHowever, Harvard President Alan Garber rejected the White House's demands with a blistering letter and Kerr used his post-game availability following his team's play-in tournament win over the Grizzlies to speak out against the Trump administration.\n\nKerr has been routinely outspoken on progressive issues and endorsed Kamala Harris\n\nTrump has also called Harvard a 'joke' and said it should lose government research contracts\n\n'I believe in academic freedom,' he said. 'I believe it's crucial for all of our institutions to be able to handle their own business the way they want to, and they should not be shaken down and told what to teach, what to say, by our government. \n\nSteve Kerr attracts fury with Harvard protest amid Trump's feud with college\n\n'That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, but it's kind of par for the course right now. This is me supporting Harvard.'\n\nKerr noted that the shirt was sent to him by his friend, Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker.\n\nKerr is the son of late professor and political scientist Malcolm Kerr, and he has frequently been outspoken on progressive issues.\n\nIn addition to the federal funding freeze on Harvard, the Department of Homeland Security also canceled $2.7million worth of research grants to the school and threatened the university's ability to enroll international students unless it turns over records on visa-holders' 'illegal and violent activities.'\n\nThe Warriors face the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs on Sunday.\n\nDonald TrumpGolden State Warriors\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nEx-Warriors owner attacks Steve Kerr after legendary NBA coach called Donald Trump a 'bully'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Steve Kerr has been called a 'hapless rube' and an 'idiot' by a former minority shareholder of the Warriors after the Golden State head coach labeled President Donald Trump a 'bully.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-14627805/warriors-owner-steve-kerr-donald-trump-attack.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/14/97460121-0-image-m-12_1745068016715.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 13:14:36","author":"Editor,Jake Nisse","authors":["Editor","Jake Nisse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":312745818,"title":"Dana Carvey thought his ‘SNL’ Joe Biden impersonation was finished after disastrous debate","text":"Dana Carvey knew his stint on “Saturday Night Live” would be cut short thanks to former President Joe Biden. \n\nThe “Wayne’s World” actor was slated to spend six weeks in New York City to impersonate Biden at the request of the show’s head honcho, Lorne Michaels.\n\n“Lorne is very persuasive,” he tells Page Six in an exclusive interview before imitating Michaels, “‘It’ll be Autumn in New York … and then afterwards you can tell us to f–k off.’ It was like, ‘OK, six weeks in New York.'”\n\nHowever, the 69-year-old actor thought his return to “SNL” was over after Biden’s disastrous June 27th Presidential debate against now-President Trump, which precipitated him dropping out of the presidential race. Weeks later, former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped up as the Democratic candidate.\n\n“When that first debate was sort of going awry with President Biden, I turned to my wife and I said, ‘We’re not going to New York,’ during the debate,” he recalls. “That’s absolutely true.”\n\nAnd Carvey’s premonition came true … to a point.\n\nThe “Masters of Disguise” actor got to appear in 10 episodes alongside Maya Rudolph, who was impersonating Harris, and Jim Gaffigan, who took on the role of Governor of Minnesota and Vice President-hopeful, Tim Walz. \n\nHis Biden impersonation included a familiar scratching of the face, an affectation that Carvey calls his “favorite,” and little mannerisms that included picking up “toys on the carpet.”\n\nCarvey — who stresses that he likes the peope he imitates — tells us that he approached his impersonation carefully, likening it to “threading” a needle to “make it funny but not make it in any way sad or cruel.”\n\n“I’m not trying to really make political points or put them down,” he explains. “I’m trying to find what is fun about them.”\n\nThroughout his stint on “SNL” from 1986 to 1993, Carvey got to impersonate another president: George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe comedian tells us that Bush, who died in 2018, loved his impersonation so much that he invited Carvey to the White House after he lost the 1992 Presidential election.\n\n“He calls me out of the blue in December to come to Washington, DC,” Carvey recalls.\n\n“And in that moment, I’m a young man. I just said, ‘Well, where would I stay?’ I was already thinking about what hotel or something,” he continued. “He paused, thought I was negotiating. ‘Well, stay right here in the White House with (former First Lady Barbara Bush) and I.”\n\nCarvey hasn’t left “SNL” completely in the past as he currently co-hosts a podcast with his former co-star David Spade, where they share showbiz stories and parse the entertainment headlines.","summary":"Carvey was set to return to \"SNL\" after his original stint from 1986 to 1993.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/04/19/entertainment/dana-carvey-thought-his-snl-joe-biden-impersonation-was-finished-after-disastrous-debate/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dana-carvey-joe-biden.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/q2JjiRve-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-19 13:00:00","author":"Nicki Gostin","authors":["Nicki Gostin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.07},{"id":312761000,"title":"McCarthy Predicts Democrat Civil War with AOC, Bernie Against Biden, Harris, Pelosi, Schumer, Jeffries","text":"Friday on FNC’s “Jesse Watters Primetime,” former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he saw Rep.

For U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, who represents Colorado’s newest congressional district north of Denver, and Rep. Jeff Hurd, the congressman for a sprawling 27-county Western Slope-anchored district, the president’s aggressive tariff and immigration policies have put pressure on sectors of the economy — agriculture, ranching and manufacturing — that play outsized roles in their districts.\n\nIn March, both legislators were put “on notice” by Emily’s List as “top targets for defeat in the 2026 midterm elections.” The political advocacy group supports Democratic women candidates who favor abortion rights in their bids for office across the country.\n\nThe hazards for Evans, a freshman representative from Fort Lupton, are greater than for Hurd because his 8th Congressional District was created four years ago to be Colorado’s most politically competitive — a promise it’s lived up to in two election cycles.\n\n“Hurd has a bit more wiggle room than Evans does,” said Colorado State University political science professor Kyle Saunders, who has been closely watching both districts.\n\nEvans, who narrowly beat incumbent Rep. Yadira Caraveo in the November election, was the only Republican House member in Colorado to make this month’s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s list of “districts in play.” That means his eventual Democratic opponent will be getting a targeted splash of national money in next year’s election.\n\n“There is a long way to go yet,” Saunders said, “but Evans will have to be very careful with how he plays his cards over the next year-plus — both in how closely he stands with Trump as well as with any votes that can be used against him in the 2026 campaign.”\n\nWhile both congressmen have largely toed Trump’s line at the start of the Republican’s second administration, there are signs they are willing to push back — albeit cautiously.\n\nIn early March, they were among 21 Republicans who signed a letter to Rep. Jason Smith, the GOP chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. They urged their party to keep clean energy tax credits from the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act climate law that fund development of “traditional and renewable energy sources alike.”\n\nThe appeal came in the face of efforts by Trump to make it easier for companies to produce oil and gas and to empower public officials to halt already approved clean-energy projects.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurd this month took a public swipe at the president by introducing a bipartisan bill that would require that unilateral tariffs proposed by the executive branch undergo congressional review, and be limited in duration.\n\n“I think it’s pretty clear under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution that Congress has authority with respect to tariffs,” Hurd, a Grand Junction attorney, told The Denver Post in an interview. “I thought it was an important thing for me to be part of the legislation that would reassert Congress’ authority.”\n\nFormer Colorado Republican Party chair Dick Wadhams said both Hurd and Evans “have done really well” in their first 100 days pledging fealty to Trump’s agenda. They’ve done so without attaching themselves too closely to some of its harder edges, he said — like supporting false claims of a stolen 2020 election.\n\n“Gabe is first and foremost a congressman for the 8th District,” Wadhams said. “And I think Jeff Hurd is in the tradition of what 3rd District voters are looking for. They’ve set themselves up as strong incumbents.”\n\n“Tying them to Trump”\n\nBut the 2026 election is still more than 18 months away. A lot can happen between now and then, Saunders said.\n\nTrump’s polling numbers have fallen since he took office on Jan. 20, according to a CBS News-YouGov survey taken a week ago. His approval rating has flipped from 53% in favor of his overall performance in February to 53% disapproval now.\n\nSimilar declines were recorded in the poll on Trump’s handling of the economy.\n\n“What we can say is that President Trump’s honeymoon is very likely over,” Saunders said. “Does that mean that his favorability will decline further from here? What we do know is that economic uncertainty, rising prices and other fundamentals do not usually help the sitting president — we saw that as recently as President Biden’s struggles with inflation in 2023 and 2024.”\n\nThe danger of an unpopular president is that unaffiliated voters may break towards Democrats next year, Saunders said. In Evans’ case, his prospects are complicated by the fact that the 8th District, which covers portions of Weld, Adams and Larimer counties, has an 8,000-voter registration advantage for Democrats, he said.\n\n“In a district where Evans only won by approximately 2,400 votes, those factors alone could easily turn the tide the other way,” Saunders said.\n\nHal Bidlack, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who unsuccessfully ran in Colorado’s 5th Congressional District nearly 20 years ago, advises the Democrats running in the 3rd and 8th districts in 2026 to burden their opponents with Trump — and the task of trying to explain Trump. He also taught political science at the Air Force Academy for nearly 20 years.\n\n“I would have the attitude of tying them to Trump as tightly as I can,” the Democrat said. “I would make them defend Trump and Trumpism completely.”\n\nHurd, who beat Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by 5 percentage points last year, hasn’t drawn a Democratic challenger yet. But Evans has two of note already.\n\nCaraveo, who on Tuesday announced a bid to retake the seat she lost nearly six months ago, told The Post that Evans is “falling in line completely with Donald Trump and Elon Musk.”\n\n“He’s not really taking into account that this is a very middle-of-the-road district that doesn’t fit into the right MAGA extremism that he’s voting for, and I haven’t seen him veer at all from the path that Donald Trump wants him to be on,” she said in an interview.\n\nHer Democratic primary opponent, state Rep. Manny Rutinel, voiced a similar criticism of Evans. He announced his candidacy less than a month after Evans took office Jan. 3.\n\n“Even though Congressman Evans was elected to represent the people of CD-8, his only focus has been representing the interests of the ultrawealthy and defending President Trump’s disastrous policies against working people,” Rutinel wrote in an email to The Post.\n\nEvans, a U.S. Army veteran and former Arvada cop, dismisses the criticism.\n\n“I’ve done over 40 in-person meetings, roundtables, town halls — things of that nature,” he said. “My staff has done over 300 other meetings, and so we’re 100% committed to being out, active and engaged in the district.”\n\nWhile Evans strongly backs the administration’s efforts to secure the border and deport criminals and gang members who are in the country illegally, he often tells the story of his grandfather, who immigrated to the United States from Mexico “the right way.”\n\nThe 8th District is Colorado’s most heavily Latino district.\n\n“We have to recognize their key contributions,” he said of immigrants, “and we have to make sure that we are moving the ball forward to get some sort of meaningful immigration reform — so that the people who are trying to do it the right way and are bringing so many positive contributions to our communities don’t get left behind.”\n\nTariffs and farming\n\nIn the meantime, the political winds have already started blowing ahead of 2026.\n\nEarlier this week, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, met with about 30 northern Colorado manufacturers in Loveland — right on the doorstep of Evans’ district. The discussion focused on the “devastating impacts of Trump’s tariff taxes on the industry and economy,” according to a news release from the governor’s office.\n\nBut manufacturers are hardly the only sector impacted by tariffs. Trade duties are especially challenging for farmers and ranchers in Colorado. They need to remain competitive on price to sell their products overseas and need the costs of imported equipment and parts to remain reasonable.\n\nChad Franke, the president of the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, said many farmers in Colorado desire a more level playing field in global trade but would rather not incur financial damage trying to get there.\n\n“The broad-ranging tariffs are going to be harmful to family farmers and ranchers because of reciprocal tariffs, which will be levied (by foreign countries) against commodities,” he said. “We’re hopeful they can put pressure on Washington, D.C., to lessen the impact of broad tariffs on the ag economy.”\n\nHurd’s bill calling for congressional review of tariffs could be an effective check on their impacts, Franke said.\n\nBut any effects from Trump’s trade policies on Colorado farmers, Franke said, won’t come into view until closer to harvest season — “If there is going to be a problem, we’ll hear about it through the summer and into the fall” — when it’s that much closer to the November 2026 election.\n\nEvans acknowledges that tariffs aren’t popular among producers in his district. But he says farmers and ranchers are also tired of being taken advantage of by other countries.\n\n“Nobody loves the chaos, but they’re actually pretty excited about the potential for the playing field to be level,” he said.\n\nEvans, who as a state lawmaker represented some of the same area north of Denver that’s now in his congressional district, said farmers tell him they want nothing more than to crack markets like Spain, Italy, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\n“They’ve had willing buyers. We’ve had willing producers here, but they couldn’t get through with the lack of trade deals in the last five years,” he said. “And so I think what we’re seeing with this administration is (that) through tariffs, they’re using that as a mechanism to get those trade deals done.”\n\nHurd sees tariffs as a “tool in the toolbox” to creating a fairer global trading system. But they must be administered judiciously, with an eye toward limiting their “breadth and scope.”\n\n“I do believe that tariffs can have a strategic role when it comes to approaching these issues, but I just think we need to be thoughtful in how we approach it,” Hurd said. He added that “broad-based tariffs cause me more concern than tariffs that are targeted towards a specific end.\n\nDespite his support for Trump’s goals of bringing manufacturing back to the United States, Hurd said it can’t be done at the expense of Congress’ power. Thus, the bill he introduced earlier this month.\n\n“We just need to make sure that we do that the right way and that we comport with the requirements under the Constitution,” he said.\n\nTrump’s checkered Colorado history\n\nBidlack, the retired lieutenant colonel and political scientist, lauded Hurd for signing on to the bill despite its dim prospects for passage in a Republican-majority Congress with deep allegiances to Trump.\n\n“It is remarkable to me that a freshman Republican would thumb his nose at Trump so dramatically in what is a doomed effort,” Bidlack said of Hurd, who has never publicly revealed whether he has voted for the president. “But it’s smart to distance himself from Trump.”\n\nThat’s especially true in Colorado, where Trump was beaten by Hillary Clinton in 2016, Joe Biden four years ago and Kamala Harris last year, Wadhams said.\n\nHurd has taken a principled stand guarding the separation of powers at the top of American government, Wadhams said — a position that should help him in a district that nearly ousted Republican Lauren Boebert in 2022 over concerns about her behavior and gravitas.\n\n“He’s a truly constitutional conservative,” Wadhams said.\n\nDespite the strong Republican lean of the 3rd Congressional District, which hugs the borders of Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico and swoops from Rangely to Pueblo, it was less than 20 years ago that Democrat U.S. Rep. John Salazar held the seat. If public opinion goes into a tailspin under the second Trump administration and Democrats find the right contender next year, Wadhams said, the district has a chance of going blue again.\n\n“A Trump presidency is a surprise every day,” he said.\n\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter.","summary":"Freshmen congressmen face question of how much to embrace president as Dems target them in 2026.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/19/colorado-gabe-evans-jeff-hurd-donald-trump-tariffs-election-2026/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TDP-Z-GettyImages-2184216746.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 12:00:55","author":"John Aguilar","authors":["John Aguilar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.256},{"id":312713984,"title":"Michelle Obama flashes her wedding ring after shutting down Barack divorce rumors once and for all","text":"Michelle Obama continues to silence the haters. \n\nThe former first lady, 61, flashed her wedding ring while out and about in Los Angeles Thursday after shutting down rumors that she and husband Barack Obama are headed for divorce.\n\nMichelle sent a clear message to skeptics while rocking her diamond bands during a visit to The Academy headquarters with her brother and podcast co-host, Craig Robinson.\n\nThe mother of two added some other chunky jewelry, including knot earrings, to her olive green ensemble.\n\nMichelle looked stylish in a cardigan and matching sweater, baggy cargo pants, brown sling-back kitten heels and a $3,700 Bottega Veneta “Arco Intrecciato” Leather Tote Bag.\n\nShe wore her braided hair back in a long, low ponytail. \n\nAlthough Barack did not join the outing, the siblings seemed to be in great spirits as they walked and talked with staffers. \n\nThe Obamas, who wed in 1992, have not been spotted together since December 2024 following a tiring months-long campaign to support Kamala Harris’ run for presidency. \n\nMichelle decided to take a step back from the spotlight after Donald Trump won the ticket, leading to unfounded speculation that there was trouble in paradise. \n\nThe chatter first picked up steam after the 44th US President attended Trump’s inauguration without Michelle.\n\nAlthough the couple posted about each other on social media, the rumor mill continued to swirl after the “Becoming” author continued to skip public-facing events. \n\nMichelle spent nearly three months out of the spotlight before making her first public appearance of 2025 on the “Jennifer Hudson Show” in March. \n\nMichelle and Robinson, 62, launched their podcast that same month and the former attorney has shared insight into her relationship with Barack in several episodes since. \n\nShe also directly addressed speculation that she and the politician, 63, were on the rocks during an episode of Sophia Bush’s “Work in Progress” podcast last week. \n\nMichelle explained that she stopped going to political events because it no longer served her — not because there was any tension between her and her husband. \n\n“The interesting thing is that when I say ‘no,’ for the most part, people are like, ‘I get it,’ and I’m OK,” she explained of her choice to take a step back. \n\n“And that’s the thing that we as women struggle with — disappointing people,” she continued. “So much so that people, they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”\n\nMichelle laughed about the notion that there was anything wrong with their marriage, adding that it’s hard for people to comprehend “a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself.”\n\n“But that’s what society does to us,” she said. “We actually finally start going, ‘What am I doing? Who am I doing this for?’ And if it doesn’t fit into the sort of stereotype of what people think we should do, then it gets labeled as something negative and horrible.”\n\nAfter spending so many years appeasing others and doing her job as first lady, she noted that it was “time to make some big girl decisions” in her life and “own it fully.”\n\n“If not now, when? What am I waiting for?” she asked. “Now is the time for me to start asking myself these hard questions of, ‘Who do I truly want to be every day?’ And that changes.”\n\nShe added, “So, who do I want to have a lunch with? How long do I want to stay in a place? Do I want to travel? If a girlfriend calls and says, ‘Let’s go here,’ I can say ‘Yes!’ I can.

Al Green’s outburst and exit from the chamber. But give the man credit for speaking truth to power: Trump received no mandate.\n\nThe presidential election of 2024 was one of the closest in recent history. More than half the country voted for someone other than Trump, and if just 115,000 votes in three states (out of 155.2 million cast nationally) had gone the other way, Kamala Harris would be president, and we would still be enjoying the global stability and robust economy that the Biden/Harris administration left us.\n\nThe extremely close margins in the House and Senate also fail to support any claims of a mandate, so let’s get real.\n\nThere was no mandate to pardon 1,500 criminals who, with Trump’s encouragement, attacked our Capitol and the brave police officers who protected the lawmakers inside, many of whom have since turned their backs on the very people who saved them from harm that shameful day in 2021.\n\nThere was no mandate to give Elon Musk, an unaccountable, unelected billionaire immigrant, who has enriched himself with taxpayer subsidies and contracts, unprecedented and likely illegal authority to gleefully take a wrecking ball to our federal government in the name of efficiency. In doing so, he is destroying vital services and the lives of thousands of experienced, dedicated public servants, many of whom are veterans who served this country in ways that Trump and Musk can’t even begin to understand.\n\nThere was no mandate to fill cabinet and other high-level positions with people whose main qualifications are denying the outcome of the 2020 election and unquestioning fealty to a wannabe dictator.\n\nThere was no mandate to fire all the inspectors general and independent watchdogs and to fill the Justice Department and FBI with people who will hunt down Trump’s perceived enemies and look the other way for his friends.\n\nThere was no mandate to abandon the people of Ukraine bravely fighting for their freedom by cutting off assistance, attacking their courageous leader and cozying up to the murderous dictator who invaded their homeland three years ago and has wantonly killed thousands upon thousands of children and adults as he continues to destroy schools, hospitals and critical infrastructure in a war that Trump said he could end in one day.\n\nThere was no mandate to remove anyone from the top leadership of our military who happened to be Black or female or to erase the historic struggles and triumphs of minorities from our government websites.\n\nThere was no mandate to wreck our economy by imposing tariffs and picking fights with vital economic partners around the world, many of whom have been trusted friends and allies for generations. Nor was there any mandate to conquer Greenland, bomb Mexico or insult our Canadian neighbors with a preposterous and wholly unwanted quest to make them the 51st state.\n\nAnd there certainly was no mandate to ignore our Constitution, violate our laws and shred the norms that have bound us together since the earliest days of the republic.\n\nTrump and the neutered Republicans in Congress who bark and clap like trained seals at his every utterance can say mandate over and over again to justify the carnage that is taking place here in Maine, across the nation and around the world, but the numbers don’t lie. They may have won a close election, but they received no mandate.\n\nIf anything, a closely divided election is a plea for our leaders to find common ground and work together to solve our problems. Since that clearly isn’t happening, it’s going to be up to the rest of us to continue to speak out, stand up and fight back — and to get ready to demonstrate what a real mandate looks like in next year’s election and the presidential contest that follows.","summary":"President Trump and the neutered Republicans in Congress can repeat 'mandate' to justify the carnage that is taking place in Maine and around the world.

disconnected Democratic elites are","text":"Following Democrats’ defeat in the 2024 election, some pointed to a systemic issue within the Democratic party: progressives and political elites who dominate the party have pushed it so far to the left, that it is out of touch with what voters want.\n\nNow, a new first-of-its kind poll conducted by UC Berkeley and Politico has quantified just how out of touch California’s Democratic political elites are with the wider electorate.\n\nTo be sure, this survey was only conducted in one state. \n\nHowever, there are indications that the chasm between Democratic elites and average voters is not confined solely to California but rather is a national problem for Democrats.\n\nDavid Hogg, the vice chair of the DNC, is reportedly planning to spend $20 million on primary challenges against Democratic incumbents he considers too passive in opposing Trump.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, if not corrected, the disconnect between the activists and elites versus the rest of the electorate – including Democrats – will make it virtually impossible for the party to coalesce around a presidential candidate.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,025 California voters and more than 700 “political influencers” – a sample which included political insiders, federal and state lawmakers, as well as their staffers – found a considerable gap between what voters want from their elected officials and what political elites want.\n\nIndeed, while a plurality (43%) of voters feel their representatives have been “too confrontational” with the Trump administration, nearly one-half of influencers say officials have been “too passive” according to Politico, which did not publish the specific percentage.\n\nPut another way, whereas voters want California to have a working relationship with the Trump administration, the smaller group of political elites want California at the forefront of anti-Trump “resistance.”\n\nMoreover, on specific policies, such as immigration and climate mandates, there was an even starker divide. \n\nAccording to Politico, whereas voters “were more likely to support reducing legal immigration and encouraging assimilation,” elites, on the other hand, “favored more legal immigration and maintaining distinct cultures.”\n\nFurther, when asked about California’s strict emission standards, voters supported it by a 5-point margin (45% to 40%), a significant difference from the 68-point margin in elites’ support (82% to 14%). \n\nSumming up the poll, Politico noted that the political elites are more eager than voters to “embrace California’s progressive agenda.”\n\nGiven that California voters are significantly more liberal than the national electorate, it’s entirely reasonable to believe that the disconnect between national elites and voters nationwide is even greater.\n\nTo that point, as Jack Citrin, a political science professor at UC Berkeley noted, “The influentials (influencers in this survey) are a much more homogenous group than the registered voter public.”\n\nThis has been to the detriment of the party’s relationship with everyday Americans, particularly working class voters, who used to be the core of the Democratic Party.\n\nIn no small measure, Democrats’ shift to the left – on the economy and social issues in particular – is why Donald Trump made considerable inroads with working class voters last November.\n\nEven in California, Kamala Harris’ 20-point margin of victory was nearly 10-points lower than former President Biden’s in 2020. \n\nWith the exception of Alpine, every county in the state shifted to the right in 2024 versus 2020, including a 9% move in Riverside, and 6% in both Orange and San Diego counties, per the New York Times. \n\nSpeaking of the former Vice President, the same survey indicated diverging opinions on her possible run for Governor of California. \n\nAsked which word most encapsulates their emotions towards a Harris candidacy, political insiders most often said “indifferent” (36%), followed by “mostly excited” (22%). \n\nRegistered Democrats however were significantly more upbeat – slightly more than 4-in-10 (41%) said they were “mostly excited” and one-third said “joyful.” \n\nConversely, roughly one-half (47%) of Independents said they felt either “irritated” (26%) or that Harris’ campaign was “hopeless” (21%). \n\nOf course, given Democrats’ dominance in the state, Independents would likely be unable to deny Harris the governor’s mansion should she run. \n\nAlthough, these findings further reinforce the disconnect between Democratic political insiders and the wider electorate. \n\nTo that end, the Democratic Party has allowed itself to be captured by progressive elites which has steered the party further to the left, damaging its political viability.\n\nBefore next year’s midterms, Democrats must reorient the party away from the elites’ far-left politics and back to its traditional values. \n\nIf they don’t, then even the chaos Trump is causing with his haphazard economic policies, and constant constitutional overreach won’t be enough to bring voters back to the Democratic Party.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"New California poll underscores how disconnected Democratic elites

Ed Howe of St. Hedwig Church in Logan Square. “It’s about looking past right in front of us to something greater.”\n\nAs Christians prepare to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Sunday, some priests and pastors have identified similarities between the darkness felt when he was crucified on Good Friday and modern-day heaviness. \n\nBut as the Rev. Michael Pfleger, pastor at St. Sabina Catholic Church in Auburn Gresham, plans to remind his congregation Sunday, darkness can be followed by light — just as the crucifixion was followed by the resurrection.\n\n“There was that Good Friday that we can’t ignore, where it seemed hopeless and it seemed like the skies were dark, and fear and hopelessness and had paralyzed people, and it looked like it was all over,” Pfleger said. “But you know that was not the end of the story that Sunday came and it changed everything.”\n\nMass federal layoffs, the war in Gaza, an economic downturn sparked by President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, mass deportations and the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion are all examples of the “darkness” weighing on believers, but Pfleger and others are urging them to fight back.\n\n“If we keep our eye just on what we see in the world, we do get overwhelmed,” Pfleger said. “But faith gives you the spiritual vision that’s beyond the world. Faith is what tells you this isn’t the end. Faith is what tells you this doesn’t win. Faith is what tells us that darkness and death don’t have the last word.”\n\nIn his sermon, the Rev. Marshall Hatch at New Mount Pilgrim Church in West Garfield Park is planning to focus on the simple message “do not be afraid.” Hatch acknowledged mass layoffs in the federal government and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s admission that she and others are afraid to criticize Trump, stirring anxiety and fear across the country.\n\nIn that context, he’ll remind parishioners to lean on one another.\n\n“And so I want the congregation to know that even in the midst of it all, you know, we still have each other,” he said. “We have the church. Christ is risen and somehow we’ll get through this together; do not be afraid. God is with us.”\n\nIn the Rev. Michael Nabors’ sermon titled “It’s Just Like the Women Said” at Second Baptist Church in Evanston, he’ll draw parallels between the women who discovered Jesus’ empty tomb and the women who have fought to break barriers in the modern era — specifically, the ones who ran and lost in their bids for the U.S. presidency. Women are under threat of losing their rights, Nabors said, referring to the SAVE Act, a bill that was recently passed by the Republican-controlled House that could make it harder for married women who have changed their name to vote, and the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which protected the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n“I will say if we had heeded Hillary Clinton, if we had heeded Kamala Harris, then it could very well be that we would be on a different road leading to a new and brighter day, just like the resurrection, instead of being on a road into the unknown,” he said.\n\nAt St. Clement Catholic Church in Lincoln Park, parishioners attending the Rev. Brett Williams’ Mass can expect to hear a resounding call to take the joy and energy from Easter Mass and spread that feeling far beyond Sunday.\n\n“It is our hope that we live as Easter people,” Williams said. “That we take the joy of the resurrection into our own personal lives and relationships and families and friends and colleagues, but also that we, in some way, make sure that the good news of Jesus risen from the dead is spread to our community.”\n\nWilliams pointed to the strength and resilience of Pope Francis, who continued his work despite kidney failure and pneumonia that left him hospitalized this year.\n\n“I think his service is inspiring for us Catholic Christians throughout the world that even frail and infirm, he makes an effort to serve. We’ve always [been] called to serve,” Williams said.\n\nFor Pfleger, the main message he wants his parishioners to take with them is simple.\n\n“Decide they’re going to live out of their faith and get up on Monday morning and fight like hell.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/religion/2025/04/18/easter-sermons-chicago-priests-pastors","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/56f1e7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd6%2Fe8%2Fb5db553b49c4b67acc20d1f9a81d%2Feast","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 02:35:54","author":"Adora Namigadde | Wbez,Mary Norkol","authors":["Adora Namigadde | Wbez","Mary Norkol"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.197},{"id":312604584,"title":"Katy Perry gets ready for sci-fi inspired world tour days after controversial trip to space","text":"In less than a year, Katy Perry has released an album, campaigned for Kamala Harris and, just this week, flown to space. As she heads to Mexico City, Mexico, to kick off a world tour on Wednesday (Apr 23), the pop superstar shows no intention of slowing down.\n\n“I’m always open and I say, ‘Why not?’ and ‘Let’s just try,’” she told the Associated Press recently at her Southern California rehearsal space. “The power of your thoughts is so incredible because everything starts with a thought. I had this thought, ‘I want to go on tour.’ And here we are.”\n\nWith that openness to try comes accepting that not every endeavour will be a victory. Her September album, 143, was critically panned, and she was simultaneously criticised for reuniting with embattled producer Dr. Luke.\n\nCelebrities like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowski critiqued the spaceflight’s use of resources as superfluous and indulgent. And Harris ultimately lost the November election to President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Perry’s longevity and the scale of her fame since her 2008 breakout hit, I Kissed a Girl, are attributable at least in part to her willingness to get back up in the wake of a setback, as she belts in her 2013 empowerment anthem, Roar.\n\n“I can control what I can control,” she said.\n\nThat mantra has been refined over the past 15 years through her practice of transcendental meditation. The meditation technique has been embraced by a handful of celebrities, including – perhaps most zealously – the late David Lynch, whom Perry credits with spreading the practice and its message.\n\n“That changed my life. And I’ve gone on a long inner space journey to untangle some wires, to answer some questions, to become more grounded, to find the power within myself,” she said.\n\nPerry is fascinated by all things spiritual, casually weaving into conversation references to astrology, the enneagram and cardology, which purports to impart mystical insights into an individual’s personality through playing cards. Perry also credits having her daughter, Daisy, with propelling her along a journey of self-discovery and enhancing her “feminine divine.”\n\n“Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she said. “I think I’ve just grown into the strong woman that I’ve always dreamed of and idolised.”\n\nThat journey has informed her approach to music and performing, down to the narrative of her sci-fi-themed Lifetimes Tour. Citing films like Blade Runner and The Fifth Element as visual and thematic inspirations, Perry will play a video game character who faces off against evil forces.\n\n“It’s really about believing in yourself and leading with love. Those are always my messages, no matter how I wrap it or whatever tour I bring. It’s love and empowerment,” she said. “When I can lead by example, it just ripples.”\n\nPerry’s tour of more than 80 performances will primarily be a career-spanning showcase of past hits, but with a dance-infused flair to some of the traditional pop songs. “I tell everybody they have to wear some sensible shoes,” she explained.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since Perry emerged as a pop star, she has made tongue-in-cheek lyricism, in line with her sense of humor, and catchy messages of empowerment a signature of her songs. Critical reception to her more recent albums has been less than enthusiastic, but that hasn't stopped the 40-year-old from going all out for this tour, calling it “Disneyland on wheels.”\n\n“I feel a responsibility to my audience who have really been with me on this ride during this whole lifetime to give them that feeling that they had when they first heard Teenage Dream,\" she said.","summary":"Her global Lifetimes Tour will kick off in Mexico City, Mexico on Apr 23.","url":"https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/katy-perry-sci-fi-tour-463456","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--XXJDxyYh--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/music-katy_perry_56684.jpg?itok=WpOo_ykG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 01:19:39","author":"Cna Lifestyle","authors":["Cna Lifestyle"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.311},{"id":312601060,"title":"Trump infuriates liberals as he shares 'PROOF' deported thug is MS-13 gangster","text":"Donald Trump showed a photograph he offered as 'proof' that deported migrant El Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member. \n\nAbrego Garcia has become a flashpoint for polarized politics, with Republicans labeling him a terrorist who should never have been in the country in the first place.\n\nLiberals, meanwhile, see him as a man both here legally and wrongly deported in their latest outrage toward Trump.\n\nTrump seemed to offer a rebuttal to the left by posting what he said were photos of knuckle tattoos representing MS-13 and belonging to Abrego Garcia on Truth Social Friday night. \n\n'This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such 'a fine and innocent person,'' Trump wrote. \n\nIt features tattoos on his fingers that officials have previously described: a marijuana leaf, a smiley face, a cross, and a skull. 'MS-13' is now spelled across the knuckles in the photo Trump posted. \n\nHowever, those letters and numbers are digitally added on and Pam Bondi made no mention of any tattoos representing the deadly gang in documents accusing Abrego Garcia of being a member.\n\nStill, some have alleged that the tattoos are meant to be code, a marijuana leaf representing the letter M, a smiley face representing the letter S, a cross being a cover up for the number one and a skull meant to be covering up the number three.\n\nTrump sees it as proof that he's found out Abrego Garcia as a member of the infamous gang. \n\n'They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he's got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc.' \n\nAbrego Garcia's lawyers have denied any links to MS-13, the notorious prison gang that Trump insists he is affiliated with, and stated he has no criminal convictions. \n\nDailyMail.com did find Abrego Garcia's wife filled out a petition accusing her husband of domestic violence but never signed or submitted it.\n\nTrump wrote: 'I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' \n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Senator Chris Van Hollen - who visited with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador - and representatives for Abrego Garcia for comment. \n\nThe post came as Trump got a legal victory Friday, with a divided appeals court in Washington halted Judge James Boasberg's contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for the deportation flights to El Salvador.\n\nIt is not a ruling on whether those proceedings should take place but gives the court a chance to hear the Trump administration's appeal against Boasberg's ruling.\n\nVan Hollen met Thursday in El Salvador with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was sent there by the Trump administration in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation.\n\nVan Hollen posted a photo of the meeting on X, saying he also called Abrego Garcia's wife 'to pass along his message of love.' \n\nThe lawmaker did not provide an update on the status of Abrego Garcia, whose attorneys are fighting to force the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.\n\nA spokesman for the Trump administration remained on message, claiming Van Hollen was worried more about a 'terrorist' illegal migrant than his own constituents.\n\n'Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist. It is truly disgusting. President Trump will continue to stand on the side of law-abiding Americans,' Kush Desai told DailyMail.com\n\nEl Salvador´s Presidnet Nayib Bukele posted images of the meeting minutes before Van Hollen shared his post and took a more confrontational approach, decrying beliefs that Abrego Garcia was suffering. \n\nBukele wrote: 'Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the `death camps´ & 'torture,' now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!'\n\nThe tweet ended with emojis of the U.S. and El Salvador flags, with a handshake emoji between them. A spokeswoman for El Salvador´s presidency said she had no further information. \n\nThe meeting came hours after Van Hollen said he was denied entry into an high-security El Salvador prison Thursday while he was trying to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being and push for his release.\n\nThe Democratic senator said at a news conference in San Salvador that his car was stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about two miles from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, even as they let other cars go on.\n\n'They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,' Van Hollen said. \n\nAbrego Garcia entered the US illegally in 2011. A judge blocked his return to El Salvador in 2019, citing the fact that gangsters were after him, but said he could be deported elsewhere. \n\nIn court filings this week, the Trump administration said he was deported to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court has since ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US. \n\nLate Thursday, a three-judge panel from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to suspend a judge's decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials to determine if they complied with the court's instruction to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. \n\nThe Trump administration´s claims that it can't do anything to free Garcia from an El Salvador prison or return him to the US 'should be shocking to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,' the court said Thursday in a blistering order that ratchets up the escalating conflict between the government's executive and judicial branches. \n\nJudge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, said: 'It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all.' \n\nHe added that he and his two colleagues 'cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.'\n\nTrump officials insist Garcia is not an innocent American, as claimed. They say he's an MS-13 gangster who deserves to be sent back to El Salvador. \n\nAdditionally, a 2021 petition for protection from domestic violence filled out by Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, which was obtained first by DailyMail.com, states that the alleged MS-13 member beat his wife multiple times over the years. \n\nShe told The Post she was 'acting out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar … in case things escalated' after being abused 'in a previous relationship.'\n\n'Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling,' she added.\n\n'Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect.'\n\nDemocrats, furious about his deportation, are up in arms, with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen traveling in an attempt to get answers.\n\nDetermined to save Garcia, he flew to El Salvador in an effort to get him out of jail and back in America. \n\nBut when he showed up asking for a meeting, he was denied. \n\nHe is now being mocked by Republicans and Conservative Americans, including the mother of a woman who was murdered by an illegal migrant. \n\n'Senator Van Hollen has done more to bring a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker and illegal alien back to Maryland than he has to help keep his American constituents safe or advocate for the victims of these vicious gangs like MS-13. \n\n'While Senator Van Hollen and the mainstream media peddle a sob story about a brutal MS-13 gang member, Secretary Noem stands with the victims of illegal alien crime, like Maryland mom Rachel Morin. \n\n'We hear far too much about the gang members and criminals sob stories and not enough about their victims,' the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on X. \n\nThe efforts by Van Hollen have also been criticized by Morin's mother Patty who spoke about the lack of any correspondence from state officials when her daughter was murdered. \n\nSpeaking on Fox News with anchor Sean Hannity, she said: 'I'm very angry, I'm outraged. I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time.\n\n'He did not call our family, he did not give condolences. There was no action [from] the Democratic party in anyway. \n\n'From Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, anyone here in Maryland, none of the Senators did anything to help search for the murderer of my daughter.'\n\nRachel Morin's illegal immigrant killer Victor Martinez-Hernandez was found guilty of first degree murder, first degree rape and kidnapping on Monday - and is now awaiting sentencing. \n\nAbrego Garcia, who is a legal resident, arrived at the notorious supermax prison CECOT in El Salvador March 15 on one of three planes from the US.\n\nHe first entered the U.S. in 2011 but was granted permission to stay by a judge in 2019. He later settled down in Maryland and has an American wife and son.\n\nThe Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia on March 15 after files indicated that he had connections with MS-13, a vicious Salvadorian-American gang.\n\nHis wife and lawyer deny his gang affiliation and have sued the administration for improperly removing him from the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration initially said his removal was a mistake. The Supreme Court then ordered the facilitation of his return.\n\nBut the Trump administration is standing firm. \n\nIn the Oval Office on Monday, Trump and Bukele led a united defense of their actions in the case of Abrego Garcia.\n\nBukele argued he couldn't return, saying: 'How can I return him to the United States?\n\n'I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it.\n\n'The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't have the power to return him to the United States.'\n\nTrump supported Bukele's claim and went further, lobbying the El Salvadorian leader to take more migrants and build more prisons hold them.\n\n'I just asked the president, you know, it's this massive complex that he built, a jail complex. I said, 'Can you build some more of them, please?'' Trump said.","summary":"Donald Trump showed a photograph he offered as 'proof' that deported migrant El Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14626985/Trump-infuriates-liberals-shares-PROOF-thug-MS-13-gangster.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/02/97449193-0-image-a-41_1745024823760.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/16/1734277532721528733/1024x576_MP4_1734277532721528733.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-19 01:19:21","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

They've been friends for about a decade.'\nAfter enjoying a meal, the two were seen exiting the restaurant with Carey sporting a blue button up as well as a pair of dark navy trousers.\n\nDrew Carey, 66, sparked up romance speculation when he stepped out with OnlyFans model Niki Skyler, 37, this week to grab lunch in Los Angeles; seen in 2024 in West Hollywood \n\nNiki — who was named Penthouse Pet of the Month back in 2017 — also opted for comfort in a black tank top and baggy pants\nThe daytime excursion came just two months after Drew shared that he is still not dating after his former fiancee Amie Harwick was murdered in 2020 by ex-boyfriend Gareth Pursehouse. \nPursehouse had pled not guilty but in 2023 he was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. \n\n Drew Carey, 66, reveals he is STILL not dating after ex killed \nCarey and Harwick became engaged in 2018 but called it quits later that same year. \nDuring an interview with Us Weekly in February, the TV personality got candid about her tragic death and admitted to the outlet, 'It destroyed me for a while. I still don't date. \n'I have women I go out with and spend time with, but it's all platonic, and I don't care about anything else. Amie's death really affected everything.' \nHe also expressed, 'I think about her every day. It's such a loss. Her death still affects me and my ideas about relationships and intimacy. \n'It was all damaged by first our breakup, and then, the day before she died, when she texted me. It had been a really bad breakup for both of us, but a necessary one. I couldn't think about her or see a picture of her.' \nThe day before her passing, Carey recalled receiving a message from Amie who brought up the topic of forgiveness and asked to meet up. \n\nThe insider explained that the model is 'just a friend.

Which I did. I loved her madly even though we had broken up.'\nDrew further reflected on the people in his life and stated, 'I have this great female friend group that I cherish, and I'm godfather to several sets of kids from the group.\n'We hang out together, went on vacation together and we talk to each other every day. That's the biggest blessing in my life right now.' \nWhen her murderer was sentenced to life in prison, Carey opened up to People about finally having closure. \n'I can barely remember the guy's name — that's how much I've put him out of my life — but ever since the final sentencing, it feels like we've all let out a breath and are able to finally move on.' \nHe continued, 'The whole process is over now, and there's nothing else to be done and nothing else to worry about. … Just speaking just for myself, it's been quite a load off.' \nDrew also shared that following her passing, he still has photos of Harwick inside of his house. \n\nDrew further reflected on the people in his life and stated, 'I have this great female friend group that I cherish, and I'm godfather to several sets of kids from the group'; Niki Skyler seen above \n'She's with me always. A lot of times I'll feel like I'll be thinking things through, and it's almost like I can hear her voice saying, \"Well, really, it's because of this and that.\" It's really nice, honestly.' \nCarey is known for hosting the game show The Price Is Right since 2007 after he took over for Bob Barker. \nIn February, the beloved series celebrated its 10,000 episode. \nWhen he first became host of the show, Drew told Us Weekly, 'I mainly didn't want to get the show canceled or be responsible for ruining such an institution. \n\nCarey is known for hosting the game show The Price Is Right since 2007 after he took over for Bob Barker. In February, the beloved series celebrated its 10,000 episode (seen above) \n'Once I got comfortable after a couple of years, it felt like it was more my show instead of me just being a steward of somebody else's. And now I just want to do it forever, as long as I'm mentally and physically able to show up. \nHe further gushed, 'It's such a fun thing! The money's nice, but it's just a cool job. I don't have to go to work, I get to go to work! It's a privilege to be here, an honor. So we'll see how long I hold up.' \nIn regards to his love for the game show and the job, the star explained, 'I'm playing games all day! There are more than 70 different contests on the show, so I'm never bored. \n'It's like game night at home: What are we going to play tonight? Is it going to be Scrabble or Monopoly or Cards Against Humanity?

two months after his McDonald's collaboration.\nThe TV personality dipped her toes into the fast food business shortly after the rapper released his personalised menu in February. \nStormzy's McDonald's collaboration, called The Stormzy Meal, includes nine chicken nuggets, fries, BBQ dips, a Sprite Zero, and an Oreo McFlurry or apple pie.\nMeanwhile, Maya's Uber menu includes a burger with watermelon jam, which she praises for its inflammatory benefits.\nThe menu also offers ackee and saltfish, a staple Jamaican breakfast which she says will revive fans due to it being rich in vitamins A and C.\nA griddled chicken salad and coffee-infused sticky toffee pudding are also up for grabs. \nMaya said: 'I rarely get time off, but when I do, I love to simply sit back on the sofa, indulging in a little self-care and devouring a takeaway - and nothing helps me bounce back from a late one like it.\n\nMaya completed her beach look with a camouflage Von Dutch baseball cap and dainty gold hoop earrings\n\nLetting her dark curls tumble freely over her shoulders, she embraced a natural glow by going makeup-free for the sunny outing\n\nShe also captured a serene moment as she cooled off in the crystal-clear sea, soaking up the idyllic surroundings\n\nMaya captioned the stunning snaps with: 'Every other day another time zone'\n\nMaya went her separate ways with Stormzy last year and she has since been linked to Ruben Dias (pictured in December) \n'That's why I'm happy to be teaming up with Uber Eats to bring my Revive And Thrive menu to life.\n'Featuring classics that I always crave, like mac 'n' cheese and sticky toffee pudding to ackee and saltfish, these dishes are packed with flavour - and a few secret ingredients that I swear by to help me get back on form.'\nMaya went her separate ways with Stormzy last year and she has since been linked to Ruben Dias. \nMaya is reportedly being followed on Instagram by Ruben's mother, prompting speculation over a relationship between the Love Island host and the Manchester City star.\nDuring the international break, Maya flew to Lisbon to watch Ruben, 27, play for the Portuguese national team.\nShe was pictured in the stands at the José Alvalade Stadium to witness Portugal's 5-2 victory over Denmark in the second leg of their Nations League quarter-final.\nThe presenter was seen with a friend and glasses of wine in a VIP hospitality box - usually reserved for friends and family of players.\nMaya then posted a picture on social media of the two celebrating together at their romantic fireside retreat at 3:30am the following morning.\nThe snap is believed to have been taken at the footballer's home in the Cascais region of Portugal, with a vast swimming pool and fire pit glimpsed in the picture.\nThailandMaya Jama\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMaya Jama flaunts her jaw-dropping figure in a skimpy black bikini as she hits the beach during sun-soaked Thailand getaway\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The New York Times reported on an invitation for the May 6 event in New York, noting it would be centered on a discussion between the former Democratic Party presidential candidate and Martin, who was elected to his position earlier this year. The lowest priced tickets for the event – designated as the \"building the opposition\" tier – reportedly start at $25,000. The higher tier, dubbed \"fighting for the future,\" cost $44,300. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS HER TIMETABLE ON HER NEXT POLITICAL STEPS The event will be another rare public appearance for Harris since she lost the 2024 presidential election to President Donald Trump in November. The former candidate has stayed out of the limelight following the defeat, except for a few outings, like her attendance at the NAACP Image Awards in February. During that event, she made a speech decrying the Trump administration after accepting the event’s \"Chairman’s Award.\" \"Some look at this moment and rightly feel the weight of history,\" she said. \"Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy, and ask, ‘What do we do now?’ But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before, and we will do it again.\" KAMALA HARRIS WAS ‘VERY ANNOYED’ WITH OBAMA AS SHE SOUGHT HIS ENDORSEMENT, BOOK REVEALS Harris’ speech at a gathering of Black female business leaders, politicians and other figures in California in early April also made headlines. During her remarks, Harris took a dig at the Trump administration. \"I’m not here to say I told you so,\" she said, prompting her and the crowd to crack up. A source close to her told Fox News Digital last week that she was contemplating launching a gubernatorial campaign in the state of California. The source said Harris would decide whether to take that path by the end of the summer. There has also been speculation that Harris might mount another presidential run in 2028. Early Democratic presidential polls indicate that the former vice president holds a significant lead over other potential White House contenders. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE A Fox News poll from late December named Harris as an early frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic primary along with other recognizable party figures, like Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., and Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill. However, prominent pollsters like FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver predict that progressive icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., will be the figure to beat in the next Democratic presidential primary.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SAMEER SURI FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:22:26 BST, 18 April 2025 |Updated:01:22 BST, 19 April 2025 \n\nPost Malone has found himself locked in a shock legal drama, as his ex-fiancée is demanding full physical custody of their two-year-old daughter.\nThe 29-year-old pop star, whose real name is Austin Post, announced the birth of his child in June 2022 without disclosing her name.\nAt the same time, he revealed he was engaged to the baby's mother but kept his fiancée's identity private, with fans taking to calling her 'Jamie.'\nIt emerged last month that Post and 'Jamie' had split, and he has recently been seen on multiple dates with a 20-year-old influencer called Christy Lee, with whom he indulged in a public display of affection in Paris this month.\nNow, 'Jamie' has revealed that her real name is Hee Sung Park, in a legal filing asking for sole physical custody of her daughter, according to Page Six.\nIn Park's documents, submitted Wednesday to the Los Angeles Superior Court's family law division, she refers to the toddler simply as DDP.\nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Post for comment. \n\nPost Malone has found himself locked in a shock legal drama, as his ex-fiancée 'Jamie' is demanding full physical custody of their daughter, two; pictured February in New Orleans \n\nNow 'Jamie' has revealed that her real name is Hee Sung Park, in a legal filing asking for sole physical custody of her daughter, according to Page Six\nThe two-year-old's mother filed for full physical custody, but she only requested joint legal custody and is also open to giving Post visitation rights, aka 'parenting time.'\nPark, who reportedly split from Post near the end of 2024, alleged in her new legal documents that DDP has lived with her since November, via TMZ.\nHer court filing, in which she demands that her ex cover her legal costs, also revealed that their daughter was born in May 2022.\n\n Post Malone continues to flaunt new romance after shock split from former fiancée \nAs for child support, she said: 'The court may make orders for support of the children and issue an earnings assignment without further notice to either party.'\nPost reportedly recently submitted sealed custody documents of his own in Utah, where he keeps his primary residence, but he has yet to give a response to Park's new filing.\nOn Friday, TMZ reported that Post's filing in Utah preceded Park's, which could help him save a considerable amount of money.\nSources said the rapper-turned-country star filed in Utah because he and Park had previously been splitting custody down the middle in the state, but it's also to his financial benefit, as Utah is far stingier with child-support payments than California. \nDespite Park's efforts to have the case heard in California, sources said the case would remain in Utah. \n\nThe two-year-old's mother filed for full physical custody, but she only requested joint legal custody and is also open to giving Post visitation rights, aka 'parenting time' \n\nPost Malone is seen sipping a Bud Light in the back of a limo on Thursday. He seemingly flouted open container laws with the move\n\nPost has recently been seen on multiple dates with a 20-year-old influencer called Christy Lee, one of which was captured by a fan on TikTok \n\nThe sources alleged that Park had only moved to the Golden State earlier this year in an attempt to obtain residency and find more favorable conditions in California's court system. \nHowever, Post's initial filing is under seal, so details about it are scarce.\nOn Thursday — one day after Park submitted her request for full physical custody — Post was seen illegally holding an open bottle of Bud Light in the backseat of a black SUV in Los Angeles.\nCalifornia law prohibits persons from carrying an open — or even unsealed — container of alcohol in a vehicle's passenger compartment, which is to say any place in reach of somebody in the car, such as a cupholder or glovebox.\nIn recent weeks, Post has been repeatedly spotted enjoying public dates with his new 20-year-old girlfriend Christy Lee, who studied at Parsons School Of Design and has reportedly interned for celebrity stylist Kristina Askerova.\nPost announced his daughter's birth and his own engagement to Park in June 2022, during an interview on The Howard Stern Show.\nIn 2023, he revealed that he and Park — whom he did not name at the time — had in fact gotten engaged two years earlier in Las Vegas, though she turned down his drunken first proposal and instructed him to ask again the next day.\n'I had lost a significant amount of money at the table,' he shared on Call Her Daddy. 'We go upstairs and I’m off my rocker hammered and I was like: \"Hey, you wanna marry me?\" I got a ring and all this stuff. And she said: \"No.\" She’s like: \"Ask me tomorrow,\" and I was like: \"All right.\" And then I did and I was sober and it was nice.'\nHe showered praise on Park, saying that he knew that she was the 'right' woman for him because of how 'massive' her heart was.\n'I've always wanted kids and a big family, and I could tell she was going to be a really good mama,' he said. 'And she's like, number one mom in the f***ing universe.' \nParisPost Malone\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPost Malone locked in shock custody drama over daughter, two, as ex-fiancée 'Jamie' finally reveals identity\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 58\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I don't know how else I would meet people if I wasn't doing that.'\n\nThe DJ and TV star is thought to have enjoyed ' a string of dates with Adam Butler' before the businessman joined her in the tropical location while on a work trip\n'When I was younger, there was the option to go out, but now I live in the country, it's not like I'm able to just go to the pub,' she added. \n'Even if I went to my local, they're all my neighbours who I know anyway, so that's of no value to me.'\nDetailing how her only chance of meeting potential matches 'in real life' is online, she hinted that she has come across some celebrity suitors on exclusive dating app Raya.\n'I'm still on my Raya dating app, I've gone on quite a few dates with different people, I've seen so many celebrities [on Raya], but you aren't allowed to say who is on there,' she teased.\nThe former Big Breakfast host noted that while it's 'really fun' to use the app, she has awkwardly often found herself paired with one of her mates.\nShe said she hasn't really been active on Raya over the winter months, but with summer fast approaching, she plans to change that, quipping: 'Watch this space.'\nThe performer said being a single mother to her daughter Betsy, 14 - who she shares with ex-husband Lee Mead - makes it harder to meet new people as she can't go out at night.\nEven when she is out DJing, Denise said she is 'in and out' of the venue and 'doesn't hang around', lessening her chance of sparking up a romance with anyone there.\nShe is seemingly keen to get back into the dating pool again after revealing she wasn't 'fussed' about being in a relationship last year.\n\nThe presenter has been single since splitting from Jimmy Barba (pictured) in October 2023 and joined exclusive dating app Raya last year in the hopes of finding love again \n\n Denise Van Outen, 50, says she's reliant on dating apps to meet men \nWhile she has been on a few dates, she said she wasn't putting pressure on herself to find a new partner because she's very content with her own company these days.\nReferencing the end of her engagement to Eddie Boxshall, who she split from in January 2022 after discovering he had been unfaithful, she told Fabulous magazine: 'I'm not fussed either way now.\n'I'm really good friends with Tamzin Outhwaite and we were saying: ''Isn't it nice to actually just be loving life and not feel pressured to have to be in a relationship or be with someone?'' I've learned to be on my own and be content.\n'This industry can feel pressurised, and then when things go wrong, it's so public. You worry that people see you as a failure.\n'I wonder if people say: ''Why can't she hold down a relationship? History keeps repeating itself'', but I'm not chasing it now.'\nShe added that her relationship with Eddie only got cut short because of what she discovered he had done, admitting that was the 'sad part' of the break-up.\nDenise said she was 'back to square one' but was trying to keep a 'positive outlook' and 'have an open heart'.\nAfter her devastating split from Eddie, Denise found love again with Jimmy Barba in July 2022, but they split after 18 months together.\n\nShe ended her engagement to Eddie Boxshall (seen together) in January 2022 after discovering he had been unfaithful\nDenise went public with property developer Jimmy, 55, that summer after her split from her love rat ex Eddie, who she was with for seven years.\nShe ended her relationship with the commodities trader in January 2022 after discovering unfaithful messages.\nEddie moved out of Denise's home following their shock split and was thought to be staying with friends.\nSix months later, she went public with Jimmy, who she met through All Saints singer Shaznay Lewis, at the Grand Prix Ball and the pair enjoyed their first holiday together after jetting to Marbella.\n\nA look back at Denise Van Outen's love life\n\nJay Kay (1998-2001) \nDenise, who narrates The Only Way Is Essex, dated Jamiroquai lead singer Jay Kay, 52, for three years from 1998 to 2001. \nThe TV personality, 47, enjoyed a highly-publicised relationship with the Jamiroquai bandmember, 52, before they 'painfully' called it quits back in 2001.\nDenise even wrote about him in her new autobiography A Bit Of Me, and he claimed they called off their plans to marry due to 'conflicting' jobs at the time.\n\nThe ex files: The star, who narrates The Only Way Is Essex, dated Jamiroquai lead singer Jay Kay, 52, for three years from 1998 to 2001 (pictured in 1998)\nNick Moran (2001)\nAfter Jay, there was a brief rebound fling with Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels actor Nick Moran. \nOne onlooker observed of one of their date nights: 'They were like a pair of magnets - stuck together all night.

We are seeing those that are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats.” She understands the American experiment stands on a precipice, and that some law firms courting favor with Donald Trump are complicit.\n\nThey are engaging in genuinely risky business that echoes the complicity of Germans who enabled Hitler’s rise — not through ideology, but by normalizing and legitimizing his power. We are watching, in real time, the methodical dismantling of democracy and the ascent of autocracy.\n\nDemocracy does not die with a bang. But complicity erodes it norm by norm, step by step, with elites greasing the slippery slope. They need to remember that history will judge their courage.\n\nWalnut Creek\n\nMeasure T will keep\nschools, cities strong\n\nWe, the mayors of Lafayette, Moraga, Orinda and Walnut Creek, urge you to vote yes on Measure T for the excellent high schools serving our communities. The need for the additional funding is compelling.\n\nStrong local schools are the foundation of our cities. Many of us moved here so our children could attend our excellent schools, and we continue to benefit from the strong property values our outstanding local schools support.\n\nMeasure T will provide locally controlled funding to retain excellent teachers, maintain manageable class sizes and preserve high-quality programs, keeping our schools among the best.\n\nEvery dollar from Measure T will stay local. Independent oversight and annual audits ensure funds are spent as promised. Seniors can apply for an exemption.\n\nJoin us in voting yes on Measure T to help our students succeed.\n\nSusan Candell, Lafayette\nSteve Woehleke, Moraga\nLatika Malkani, Orinda\nand Cindy Darling, Walnut Creek\n\nFailed health agencies\nmust be overhauled\n\nRe: “If autism is public health crisis, why is the HHS pulling back?” (Page A6, April 17).\n\nLet’s state some facts: Autism diagnoses increased 175% from 2014 to 2024. Cancer in people under 50 increased 79% globally since 1990. Over 40% of adults are obese and about 75% are overweight. Childhood obesity has tripled since 1970. Diabetes increased four times since 1990. Alzheimer’s disease deaths have increased by 140% since 2000. Life expectancy in the U.S. is 12th among developed countries. Additives are in our foods that are not allowed in most other developed countries.\n\nI don’t see how anyone can believe that the NIH, CDC or FDA have done a good job. It is time to get rid of people who have failed to improve our health. I firmly support a complete overhaul of these agencies and a new focus on the prevention of illness.\n\nImmunizations are\na shared responsibility\n\nWorld Immunization Week, observed from April 24–30, reminds us of the vital role vaccines play in protecting lives across all ages. As communities worldwide recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s more important than ever to rebuild trust in vaccines and close the immunization gap.\n\nVaccines have eradicated smallpox, brought polio to the brink of extinction and continued to prevent countless illnesses. Yet millions still lack access due to misinformation, poverty and health care barriers.\n\nLet’s use this week to raise awareness, support outreach programs and advocate for equitable access to vaccines for everyone, everywhere. Immunization isn’t just a personal choice — it’s a shared responsibility.\n\nMike Crosby\n\nDemocrats jump the gun\nto condemn Trump tariffs\n\nRe: “Trump’s tariffs target of state suit” (Page A1, April 17).\n\nThe tariffs have not even been fully established yet, and Gov. Gavin Newsom, the media and the rest of the Democrat cabal are crying about them. It took them four years to figure out that Joe Biden was a cognitive disaster, but in less than a month, they have definitely concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the tariffs are bad.\n\nOf course, we know that it is just because they are “Trump” tariffs that make them “bad.” They would whine about a cure for cancer if it was discovered by Donald Trump.\n\nNewsom signed bills authorizing $50 million to fight Trump policies here in California, whether they are good for the state or not. This is just another example of how Democrats waste California taxpayer dollars and neglect its citizens — just another reason to vote Republican.\n\nJay Todesco","summary":"Also: Measure T &#124; Agency overhaul &#124; Shared responsibility &#124; Jumping the gun.

Other Trump appointees reached out to the governor, but the president was not one of them.\n\n“I haven’t,” Shapiro said. “I heard immediately that day from Director [Kash] Patel of the FBI. And I’ve heard from Attorney General [Pam] Bondi.”\n\nShapiro also acknowledged there were some security failings that resulted in the arson attack, but he is viewing it as a hopeful learning experience for the Pennsylvania police moving forward.\n\n“Look, there — there were clearly security failures,” he said. “And — I want, you know, I have confidence in the Pennsylvania State Police to learn from it, to address it.”\n\nCody A. Balmer, the suspect in the arson attack, confessed to scaling a wall, breaking a window and tossing a homemade incendiary device into the governor’s home because Balmer believed Shapiro was complicit in the deaths of Palestinians in Gaza, according to police earlier this week.\n\nDetails of a police search warrant were made public on Wednesday, Balmer’s 911 call that said Shapiro, a vocal supporter of Israel, “needs to know that he ‘will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.’”\n\nThe warrant added: “Balmer continues saying he needs to stop having my friends killed, and ‘our people have been put through too much by that monster.’”\n\nShapiro was, at one point, being considered as a vice presidential candidate after Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee in the 2024 presidential race.","summary":"The Pennsylvania governor tells \"Good Morning America\" that he has heard from other prominent Republicans since Monday\n\n\nThe post Josh Shapiro Says He Never Heard From Trump After Antisemitic Arson Attack on His Home appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/josh-shapiro-arson-has-not-heard-from-donald-trump/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Josh-Shapiro-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 23:15:52","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.833},{"id":312593128,"title":"Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Cancels Show Starring Trans Actress","text":"Amazon Prime Video, owned by multibillionaire Jeff Bezos, has canceled Clean Slate, one of the few streaming series led by a trans woman.\n\nThe show premiered on Feb. 6 and ran for only three months until Amazon axed it, reported Deadline. Laverne Cox, the first transgender person to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in an acting category, starred as the show’s main protagonist with legendary comedian George Wallace as her estranged father.\n\nThe cancellation comes only months after Bezos erased statements pledging “equity for Black people,” “LGBTQ+ rights,” and any mention of “transgender” from Amazon’s website in December, reported The Washington Post, also owned by Bezos. Amazon was also one of the biggest corporations to overhaul its website following President Donald Trump’s war on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\n\nCox, Wallace, and co-creator Dan Ewen broke the news that a Clean Slate wasn’t returning for another season in a guest column for Deadline.\n\n“By the end of March, our eight-episode series, our labor of love, was canceled,” the column begins. “A seven-year effort was gone in a puff of sever exhaust.” \n\nIt continues: “Please forgive the word count. This s--- was cheaper than therapy.” \n\nClean Slate was backed by the legendary late screenwriter and producer Norman Lear, who died of cardiac arrest in late 2023. The show was reportedly his last completed project. \n\nIn making the show—which centered on bridging familial and political divides, with Alabama as its backdrop—the actors shared that its script often transcended their own life experiences.\n\n“Laverne, one of precious few Alabamans to appear on both the cover of Time magazine and British Vogue, had spent the prior 90 minutes entertaining dozens of questions about transness from the ever-curious Norman,“ the article noted, springing back to the days before the cancellation. ”It was a fantastic conversation, and we would wager it was Norman’s first meeting where he would find himself addressed as ‘guuuurl’ 17 times. \n\nThe article also lauded Lear for being able to empathize with experiences different than his own, despite his awesome age. (He was 101 when he died.)\n\n“Some of Lear’s questions were too personal, some overly medical,” wrote Cox, Wallace and Ewen in Deadline. “Laverne’s retort, ‘That information is between me and my doctor and my boyfriend,’ would end up in the pilot script. But Norman’s questions were evidence of a mind that had remained open, decades after most people’s have welded shut and whatnot.”\n\nThe article also reminisces on the moment the series was introduced to the world: “It was a fight, but our joyful, aspirational comedy about a trans Black woman returning to South as her true self had gone from just an inkling to a billboard in Midtown,” they wrote. \n\nBut it too soon it disappeared, the the show’s stars writing that they “mourn the characters being scrubbed from storytelling out of fear.” \n\nThey added, “We will push to keep the story alive, for the sake of the kind of people portrayed in it, the kind of people being legislated out of existence, or erased from history books.”\n\nBefore late December, Amazon had a webpage that said it was “working at the U.S. federal and state level on legislation” to protect transgender people. It also noted that the company provided “gender transition benefits based on the Standards of Care published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).” The section with those claims was completely scrapped, though a company spokesperson maintained at the time that the benefit was still available, according to WaPo.\n\nAmazon also changed its “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” page to “Inclusive Experiences and Technology” and cut an entire section saying that the company stood “in solidarity” with Black employees and customers. \n\nAfter killing a WaPo op-ed endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, Bezos also reportedly ordered the paper to rewire its opinion page to solely focus on “personal liberties and free markets.”","summary":"Paras Griffin / Getty ImagesAmazon Prime Video, owned by multibillionaire Jeff Bezos, has canceled Clean Slate, one of the few streaming series led by a trans woman.\n\nThe show premiered on Feb. 6 and ran for only three months until Amazon axed it, reported Deadline.

VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!,' James wrote on social media to his more than 200 million followers on X and Instagram.\n\nJames also posted a video suggesting that President Donald Trump was racist against black people.\n\nThe Harris campaign disclosure revealed that her campaign paid James' production company, SpringHill Entertainment for 'campaign event production, according to the Washington Free Beacon, who first reported the details of the payment.\n\nJames never campaigned for Harris, but his production company worked with Harris to produce the ad, titled Hate Takes US Back. \n\n'We are thrilled to have collaborated on producing this ad for LeBron James as he officially endorses Kamala Harris,' the company wrote in a social media post at the time. \n\nThe payment was not officially made until January 28, 2025, days after Trump was inaugurated, and finally disclosed months later.\n\n The payment to James is one more example of how the Harris campaign helped shift funds toward celebrities as they agreed to endorse the vice president.\n\nThe campaign paid $165,000 to Beyoncé's team for a 4 minute campaign rally speech in Houston Texas and $58,867 to Cardi B's company Washpoppin INC. for 'campaign event production' according to the Free Beacon. \n\nCardi B famously claimed she 'didn't get paid a dollar' after she was accused on social media of getting paid by the campaign to endorse Harris.\n\n'I actually came out of pocket for glam and travel because it's somewhere I wanted to be,' she said.\n\nThe Harris campaign payment to Cardi B's company occurred after the election.\n\nOther payments revealed the Harris campaign paid $132,753 to Mermaid Touring, the company of pop idol Lady Gaga, $132,335 to August 8, Inc., the company owned by Gracie Abrams, and $98,000 to TGK Touring, the company of R&B singer Khalid.\n\nThe most eye-popping payment form the Harris campaign check to Oprah's production company for $1 million.\n\nThe campaign also paid $500,000 to Al Sharpton's non profit before appearing in an interview with the MSNBC anchor and $100,000 to an Obama linked company for campaign appearances.\n\nAdrienne Elrod, who served as a senior spokesperson for the campaign, told Deadline they do not pay celebrities.\n\nDespite accusations and rumors of celebrities getting checks from the campaign, the Harris campaign insisted they were not paying anyone for their endorsements or campaign activity.\n\n'We have never paid any artist and performer.

He's a Trump hater.

Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Abrego Garcia at a table with what appear to be margaritas, was posted by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele after his government finally allowed the lawmaker to meet with the man who was accidentally deported there last month. \n\n'Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the 'death camps' & 'torture', now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!' Bukele captioned the images posted to X on Thursday. \n\nBut Van Hollen sought to set the record straight after returning to the U.S. on Friday, telling a throng of reporters at a Virginia airport after returning from his trip that the drinks were set out by the country's president. \n\n'So here's what happened, when I first sat down with Kilmar, we just had glasses of water, maybe some coffee, and as we were talking one of the government people came over and deposited two other glasses on the table with ice and I don't know if it was salt or sugar around the top, but they look like margaritas,' Van Hollen said.\n\n'And if you look at the one they put in front of Kilmar, it actually had a little less liquid than the one in me in front of me to try to make it look, I assumed, like he drank out of it.'\n\n'Let me just be very clear, neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us, and if you want to play a little Sherlock Holmes, I'll tell you how you can know that,' the senator explained. \n\nHe claimed that because of the salt (or sugar) covered rims, he could prove that neither he nor Kilmar imbibed during the welfare check Van Hollen had been demanding for days whilst on a highly-publicized trip to advocate for Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \n\nPictured: Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen sits with deported illegal migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia with drinks that some claimed were margaritas. This image was posted by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, whose workers brought out the drinks for the alleged MS-13 member and Democrat \n\nVan Hollen, however, does not have any margaritas in the picture his team posted online. He claims the country's president set him up with the drinks that neither he nor Kilmar tried \n\nVan Hollen addressing the press after returning to the U.S. on Friday \n\n'If you sip out of one of those glasses, some of whatever was salt or sugar would disappear,' the Democrat told the press. 'You would see a gap. There's no gap.'\n\nSomeone in the crowd immediately blurted out 'There's no gap!' \n\nThe lawmaker also addressed the more serious issue of being set up by Bukele.\n\n'Nobody drank any margaritas or sugar water or whatever it is. But this is a lesson. It's the lengths that President Bukele will do to deceive people about what's going on, and it's also shows the lengths that the Trump administration and the President will go to,' the Democrat charged. \n\nVan Hollen caught a lot of flak online over the image as users tore into him for flying to another country to advocate for a non-citizen and alleged MS-13 member while citizens in Maryland have been targeted by migrants. \n\nThe Democrat senator who traveled to El Salvador to meet with a deported illegal migrant and alleged MS-13 member was seen drinking what appeared to be margaritas, infuriating many online.\n\nPopular Trump-aligned accounts on X, including Libs of TikTok, slammed Van Hollen for his cozy chat with deported thug.\n\nOne person pointed out that in Van Hollen's official post on X, he didn't include the picture showing the margarita glasses. \n\nAnother responded directly to the senator's post and said, 'Hey Chris!! This is the real picture. How were those margaritas??? President Bukele posted this one. No hiding the truth from America.'\n\nA third wrote: 'Senator Chris Van Hollen and Kilmar Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with salted rims…Thirsty Thursday in El Salvador.' \n\nEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who met with President Donald Trump this week, shared the photo of the supposedly alcoholic drinks\n\nVan Hollen has not responded to the social media outrage yet, but in his post about the meeting, he said he called Abrego Garcia's wife 'to pass along his message of love.' \n\nThe lawmaker did not provide an update on the status of Abrego Garcia, whose attorneys are fighting to force the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.\n\nA spokesman for the Trump administration remained on message, claiming Van Hollen was worried more about a 'terrorist' illegal migrant than his own constituents.\n\n'Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist. It is truly disgusting. President Trump will continue to stand on the side of law-abiding Americans,' Kush Desai told DailyMail.com.\n\nBukele's post on X ended with emojis of the U.S. and El Salvador flags, with a handshake emoji between them. A spokeswoman for El Salvador´s presidency said she had no further information. \n\nThe meeting came hours after Van Hollen said he was denied entry into an high-security El Salvador prison Thursday while he was trying to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being and push for his release.\n\nThe Democratic senator said at a news conference in San Salvador that his car was stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about two miles from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, even as they let other cars go on.\n\n'They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,' Van Hollen said. \n\nAbrego Garcia was sent to an El Salvador prison by the Trump administration in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation\n\nVan Hollen did not provide an update on the status of Abrego Garcia (pictured), whose attorneys are fighting to force the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US\n\nAbrego Garcia entered the US illegally in 2011. A judge blocked his return to El Salvador in 2019, citing the fact that gangsters were after him, but said he could be deported elsewhere. \n\nIn court filings this week, the Trump administration said he was deported to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court has since ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US. \n\nLate Thursday, a three-judge panel from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to suspend a judge's decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials to determine if they complied with the court's instruction to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. \n\nThe Trump administration´s claims that it can't do anything to free Garcia from an El Salvador prison or return him to the US 'should be shocking to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,' the court said Thursday in a blistering order that ratchets up the escalating conflict between the government's executive and judicial branches. \n\nJudge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, said: 'It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all.' \n\nHe added that he and his two colleagues 'cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.'\n\nTrump officials insist Garcia is not an innocent American, as claimed. They say he's an MS-13 gangster who deserves to be sent back to El Salvador. \n\nAdditionally, a 2021 petition for protection from domestic violence filled out by Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, which was obtained first by DailyMail.com, states that the alleged MS-13 member beat his wife multiple times over the years. \n\nVan Hollen posted a photo of the meeting on X, saying he also called Abrego Garcia's wife 'to pass along his message of love'\n\nShe told The Post she was 'acting out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar … in case things escalated' after being abused 'in a previous relationship.'\n\n'Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling,' she added.\n\n'Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect.'\n\nDemocrats, furious about his deportation, are up in arms, with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen traveling in an attempt to get answers. \n\nDetermined to save Garcia, he flew to El Salvador in an effort to get him out of jail and back in America. \n\nBut when he showed up asking for a meeting, he was denied. \n\nHe is now being mocked by Republicans and Conservative Americans, including the mother of a woman who was murdered by an illegal migrant. \n\n'Senator Van Hollen has done more to bring a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker and illegal alien back to Maryland than he has to help keep his American constituents safe or advocate for the victims of these vicious gangs like MS-13. \n\n'While Senator Van Hollen and the mainstream media peddle a sob story about a brutal MS-13 gang member, Secretary Noem stands with the victims of illegal alien crime, like Maryland mom Rachel Morin. \n\nA2021 petition for protection from domestic violence filled out by Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez (pictured), which was obtained first by DailyMail.com, states that the alleged MS-13 member beat his wife multiple times over the years\n\n'We hear far too much about the gang members and criminals sob stories and not enough about their victims,' the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on X. \n\nThe efforts by Van Hollen have also been criticized by Morin's mother Patty who spoke about the lack of any correspondence from state officials when her daughter was murdered. \n\nSpeaking on Fox News with anchor Sean Hannity, she said: 'I'm very angry, I'm outraged. I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time.\n\n'He did not call our family, he did not give condolences. There was no action [from] the Democratic party in anyway. \n\n'From Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, anyone here in Maryland, none of the Senators did anything to help search for the murderer of my daughter.'\n\nRachel Morin's illegal immigrant killer Victor Martinez-Hernandez was found guilty of first degree murder, first degree rape and kidnapping on Monday - and is now awaiting sentencing. \n\nAbrego Garcia, who is a legal resident, arrived at the notorious supermax prison CECOT in El Salvador March 15 on one of three planes from the US.\n\nHe first entered the U.S. in 2011 but was granted permission to stay by a judge in 2019. He later settled down in Maryland and has an American wife and son.\n\nAbrego Garcia (pictured), who is a legal resident, arrived at the notorious supermax prison CECOT in El Salvador March 15 on one of three planes from the US\n\nDemocratic Senator from Maryland Chris Van Hollen speaks to the press in Antiguo Cuscatlan, El Salvador. Van Hollen arrived in El Salvador to request the release of Abrego Garcia \n\nThe Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia on March 15 after files indicated that he had connections with MS-13, a vicious Salvadorian-American gang.\n\nHis wife and lawyer deny his gang affiliation and have sued the administration for improperly removing him from the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration initially said his removal was a mistake. The Supreme Court then ordered the facilitation of his return. \n\nBut the Trump administration is standing firm. \n\nIn the Oval Office on Monday, Trump and Bukele led a united defense of their actions in the case of Abrego Garcia.\n\nBukele argued he couldn't return, saying: 'How can I return him to the United States?\n\n'I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it.\n\n'The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't have the power to return him to the United States.'\n\nTrump supported Bukele's claim and went further, lobbying the El Salvadorian leader to take more migrants and build more prisons hold them.\n\n'I just asked the president, you know, it's this massive complex that he built, a jail complex. I said, 'Can you build some more of them, please?'' Trump said.\n\nMarylandDonald TrumpPolitics\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDemocrat Chris Van Hollen claims he was given 'fake margaritas' by El Salvador's President Bukele\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Democrat senator who traveled to El Salvador to meet with deported migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia swears that he was set up by the nation's president for an unfortunate photo-op.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14626715/Democrat-Chris-Van-Hollen-ridiculed-hilarious-reason-didnt-drink-fake-margaritas-El-Salvador-alleged-MS-13-gangster.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/18/05/97416219-0-image-a-18_1744949478317.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/16/1734277532721528733/1024x576_MP4_1734277532721528733.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-18 22:14:16","author":"Editor,James Cirrone,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":312619782,"title":"Bethenny Frankel is the latest Hollywood star to flee liberal state and move to Florida","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Apr 19th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe local delicacy being blamed for a TENTH of this village's population getting motor neurone disease\n\nConvert or get hurt: How Islamist gangs are terrorising staff in high-security prisons and forcing non-Muslim inmates to join their ranks for 'protection' as the authorities lose control\n\nBeyonce's birth certificate reveals a shocking revelation that has fans in a frenzy\n\nThe truth about Brooklyn Beckham's growing rift with his family - and why it could 'destroy' his dad's 50th birthday party: Friends tell me how David is 'desperate' to celebrate with his kids - but is in the dark about his eldest's plans\n\nWhat REALLY happens when you die?

As she heads to Mexico City to kick off a world tour on Wednesday, the pop superstar shows no intention of slowing down.\n\n“I’m always open and I say, ‘Why not?’ and ‘Let’s just try,’” she told The Associated Press recently at her Southern California rehearsal space. “The power of your thoughts are so incredible because everything starts with a thought. I had this thought, ‘I want to go on tour.’ And here we are.”\n\nWith that openness to try comes accepting that not every endeavor will be a victory. Her September album, “143,” was critically panned, and she was simultaneously criticized for reuniting with embattled producer Dr. Luke. Celebrities like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowski critiqued the spaceflight’s use of resources as superfluous and indulgent. And Harris ultimately lost the November election to President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Perry’s longevity and the scale of her fame since her 2008 breakout hit, “I Kissed a Girl,” are attributable at least in part to her willingness to get back up in the wake of a setback, as she belts in her 2013 empowerment anthem, “Roar.” \n\n“I can control what I can control,” she said.\n\nThat mantra has been refined over the past 15 years through her practice of Transcendental Meditation. The meditation technique has been embraced by a handful of celebrities, including — perhaps most zealously — the late David Lynch, whom Perry credits with spreading the practice and its message.\n\n“That changed my life. And I’ve gone on a long inner space journey to untangle some wires, to answer some questions, to become more grounded, to find the power within myself,” she said.\n\nPerry is fascinated by all things spiritual, casually weaving into conversation references to astrology, the enneagram and cardology, which purports to impart mystical insights into an individual’s personality through playing cards. Perry also credits having her daughter, Daisy, with propelling her along a journey of self-discovery and enhancing her “feminine divine.”\n\n“Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she said. “I think I’ve just grown into the strong woman that I’ve always dreamed of and idolized.”\n\nThat journey has informed her approach to music and performing, down to the narrative of her sci-fi themed “Lifetimes Tour.” Citing films like “Blade Runner” and “The Fifth Element” as visual and thematic inspirations, Perry will play a video game character who faces off against evil forces.\n\n“It’s really about believing in yourself and leading with love. Those are always my messages, no matter how I wrap it or whatever tour I bring. It’s love and empowerment,” she said. “When I can lead by example, it just ripples.”\n\nPerry’s tour of more than 80 performances will primarily be a career-spanning showcase of past hits, but with a dance-infused flare to some of the traditional pop songs. “I tell everybody they have to wear some sensible shoes,” she explained.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since Perry emerged as a pop star, she has made tongue in cheek lyricism — in line with her “very sarcastic” sense of humor — and catchy messages of empowerment a signature of her songs. Critical reception to her more recent albums has been less than enthusiastic, but that hasn't stopped the 40-year-old from going all out for this tour, calling it “Disneyland on wheels.”\n\n“I feel a responsibility to my audience who have really been with me on this ride during this whole lifetime to give them that feeling that they had when they first heard 'Teenage Dream,'\" she said.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

I don’t want to hear him giving speeches right now. I’m sorry, I know that’s s—-y. I know that’s petty. He doesn’t owe me anything. My opinion doesn’t matter here. \n\n“I don’t want to hear — I’m very mad at Joe Biden,” Vietor said, reacting to the former president’s speech. “So I’ve been reading Jake Tapper’s book about the Biden administration and the steps taken to kind of hide his decline. I can’t get into the details, it’s still embargoed, but it is enraging.”\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper is promoting his upcoming book, “Original Sin,” investigating Biden’s mental decline and its cover-up by members of the Democratic Party that wound up changing the course of the 2024 election.\n\nCohen touted numerous legislative accomplishments of Biden’s presidency, but ultimately agreed he is not the right man for the moment.\n\n“We have a gerontocracy problem in our party,” Cohen said. “And so the reality is that the last thing we should be doing right now is giving the biggest platforms to the people who really are holding back the party more broadly in a moment where we are desperate for and desperately need generational change.”\n\nVietor agreed on the need for generational change, arguing the party needs to look “forward, not backwards.”\n\n“We don’t want to talk about his administration right now,” he said. “People are pissed, they’re mad about inflation. Democrats are mad at the administration for how it went for Kamala Harris. I get that he’s giving speeches, it’s probably paying the bills, but I don’t wanna hear them.”","summary":"'I'm very mad at Joe Biden,' Tommy Vietor says.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/18/media/ex-obama-aide-doesnt-want-to-hear-from-biden-right-now-as-enraging-new-details-about-cover-up-emerge/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/102936744.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EzAIH2zL-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-18 21:02:52","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":312567490,"title":"Steve Kerr dons Harvard shirt in response to Trump's federal funding freeze: 'Stand up to the bully'","text":"The Trump administration announced Monday it would be freezing $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts for Harvard University after university President Alan M.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will be the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n“She was going to be my first pick, and I can’t conceal that now, right?” Silver told former FiveThirtyEight podcast host Galen Druke in a video posted on Silver’s Substack newsletter “Silver Bulletin” on Wednesday.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of points in her favor at this very moment,” Druke pointed out, referencing the amount of support the young congresswoman has garnered within her own party.\n\n“In a Yale poll just out this week, AOC has the highest net favorability rating of any of the Democrats that they asked about,” Druke said.\n\nThe same poll Druke referenced also shows Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Kamala Harris as highly favored among Democrats.\n\nDruke went on to say that the Democratic primaries will “be a contest for attention,” which Ocasio-Cortez has largely amassed in recent months through her criticism of Elon Musk and President Donald Trump’s agendas.\n\n“The media is kind of obsessed with her, and they’re going to follow her every move, which means she’ll be able to keep the attention on her throughout the primary process,” he said.\n\nSilver agreed with Druke, citing several of Ocasio-Cortez’s advantages over her theoretical opponents, such as her polling numbers, progressive stance, age and understanding of media.

Numerous faith-based organizations warn that not bringing back the long-running process could \"indefinitely\" hurt individuals attempting to reunite with loved ones.Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.Why It MattersThe executive order \"Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP)\" was signed on January 20, just after Trump was inaugurated. It went into effect just after midnight on January 27, suspending the program for 90 days to allow U.S. officials to determine \"whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the USRAP would be in the interests of the United States.\"That 90-day deadline is set to expire on Easter Sunday. Trump administration officials are claimed to have not made any contact with Christian groups in favor of rescinding the order.What To KnowIn 2024, the majority of the 100,034 refugees who resettled to the U.S. were Christians, and 29,493 Christians among them came from 50 countries where Christians face the most severe persecution, according to church watchdog Open Doors US.The Trump administration tied USRAP to the U.S. being \"inundated with record levels of migration\" over the past four years, specifically mentioning \"significant influxes of migrants\" in cities including Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio—the latter of which drew widespread attention during the 2024 presidential race when Trump, during a debate against former Vice President Kamala Harris, falsely claimed that migrants were eating dogs and cats.In his first week in office during his first term as president, Trump set the maximum number of refugees to be admitted at 50,000.On Thursday, the Christian organization World Relief rereleased a statement urging the Trump administration to reconsider its motives and restart the resettlement process.Even with the suspension, they say that churches, individual Christians, and other supporters have contributed more than $10 million to World Relief in the past three months \"in response to gaps created by the administration's abrupt termination of pre-committed funds for already-resettled refugees and vulnerable people elsewhere around the globe.\"A spokesperson for the organization told Newsweek that as of Thursday, more than 20,000 Christians from all 50 states had signed onto the statement. They include local pastors, denominational leaders, influential authors and podcasters, leaders of prominent national and state-based Christian advocacy organizations, and advocates for persecuted Christians globally.\"In terms of what's next for refugee resettlement, if resettlement is not resumed, it will mean refugees who were scheduled to be resettled in late January or early February— including many who have U.S.-based family who was desperate to be reunited to them—will have their hopes deferred even further, potentially indefinitely,\" Matthew Soerens, vice president of advocacy and policy at the Christian organization World Relief, told Newsweek.He added: \"For many, that means being stuck in a refugee camp where they'd already lived for years or even decades, usually denied the legal authority to work and support themselves, and at a time when reductions to U.S. funding are also restricting access to support for food and other basic necessities for many refugees in camp settings globally.\"A decision of the U.S. to halt all resettlement could lead some host countries to decide to deport certain people who no longer have any likelihood of being resettled back to danger, Soerens added. That includes Afghans in Pakistan, such as those who will face persecution by the Taliban because of their Christian faith or because of their service to the U.S. military.World Relief and partner groups also argue that the longstanding U.S. refugee resettlement program aligns with the Trump administration's goals of securing borders through lawful means of legal immigration.Efforts by World Relief to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, and White House Faith Office Director Jennifer Korn have all been ignored, a spokesperson told Newsweek.It's not just resettlement that has halted. A private sponsorship program for refugee resettlement called Welcome Corps, which included private groups subsidizing resettlement costs instead of taxpayers, was suspended. Officials say that persecuted Christians in countries like Iran have been \"in limbo.\"\"Ongoing suspension of refugee resettlement will also mean that local churches who have been engaged in refugee ministry for many years as a tangible expression of their Christian faith will be denied the opportunity to welcome newly arriving refugees, including those who have raised funds to cover the costs of resettlement through the Welcome Corps private sponsorship process,\" Soerens said.\"Of course, we can and will continue to care for the refugees already present within our communities, but many churches have provided the most intensive support to refugees within their first several months after arrival, when they need the most support, and those opportunities are now suspended.\"What People Are SayingNational Association of Evangelicals President Walter Kim: \"President Trump can lead the nation in rescuing persecuted Christians, as well as believers of other faiths, by restoring and strengthening the U.S. refugee resettlement program. As the son of a refugee from North Korea, I am alive today because my father was given refuge in South Korea and immigrated to the United States.\"Katie Frugé, executive director of the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission: \"America's longstanding commitment to religious freedom at home and abroad has made it a beacon of hope for persecuted Christians around the globe. I pray that our nation will continue to rise as a protector of those tormented by religious persecution, upholding our great tradition of compassion and strength.\"Christian author Jen Pollock Michel: \"Refugee resettlement is not only a Christian priority, given our biblical commitment to protect the most globally vulnerable. It's something the majority of Americans support. I urge President Trump to re-establish a humanitarian program that has historically brought hope to the persecuted and war-torn of the world.\"Doug Sauder, lead pastor of Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale: \"The Christian church has a great tradition of caring for refugees. This tradition comes from a clear mandate in Scripture that we care for the widow, the orphan and the refugee. In every society through the last 2,000 years, Christians have advocated for the care of these vulnerable people groups, and the refugee resettlement program and the work of World Relief should continue its good work as we resettle persecuted Christians and those who have helped our nation at a great cost to themselves.\"What Happens NextThe Sunday deadline could impact countless refugees who had anticipated coming to the U.S. earlier this year. It remains unclear whether the Trump administration will waver on the executive order.","summary":"More than 20,000 Christians signed a petition urging Trump to reconsider an executive order signed on his first day in office.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/christians-refugees-trump-petition-resettlement-immigration-2061608","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2629885/refugees.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 20:15:36","author":"Nick Mordowanec","authors":["Nick Mordowanec"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":312560168,"title":"Anti-Trump Podcaster Calls Joe Rogan ‘Jerk’ Who ‘Spreads Lies’","text":"Ben Meiselas flamed rival podcaster Joe Rogan during a discussion about whether Kamala Harris should have appeared on Rogan’s show during the 2024 campaign. \n\n“To me, Rogan’s a jerk and he spreads lies,” Meiselas said on a new episode The People’s Cabinet podcast, slamming the pro-MAGA podcaster. \n\nMeiselas co-hosts the left-leaning MeidasTouch podcast with his brothers Brett and Jordan.

And that's not right.'","text":"Lisa Murkowski, Alaska's longtime U.S. senator, was home from Washington this week, touching base. As part of her rounds, the Republican lawmaker appeared in Anchorage before an annual meeting of tribal leaders and nonprofit executives. Inevitably, the discussion turned to the wrecking-ball presidency of Donald Trump and his autocratic and, frankly, un-American penchant for siccing the government on his political foes. Asked what she had to say to those living in fear, or who represent constituents afraid of today's McCarthyesque climate, Murkowski responded with honesty and bracing candor. \"We are all afraid,\" she said. She then paused five long seconds, her face a rictus of wonderment and concern, allowing the observation and admission — from a sitting member of the United States Senate, no less — to sink in. “It’s quite a statement,\" Murkowski went on. Another brief pause, then several starts and stops. \"But we're in a time and a place where ... I've not been here before,\" she said. \"And I’ll tell you, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that’s not right.” It's a fine pass we've come to when simply speaking the truth and stating the obvious are considered newsworthy, much less an act of courage. But here we are, folks. America, 2025. If you wish to be cynical, there are reasons why Murkowski — whose comments Monday quickly ricocheted across the country — may be more prepared to speak out against Trump than her timorous Republican peers. Trump easily carried Alaska all three times he ran for president. But his showing — the 54% of the vote he received in November was a high mark — is a shadow of his blowout victories elsewhere. Trump won Wyoming with 70% of the vote, West Virginia with 68% and Oklahoma and North Dakota with 65% support. His executive order changing the name of North America’s tallest peak, Denali, back to Mt. McKinley has landed among Alaskans with a decided thud. A survey of adult residents found they opposed the switch by more than 2 to 1. In other words, the Last Frontier is not exactly head over heels for Trump. Besides, Murkowski won't face reelection — should she decide to run for a fifth term — until 2028, when Trump's time in office will finally, mercifully be winding down. Those factors, however, don't take away from the starch in the senator's spine or her willingness to stand up while so many others in her party cower in submission. Give Murkowski her due: She doesn't shrink from a fight. In 2010, she notched a rare write-in victory after losing the GOP nomination to a right-wing \"tea party\" Republican. In 2021, Murkowski was one of just seven Republican senators — and the only one to face constituents in the next election cycle — to vote to convict Trump in an impeachment trial for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Her act drew a censure from state GOP leaders and the petulance you would expect from Trump, who urged some Republican, any Republican — “If you have a pulse, I’m with you!” — to challenge Murkowski's reelection. When Kelly Tshibaka, a 2020 election denier, stepped forward, Trump appeared at an Anchorage rally to lend his support. Murkowski won anyway. She may be the state's most popular living politician, said Amy Lovecraft, a political science professor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. \"She knows the state,\" Lovecraft said. \"She gets stuff done. She's a doer.\" She's also outspokenly independent, a rare commodity in today's increasing cult-like GOP. In fact, the whole notion of checks and balances — a foundational principle of American democracy — has gone out the window, Murkowski suggested in Anchorage. \"Right now, we are not balancing as the Congress,\" she said, expressing concern, as well, over Trump's attempted undermining of the judiciary. Murkowski has taken on Trump more than once. She refused to vote for him in 2024 — she didn't support Kamala Harris, either — and was one of the few Republicans in office to publicly condemn Trump's shameful pardon of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists. She opposed Pete Hegseth's risible nomination as Defense secretary and voted to undo Trump's heedless tariffs on Canada. She's also expressed concerns about Elon Musk's wanton assault on federal employees. \"Things are happening so fast through this Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE\" — the fictive name of Musk's made-up agency — \"None of us understand the half of it. It’s literally piecing it together,” Murkowski told those gathered in Anchorage. Speaking on Monday to the Alaska Daily News, Muskowski recounted numerous conversations with some of those summarily fired in Musk's precipitous purge. Many were in tears. \"They thought that they were in a profession they've given so much to and thought that they were doing well,\" Murkowski said. \"And literally, with no notice whatsoever, [they were] terminated and told that their work performance was not satisfactory, which was not true. \"These are real emotions. These are real people,\" she said. \"These are real fears and they need to be heard.\" Indeed. Sadly, for now, Murkowski is one of vanishingly few Republican politicians with the guts to speak up against the party's rogue president — a brave, but lone, voice in the wilderness.","summary":"Sen.

Someone needs to get him a cute little lorazepam rx and a high grade ashwaganda supplement because it can’t happen like this.”\n\n There’s been plenty of debate on Trump’s policies when it comes to the economy and his negotiations with countries such China and Canada, which have led to a minimum 10% tariff for all nations. According to the White House’s website in a post dated April 15, “China faces up to a 245% tariff on imports to the United States as a result of its retaliatory actions.”\n\n Banks also showed support for China in her X messages: “Nobody on earth is afraid of crazy old white man anger.

However, she’s been anti-Elon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency, and says the Tesla CEO “belongs nowhere near American Politics.”\n\n Musk’s involvement with the twice-impeached president led to her giving an 11th-hour endorsement to Kamala Harris.
