The agency, he wrote in the chapter’s first words, “should promote freedom of speech.”\n\nSince entering the role, Carr has embraced Trump’s campaign against broadcasters who air critical coverage of his administration, investigated major networks for their diversity policies, and paved the way for ABC to remove comedian and Trump critic Jimmy Kimmel from his long-running late-night show in an apparent act of retaliation.\n\nCarr now appears to be taking a victory lap, posting juvenile memes in response to questions from journalists about the comedian’s suspension.\n\n“Jimmy Kimmel is the latest target of the Trump administration’s unconstitutional plan to silence its critics and control what the American people watch and read,” according to Christopher Anders, director of the democracy and technology division at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n“This is beyond McCarthyism,” he said. “Trump officials are repeatedly abusing their power to stop ideas they don’t like, deciding who can speak, write, and even joke. The Trump administration's actions, paired with ABC's capitulation, represent a grave threat to our First Amendment freedoms.”\n\nThroughout his 2024 campaign, Trump launched several lawsuits and legal threats against news organizations seeking billions of dollars in damages, commanded Republicans in Congress to vote against legislation that would protect journalists’ sources, and took advice from wealthy allies and right-wing groups who sought to block publicly funded media from getting a single public dollar.\n\nHe sued ABC News host George Stephanopoulos for making what he called “patently and demonstrably false” statements that he was found liable for rape in E Jean Carroll’s defamation trial. Days before Election Day, he sued CBS News for $10 billion, alleging that the network deceptively edited an interview with his rival Kamala Harris to unlawfully influence the election.\n\nCarr, meanwhile, was signaling his alignment with Trump’s incoming agenda in right-wing media, amplifying conservative grievances and allegations that Democratic officials conspired with mainstream media outlets to suppress them.\n\nAfter entering the role in January, Carr revived federal complaints against ABC, CBS and NBC that accused the broadcasters of political biases.\n\nCarr has also launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion programs at communications companies, and publicly stated that major merger approvals will be conditioned on the president’s anti-DEI agenda.\n\nHe also appeared to shape the merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global, the parent company for CBS, which had settled Trump’s lawsuit for $16 million. Weeks after the settlement was approved, Carr approved the merger.\n\nLast year, Carr wrote on X that “the First Amendment prohibits government officials from coercing private parties into suppressing protected speech.”\n\nA unanimous ruling from the Supreme Court last year also flatly stated that “government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.”\n\nThis week, Carr came for Kimmel.\n\nIn an opening monologue this week, Kimmel addressed the waves of speculation and misinformation surrounding the killing of Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist who was fatally shot at a college campus speaking event September 10.\n\n“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.\n\nOn a podcast with right-wing influencer Benny Johnson Wednesday, Carr called Kimmel a “very, very serious issue right now for Disney,” ABC’s parent company.\n\n“It’s time for them to step and say this garbage … isn’t something that we think serves the needs of our local communities,” he said.\n\nThe FCC is tasked with licensing TV and radio stations and ensuring that they’re operating in the “public interest” when broadcasting over public airwaves. It cannot wholly ban a news network for content its commissioners don’t like; the agency legally cannot invoke the “the power of censorship” to interfere “with the right of free speech.” \n\nIn 2019, Carr said the FCC does not have a “roving mandate to police speech in the name of ‘public interest.’” Carr is now arguing the agency can do just that.\n\nTwo days after Kimmel’s comments, Nexstar — the largest owner of local stations in the country — decided Kimmel’s monologue was so “offensive and insensitive” that broadcasters shouldn’t air him.\n\nThe company is also trying to purchase a major rival for $6.2 billion — which would require the FCC’s approval\n\nNexstar’s ABC affiliate stations cover nearly 40 percent of the national market. Shortly after Nexstar announced its stations would pull Kimmel’s show off the air, ABC/Disney announced that Kimmel would be suspended indefinitely.\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group, the largest of ABC’s affiliate groups, also objected to Kimmel’s statements, called on the comedian to apologize to Kirk’s family, and for ABC to make a “meaningful donation” to Kirk’s Turning Point USA.\n\nOn his Truth Social, the president called Kimmel’s suspension “great news,” and suggested NBC’s late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers were next.\n\nIn a news conference in England, Trump directly linked Carr to the president’s threats to TV licenses over coverage he doesn’t like.\n\n“I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr,” Trump said. “I think Brendan Carr is outstanding. He’s a patriot. He loves our country, and he’s a tough guy.”\n\nPodcast Benny Johnson also took credit.\n\n“This is what got Kimmel fired,” Johnson said about his podcast. “Right here.”\n\nDemocratic officials and advocacy groups have demanded Carr’s resignation and plan to open investigations into whether Trump directly intervened or colluded with companies to target constitutionally protected speech.\n\n“This administration’s pursuit of an autocratic state is continuing to intensify at an alarming pace,” said Democracy Forward president Skye Perryman, whose organization is seeking communications from the government to know whether the administration had pressured media companies to stifle dissent.\n\n“The public has the right to know whether senior FCC officials are engaging in conversations with outside parties that could lead to restrictions on speech and undermine freedom of expression,” she said.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Carr said it would be “worthwhile” for his agency to “look into” ABC’s The View and other programs, citing potential violations of “equal time” or “equal opportunity” rules for broadcasters — none of which would apply to comedians.\n\n“We’re in the midst of a massive shift in dynamics in the media ecosystem for lots of reasons, again, including the permission structure that President Trump’s election has provided,” Carr said in a separate interview with CNBC.\n\n“And I would simply say we’re not done yet with seeing the consequences of that shift.”","summary":"Project 2025 co-author pledged to ‘restore’ free speech before targeting broadcasters in Trump’s sights","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/brendan-carr-fcc-trump-jimmy-kimmel-b2829430.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/18/20/43/FILE-PHOTO-FCC-commissioners-testify-before-U-S--Congress-in-Washington-go4s4lnz.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/J92FMPo2-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-18 22:09:14","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":361665120,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel's suspension fits squarely into the FCC's new pressure playbook","text":"Brendan Carr didn't order ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, but the Federal Communications Commission chair got the outcome he wanted.Kimmel, a late-night host who's long criticized and mocked President Donald Trump, had his namesake show on ABC suspended \"indefinitely\" after his comments about Charlie Kirk, the right-wing influencer who was killed in public last week.Carr, a Trump appointee, suggested on a conservative podcast on Wednesday that owners of local broadcast stations that license ABC programming should pressure the network to cancel Kimmel. He said broadcasters who don't act \"in the public interest\" could get their licenses reviewed.Hours after Carr's critique, ABC pulled Kimmel's show after pressure from two major companies — Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair — that own local ABC affiliate stations.An FCC commissioner pressuring local broadcasters to speak up against a network is like \"nothing we've confronted before in our modern day,\" said Al Tompkins, a journalism professor at Syracuse University.While it may be new, it's also part of a pattern of Carr using his power in muscular and novel ways at the helm of the FCC, from threatening to pull broadcast licenses to delaying a deal and investigating DEI practices.Carr's FCC held up Skydance's acquisition of Paramount for months after Trump sued CBS News, a subsidiary of Paramount, claiming that a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris was deceptively edited. Paramount settled for $16 million in July. The FCC approved the deal a few weeks later.Carr's maneuvering has led to some blowback. For example, FCC commissioner Anna Gomez, a Biden appointee, criticized Carr for politicizing the agency in a statement on Thursday.\"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes,\" Gomez said.Carr and his spokesperson didn't respond to requests for comment.Carr's actions show the FCC's particular power over broadcast TV, as opposed to cable and streaming, where it lacks authority.The FCC issues broadcast licenses to stations and can revoke them if they are not operating in the \"public interest.\"Historically, the FCC has usually focused on limiting explicit content like nudity and swearing, Tompkins said. A high-profile example is the FCC fining CBS for broadcasting \"indecency\" after Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl, said G.S. Hans, a clinical professor of law at Cornell Law School.The FCC's public interest language \"isn't super powerful,\" which is why the government usually gets specific with its rebukes, Hans said.Revoking a broadcast license is extraordinarily rare. One of the few successful attempts was when the FCC revoked the licenses for WLBT-TV, a local station in Jackson, Mississippi, that refused to cover the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s. Another attempt was when a Jacksonville TV station owned by the Washington Post came under pressure after reporting a racist comment from a former Supreme Court nominee of President Richard Nixon. The effort went nowhere, and the next year, Nixon resigned.\"Renewal is almost always automatic,\" said Gigi Sohn, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden for FCC commissioner but withdrew after facing political pressure.The mechanics of getting ABC off the air would be tricky, since broadcast licenses belong to local affiliate stations instead of the network itself. That means the FCC would have to revoke licenses from hundreds of stations across the country, which would be time-consuming.Still, Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, said the FCC has other ways of pressuring broadcasters, such as holding hearings or commissioning studies. Carr has also gone down other routes, like investigating ABC owner Disney and NBCUniversal parent Comcast for their DEI practices.And as Paramount learned the hard way, the FCC can stand in the way of mergers.Nexstar is attempting to acquire rival Tegna, and the FCC must approve the deal. The tie-up would likely require a rule change, since TV station owners can't increase ownership to more than 39% of US households. To consummate its deal, Nexstar needs to be in the FCC's good graces.\"They certainly don't want to be crossways with Carr,\" Tompkins said of Nexstar.Beyond concerns about the FCC, companies like Nexstar can also face pushback from red-state viewers over highly politicized late-night shows, Tompkins added.The FCC's \"public interest\" clause has historically been applied very cautiously, said Seth Stern, the director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation.\"The law has never been interpreted to give the FCC this kind of authority over particular programs (or their hosts), and in fact provides just the opposite,\" said Bob Corn-Revere, the chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.That may be beside the point. Even if Carr doesn't actually attempt to revoke licenses, his rhetorical pressure sends a signal.Sohn, who's now a senior fellow at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, said Carr is using his position as a \"bully pulpit.\"\"It doesn't really matter what the exact powers are,\" Poynter's Edmonds said. \"It's a kind of signal, and a threat.\"","summary":"ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel after FCC chair Brendan Carr criticized his remarks on Charlie Kirk.

(Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nTrump made the comment aboard Air Force One, according to multiple reporters, repeating a prior claim that television networks are “97% against [me], they give me only bad publicity or press. I mean, they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away,” according to CBS News White House reporter Kathryn Watson.\n\nThe president did not cite a source for the 97% figure, which he brought up last month when he alleged “ABC & NBC FAKE NEWS, two of the worst and most biased networks in history, give me 97% BAD STORIES.”\n\nTrump then noted decisions around licenses will be up to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who on Wednesday supported decisions from ABC affiliate broadcasters like Nexstar and Sinclair to pull Kimmel’s show.\n\nPrior to ABC’s announcement about Kimmel, Carr appeared on a podcast to threaten to take action against the host, and said broadcasters “have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,” noting, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”\n\nShortly after, Nexstar and then ABC announced their decisions.\n\nIt is not possible for Carr to remove licenses from news networks like ABC, as they are not licensed by the FCC, which instead provides licenses to broadcast stations like Nexstar that may own affiliated stations from networks like CBS, Fox and ABC.\n\nDuring the Air Force One flight Thursday, Trump also claimed all evening shows do is “hit Trump,” adding, “They’re licensed. They’re not allowed to do that,” according to CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Trump said without evidence the networks were “untruthful” and suggested that “at a minimum,” they should be forced to “pay up BIG” for using public airwaves, indicating such a fee could cost millions of dollars a year.\n\nTrump’s comments come shortly after Kimmel’s removal from ABC, which said his show would be “pre-empted indefinitely” without providing a reason for the decision. Nexstar and Sinclair, which respectively own dozens of ABC affiliate stations, separately said they would stop broadcasting the host’s show. Nexstar pointed to a monologue Kimmel gave this week in which he said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” Kimmel did not endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, but has long been critical of Trump, telling viewers on election day, “It was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him. And guess what? It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him too. You just don’t realize it yet.”\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nBroadcasters that own ABC affiliates have not indicated they intend to bring Kimmel back on the air yet. However, Sinclair has called for a direct apology from the host to Kirk’s family in addition to a “meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA,” the conservative nonprofit formerly led by Kirk. Meanwhile, keeping Kimmel off the air could keep Nexstar in the Trump administration’s good graces as the firm looks to acquire broadcast company TEGNA for $6.2 billion. The FCC will need to raise its 40% broadcast ownership cap for the deal to advance.\n\nKey Background\n\nCarr has worked closely with the president’s agenda. After Nexstar’s announcement, Carr said the decision to remove Kimmel from the air was “an unprecedented decision” and that it is “important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community.” Earlier this year the FCC approved Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount after Skydance vowed to remove diversity, equity and inclusion considerations from its business practices, a commitment lauded by Carr, who said the decision “marks another step forward in the FCC’s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination.” The merger was also approved after CBS, a Paramount subsidiary, settled a $16 million lawsuit levied by Trump alleging a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris was deceptively edited. CBS initially said the lawsuit was “completely without merit.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nABC Pulls Jimmy Kimmel ‘Indefinitely’ After Charlie Kirk Comments: Here’s What He Said (Forbes)\n\nTrump Suggests ABC And NBC Should Lose Broadcast Licenses Over Negative Coverage Of Him (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

Carter: Presidents can’t sue their way out of criticism","text":"There’s a certain irony in the fact that President Donald Trump announced his silly $15 billion defamation suit against The New York Times scant days after a federal appellate court dismissed a similar claim against Fox News. That lawsuit was filed by Nina Jankowicz, the former head of the Biden administration’s short-lived Disinformation Governance Board.\n\nThe lawsuits suffer from a common defect: They seek to turn hyperbolic criticism of a government official into grounds for civil damages. The court was right in tossing Jankowicz’s suit; Trump’s should meet a similar fate — and quickly. It should be exceptionally difficult for those who serve in government to sue their critics; for presidents, it should be hardest of all.\n\nThe Trump lawsuit is leading the news, and it’s easy to see why. He seeks $15 billion in damages for a litany of grievances against the Times, which, in his telling, has been “spreading false and defamatory content” about him, during both his terms and in between. Yet on even a quick reading of the lengthy complaint, nearly everything cited is either fair comment, opinion, or for other reasons not actionable.\n\nTo understand the problem with Trump’s suit, it might be helpful to turn first to last Friday’s opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which affirmed the dismissal of Jankowicz’s claim that she’d been defamed by Fox News. The Disinformation Governance Board — could one imagine a more Orwellian name? — was an advisory committee to the Department of Homeland Security, announced with fanfare in April 2022, and then, in the wake of fierce criticism, was “paused” the following month and dismantled that August.\n\nJankowicz, who headed the board for all of three weeks, was targeted early and often by critics who warned that censorship of American citizens would not be far behind. In her suit, she alleged that Fox News, both while she led the board and after she left, broadcast commentary that defamed her.\n\nThe trial court dismissed Jankowicz’s action, and on appeal the Third Circuit was unsympathetic. The panel noted first that criticism of a government agency isn’t defamatory and explained that to punish a news outlet for its choice to make a particular official the face of that criticism is an “attack on core free expression rights.” In short, much of what Fox News said about Janowicz wasn’t actually about her. The rest, the court wrote, consisted mostly of predictions, speculation, or opinion — or was substantially true. All of those are traditional grounds for rejecting defamation claims. In the case of speech aimed at government officials, they should be interpreted as broadly as possible. To do less is to cast a shadow over the most fundamental right of a free people: the right to criticize those who govern.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump’s lawsuit. The defendants are not just the Times, but also several of its reporters, along with Penguin Random House, publisher of a recent best-selling book by those reporters about Trump and his businesses, based largely on articles published in the Times.\n\nThe complaint, although heavy on words, is light on substance. It begins with 20-odd pages of pointless but quotable commentary — a familiar if unfortunate device these days as lawyers try to get headlines. The next 20-odd pages boast of Trump’s achievements throughout his career. Most of this is in service to a narrative that we might paraphrase this way: The Times so dislikes Trump that it published false statements in an effort to deny him reelection.\n\nClearly, the Times cannot be punished either for disliking him or for trying to defeat him. That leaves only the claim that he was defamed. Because Trump is a public figure — arguably the most public figure in the world — he must show that the alleged falsehoods were published by the Times and Penguin Random House either with knowledge that they were false, or with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nIt’s hard to see how he can do that. Here, as in Janowicz’s complaint, almost everything Trump alleges is either opinion, prediction, or speculation. For example, when the Times and the book questioned Trump’s business acumen, the complaint responded by pointing to investments that turned a tidy profit. But the fact that the purchase of Mar-a-Lago has multiplied its value many times over doesn’t make the opinion “false.”\n\nTo see the court’s logic, imagine that I were to write, “President Trump seems to sue people just to get back at them.” That’s clearly a statement of my opinion, fully protected under the First Amendment. It would not be rendered “false” simply because he won or settled a few lawsuits.\n\nSimilarly, the complaint disputes the reporters’ assertions about how Trump became famous, who was responsible for his success, and whether he paid adequate attention to the financial details of his businesses. (The lawsuit also charges the Times and Penguin with implying that Trump’s father Fred, in preparing to transfer his fortune to his son, jiggered the numbers. Even if this statement were defamatory (and I’m not saying it is), this does not appear to be a statement about his son Donald and therefore is not actionable.) All of these would seem clearly to be statements of speculation or opinion.\n\nAnother example: Trump alleges that the Times editorial board, in endorsing Kamala Harris, “asserted hypocritically and without evidence that President Trump would ‘defy the norms and dismantle the institutions that have made our country strong.’” That sort of allegation, too, arose in Jankowicz’s case, where the complaint argued that Fox News had predicted that she would “surveil” and “censor” Americans. The Third Circuit concluded that “the vast majority” of the statements made about the plaintiff personally were not actionable because they represented “speculation and conjecture about Jankowicz’s motives, goals, and future actions, of which the truth or falsity were not readily verifiable.” When speculation is “laced with hyperbole” — which is essentially what Trump alleges here — the case for dismissal is even stronger.\n\nThe short of it is that government has no business trying to regulate speech about itself — and that includes lawsuits by public officials who dislike what the news media says about them. I’m not saying that anybody needs to grow a thicker skin; rather, public servants must recognize that our ability to say cruel, even nasty things about them is part of what is meant by freedom.\n\nI’m no fan of the mockery and vituperation that so often passes for public dialogue. But I’m even less of a fan of punishing those who engage in it. As the Supreme Court wrote some 84 years ago, “it is a prized American privilege to speak one’s mind, although not always with perfect good taste, on all public institutions.”\n\nAnd, as the courts might now add, about the people who run them.\n\nStephen L.

But President Donald Trump wants to give his party an advantage in the 2026 election in order to keep majority control in the House of Representatives, as midterms tend to favor the party out of power. Republicans in Texas and Missouri have moved to create advantageous new seats while California Democrats have countered with their own new proposal.\n\nIndiana lawmakers however have not yet answered the redistricting call and have kept their cards close, emblematic of the state’s independent streak and its more measured approach to politics.\n\nBut pressure from Trump to redraw House districts has been mounting on Republicans in the state he won by 19 percentage points in 2024. First-term Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, said Tuesday that a legislative session on redistricting probably will happen, and it could come as soon as November. But he doesn’t want to call a special session unless there will be a successful outcome.\n\n“I’ve been very clear. I want it to be organic,” he said in a video reported by WRTV in Indianapolis.\n\nA large crowd gathered inside the statehouse in Indianapolis Thursday afternoon to see Buttigieg speak.\n\n“It’s an issue of fairness,” said Judy Jessup, an Indianapolis resident. “The voters should get to choose politicians, not the other way around.”\n\nButtigieg is the biggest Democratic voice to come out of Indiana in recent memory. Following the 2020 election, Buttigieg and his family moved to Traverse City, Michigan, and he served as Secretary of Transportation under the Biden administration.\n\nIn an excerpt from her upcoming memoir, Kamala Harris said that Buttigieg was her first pick for 2024 running mate, but she said running with Buttigieg, who is openly gay, was too risky. He didn’t address the comments on Thursday.\n\nBraun could call a special session, but it would be up to lawmakers to create a new map. Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers in Indiana, meaning Democrats could not stop or delay a special session by refusing to attend, like their peers in Texas briefly did. Republicans also outnumber Democrats in Indiana’s congressional delegation 7-2. Some Republicans see an opportunity to gain all nine seats in the state.\n\nThe GOP would likely target Indiana’s 1st Congressional District, a Democratic stronghold encompassing Gary and other cities near Chicago. Three-term Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan won reelection in 2022 and easily retained the seat in 2024 even after Republicans redrew the district to be slightly more favorable to the GOP.\n\nRepublicans could also zero in on the 7th Congressional District, composed entirely of Marion County and the Democratic stronghold of Indianapolis, but they would invite more controversy by slicing up Indiana’s largest city and diluting Black voters’ influence.\n\n“Both of those districts are filled with Black voters,” state Sen. Andrea Hunley, who represents Indianapolis, said at the rally. “This is a racist power grab to silence voters who look like me.”\n\nTexas passed a new map that would help Republicans win up to five new seats, and Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, is expected to sign legislation soon that would help Republicans win seven of the state’s eight districts. Meanwhile, California Democrats are launching a campaign to build support ahead of a Nov. 4 referendum on new U.S. House districts that were made to offset wins made by Texas Republicans.\n\nUtah and Ohio may soon have new congressional district maps, and elected leaders in other states also are considering mid-decade redistricting, including Republicans in Florida and Kansas and Democrats in Maryland and New York.\n\nVolmert reported from Lansing, Michigan.","summary":"Indiana Republicans have been hesitant to redistrict so far compared to other states.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/18/pete-buttigieg-redistricting-indiana/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US_Election_2026_Redistricting_Indiana_96445-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 20:03:45","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":361643188,"title":"If You Think Tim Walz Was Bad, Just Look At Kamala’s First Choice","text":"Tim Walz may be the first (presumably) heterosexual DEI pick. \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris had a different “first choice” for running mate, The Atlantic reports: Pete Buttigieg. \n\nHarris decided it would be “too big a risk,” according to the excerpts of Harris’ forthcoming memoir published by The Atlantic. \n\nButtigieg “would have been an ideal partner—if I were a straight white man,” Harris reportedly writes. \n\nWhat’s a (presumably) straight brown woman to do?\n\n“But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a black woman, a black woman married to a jewish man.

If Harris et al. believed the 2024 election was a battle for the soul of the nation, why risk running Harris herself? \n\nNarcissism and self-interest, probably. \n\nBut Harris wasn’t up against “America.” She was up against Americans, who regard Buttigieg with varying approval. \n\nButtigieg is popular with New Hampshire Democrats. Among that cohort, Buttigieg tied with Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom in a hypothetical 2028 presidential primary, according to a Saint Anselm survey conducted in late August. Pollsters surveyed 1,776 New Hampshire registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 2.3 percentage points.\n\nNew Hampshire is overwhelmingly white.\n\nA whopping zero percent of black respondents supported Buttigieg when asked which candidate they’d back for the Democratic Party’s 2028 presidential nomination, according to an Emerson College poll from late June. Pollsters surveyed 1,000 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\n .@DonaldJTrumpJr on Tim Walz: “I’ve never seen a wrist so limp.” pic.twitter.com/zDbxElEomg — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) March 21, 2025\n\nButtigieg has “one big, glaring soft spot … which is his relationship with the Black community,” a veteran Democratic strategist told The Hill in Aug. “He didn’t have a lot of African American fans from his time as mayor, he didn’t have a lot of Black support when he ran for president, and I haven’t seen evidence that he’s done much to fix that over the last few years.”\n\nHarris had her own troubles with black voters.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama wagged his finger at black men in October 2024, telling reporters, “My understanding, based on reports I’m getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as you saw when I was running. Now, I also want to say that it seems more pronounced with the brothers.” (RELATED: ‘So Patronizing’: Dem Strategist Torpedoes Obama Over His Message To Black Men)\n\nPresident Donald Trump doubled his support among black voters between 2020 and 2024, according to Pew Research. Harris won 83% of the black vote. \n\nGranted, 83% is nothing to sneer at.

And President Biden wasn't doing so hot in the polls, and Vice President Kamala Harris wasn't doing so hot in the polls,” he recalls.\n\nBedford explains that Arctic Frost was the latest in a six-year FBI-Democrat campaign — starting with former FBI Director James Comey’s anti-Trump conspiracies and raids, followed by relentless January 6 interrogations targeting GOP operatives’ finances — to dismantle the Republican Party through baseless investigations.\n\nThe FBI and Democrats behind Arctic Frost were desperate to keep their actions hidden, Bedford says, because they knew that Trump, if re-elected, would uncover the \"receipts\" of their misconduct. Stupidly, they banked on him going to prison or never returning to power, but now they’re facing the music. “They are guilty as sin,” says Bedford.\n\nPeterson stresses the need to “clean house.”\n\n“You have tens of thousands of people who have been trained now for a long time such that they think this is a-okay. They were perfectly willing to go along with investigating 92 Republican linked groups…two years after the election to surveil and investigate political opponents of the sitting president,” he says.\n\n“This is not something that's acceptable; it's not something that we can allow to be normalized; and it's something that's going to require deep structural reform and getting tens of thousands people out of there.”\n\nTo hear more of the conversation, watch the episode above.\n\nWant more from 'Blaze News | The Mandate'?\n\nTo enjoy more provocative opinions, expert analysis, and breaking stories you won’t see anywhere else, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.","summary":"Under the Biden administration, the FBI launched a covert operation code-named “Arctic Frost” in 2022 — a sweeping probe that has now been exposed as a blatant weaponization of federal power against conservatives.\n\nThanks to whistleblower disclosures and new Senate releases from Sen.

That’s why Nexstar publicly announced Thursday that its stations would no longer carry the show, telecom insiders tell On The Money. Ditto for ABC, which produces and distributes “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to broadcasters like Nexstar — and likewise has business before the FCC.\n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\nProtesters Gather as Jimmy Kimmel's Show Suspended Over Charlie Kirk Comments\n\nA number of protesters gathered outside Jimmy Kimmel’s Hollywood studio...\n\nBob Iger, the CEO of its parent, Disney, was also quick to suspend the show indefinitely.\nOn Thursday, Sinclair Broadcasting — a rival local TV giant with a conservative bent — upped the ante even further, saying ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel was insufficient and announcing it will yank “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from its stations until the host apologises directly to Kirk’s family and donates to his political activist group.\nThe backdrop to all this is Carr, a longtime telecom lawyer who is the new sheriff of the broadcast industry. Carr has been warning networks large and small that he’s taking one of the most expansionary views of the agency’s regulatory edict to make sure programming is in the “public interest,” First Amendment concerns be damned.\n\nJimmy Kimmel. (Photo by VALERIE MACON / AFP)\nHis impact has been nothing short of dramatic: Paramount settled a suit with President Trump over CBS’s controversial interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, fearing that the FCC wouldn’t approve its $8 billion sale to independent studio Skydance.\nIt also cancelled the late-night show of the money-losing and politically charged comic Steven Colbert.\nOther broadcast networks have been settling various lawsuits with Trump – ABC forking over $16 million to settle a suit with the president over comments made by news host George Stephanopoulos – to stay on Carr’s good side. \n\nSponsored content\n\nUnlike cable, the FCC has the authority to throttle content that airs on “public airwaves” – aka local TV networks – by withholding broadcast licenses. That includes local stations owned by the likes of NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox, as well as those that have agreements to run their programming, like Nexstar.\nIn the past, the FCC has given wide latitude for broadcasters to air anything except obscenity; that’s why people like Steven Colbert, Kimmel and even alleged straight news broadcasts like “60 Minutes” could get away with left-wing commentary despite wide swathes of the country hating those views.\nKimmel’s odd comments on Monday riled Carr not only for mocking conservatives as they mourned Kirk’s assassination, but also seeming to imply a misleading narrative that his assassin was conservative himself: “we hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”Yes that too would have been considered First Amendment protected speech during previous administrations. Carr would argue the constitution’s speech clause isn’t absolute. It only means the government can’t jail Kimmel or Colbert for their opinions.\n\nCEO of Disney Bob Iger. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP)\n“Cleary Nexstar is sucking up to Carr,” one telecom lawyer told me Wednesday just after the show’s cancellation. “Kimmel’s comments are noxious but from a First Amendment standpoint they would have been protected in the past. He’s a comedian, so how is he distorting the news unless you have a deal to be approved by the FCC?”\nEither way, it doesn’t mean that the FCC has to grant you a license when it can make a case – which is what Carr is doing now in the broadcast industry – that one-sided politics is anathema to the public interest.\nAs Carr put it in a Wednesday interview with my Fox colleague Sean Hannity: “running a narrow partisan circus, whatever the public interest means, it’s not that.”\n\nMore Coverage\n‘God help us’: Hollywood elites sook it up\n\nTelling detail in Kimmel’s contract exposed\nJoshua Haigh\nNexstar is particularly vulnerable to Carr’s public interest interpretation given its plans to expand. It is already one of the biggest owners of ABC affiliate stations carrying Kimmel’s show, controlling more than 30 around the country.The deal to buy Tegna announced in August would extend the company’s reach even more. Both companies combined would cover 80% of households, operating 265 stations in 44 states. In some markets the new company will control three or four stations.\nAll of that needs FCC approval.Reps for Nexstar and the FCC didn’t return a request for comment.\nThis appeared in the New York Post and was republished with permission. \n\nMore related stories\n\nWilliam teases King in front of Trump\nThe Prince of Wales had a sly remark to break the ice with the US president and First Lady after officially greeting them in Windsor.\n\n‘I disagree with the PM’: Trump’s cold answer\nDonald Trump may have a good relationship with the UK PM but on one very major issue he couldn’t hide how the pair didn’t see eye to eye.\n\nYou’ll never guess who sat next to Kate\nThe Princess of Wales was paired with a very surprising international figure for this week’s lavish State dinner.\n\nRegistration\n\nIn The Know Quiz\nNewsletters\nCompetitions\n\nWelcome to news.com.au\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nHelp and Support\n\nGeneral Feedback\nAdvertise with us\nStandards of Practice\n\nLicensing & Reprints\n\nOur News Network\n\nThe Daily Telegraph\n\nThe Courier Mail\n\nOur Partners\n\nrealestate.com.au\n\nCODE Sports\n\nA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

D. Vance said as he hosted The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday. This may well be true: Kirk lobbied for Vance to get the vice-presidential nomination. It’s also a reflection of how deeply Donald Trump’s White House is intertwined with a thriving ecosystem of partisan podcasters who amplify his agenda—and help set it.\n\nIn the past decade, American public life has undergone two major transformations: The MAGA movement has swallowed the Republican Party whole. And influencers such as Kirk have elbowed aside traditional media outlets in the quest for attention. Even more important, the boundary between the movement and the influencers is nonexistent: Kirk’s campus-outreach group, Turning Point USA, was ostensibly a grassroots operation, but it was also a mouthpiece for Trumpism. Here’s Kirk talking about his voter-outreach operation during last year’s presidential race: “We’re working directly in harmony with the Trump campaign,” he announced in an archive clip aired at the start of Vance’s tribute show. “It’s been vetted, it’s been cleared, it’s been blessed,” he said of his event, adding, “We’re going to try to win this thing.”\n\nVance and Kirk were personally close, and the vice president was clearly moved by the shock and injustice of his friend’s assassination. He traveled to Utah to bring Kirk’s coffin home to Arizona on Air Force Two. But the vice president’s decision to host The Charlie Kirk Show was also a political act. As the party’s most likely nominee for 2028, Vance must hope to inherit Kirk’s organizational infrastructure—and his audience.\n\nJust last week, Kamala Harris was confessing that she felt sidelined as vice president, confined to unpopular policy areas by a president who didn’t want to be overshadowed. Vance has realized that podcaster in chief is a more powerful position than the one he currently holds. Imagine how strange a sitting vice president’s decision to host The Charlie Kirk Show would seem to a time traveler from 20 years ago. Had Rush Limbaugh died during George W. Bush’s presidency, would Dick Cheney have hosted the radio host’s call-in show?\n\nTo those inside the MAGA movement, Kirk was not merely a friend, a young father, and a passionate advocate for conservative-Christian values—he was just like them. From the president down, this is a group of people obsessed with “owning the narrative.” The “performative utterance”—a sentence that bends reality into the speaker’s preferred form with words alone—might be a concept championed by the postmodern left, but it has been embraced by Trump and the MAGA right, who believe that saying something is 90 percent of doing it.\n\nTrump’s White House is a government by the podcasters, for the podcasters. Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, was a podcaster. His deputy, Dan Bongino, was a podcaster. Katie Miller, the wife of the immigration czar Stephen Miller, left DOGE earlier this year and started a podcast. Throughout last year’s campaign, Trump took his message to a bunch of male podcasters, who duly rewarded him with softball interviews—or, in some cases, open endorsements. At the same time, Tucker Carlson hosted a live series of conversations across the country with other podcasters (Russell Brand, Jack Posobiec, Glenn Beck) and three people who are now in the administration (Vance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Tulsi Gabbard).\n\nThe symbiotic relationship has continued during MAGA’s return to government: Carlson was one of the guests on Vance’s tribute show. Their opening discussion was about how Kirk first contacted Vance after seeing him on Carlson’s former Fox News program. (In one of this era’s many unexpected outcomes, Carlson is now one of the more Trump-critical voices within MAGA, even though his son, Buckley, works for Vance.) Earlier this year, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt tested a new briefing format in which lucky contestants competed to ask her the most sycophantic question. Can you guess who they were? Podcasters. When the Trump administration wanted to pretend it had released the Epstein files—actually some binders full of boring and mostly public information—a group of useful idiots was summoned to the White House: podcasters. Trump recently gave a personal tour of the Oval Office to three hosts of the podcast All-In. One of them is his crypto czar, David Sacks, who obligingly gushed about Trump’s redecoration of the room. “If you look at before-and-after photos, which I’m sure we’ll put on the screen, the Oval looked kinda drab before,” Sacks told his fellow hosts as they waited for the president. Now, of course, the Oval has so much gold leaf that it looks like a Vegas version of Versailles.\n\nSome of the MAGA-aligned podcasts are organic successes; others appear to be little more than vanity projects, sustained by their proximity to the administration. Katie Miller’s podcast, for example, has 5,000 subscribers on YouTube. Her first guest was Vance; her most recent booking was Attorney General Pam Bondi, who insinuated that people should be fired for “hate speech.”\n\nIn dictatorships, the government has to spend taxpayers’ money on state media. Here in America, the land of free speech and the free market, people volunteer to be Baghdad Bob. Right-wing commentators frequently accuse their opponents of exactly the same vice—being “regime journalists” who are part of the “Cathedral.” But many traditional news organizations have strict rules forbidding their reporters from donating to candidates or attending fundraisers, let alone running a grassroots campaign to elect a president. The Republicans have a huge and flourishing podcast industry dedicated to boosting their talking points. The Democrats have Pod Save America, on a good day.\n\nThis administration is profoundly hostile to the mainstream press because there are now less bruising ways to gain attention. MAGA allies control X and the video platform Rumble, and Trump himself controls Truth Social. Trump-friendly investors have just pledged to buy out TikTok. Mark Zuckerberg appeared next to the president recently and, at Trump’s prompting, talked about how much money his company, Meta, was planning to invest in data infrastructure in the United States. Afterward, Zuckerberg was caught on a hot mic admitting apologetically that he had no idea what numbers the president had wanted him to announce. At the same time, Trump and his allies have sued newspapers and broadcasters, and the head of the Federal Communications Commission pressured TV stations to have Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show taken off the air. Yes, what Kimmel implied about Kirk’s case—that the murder suspect was right-wing—was factually wrong. But when has that ever been the standard applied to things said during late-night monologues? In any case, Trump’s Truth Social posts reveal that the existence of Kimmel’s show—“Less talent than Colbert!”—has bothered him for some time.\n\nThe right might say that it’s winning in the marketplace of ideas, but that rings hollow when it’s also trying to buy the market.\n\nOver the past week, Elon Musk’s X, which acts as the storefront for many of these podcasts, and the place where their titans interact, has been a mirror image of Twitter immediately after George Floyd’s murder in 2020—an inchoate mass of rage and grief looking for a lightning rod. Back then, in one particularly gratuitous example, a Mexican American utility worker was fired after a photo on Twitter showed him making an ambiguous hand gesture that some people construed as a white-power salute. In the past week, Kirk’s fans and friends have similarly targeted private individuals who criticized his views, or who have spoken callously about his death. The dean of a Tennessee university was fired for saying she had “zero sympathy” for him. The managing partner of a Texas Roadhouse was fired after his wife referred to Kirk as a “Nazi.” One MAGA influencer claimed that this would make the restaurant’s staff feel “intimidated,” in an unintentional echo of the language used by New York Times staffers in 2020, when they argued that an op-ed by Senator Tom Cotton endangered their lives.\n\nFor several days, a website called “Expose Charlie’s Murderers” claimed to be collating the names of those who celebrated Kirk’s death. (The site now appears to be offline.) That reminded me of another left-wing mass movement, when a list purporting to expose “Shitty Media Men” circulated in private chats at the height of #MeToo. That list captured some genuine wrongdoing, I’m sure, but was also a forum for anyone with a grudge or a flimsy allegation to air it unchallenged.\n\nThe background of the “great awokening” is being used as the justification for the MAGA purges of the past week. Many conservative podcasters who condemned the peak cancel-culture era are now arguing that their own doxxing and firing campaigns are somehow different. “There is a big difference between the left canceling people and the right canceling people,” posted the podcaster Matt Walsh, a repeat offender in this regard. “The left cancels you for saying things that are true. To the extent that the right cancels you, it is for saying things that are abhorrent and sick.” The obvious rejoinder is: Who gets to decide what is abhorrent and sick? Personally, I find references to “prowling Blacks” quite sick, or the suggestion that a 10-year-old girl should be forced to bear her rapist’s baby. But Charlie Kirk had every right to argue his positions.\n\nWhich is exactly what he did. To use his assassination to restrict free speech is an insult to what Kirk’s friends have told us repeatedly that he stood for, but that’s what you get when you have a government whose highest goal is to podcast. Many parts of American life have proved resistant to the MAGA movement’s performative utterances—the economy, for example, cannot be bullied into growing. But the podcast-industrial complex is useful for establishing new norms and taboos, and expanding the administration’s power.","summary":"The right-wing podcast-industrial complex is establishing new norms and taboos—and expanding the White House’s power.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/09/maga-podcasters-charlie-kirk/684255/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/oav7l1RJNNSN_pyrMSIxV6PT0po=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/09/2025_09_17_Lewis_Podcast_Right_MAGA_final/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 18:09:06","author":"Helen Lewis","authors":["Helen Lewis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.087},{"id":361614382,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension isn’t cancel culture. It’s a five-alarm fire of censorship and capitulation","text":"\"Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT\".\n\nThat’s what Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday night, not long after the announcement that Kimmel’s show had been cancelled-or-not-cancelled-or-suspended ... but definitely was not going to air for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt wasn’t an entirely surprising development. In the immediate aftermath of the Charlie Kirk shooting last week, Kimmel threw gasoline on a fire when he said “the MAGA gang” was trying to “score political points from it”. \n\nIt was a relatively tame criticism as far as modern political commentary goes. Compare it, for example, with Fox News host Brian Kilmeade’s call to “just kill” mentally ill homeless people, also made on-air in the past few days, for which he did not lose his job (but did apologize.)\n\nYet we should have known what was coming. A spate of firings across the country had already happened after Kirk was killed, ranging from people who were seen to be celebrating the shooting to people who were simply not mourning enough. Vice President JD Vance himself had already appeared to publicly call for a mass ‘doxing’ campaign against those who were seen to have disrespected the podcaster.\n\nBut this pattern began long before Kirk. When Stephen Colbert’s show was abruptly cancelled not long after he mocked Trump on-air, it felt like a canary in the coal mine. CBS denied that it was done to curry favor with the Trump administration, but the president celebrated it as a victory nonetheless. Indeed, at the time, Trump wrote on Truth Social that “Jimmy Kimmel is NEXT to go in the untalented Late Night Sweepstakes and, shortly thereafter, Fallon will be gone… It’s really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!”\n\nWell, would you believe it? He was right on the money about Kimmel. ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Wednesday, almost immediately after a threat from the Trump-appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr. Carr’s comments implied that the FFC might take legal action against ABC if it didn’t happen — “we can do this the easy way or the hard way,” were his exact words — even though there’s no real way in which the American courts can be used to silence opinions made on air. \n\nBut this does underscore the way in which the White House and its allies do not need to win lawsuits against comedians or journalists in order to effectively ban criticism of themselves and their agenda. They just need to file the paperwork, or even simply publicly threaten to file suit.\n\nThat is especially true after ABC News in December agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump’s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll, as well as Paramount’s July settlement with him for $16 million over a lawsuit claiming that 60 Minutes edited a campaign-stretch interview with rival Kamala Harris to make her look better.\n\nTrump has a long history of weaponizing litigation, either real or threatened — from the New York Times to the Wall Street Journal to the Lincoln Project to any author who uses anonymous sources in their work — knowing that the threat of endless legal fees and MAGA outrage is often enough to make corporations cave. Entertainment executives don’t want to spend years in discovery battles with Trump’s lawyers. They want advertisers and investors to feel safe. So the calculus is brutal: cut the comic loose, avoid the headache, move on.\n\nThe We Love Free Speech crew is now showing its true colors. \n\nAnd none of this is confined to late-night television. We’re watching a broader institutional surrender. Universities have quietly killed talks and fellowships and “investigated” protesters rather than weather a Trumpist backlash. After the president declared that “improper ideology” would be targeted at museums and research institutions such as the Smithsonian, funding has been pulled for certain scientific research and artistic exhibitions have been quietly changed: most recently, the National Parks Service is said to have been considering the removal of a photograph of an enslaved man’s scars that was once used widely by abolitionists. \n\nThough that particular decision did make headlines, the smaller decisions rarely do; they happen in private emails and company meetings. But the effect is the same: cultural gatekeepers preemptively silence themselves, not because the government told them to directly, but because they’re afraid.\n\nThat fear is exactly what Trump thrives on. He has always understood spectacle as power (see: that absurd state visit to the UK, still ongoing.) His lawsuits are less about legal precedent than about sending a message: mock me and I’ll make your life hell. Networks, publishers, and arts institutions are listening. \n\nIf a comedian with Kimmel’s stature, audience and clout can be shoved offstage, one can only imagine the reception awaiting a young playwright lampooning Trump at a nonprofit theater. Or a junior curator proposing an exhibition on authoritarianism. Or a historian applying for a university fellowship, or even a biochemist proposing further research into an illness that primarily affects women or other underserved communities. The answer is obvious: better to steer clear. Safer to say nothing. Divert the money back into something that seems acceptable to those in power.\n\nThe First Amendment still exists. No court has banned jokes about Trump, or Charlie Kirk, or Israel, or white male podcasters, or whoever is now apparently beyond the reach of mockery. But who needs the First Amendment when you’ve got a sweet arrangement like this? America’s most prominent cultural institutions are doing the censoring themselves! \n\nNeedless to say, when self-censorship becomes the default, the legal protections on paper are meaningless.\n\nColbert’s exit should have rung louder alarms, and Kimmel’s is a five-alarm fire — because we are now witnessing the consolidation of cultural power around one man’s ego. The question everyone should be asking is: why are so many willing to comply in advance?","summary":"The ‘Free Speech’ crew are at it again, making sure nobody says anything — in their own words — ‘ideologically improper’, writes Holly Baxter","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kimmel-suspension-trump-charlie-kirk-colbert-b2829230.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/18/0/01/Screenshot-2025-09-17-at-8-35-26-PM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QVtxFSgG-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-18 18:05:54","author":"Holly Baxter","authors":["Holly Baxter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":361651676,"title":"Most American Jews would like Trump to stop pretending to help","text":"A strong majority of American Jews are sick of being used as a tool for President Donald Trump to carry out his illiberal agenda, according to a poll conducted by Ipsos for researchers at the University of Rochester and the University of California.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American Jews (72%) think Trump is using antisemitism as an \"excuse\" to pull research funding from colleges and universities, according to the survey.

Quite the dilemma. At this point, it’s probably useless to point out how Adolf Hitler, unlike President Donald Trump, murdered his political enemies; controlled the media and the arts through censorship, intimidation and propaganda; arrested and detained adversaries indefinitely and without trial; murdered 6 million Jews and 5 million others; and ignited a world war that resulted in an estimated 50 million civilians dead worldwide.\n\nVirtually every policy Trump enacts or attempts to enact ends up in court. He appeals unfavorable district court decisions, many of which end up at the Supreme Court, where Trump usually wins. Still, Trump’s critics call him a “tyrant” and a “dictator.”\n\nExamine the judicial system under Hitler’s Germany. The Holocaust Encyclopedia writes: “... Like most areas of public life after the Nazi rise to power in 1933, the German system of justice underwent ‘coordination’ (alignment with Nazi goals). All professional associations involved with the administration of justice were merged into the National Socialist League of German Jurists.”\n\nComparing Trump, a democratically elected leader, to Hitler is, was and always will be insanely and profoundly ignorant. It is insidious.\n\nFormer Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “People don’t have the intention of saying something that will lead to something dangerous (so) we cannot take responsibility for the minds that are out there and how they hear it.”\n\nHow did Charlie Kirk’s suspected assassin, Tyler Robinson, “hear it”?\n\nAfter Robinson shot Kirk, he texted his roommate/partner, a man transitioning to be a woman. Robinson told his partner to find and read a message Robinson left before the assassination. It read: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I’m going to take it.”\n\nPartner: “You weren’t the one who did it right????”\n\nRobinson: “I am, I’m sorry.”\n\nWhen asked why, Robinson responded: “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out.”\n\nOn the ammunition found with his rifle were several phrases including, “Hey, fascist! Catch!”\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) insists her party comes to the debate with clean hands because, well, you know, Trump. Warren said: “Oh, please. Right. Why don’t you start with the president of the United States? Right? And every ugly meme he has posted and every ugly word ...”\n\nLet’s start with the president. It was former President Joe Biden who said, “It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the -- I’m going to say something, it’s like semi-fascism.”\n\nVice President and then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris, when asked whether she considered Trump “a fascist,” responded: “Yes, I do. Yes, I do. ... He’s saying to his generals, in essence, why can’t you be more like Hitler’s generals? Come on!”\n\nA YouGov poll taken after Kirk’s assassination found that 25% of the self-described “very liberal” believe political violence is sometimes acceptable to achieve political goals. This is eight times the number of the self-described “very conservative” who feel likewise. Last year, a report affiliated with Rutgers University called “Assassination Culture” wrote: “Over half of those who self-identified as left of center (56%) reported that if someone murdered Donald Trump, they would at least be somewhat justified ... This includes 14.1% who said this murder would be ‘Completely Justified.’”\n\nIn 2008, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, accused of merely uttering empty words, said: “Don’t tell me words don’t matter. ‘I have a dream’ -- just words? ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal’ -- just words?”\n\nLarry Elder is a bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk-show host.

(Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nCarr “engaged in the corrupt abuse of power” and “disgraced the office he holds by bullying ABC” and “should resign immediately,” according to a Thursday statement signed by six Democrat leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.\n\nSpeculating whether the move was “part of a corrupt pay-to-play scheme,” they threatened to issue a congressional subpoena against “media companies” to “learn the truth” about why Kimmel was indefinitely suspended Wednesday.\n\nThe Democrats did not clarify what scheme they were talking about, but Nexstar Media Group—which pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from its ABC-affiliated stations, leading ABC parent organization the Walt Disney Company to nix the show—seeks FCC approval of a $6.2 billion merger with the broadcast group Tegna.\n\nCarr threatened potential consequences for media companies behind Kimmel’s show, saying on a podcast Wednesday that certain companies would need to “take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\n\nSeveral other prominent Democrats also described the Trump administration’s intervention in the Kimmel controversy as a blatant overreach of free speech, with former President Barack Obama tweeting Thursday, “after years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like.”\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN Thursday “we know there was federal interference,” adding “that truly undermines the whole premise of the First Amendment,” while Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., compared the Trump administration to “autocracies” and said “Trump and his allies seem to want to shut down speech that they don’t like to hear.”\n\nCarr made a veiled threat that the FCC could reject CBS parent company Paramount Global’s proposed merger with Skydance earlier this year over edits CBS made to an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris last year. Trump sued CBS claiming it trimmed Harris’ response to a question to cast her in a more favorable light. CBS settled the lawsuit with Trump for $16 million and Carr subsequently approved the merger. Carr has also opened investigations into several broadcasters’ diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nKey Background\n\nABC pulled Kimmel off the air “indefinitely Wednesday shortly after Nexstar announced it wouldn’t run the program. Neither ABC nor Nexstar specifically mentioned Kimmel’s Kirk comments in explaining the decision, but Nexstar said it was based on comments Kimmel made that were “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.” Kimmel sparked a wave of backlash among conservatives when he said on his show Monday “we hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” The Trump administration celebrated the decision, with Carr thanking the company for “doing the right thing” in a social media post Wednesday. Trump called it “Great News for America” in a Truth Social post, and told reporters Thursday “Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nABC Pulls Jimmy Kimmel ‘Indefinitely’ After Charlie Kirk Comments: Here’s What He Said (Forbes)\n\nKimmel’s Charlie Kirk Monologues Surge In Viewership After Suspension—As ABC Leaves Up Video Clips (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

Look no further than President Donald Trump, California Governor Gavin Newsom fired back. \n\nABC announced Wednesday evening that it was indefinitely suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! after comments the host made Monday characterizing conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killer as “MAGA”. Law enforcement said Tuesday that the suspected shooter’s mother claimed he had “started to lean more to the left” over the past year. \n\nSome liberals have accused conservatives of censoring those who haven’t condemned the assassination of Kirk strongly enough, but Hannity came to conservatives’ defense on his show.\n\n“The left already, starting with Humpty Dumpty fake news CNN, JB Pritzker, Gavin Newsom, predictably claiming, this is conservative censorship – the MAGA crowd, Donald Trump, got Jimmy Kimmel,” Hannity said. “That is false.”\n\n“There’s no pressure group outside that was pushing for Jimmy Kimmel to be silenced.”\n\nThe Fox host also claimed that he couldn’t find “a single prominent conservative voice in the country that even remotely wanted, or hoped, or was pushing, to get Jimmy Kimmel taken off the air.”\n\nNewsom, who has ramped up his social media posts trolling conservatives in recent weeks, was quick to respond. \n\nHe posted on X: “BREAKING: Sean Hannity doesn’t think Donald Trump is ‘a prominent conservative voice.’”\n\nAttached was a screenshot of Trump’s Truth Social post, from July, where he celebrated the cancellation of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and predicted Kimmel would be “next.”\n\nNewsom continued to post apparent free speech contradictions by conservatives Thursday. He shared a statement made by Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr in 2022 where he defended political satire against censorship. \n\n“This aged well,” the Democratic governor wrote.\n\nBefore ABC decided to pull Kimmel’s show, Carr suggested he would take regulatory action against the network for the host’s remarks.\n\nTrump and his allies have long railed against network TV’s late-night hosts who often criticize or mock the president.\n\nTrump celebrated Kimmel’s suspension on Truth Social Wednesday, calling it “Great News for America”. He also appeared to call for the ousting of other late-night hosts, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.\n\nFor years, Trump has called late-night stars “untalented,” insinuated they’re working with Democrats, asserted they can be replaced, and claimed they have poor ratings. \n\nKimmel’s show has seen a significant drop in viewership in the past year, and although it made some gains in the second quarter, it continued to trail behind other late-night hosts according to LateNighter. His contract is up in May 2026.\n\nSince returning to office in January, Trump has displayed a willingness to wield his power against legacy media institutions that paint him negatively. \n\nThe president sued CBS News for$10 billion last year, for what he said was deceptive editing of a clip of former Vice President Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes. CBS agreed to settle the lawsuit for $16 million earlier this year. \n\nTrump also filed a $10 billion-dollar defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for publishing an alleged birthday letter he wrote to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nTrump recently filed a $15 billion lawsuit against the New York Times for defamation related to articles that undermined his success as a businessman. \n\nThe president has also revoked public funding to public broadcasters NPR and PBS, which he claims are biased against him.","summary":"In July, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he hoped he played ‘a major part’ in late-night hosts losing their shows","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/gavin-newsom-sean-hannity-kimmel-b2829116.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/18/13/48/FotoJet-(2).jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Pel7FUCe-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-18 16:01:53","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":361586304,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel’s cancellation proves right-wingers are the real snowflakes","text":"Jimmy Kimmel Live! is not a partisan show that only swings at Republicans (Picture: Chris Delmas/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nUS comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talk show has been yanked off air ‘indefinitely’ after a couple of barbed – but frankly bog-standard – lines about the politics swirling around Charlie Kirk’s killing.\n\nThe Disney-owned network ABC has offered little in the way of a proper explanation. From where I’m sitting, the decision reeks of pressure from political powers above.\n\nIt looks and feels like punishment. And it makes a mockery of the right’s endless sermon about ‘unlimited’ free speech.\n\nFrom Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace’s jaw-dropping, baseless lie that Democrats were to blame – made before a suspect had even been apprehended – to Vice President JD Vance insisting left-wing violence is the bigger problem, the hypocrisy is staggering.\n\nKimmel poked at Donald Trump’s curiously performative public grief with a line that would barely raise an eyebrow in US TV’s long history of late-night satire: ‘This is not how an adult grieves the murder of somebody called a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.’\n\n Kimmel poked at Donald Trump’s curiously performative public grief (Picture: EPA/Jim Lo Scalzo)\n\nIt was a sharp, accurate summary of a bizarre moment when a reporter asked the President how he was holding up after Kirk’s death, and he started talking about his shiny new White House ballroom.\n\nKimmel also said: ‘The MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.’\n\nSure, it’s crude and pointed, but it’s not gleeful. Yet within hours, Nexstar Media – one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US – announced it would not air the show on its syndicated local stations ‘for the foreseeable future’.\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMore affiliates followed. Then ABC stuck a label on it and called it an ‘indefinite’ hiatus.\n\nState pressure was hardly subtle. Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr publicly urged affiliates to pull the show, threatening sanctions, while the President cheered from the sidelines and called it ‘great news for America’.\n\nYou do not need to be a civil-liberties lawyer to feel the chill. So what happened to that absolutist free speech the right loved so much?\n\nFor years we were told that offence is the price of a free society, that comedy must be fearless, that ‘cancel culture’ was the gravest threat. \n\n Charlie Kirk himself said last year: ‘Hate speech does not exist legally in America’ (Picture: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nCharlie Kirk himself said last year: ‘Hate speech does not exist legally in America. There’s ugly speech. There’s gross speech. There’s evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.’\n\nHowever you look at it, Kimmel’s monologue did not even approach that threshold.\n\nHe did not celebrate a death or revel in a family’s pain. He mocked political hypocrisy in the long-established house style of American late-night television.\n\n He did not celebrate a death or revel in a family’s pain (Picture: Randy Holmes/Disney via Getty Images)\n\nEven those hostile to the comedian have struggled to produce anything more damning than the goldfish line. This was nowhere near the edgy meme culture that has been circulating since the shooting, and miles away from the genuinely offensive, explicit taunts you can find elsewhere online.\n\nDefenders of the decision say this isn’t censorship – just ABC calming an angry audience and protecting the bottom line. Give me a break.\n\nWhen the country’s largest station group dumps a show after a powerful regulator’s public threat, there’s no way I believe they’re speaking freely. They are reacting to the threat of political retribution.\n\nAside from the embarrassing capitulation of America’s institutions conceding to political pressure, Jimmy Kimmel Live! is not a partisan show that only swings at Republicans. It has taken lumps out of Democrats plenty of times.\n\nLast year, guest host Lamorne Morris mocked Joe Biden when he dropped out of the race, quipping that he had ‘wandered off’. Kimmel himself roasted Democrats’ clunky ‘choose your fighter’ social video this spring, calling it embarrassing for ‘everyone involved’.\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKimmel rolled his eyes at Biden’s stagecraft and compared Kamala Harris verifying Trump’s win to ‘making your ex DJ at your wedding’.\n\nThis punctures the idea that ABC’s move is partisan play. What has changed is not Kimmel’s tone – it is the climate around him.\n\n Was ABC right to halt Kimmel's show?\n\n They had to - the backlash was too strongCheck\n\n No, it is just caving to political pressure Check\n\n Stay up to date with the stories everybody’s talking about by signing up to Metro's News Updates newsletter.\n\n Email \n\n I agree to receive newsletters from Metro \n I agree to receive newsletters from Metro \n\n Sign UpSign UpThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

A public figure has been killed. Emotions are raw. Many will find any jokes in the vicinity distasteful.\n\nPersonally, I have not taken part in any of it. For me, the whole thing has been a sorry chapter in the sad story of a country unable to face up to its addiction to guns.\n\nBut the bar for pulling a national programme off air – with a vengeful regulator hovering – should be higher than taste. \n\nIf you celebrated the ‘free speech’ era when it meant tolerating ugly jokes about liberals, demonising trans people, or mocking Biden’s health, you do not get to rewrite the rules now a joke lands on you. \n\nKimmel’s critics could’ve written sharper rebuttals or switched channels. Instead, the precise people who have spent years screaming about unlimited free speech have proved that free speech was never the point.\n\nOne mild, standard-issue joke about their politics and ABC’s longest-running late-night talk show is pulled off air overnight – ‘cancelled’, if you will. (Oh, the irony.)\n\nFor a political tribe that revels in labelling opponents ‘snowflakes’, it is somewhat reassuring to know we can finally agree on one thing: Words can hurt, after all.\n\nDo you have a story you’d like to share?

Sitting down to face her reflection, Rudolph is joined by the real Harris positioned on the other side of the mirror, resulting in rapturous applause from the unassuming live audience.\n\n While speaking with Entertainment Weekly to preview season 3 of her Apple TV+ comedy Loot, Rudolph reveals that just like every sketch on the fabled Studio 8H stage, the Harris sketch “came together very quickly.” She also notes it evolved from an initial idea involving music superstar Beyoncé, a persona that Rudolph also frequently imitates, during her highly-publicized campaign stop for Harris in her hometown of Houston in October of last year. (P.S.: If you thought you spotted Rudolph at the final stop of the Cowboy Carter Tour in Las Vegas in late July, that was, in fact, her, lassoing in her 53rd birthday.) \n\n “I was once again inspired by Beyoncé because she was part of Kamala’s campaign in Houston. I jokingly said to Lorne [Michaels, series creator], ‘How am I gonna play both?’” Rudolph says of the sketch. “I think the show was off that week, and so he made a call and the next thing I know, he said, ‘Beyoncé’s not available, but Kamala would love to do it.’”\n\n “In all the years that I worked on the show, it was normal for any of the candidates to come through the studio and appear when they were running,” notes Rudolph, who was a cast member on the venerable sketch comedy between 2000 and 2007. “So I was hoping the whole time that she would come, but we really had no indication that she would.”\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n Harris flew in on that Saturday of the show, tackling the sketch despite having virtually no time to rehearse, according to Rudolph. \"She wasn't even there for dress rehearsal,” Rudolph recalls. “We did a dress with Ego [Nwodim], thankfully. Once Kamala got there, we went through the cards with her and we just did it. And that was her doing it for the first time on air.”\n\n The Emmy winner calls that moment “unlike any other experience I've had” on the show. “Those are the moments where you think, ‘Wow, I'm so lucky to be here and witness this,’” Rudolph says. “You can feel that electricity in the room and the crowd responding to that.”\n\n As for whether Rudolph could pop up in some capacity in the upcoming season 51 returning early next month, “In true form to the show, I never know if I'm gonna be there until that week,” she says. “The door’s always open and as Lorne knows, I’m always happy to be there. It's my second home and I love it so much and I'm always so happy to get to go back.

The MAGA crowd, Donald Trump got Jimmy Kimmel.’ That is false,” Hannity whined Wednesday night. “I can’t find a single prominent conservative voice in the country that even remotely wanted or hoped or was pushing to get Jimmy Kimmel taken off the air.”But in July, after CBS announced that The Late Show With Stephen Colbert would be canceled, Trump celebrated the win against a vocal critic by listing who else he’d like to see taken off the air.“I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings,” Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time. “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”It appears that Hannity is playing defense for the blatant act of political overreach from the Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who publicly pressured Nexstar Media Group, the broadcast company that owns ABC, to punish Kimmel for his speech. Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for a $6.2 billion deal to buy Tegna, an acquisition that would make Nexstar the biggest owner of local stations in the country.During his show Monday, Kimmel said that MAGA had spent the weekend “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” In fact, Republicans started doing that the same day Kirk was shot, casting blame on the left and the transgender community before the shooter was even identified.Kimmel’s remark about MAGA comments wasn’t even a matter of opinion, it was a well-documented fact. Read more about Kimmel:Trump Celebrates Censorship by Mocking Jimmy KimmelMost Recent PostDespite Representative Nancy Mace’s best efforts, her Democratic colleague Ilhan Omar will get to speak her mind another day.Four Republicans joined the Democratic caucus Wednesday night to quash Mace’s measure, sending the South Carolinian into a tizzy over the foiled plan and the diminished support inside her own party. Those conservatives were Representatives Mike Flood, Tom McClintock, Jeff Hurd, and Cory Mills, all of whom Mace put on full blast after the vote.“They voted to shield a woman who mocked the cold-blooded assassination of Charlie Kirk … a woman who belittled his grieving family,” Mace posted in the wake of the failed vote. “They showed us exactly who they are. Never forget it.”Over the last week, Mace has advocated for stripping Omar of her committee assignments and censuring her, and has publicly suggested that Omar should be deported back to Somalia for having allegedly “smeared Charlie Kirk and implied he was to blame for his own murder” during an interview with Zeteo’s Mehdi Hasan. Disjointed clips from that interview were similarly picked up and recirculated by far-right personalities, who claimed that Omar had said Kirk deserved to die. But that wasn’t accurate.“No one said he deserved to die. Ilhan Omar said the exact opposite to me,” Hasan wrote on X. “She condemned his killing. And she said her heart goes out to Kirk’s widow.”Omar also pushed back against Mace, arguing that she never made the comments that Mace was attempting to silence her for.“Her [resolution] does not contain a single quote from me because she couldn’t find any,” Omar said. “Unlike her, I have routinely condemned political violence, no matter the political ideology. This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor.”Read more about Mace:Nancy Mace Launches Racist Attack on Ilhan Omar for Made-Up QuotesMost Recent PostFederal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr—who just a few years ago was waxing poetic about how political satire is the “oldest and most important form of free speech”—is now using The Office GIFs to celebrate taking away Jimmy Kimmel’s freedom of speech. Carr appeared on conservative commentator Benny Johnson’s podcast and floated punishing Kimmel for making remarks about Trump’s reaction to Charlie Kirk’s killing. While ABC was not initially going to rebuke Kimmel, as his statements were pretty run of the mill, threats from Carr and the Trump administration regarding pulling their broadcast licenses made them cave. Late that night they suspended Kimmel indefinitely. Carr, who wrote the Project 2025 chapter on the FCC, has been jubilant in the days since Kimmel’s muzzling. Wednesday night he went on Hannity for a victory lap. “Late-night shows, something’s gone seriously awry there. They went from going for applause, for laugh lines, to applause lines. They went from being court jesters that would make fun of everybody in power to being court clerics and enforcing a very narrow political ideology,” Carr told Hannity. “There’s more work to go, but I’m very glad to see that America’s broadcasters are standing up to serve the interests of the community and we don’t just have progressive foie gras coming out from New York and Hollywood. Kimmel is no cleric. And Carr is rich for acting as if his firing was the product of some local, grassroots campaign when it’s extremely clear that this was a result of direct pressure on ABC from the federal government. The backlash to Carr’s spineless hypocrisy has been swift, as receipt after receipt of him defending the same principles he is now attacking is circulating widely. “Should the government censor speech it doesn’t like? Of course not,” he said in 2019. “The FCC does not have a roving mandate to police speech in the name of ‘public interest.’”“From Internet memes to late-night comedians, from cartoons to the plays and poems as old as organized government itself—Political Satire circumvents traditional gatekeepers & helps hold those in power accountable,” he said the very next year. “Not surprising that it’s long been targeted for censorship.”Editor’s PickWhat If the Next Democratic President Governs Like Trump?Most Recent PostThe plug has been pulled on another Trump-critical late-night host, and the president is over the moon.“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” Donald Trump posted to Truth Social Wednesday. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”“Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible,” he continued, referring to Stephen Colbert, who had his show on CBS canceled in July.Jimmy Kimmel Live! was put on indefinite hiatus Wednesday by Nexstar, one of the largest owners of ABC stations in the country. Nexstar said it “strongly” objected “to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk,” according to a statement. Kimmel was excoriated by Republicans after he suggested earlier this week that Kirk’s suspected killer, Tyler Robinson, was a MAGA conservative.“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said during a monologue.But emerging details have painted a more complicated picture of the 22-year-old Utahn, who according to his friends was relatively apolitical. The move to deplatform Kimmel immediately followed a threat from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who condemned Kimmel’s language as the “sickest conduct possible.”“[This] appears to be an action by Jimmy Kimmel to play into the narrative that this was somehow a MAGA or Republican-motivated person,” Carr told YouTuber Benny Johnson. “What people don’t understand is that the broadcasters … have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest. When we see stuff like this, look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Carr was celebrating the decision hours later. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the FCC chair thanked Nexstar for “doing the right thing” and implored other broadcasters to “follow Nexstar’s lead.” Trump was, apparently, in a similar headspace. On Truth Social, the president made it clear that his ideal version of a late-night lineup involves nixing two other NBC hosts who have been hard on his administration. Addressing the network directly, Trump urged NBC to fire two of its stars: Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. “That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC,” Trump wrote. “Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.”But Nexstar’s opposition to Kimmel’s monologue might not be entirely moralistic. The massive broadcast network is currently seeking FCC approval for a $6.2 billion deal to buy Tegna, an acquisition that would make Nexstar the biggest owner of local stations in the country.The pattern is remarkably similar to the circumstances surrounding Colbert’s ended contract. Colbert’s show—the most popular show in its time slot—was canceled three days after the comedian claimed that Paramount’s $16 million settlement with Trump over his groundless lawsuit targeting Kamala Harris’s 60 Minutes interview looked like a “big, fat bribe.” Days after the cancellation was announced, the FCC approved Paramount’s $8 billion merger with Skydance.Read more about Kimmel:The Jimmy Kimmel Suspension: A Huge Step Down the Authoritarian RoadMost Recent PostPresident Donald Trump announced that he would designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization—but not only do anti-fascists not commit nearly as much political violence as the far right, they’re not even an organization. Oh yeah, and Trump’s move is illegal. “I am pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday night. “I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices.”But antifa, which is short for “anti-fascist,” is a movement, not a group. The so-called organization lacks a central structure and is instead a loose network of individuals and groups who act separately under the banner of opposing facism.In May 2020, Trump announced that he would designate antifa as a terrorist organization, and Attorney General Bill Barr warned he would treat violence from group members as domestic terrorism. But in September 2020, FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that antifa was an ideology, not a group or organization, earning him an earful from Trump.Crucially, the president lacks the legal authority to designate antifa as a terrorist organization. Congress previously granted the secretary of state the power to designate foreign groups as foreign terrorist organizations, but has granted no such power to the executive branch to designate domestic groups.During Trump’s first term, Mary McCord, a former senior official at the Department of Justice, told Al Jazeera there was no procedure for “designating domestic organisations as terrorist organisations,” and Trump’s efforts raised “significant First Amendment concerns.”It’s worth noting that while counterprotesters acting under the antifa banner have sometimes turned violent, the actual rate of political violence motivated by left-wing ideologies is dwarfed by right-wing violence. Between 1975 and September 2025, individuals motivated by right-wing ideologies such white supremacy, involuntary celibacy, and anti-abortion beliefs committed 391 murders, according to the Cato Institute. Comparatively, people motivated by left-wing ideologies were responsible for 65 deaths.It seems Trump’s latest effort is a reactionary move following the death of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, which elicited condemnations of left-wing violence before the shooter’s identity was even known. Earlier this week, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said that the administration planned to “channel all of the anger that we have over the organised campaign that led to this assassination, to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.” As of yet, there is no evidence to suggest that Kirk’s death was linked to the network known as antifa or that his assassin was motivated by a radical left-wing ideology. Read more about Kirk:Soldiers Are Being Disciplined for Charlie Kirk Social Media PostsMost Recent PostFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday described a “curious balance” in the labor market, in which both supply and demand have sunk “sharply,” thanks to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and potentially his tariffs.Asked whether tariffs have created the weakened U.S. job market, Powell said that is “certainly possible.” But while trade policy “may” be affecting the labor market, Powell said, “the change in immigration” is the primary reason “employment is doing what it’s doing.” The change, of course, being Trump’s disruptive mass deportation campaign, which has dramatically decreased the supply of workers.Amid this decrease in supply, Powell added, “demand for workers has also come down quite sharply,” leading to a “curious balance,” he said, repeating a term he used in a speech last month. “Typically when we say things are in balance that sounds good,” he added. “But in this case, the balance is because both supply and demand have come down quite sharply.”The situation Powell described, some observers noted, resembles stagflation—the dreaded combination of stagnant economic growth, rising prices, and high unemployment. “‘Curious balance’ … Say the S word Jay,” tweeted Kevin Green, a markets correspondent at the Schwab Network, alongside a crying-laughing emoji.Editor’s PickThe Right’s Scary Quick Campaign to Exploit Charlie Kirk’s Death Most Recent PostAt least eight members of the military have been punished for comments made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s death, and dozens more have been doxed and reported. Task and Purpose reports that at least five Army officers and one Air Force sergeant have been suspended, one Marine was fired from his recruitment job for posting a meme of Kirk captioned, “Another racist man popped,” and one Army reserve major is under investigation.“The Department of War maintains a zero-tolerance policy for military personnel or DOW civilians who celebrate or mock the assassination of Charlie Kirk,” the Pentagon posted from its rapid response account last Friday on X. Even so, it won’t be as simple to just fire soldiers for posting things that don’t align with the current administration’s politics as the Pentagon is making it out to be. “People who join the military have less First Amendment rights than those who don’t, but they still have robust First Amendment rights,” former military colonel, judge, and prosecutor Don Christensen told CNN. He went on to note that nothing says, “Pete Hegseth doesn’t like what you’re saying so I’m going to prosecute you.”“You can’t just say out of the blue, ‘If you say something on social media about Charlie Kirk that Pete Hegseth doesn’t like, that’s a crime,’” Christensen continued. While that may be true, it’s likely that the Pentagon’s gag order has already had the desired chilling effect.Editor’s PickDoes Anybody Care This Is the Worst Bribery Scandal Since Teapot Dome?Most Recent PostHouse Republicans wouldn’t even let their Democratic colleague finish reading a motion to subpoena Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Wednesday for information about alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.During Kash Patel’s House Judiciary Committee hearing earlier, the FBI director repeatedly deferred Representative Mary Gay Scanlon’s questions about $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions, which major banks had flagged to the government related to Epstein and his alleged collaborators, to the Treasury Department. After the hearing, Scanlon attempted to introduce a motion to subpoena Bessent to produce the suspicious activity reports—but her Republican colleague Tom McClintock wouldn’t even let her get the words out.Scanlon said she was seeking reports “in the possession of the Treasury Department identifying the roughly $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions—” “Uh, Mr. Chairman?” McClintock interjected. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan then recognized McClintock, who made a motion to table Scanlon’s request. Jordan replied that the motion was “not debatable.”“I didn’t finish,” Scanlon said. “She hadn’t completed the motion,” said Representative Jamie Raskin. “It’s improper to cut it off before it’s completed, Mr. Chairman.”Jordan said she could finish her last sentence. “OK, so we’re asking them to identify the roughly $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions related to the sex trafficking crimes of Epstein, Maxwell, and their co-conspirators—” Scanlon continued, before being interrupted by McClintock yet again. This time, Jordan moved straight to vote on McClintock’s motion to table, and Republicans promptly squashed her attempt to call Bessent in. Scanlon wrote on X that her Republican colleagues had “voted for continuing the cover-up.”McClintock also moved to table Representative Jasmine Crockett’s motion to subpoena the head of the Bureau of Prisons to produce records relating to Maxwell’s transfer, and Representative Eric Swalwell’s motion to subpoena deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino for witness interviews. Read more about Epstein:Kash Patel’s Big Mouth Just Got Him in Trouble on Epstein FilesMost Recent PostThe Trump administration is taking its recent assault on alleged drug boats from Venezuela very seriously—not.Recalling a recent conversation he had with War Department Secretary Pete Hegseth about the unprovoked air strikes in the Caribbean, Vice President JD Vance joked Wednesday that he “wouldn’t go fishing right now in that part of the world.”So far this month, the United States has destroyed two small Venezuelan boats traversing international waters, which Trump administration officials deemed—without an investigation or interdiction—were smuggling drugs. The first attack killed 11 people on September 2, while a second attack on September 15 killed an additional three individuals, according to Donald Trump.Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, said that the Trump administration had violated U.S. and international laws by striking the boats. He condemned the attacks as a “heinous crime” and also suggested that the strikes were an attempt to goad Venezuela into a “major war.”In a rare interview, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil told CNN last week that the nation is not looking for a military confrontation with the U.S.“We are not betting on conflict, nor do we want conflict,” Gil told the network.Another incident late last week, in which the U.S. military “illegally and hostilely” detained another boat off the coast of a Venezuelan island, further intensified relations between the two countries. In a statement, Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry said that the U.S. was “looking for an incident to justify escalating war in the Caribbean, with the aim of regime change” in Venezuela. It further demanded that the U.S. “immediately cease these actions that endanger security and peace in the Caribbean.”But the White House is apparently not looking to deescalate the situation. Instead, Trump and Vance have openly boasted about the unconstitutional killings. On Monday, Trump publicized that the second attack was on his orders, while promising to continue the “hunt,” and Vance has claimed that the needless deaths were the “highest and best use of our military.”When a political commentator noted that killing citizens of another country without due process is a war crime, Vance simply retorted, “I don’t give a shit what you call it.”Some Republicans back at home, meanwhile, have not been impressed by the aggressive international display. In an interview last week, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News that he felt compelled to address the attacks, underscoring that not every ship sailing in the Caribbean is smuggling drugs.“The reason we board them before we blow the crap out of them is some of them don’t have drugs,” Paul said.Paul additionally lamented that the Trump administration was involving itself in affairs thousands of miles off U.S. coastlines, and expending federal resources on the lowest echelons of the global drug trade.Read more about Vance:Rand Paul Forced to Explain to JD Vance That Abitrary Killing Is BadMost Recent PostRepresentative Nancy Mace’s crusade against Representative Ilhan Omar has dredged up an old, Islamaphobic rumor.The pair were going back and forth on X Wednesday, ahead of a scheduled floor debate over Omar’s potential censure, and Mace referred to the Minnesota lawmaker as “Somalia Ilhan Omar.”“Is your ridiculous censure about me being born in Somalia? Because that’s just as crazy as you are,” wrote Omar.But then Mace reached for the top shelf to offend her colleague.“Who knows, maybe it’ll be about you marrying your brother next!” Mace responded. “Tune in!”MAGA conservatives have rumbled for years—without evidence—that Omar married her brother to bring him into the United States. The conspiracy first emerged during Omar’s 2016 campaign for the Minnesota state legislature, in a since-deleted post on the conservative blog Power Line, where an anonymous source was quoted as saying that Omar’s ex-husband, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, was related to her by blood.Omar has vehemently and repeatedly denied the unfounded allegations, which have been disproven by her marriage certificate. At the time, Omar described the insinuation that she had married her brother to be “absurd and offensive.”But that hasn’t stopped Mace from digging the details back up. Over the last week, Mace has advocated stripping Omar of her committee assignments and censuring her, and has publicly suggested that Omar should be deported back to Somalia for having allegedly “smeared Charlie Kirk and implied he was to blame for his own murder” during an interview with Zeteo’s Mehdi Hasan. Clips from that interview were similarly picked up by far-right personalities, who claimed that Omar had said Kirk deserved to die. But that’s not accurate.“No one said he deserved to die.

This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor.”Even other Republicans didn’t appear to galvanize behind Mace’s cause, apparently wiping their hands of the South Carolinian’s vendetta.“It just seems like every week or so we want to censure somebody for something,” Texas Representative Troy Nehls told Fox News’s Chad Pergram on Tuesday. “A lot of people say a lot of stupid stuff around here.”Ironically, Mace’s mudslinging comes just days after she insisted that she never bad-mouthed her Democratic colleagues.Read more about Kirk:MTG Embraces Charlie Kirk’s True Legacy When Discussing TPUSA FutureView More Posts","summary":"Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed that he couldn’t find a “single prominent conservative voice” pushing to knock Jimmy Kimmel off the air—but in July, President Donald Trump suggested that Kimmel would be “next” to be canceled.\n\n“The left already—starting with humpty-dumpty CNN, Pritzker, Newsom—predictably claiming, ‘This is a conservative censorship.

Congress previously granted the secretary of state the power to designate foreign groups as foreign terrorist organizations, but has granted no such power to the executive branch to designate domestic groups.During Trump’s first term, Mary McCord, a former senior official at the Department of Justice, told Al Jazeera there was no procedure for “designating domestic organisations as terrorist organisations,” and Trump’s efforts raised “significant First Amendment concerns.”It’s worth noting that while counterprotesters acting under the antifa banner have sometimes turned violent, the actual rate of political violence motivated by left-wing ideologies is dwarfed by right-wing violence. Between 1975 and September 2025, individuals motivated by right-wing ideologies such white supremacy, involuntary celibacy, and anti-abortion beliefs committed 391 murders, according to the Cato Institute. Comparatively, people motivated by left-wing ideologies were responsible for 65 deaths.It seems Trump’s latest effort is a reactionary move following the death of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, which elicited condemnations of left-wing violence before the shooter’s identity was even known. Earlier this week, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said that the administration planned to “channel all of the anger that we have over the organised campaign that led to this assassination, to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.” As of yet, there is no evidence to suggest that Kirk’s death was linked to the network known as antifa or that his assassin was motivated by a radical left-wing ideology. Read more about Kirk:Soldiers Are Being Disciplined for Charlie Kirk Social Media PostsMost Recent PostFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday described a “curious balance” in the labor market, in which both supply and demand have sunk “sharply,” thanks to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and potentially his tariffs.Asked whether tariffs have created the weakened U.S. job market, Powell said that is “certainly possible.” But while trade policy “may” be affecting the labor market, Powell said, “the change in immigration” is the primary reason “employment is doing what it’s doing.” The change, of course, being Trump’s disruptive mass deportation campaign, which has dramatically decreased the supply of workers.Amid this decrease in supply, Powell added, “demand for workers has also come down quite sharply,” leading to a “curious balance,” he said, repeating a term he used in a speech last month. “Typically when we say things are in balance that sounds good,” he added. “But in this case, the balance is because both supply and demand have come down quite sharply.”The situation Powell described, some observers noted, resembles stagflation—the dreaded combination of stagnant economic growth, rising prices, and high unemployment. “‘Curious balance’ … Say the S word Jay,” tweeted Kevin Green, a markets correspondent at the Schwab Network, alongside a crying-laughing emoji.Editor’s PickThe Right’s Scary Quick Campaign to Exploit Charlie Kirk’s Death Most Recent PostAt least eight members of the military have been punished for comments made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s death, and dozens more have been doxed and reported. Task and Purpose reports that at least five Army officers and one Air Force sergeant have been suspended, one Marine was fired from his recruitment job for posting a meme of Kirk captioned, “Another racist man popped,” and one Army reserve major is under investigation.“The Department of War maintains a zero-tolerance policy for military personnel or DOW civilians who celebrate or mock the assassination of Charlie Kirk,” the Pentagon posted from its rapid response account last Friday on X. Even so, it won’t be as simple to just fire soldiers for posting things that don’t align with the current administration’s politics as the Pentagon is making it out to be. “People who join the military have less First Amendment rights than those who don’t, but they still have robust First Amendment rights,” former military colonel, judge, and prosecutor Don Christensen told CNN. He went on to note that nothing says, “Pete Hegseth doesn’t like what you’re saying so I’m going to prosecute you.”“You can’t just say out of the blue, ‘If you say something on social media about Charlie Kirk that Pete Hegseth doesn’t like, that’s a crime,’” Christensen continued. While that may be true, it’s likely that the Pentagon’s gag order has already had the desired chilling effect.Editor’s PickDoes Anybody Care This Is the Worst Bribery Scandal Since Teapot Dome?Most Recent PostHouse Republicans wouldn’t even let their Democratic colleague finish reading a motion to subpoena Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Wednesday for information about alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.During Kash Patel’s House Judiciary Committee hearing earlier, the FBI director repeatedly deferred Representative Mary Gay Scanlon’s questions about $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions, which major banks had flagged to the government related to Epstein and his alleged collaborators, to the Treasury Department. After the hearing, Scanlon attempted to introduce a motion to subpoena Bessent to produce the suspicious activity reports—but her Republican colleague Tom McClintock wouldn’t even let her get the words out.Scanlon said she was seeking reports “in the possession of the Treasury Department identifying the roughly $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions—” “Uh, Mr. Chairman?” McClintock interjected. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan then recognized McClintock, who made a motion to table Scanlon’s request. Jordan replied that the motion was “not debatable.”“I didn’t finish,” Scanlon said. “She hadn’t completed the motion,” said Representative Jamie Raskin. “It’s improper to cut it off before it’s completed, Mr. Chairman.”Jordan said she could finish her last sentence. “OK, so we’re asking them to identify the roughly $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions related to the sex trafficking crimes of Epstein, Maxwell, and their co-conspirators—” Scanlon continued, before being interrupted by McClintock yet again. This time, Jordan moved straight to vote on McClintock’s motion to table, and Republicans promptly squashed her attempt to call Bessent in. Scanlon wrote on X that her Republican colleagues had “voted for continuing the cover-up.”McClintock also moved to table Representative Jasmine Crockett’s motion to subpoena the head of the Bureau of Prisons to produce records relating to Maxwell’s transfer, and Representative Eric Swalwell’s motion to subpoena deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino for witness interviews. Read more about Epstein:Kash Patel’s Big Mouth Just Got Him in Trouble on Epstein FilesMost Recent PostThe Trump administration is taking its recent assault on alleged drug boats from Venezuela very seriously—not.Recalling a recent conversation he had with War Department Secretary Pete Hegseth about the unprovoked air strikes in the Caribbean, Vice President JD Vance joked Wednesday that he “wouldn’t go fishing right now in that part of the world.”So far this month, the United States has destroyed two small Venezuelan boats traversing international waters, which Trump administration officials deemed—without an investigation or interdiction—were smuggling drugs. The first attack killed 11 people on September 2, while a second attack on September 15 killed an additional three individuals, according to Donald Trump.Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, said that the Trump administration had violated U.S. and international laws by striking the boats. He condemned the attacks as a “heinous crime” and also suggested that the strikes were an attempt to goad Venezuela into a “major war.”In a rare interview, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil told CNN last week that the nation is not looking for a military confrontation with the U.S.“We are not betting on conflict, nor do we want conflict,” Gil told the network.Another incident late last week, in which the U.S. military “illegally and hostilely” detained another boat off the coast of a Venezuelan island, further intensified relations between the two countries. In a statement, Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry said that the U.S. was “looking for an incident to justify escalating war in the Caribbean, with the aim of regime change” in Venezuela. It further demanded that the U.S. “immediately cease these actions that endanger security and peace in the Caribbean.”But the White House is apparently not looking to deescalate the situation. Instead, Trump and Vance have openly boasted about the unconstitutional killings. On Monday, Trump publicized that the second attack was on his orders, while promising to continue the “hunt,” and Vance has claimed that the needless deaths were the “highest and best use of our military.”When a political commentator noted that killing citizens of another country without due process is a war crime, Vance simply retorted, “I don’t give a shit what you call it.”Some Republicans back at home, meanwhile, have not been impressed by the aggressive international display. In an interview last week, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News that he felt compelled to address the attacks, underscoring that not every ship sailing in the Caribbean is smuggling drugs.“The reason we board them before we blow the crap out of them is some of them don’t have drugs,” Paul said.Paul additionally lamented that the Trump administration was involving itself in affairs thousands of miles off U.S. coastlines, and expending federal resources on the lowest echelons of the global drug trade.Read more about Vance:Rand Paul Forced to Explain to JD Vance That Abitrary Killing Is BadMost Recent PostRepresentative Nancy Mace’s crusade against Representative Ilhan Omar has dredged up an old, Islamaphobic rumor.The pair were going back and forth on X Wednesday, ahead of a scheduled floor debate over Omar’s potential censure, and Mace referred to the Minnesota lawmaker as “Somalia Ilhan Omar.”“Is your ridiculous censure about me being born in Somalia? Because that’s just as crazy as you are,” wrote Omar.But then Mace reached for the top shelf to offend her colleague.“Who knows, maybe it’ll be about you marrying your brother next!” Mace responded. “Tune in!”MAGA conservatives have rumbled for years—without evidence—that Omar married her brother to bring him into the United States. The conspiracy first emerged during Omar’s 2016 campaign for the Minnesota state legislature, in a since-deleted post on the conservative blog Power Line, where an anonymous source was quoted as saying that Omar’s ex-husband, Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, was related to her by blood.Omar has vehemently and repeatedly denied the unfounded allegations, which have been disproven by her marriage certificate. At the time, Omar described the insinuation that she had married her brother to be “absurd and offensive.”But that hasn’t stopped Mace from digging the details back up. Over the last week, Mace has advocated stripping Omar of her committee assignments and censuring her, and has publicly suggested that Omar should be deported back to Somalia for having allegedly “smeared Charlie Kirk and implied he was to blame for his own murder” during an interview with Zeteo’s Mehdi Hasan. Clips from that interview were similarly picked up by far-right personalities, who claimed that Omar had said Kirk deserved to die. But that’s not accurate.“No one said he deserved to die. Ilhan Omar said the exact opposite to me,” Hasan wrote on X. “She condemned his killing. And she said her heart goes out to Kirk’s widow.”Omar also pushed back against Mace, arguing that she never made the comments that Mace was attempting to silence her for.“Her [resolution] does not contain a single quote from me because she couldn’t find any,” Omar said. “Unlike her, I have routinely condemned political violence, no matter the political ideology. This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor.”Even other Republicans didn’t appear to galvanize behind Mace’s cause, apparently wiping their hands of the South Carolinian’s vendetta.“It just seems like every week or so we want to censure somebody for something,” Texas Representative Troy Nehls told Fox News’s Chad Pergram on Tuesday. “A lot of people say a lot of stupid stuff around here.”Ironically, Mace’s mudslinging comes just days after she insisted that she never bad-mouthed her Democratic colleagues.Read more about Kirk:MTG Embraces Charlie Kirk’s True Legacy When Discussing TPUSA FutureMost Recent PostThe Trump administration has finally managed to make something significantly cheaper for Americans: cocaine. The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump has been committing so much manpower to fight dual wars on fentanyl and immigration that he’s opened up a new and fruitful hole in the drug trafficking ecosystem, which Mexican cocaine trafficker Nemesio “Mencho” Oseguera and his Jalisco cartel have filled with record amounts of cocaine in the United States—and at a new low cost. Record levels of cocaine production in Colombia are driven by the fentanyl crackdown near the border and a significant surge in usage here in the U.S. Now prices for the powder have fallen to $60–$75 per gram, a 25 percent decrease, according to researcher Morgan Godvin. “The price of pure cocaine has plummeted,” he told the Journal. The 2016 arrest of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s more recent crackdown on his cartel, the Sinaloans, handicapped Mexico’s top fentanyl trafficking cartel. Trump’s overzealous deportation campaign has also pulled officers away from two main fentanyl checkpoints along the southern border.The U.S. has placed a $15 million bounty on Oseguera. This news comes as the Trump administration conducted drone strikes on what it claims were two speedboats carrying cocaine and fentanyl from Venezuela in the Caribbean. Trump has made multiple threats of military intervention against cartels, even positing bombing Mexican soil. Oseguera reportedly transports his product via speedboat, from Colombia and Ecuador to Mexico. As the economy continues to struggle, Americans everywhere can now powder their noses for cheap thanks to Trump.Editor’s PickSo You Want a Civil War?

The fact that MAGA rapper Forgiato Blow, aka Kurt Jantz, is even a thing proves white conservatives never really hated “gangsta rap;” it’s just that their idea of a gangster is a Klan member doing a lowercase-t-walk instead of the C-walk. They’re fine with all the stuff about killing Black men, though. It appears that Blow has responded to the slaying of his favorite white nationalist podcaster, Charlie Kirk, by teaming up with some country singer named JJ Lawhorn to produce a song about lynching Black people. Now, in his track titled “Good vs. Evil” (which I can only imagine is called that because he looks like Evil Bubba Sparxxx), Blow doesn’t explicitly suggest Black people should be lynched in the “public executions” he wants to “bring back.” He just has Lawhorn singing about “a big tall tree and a short piece of rope” to “hang ‘em up high at sundown” and “leave ‘em swinging so the folks all know you don’t mess around in our town” — and, no, no no — this doesn’t sound like Klan-inspired reconstruction era fantasy camp at all! Blow also makes it a point to rap, “We don’t judge by skin, we judge by soul” — right before he starts rapping exclusively about cases where Black men are accused of murdering white people while dropping the N-word with the hard “R.” Blow mentioned the killings of Austin Metcalf, Laken Riley, and Iryna Zarutska, who he said was “killed by a “n****r.” Seriously, what in the white su-premcee is going on here? It’s interesting that, last year, Paul Build-That-Wall was at a Trump rally shouting about how “most Black men hate Kamala Harris.” But now, Trump’s in office and he’s mourning Kirk — who was known for spreading propaganda about “prowling Blacks” attacking white people at random — so now MAGA Mathers and his discount Jason Aldean sidekick are free to sing about lynching Black men. It’s almost as if white MAGA supporters are race-baiting opportunists who don’t actually care about Black people until they need our votes. The fact is, data consistently shows violent crime is at the lowest it has been in decades across the country, and, at any rate, the data has always shown that most violent crime is intraracial, meaning a white person is far more likely to be attacked by another white person than anyone else, despite what right-wing podcasters claim — which leads me to my next point… What’s really perplexing about MC Klan’s new pro-hate crime song is that, on Instagram, nearly every clip he has shared of it includes a reference to Charlie Kirk’s demise. WTF did Black people do to Kirk? Once again, y’all, the man who shot the grand wizard of podcasts (and the Milli Vanilli of good-faith debates) was a white man who killed his fellow white man at a white college in white-ass Utah. We were somewhere minding our collective business at the time. So, why TF is Blow on IG sharing his new lynch-happy carol with captions like this: “I’m done being silent in my faith! Im done being a silent conservative, I’m no longer concerned that truth may hurt your feelings. Jesus is coming back and we are all part of his mission! I am Charlie Kirk!” It’s almost as if no matter who these noose-loving Nazis are mad at, they just default to anti-Blackness. Also, when the hell has Crack Miller ever been silent? MAGAmore was on stage with the Proud Boys, loudly stumping for Trump just a few years ago. The same year, Machine Gun KKKelly was trolling “snowflakes” in an embarrassing rap video featuring teen (trafficking) sensation Rep. Matt Gaetz. In 2023, Vanilla Lice (I feel like I’ve used that one before) shot a video on the set of far-right media site One America News (OAN). Forgiato Blow has never been “silent,” but, booooy, we wish he would be. The MAGA whites are unhinged, delusional, deplorable, and as exhausting as ever now that their favorite racist talking head is dead — which, again (and again, and, again, and again,) has nothing to do with Black people. Leave us TF alone!

It’s a well-documented trait.\n\nIn fact, it was among the first things in Mr Trump’s extensive record of personal dramas to cause him trouble when he entered politics a decade ago. Very early in the campaign, a debate moderator confronted him with a list of insults he’d aimed at various women, calling them “fat pigs”, “dogs”, “slobs” and “disgusting animals”. All very charming.\n\nMr Trump responded, in characteristically unrepentant fashion, and with all the wit of a 10-year-old in the school playground who just completed sex ed, by implying the journalist who asked about it had been mean to him because she was on her period.\n\nThe President has a beautifully simple defence, however, to any allegations of sexism: he is not just a bit of a prick to women. He’s a bit of a prick to everyone! Men, no less often than women, cop the wrath of his caps lock on social media, or of the words that pour forth from his mouth with vacillating levels of coherence and spittle.\n\nWe all know someone like this, don’t we? Someone whose behaviour is so consistently egregious that you can never pin them down on anything specific? “Oh, don’t worry about Donald, he’s like that to everyone.” There’s a threshold of dickheadedness beyond which nothing can shame you anymore, and Mr Trump’s life is a lesson in how to exploit it.\n\nSo forget the insults for a moment. Let’s talk about the way Mr Trump compliments women, which reveals just as much about him.\n\nThat’s often the case, no? When people are trying to be nice, when they are not being defensive, their shields come down. You see what they value in other human beings.\n\nWe saw multiple examples of that today from Mr Trump, as he was hosted by Britain’s royal family on a state visit to the country.\n\nFlattering words were uttered. All the usual diplomatic niceties were observed. Mr Trump hobnobbed graciously enough with Charles and William. He managed to make his speech at the state dinner, largely about himself, but with kind words for the royals too. That’s all classic, harmless Trump stuff.\n\nAnd he offered praise for Kate. Or Princess Catherine, if you prefer. Personally, I find royal titles boring in the 21st century, but given we’re probably what, 20 years away from another referendum on the monarchy, we’ll keep a lid on that for now.\n\n“You’re beautiful. So beautiful,” Mr Trump told the Princess as she and her husband greeted him at Windsor Castle.\n\nKate gave him an obliging smile, because that is what her job required of her: to pretend that she was positively thrilled to be called physically attractive by a flabby 79-year-old who had previously pursued her mother-in-law.\n\n(I can call him flabby, because I’m flabby too. Those are the rules. Nobody aside from my wife, presumably, is less happy about the situation than I am.)\n\nMr Trump said something similar during his speech at the subsequent state dinner.\n\n“To see Her Royal Highness Princess Catherine so radiant and so healthy and so beautiful, it’s a great honour,” he remarked.\n\nThe woman just survived cancer. You couldn’t come up with a more substantive compliment? How about “resilient”? Or “courageous”, or “inspiring”, or “indomitable”? Pick any adjective, really, that speaks to Kate as a human being, rather than as something to look at. Give me about 30 seconds, and I could write you something more appropriate.\n\n“I’m honoured to be in the presence of Princess Catherine, whose resilience in the face of a terrible diagnosis is inspiring for all of us.” Or whatever. It’s not difficult.\n\nI can hear your protests already: I’m making too much of this. Maybe. But this is a pattern, from Mr Trump, of putting ... goodness, how do I word this without making it seem creepy as hell? Of judging women by their physical attractiveness.\n\nWe’re not far removed from the President praising White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt for having “that face” and “those lips, the way they move”. (He did, to be fair, also mention “that brain”, which is encouraging.)\n\nWe’re not that far removed from him saying, ‘She’s got the best body,’ as an endorsement of his own daughter, Ivanka.\n\nPut it this way. If Mr Trump had walked up to Prince William and said, ‘You’re beautiful. So beautiful,’ we would have questioned whether he’d suffered a sudden aneurysm. When he says it to William’s wife, there is no reaction whatsoever. There’s a double standard. That tells us something about Mr Trump, and about ourselves.\n\nAnother hypothetical: Mr Trump was required, at multiple points last year, to interact with Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff. He didn’t tell Doug, “you’re beautiful”. Of course he bloody didn’t. That would have been patronising.\n\nIt’s partly a problem with picking – and sorry, I don’t mean this as an insult to any of our older readers – someone who grew up in the 1950s to lead the world’s most powerful country in 2025. Biden was no better in that regard. Mr Trump is multiple generations removed from the median of modern society, and my goodness, it shows.\n\nIt’s also a problem with Mr Trump, specifically. It’s a problem with how he views the world and the women who live in it. It is not intentionally malicious. But he is, nevertheless, a bloke who thinks the highest compliment you can give a woman is that she looks good.\n\nWatch the footage of Kate’s face while she was humouring the President today. She looks like a mother doing her best to maintain her patience with a toddler. She is 43; the toddler is 79.\n\nAnd listen to the speech from King Charles at the state dinner, which treated Mr Trump’s visit as entirely normal, when it was anything but.\n\n“In striving together for a better world, we also have a precious opportunity to safeguard and to restore the wonders and beauty of nature for the generations who follow us. We share the ambition and determination to preserve our majestic lands and waters; above all, to ensure that we have clean water, clean air and clean food,” Charles said, in probably the most substantive part of the speech.\n\nIt felt so very, very symptomatic of the Earth we now inhabit.\n\nThe King is still behaving as though Donald Trump is a normal US president. Kate still observes the niceties. While Mr Trump keeps stomping around in all his smugness, all his arrogance, never learning, never adjusting, never reflecting, the relic of a worldview that expired decades ago.","summary":"Donald Trump undoubtedly thought he was being nice to Princess Catherine.

Spencer Cox Has Been Preaching Calm in a Violent Moment—But There’s Something Missing","text":"Since the murder of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk last week in Utah, the state’s Republican governor, Spencer Cox, has won plaudits for his general moderation. In his press conferences and TV appearances, he was perhaps the lone member of his party to remind Americans that the person most responsible for killing Kirk was the young man who shot him.\n\n“We can return violence with violence. We can return hate with hate, and that’s the problem with political violence—is it metastasizes,” he said in a Friday press conference after Kirk’s alleged shooter was apprehended. “Because we can always point the finger at the other side. And at some point, we have to find an off-ramp, or it’s going to get much, much worse.”\n\nStepping into the role of national mediator has been a natural fit for Cox. He has spent the past couple of years trying to get Americans to find common ground through his “Disagree Better” initiative at the National Governors’ Association. He toured the country touting volunteering as an antidote to our social and political polarization while promoting conflict resolution tools for people to use around the dinner table and in political conversations. And he helped organize events with ideological opposites like Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Amy Coney Barrett to model respectful disagreement as a defense against political violence.\n\nCox sees in the aftermath of the Kirk shooting a chance for his Mormon-dominated state to lead the country away from the brink. “Maybe, just maybe, there’s a path forward for our country that comes through the great people of Utah,” he told the Atlantic’s McKay Coppins over the weekend.\n\nShowing the country how to pull back from the brink, however, will require more concrete action than just calling on people to put down their phones and “touch grass,” as he said on Friday. “Interventions to reduce affective polarization will be ineffective if they operate only at the individual, emotional level,” wrote Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in a September 2023 essay reviewing the existing studies on the subject. She explains that the country’s current divisions often stem less from individual polarization than from structural issues and “partisan incentive structures to win at all costs in order to win ultimate power.”\n\n“Political violence is not random,” Barbara Walter, international affairs professor at UC San Diego and the author of How Civil Wars Start and How to Stop Them, told Politico recently. “Research shows it becomes far more likely under four conditions: when democracy is declining rapidly, when societies are divided by race, religion or ethnicity, when political leaders tolerate or encourage violence, and when citizens have easy access to guns.”\n\nLike much of the country, Utah, with an increasingly diverse population and its famously lax gun laws, checks all of those boxes. And while Cox neither tolerates nor encourages violence, he has helped undermine democracy through one of the state’s most divisive political controversies: partisan gerrymandering.\n\nStarting with Texas, Republicans across the country have recently launched an arms race of mid-cycle partisan redistricting to respond to President Donald Trump’s request to further suppress Democratic representation in Congress. Utah, however, doesn’t need to take such drastic measures because Republicans have already spent 25 years crushing the ability of Democrats and independents to have a meaningful voice in state politics.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jim Dabakis, who was chair of the Utah Democratic Party during the 2011 redistricting, once described it as “the American political process at its ugliest, meanest, and most selfish, where legislators are picking their voters, instead of having the voters pick the legislators.”\n\nRepublicans make up about half of all 2 million registered voters in Utah. The last time the state elected a Democratic governor was in 1980. But nearly 600,000 voters aren’t affiliated with either party. Many of them vote like the state’s 280,000 registered Democrats. In 2024, while only about 15 percent of voters were registered as Democrats, nearly 40 percent of statewide voters pulled the lever for Kamala Harris for president. Most of those liberals are concentrated in Salt Lake County, where Harris actually beat Trump, winning 53 percent of the vote.\n\nYet those numbers aren’t reflected in the state’s congressional representation, which is solidly Republican (and male). The state legislature draws electoral boundaries and, for more than two decades, Republicans have maintained a veto-proof supermajority. The legislature is 80 percent Republican and 98 percent white in a state that’s now nearly 17 percent Hispanic. Nine out of every ten seats are also held by Mormons, even though only 60 percent of Utah residents today are LDS.\n\nCox served briefly in the state legislature before being appointed lieutenant governor in 2013, and then elected governor in 2020. He seems to understand why people in his state are unhappy about gerrymandering. “There is nothing in the history of our country that makes people angrier and makes them lose trust than when they feel like the government is not being responsive to them,” he said at an event recently. That doesn’t mean he’s done anything to change the situation. In fact, he’s supported it.\n\nThe case of Rep. Jim Matheson is instructive. Back in 2000, he was Utah’s sole Democrat in Congress, and his district consisted entirely of Salt Lake County. But the following year, Republicans who couldn’t beat him at the ballot box tried to get rid of him by redrawing his district. The new district’s configuration predicted that a generic Republican should be able to win it by at least 15 points. But Matheson was a Blue Dog and the popular son of the state’s last Democratic governor, Scott Matheson. He continued to get reelected.\n\nBecause of its rapid population growth, Utah earned a fourth congressional seat after the 2010 census. So, in 2011, the legislature once again tried to redistrict Matheson out of office, this time changing his district boundaries to cover even less of Salt Lake County and more rural areas. In 2012, Matheson switched to the new district, which was heavily Republican but covered more of Salt Lake City. He narrowly won that race, too.\n\nMatheson retired in 2014, and the seat passed to the late Republican Mia Love. But the district proved remarkably competitive, and in 2018, Democrat Ben McAdams bumped off Love. He was defeated in 2020 by the current office holder, former NFL player Burgess Owens.\n\nAfter all these GOP efforts to consolidate their power, many Utah voters were fed up. In 2018, they narrowly passed a ballot initiative that banned partisan gerrymandering and created an independent redistricting commission charged with drawing up nonpartisan election districts. The state legislature, however, quickly repealed the new law in 2020. The following year, after only 90 minutes of floor debate, they passed an egregious new congressional map that cracked the Salt Lake area into four districts, ensuring that Democratic voters didn’t make up more than about 22 percent of any of them. \n\nBy this time, Cox was governor, and state residents protested at the Capitol and called on him to veto the map. He approved it anyway, arguing that the legislature would simply overrule him if he did otherwise. “I’m a very practical person. I’m not a bomb-thrower, and I believe in good governance,” he said at the time. “I’ve been told that a veto just for the sake of a veto is something that I should do. I just think that that’s a mistake.”\n\nCox’s failure to defy his party for the sake of democracy is one reason why many state voters saw his “Disagree Better” campaign as disingenuous at best. After all, it’s hard to disagree better when you’re not even allowed a seat at the table.\n\nBut that could soon change.\n\nGood government groups who’d help pass the 2018 ballot initiative sued over the new maps in 2022, arguing that the legislature had violated Utahns’ rights to participate in free elections. The state legislature asked the Utah Supreme Court to block the lawsuit. Cox filed an amicus brief supporting the GOP-led legislature. In 2024, the court ruled that the legislature had overstepped its authority in thwarting the will of the people expressed in the 2018 ballot initiative and allowed the case to move forward.\n\nOn August 25, 2025, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson, who was appointed by Cox’s predecessor, Republican Gary Herbert, threw out partisan redistricting maps and ordered legislators to come up with fair, nonpartisan redistricting in keeping with the 2018 ballot initiative. The legislators have until September 25 to comply so that fair maps are in place for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nAfter Gibson issued her August order, furious Republican legislators began looking for any way to avoid following the order, up to and including threats to remove Gibson from the bench. Even Trump weighed in on the decision.\n\n“Monday’s Court Order in Utah is absolutely Unconstitutional,” he wrote on Truth Social. “How did such a wonderful Republican State like Utah, which I won in every Election, end up with so many Radical Left Judges? All Citizens of Utah should be outraged at their activist Judiciary, which wants to take away our Congressional advantage, and will do everything possible to do so. This incredible State sent four great Republicans to Congress, and we want to keep it that way. The Utah GOP has to STAY UNITED, and make sure their four terrific Republican Congressmen stay right where they are!”\n\nCox also opposed the judge’s decision to throw out the partisan maps, suggesting that it was now Democrats who wanted to win an unfair advantage. “Democrats in our state desperately want a district, even though Republicans outnumber them three to one in the state,” he said. “The only way to get a Democratic district in the state is to gerrymander.” \n\nIn fact, nonpartisan maps proposed by an independent commission would give Democrats a much better shot at winning a single congressional seat, but mostly the new maps would make all the districts more competitive, which democracy advocates say is the preferred way to force partisans to compromise for the public good.\n\nLate Monday, the Utah Supreme Court ruled against the legislators and upheld Gibson’s order, raising the possibility that after the long fight for better democracy, Utah voters might prevail. Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, one of the groups that helped pass the ballot initiative, thinks it’s possible. “Utah is a special place,” she told me. “I am optimistic that the legislature and governor will show the country that the ‘Utah way’ still exists in such a polarized world by finally enacting the fair maps that Utahns voted for.”\n\nGiven its history, though, the state GOP is clearly not going to give up without a fight. Like many places, Utah has a vocal minority of GOP extremists and conflict entrepreneurs who have steadily been pushing the state to the right. They have been a persistent problem for more moderate Republicans like Cox.\n\nWhen he appeared at Utah’s GOP nominating convention in the spring of 2024, Cox was booed by the state’s radical, MAGA diehards who made up most of the delegates. He lost the vote to Phil Lyman, a Republican state representative who was pardoned by former President Donald Trump for a trespassing charge he picked up for driving an ATV in an illegal protest on public lands in 2014. Cox had to get on the ballot through statewide signature collections the same way Mitt Romney did in 2018.\n\nHe was reelected last year with only 53 percent of the statewide vote, underperforming Trump by 7 points. Going so far as to buck his own party to support fair redistricting may be even more fraught for Cox than pushing back on the president, which he has also refused to do.\n\nYet, in a sign of the volatility of the current situation, even Cox’s mild calls for calm over the past week have been met with outrage from the far right nationally. “Cox represents the dead Republican Party that is just too gutless to engage here and wants to look the other way,” MAGA luminary Steve Bannon fumed on his War Room podcast Monday. He accused Cox of upstaging FBI director Kash Patel and harboring too much sympathy for LGBTQ people. “Cox is part of the problem.”\n\nFacing down such criticism isn’t for the faint of heart. But conflict researchers say such leadership is critical to de-escalating a highly polarized situation, and that even changing the language of the debate, as Cox seems to be trying to do, is an important step.\n\nRobert Pape is director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST) at the University of Chicago. “Political violence is like a wildfire,” he told me last year. “You need both combustible mass material—dry wood—and you also need a trigger, like a lightning strike or a cigar butt.” The Kirk murder certainly qualifies as a trigger. But Pape said violence isn’t inevitable. The outcome depends heavily on what political leaders do. “Leaders can act either as a trigger or a damper.”","summary":"Since the murder of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk last week in Utah, the state’s Republican governor, Spencer Cox, has won plaudits for his general moderation.

This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish,” said Kimmel, who has often poked fun at Trump.\n\nOn the day Kirk was shot, Kimmel took to Instagram to condemn the attack and send “love” to the 31-year-old activist’s family.\n\nA suspect, 22, has since appeared in court charged with aggravated murder.\n\nShortly after ABC announced Kimmel had been suspended, President Trump wrote in a social media post: “The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”\n\nKimmel is one of the top chat show personalities in the US. He has fronted his show Jimmy Kimmel Live! since 2003 and hosted the Oscars four times.\n\nAfter he was taken off air, Kimmel left the show’s studio on Hollywood Boulevard wearing a flannel shirt and cap and rode away in a car without comment.\n\nFans of the show, who had been queuing up to join the live audience, expressed disappointment about the cancellation.\n\nJanna Blackwell, who was on holiday from Virginia, told the BBC: “You know, this is getting ridiculous and stupid.\n\n“Freedom of speech. He shared his opinion and is being cancelled. To me that is bizarre.”\n\nA small protest was also held outside the studio with a sign saying “Trump must go now”.\n\nSome prominent Hollywood figures spoke out against Kimmel’s suspension, with actor Ben Stiller sharing the news on X and commenting: “This isn’t right.”\n\nHacks star Jean Smart, who won an Emmy on Sunday, wrote on Instagram that she was “horrified at the cancellation”, adding: “What Jimmy said was free speech, not hate speech”.\n\nActress Jamie Lee Curtis posted an Instagram story with one of Kimmel’s own quotes from earlier in the year. “I don’t believe anybody should be cancelled, I really don’t,” he said in April.\n\nOther figures showing their support included singer John Legend and actor Josh Gad, while actress Alison Brie described the news as “unreal and very scary”.\n\nThe ABC announcement came just after one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, Nexstar Media, said it would not air Jimmy Kimmel Live! “for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight’s show”.\n\nNexstar said the comedian’s remarks about Kirk were “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse”.\n\n“[We] do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,” said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division.\n\nThe chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, thanked Nexstar “for doing the right thing” and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead. Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for its planned $6.2bn (£4.5bn) merger with Tegna.\n\nSinclair, the largest ABC affiliate group in the US, followed suit. It said it would air a special remembrance programme dedicated to Kirk this Friday during the original time slot for Kimmel’s show.\n\nFCC head Carr, a Trump appointee, had earlier criticised Kimmel’s monologue.\n\nThe head of the US communications regulator said on Wednesday that the ABC host had shown “the sickest conduct possible” and he urged Disney to take action.\n\n“[Broadcasters] have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,” the Trump appointee told the Benny Show, a conservative podcast.\n\nHe noted that an apology from Kimmel would be a “very reasonable, minimal step”.\n\nBut Anna Gomez, the only Democratic member of the FCC, criticised Carr’s remarks.\n\nShe posted on X that “an inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship or control”.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America (WGA), Hollywood’s labour union, condemned the decision to take Kimmel off air as a violation of constitutional free speech rights.\n\n“Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth,” it said in a statement.\n\nSag-Aftra, another union, said the move was “the type of suppression and retaliation that endangers everyone’s freedoms”.\n\nA person familiar with Kimmel’s situation told CNBC that the host had not been fired, adding that bosses at the network intended to speak to the comedian about what he should say when he goes back on air.\n\nKimmel is the latest late-night host to see his programme run into issues as more viewers turn to streaming over traditional network viewing.\n\nIn July, rival network CBS announced it would end The Late Show With Stephen Colbert next year after 11 seasons.\n\nNetwork executives said the move was “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount”.\n\nHowever, Colbert tore into the network and its parent company over the decision.\n\nHe accused CBS of leaking financial figures to the press, and alluded to a $16m (£13.5m) settlement with Trump after he sued the network over an interview its 60 Minutes programme did last year with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nThat payout came several months after the Disney-owned ABC agreed to pay $15m (£12m) to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit after its star anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely and repeatedly said during an interview that the president had been found “liable for rape”.\n\nA jury in a civil case had determined Trump was liable for “sexual abuse”, which has a specific definition under New York law.

You can question Kimmel’s sense of taste, but you would expect a champion of free speech to leap to his defence.\n\nTrump has done the opposite and even took time out during his state visit to Britain to post his approval of Kimmel’s silencing on his Truth Social social media outlet.\n\nNo one has ever accused Trump of having a sense of irony. But you would like to think that he paused for just a moment to consider the inconsistency of praising the virtues of free speech in his Windsor Castle banquet speech, and shortly afterwards celebrating the demise of someone for exercising that supposed cherished freedom.\n\nIt reveals the crude truth about Trump’s definition of free speech: you can say anything you like as long as you don’t criticise him. Nor was he merely commenting on the censorship of Kimmel from the sidelines: his departure seems to have been the direct result of action by Trump’s allies in the US.\n\nHis show was cancelled by the ABC network after pressure on its owners, Disney, from Brendan Carr, the head of America’s media regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. Carr called Kimmel “truly sick” and accused him of “lying to the American people”. Carr just happens to have been appointed to his role by, yes, you guesssed it, Donald Trump.\n\nRespected US media commentator Stephen Battaglio of the Los Angeles Times said of Carr on the Today programme: “He is an agent of Donald Trump. He wakes up in the morning and the first thing he asks himself is ‘how can I please the President?’” As Mr Battaglio pointed out, Charlie Kirk, the outspoken pro Trump advocate assassinated at a Utah Valley University event last Wednesday, was himself a passionate advocate of free speech. “He said a lot of things that were loathsome to many people. However, he was willing to go into the arena and debate and challenge people who didn’t agree with him. I cannot imagine he would have approved of something like this in his memory.” \n\nMr Battaglio said Disney TV chiefs who had buckled to pressure could rue the day they dumped Kimmel at Trump’s behest. It could lead to other celebrities and broadcasters horrified at the way someone could be “shutdown for something they said in a moment of creative expression” refusing to go on ABC shows in a show of support for Kimmel. Mr Battaglio said: “There could be a wider reaction to this that Disney may come to regret.” It is too soon to tell whether that will happen, although US show business figures including actors Ben Stiller, Wanda Sykes and Jean Smart have already criticised the firing of Kimmel. Compare and contrast Kimmel’s fate with that of Brian Kilmeade, a presenter on Trump’s beloved Right wing Fox TV. Kilmeade recently called for mentally ill and homeless people to be killed. As US comedian Paul Scheer observed: “So let me get this straight. Kimmel is off the air for his comments about the politicisation of an assassination but this is totally fine.” Kilmead later apologised for his remarks. \n\nIt is hard to grasp the breathtaking degree of Trump’s hypocrisy in the Kimmel affair. Judging from his outrage, one imagines he would be even more angry if Kimmel accused him of having a “low IQ” and falsely claimed he had lied about being born in America. Except Kimmel did not say those things. Both were insults hurled by another former TV show host, Trump himself - about Democrat opponents Kamala Harris and Barack Obama. Before narcissist Trump and vice president JD Vance next lecture Britain on the free speech, they should look in the mirror first.","summary":"Instead of leaping to the defence of those who seek to speak without fear or favour, the President of the United States is revelling in their demise, says Simon Walters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jimmy-kimmel-axed-trump-free-speech-hypocrisy-b2828967.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/18/1/19/SEI266575382.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QVtxFSgG-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-18 10:30:08","author":"Simon Walters","authors":["Simon Walters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.101},{"id":361478408,"title":"Trump’s suit against the New York Times is nonsense. Yet it poses a grave threat | Robert Reich","text":"Donald Trump has sued the New York Times for, well, reporting on Trump.\n\nRather than charging the Times with any specific libelous act, Trump’s lawsuit is just another of his angry bloviations.\n\nThe lawsuit says he’s moving against “one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party”. And so on.\n\nAt least he sued the Wall Street Journal’s parent company for something specific: reporting Trump’s birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein (which Trump continues to deny is his even though it showed up in the Epstein files released by a US House committee).\n\nLast year, Trump sued ABC and its host George Stephanopoulos for having said that Trump was found liable for rape rather than “sexual abuse” in the civil suit brought by E Jean Carroll. The network settled for $16m.\n\nTrump sued CBS for allegedly editing an interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes to make her sound more coherent. CBS also agreed to pay $16m.\n\nDefamation lawsuits are a longstanding part of Trump’s repertoire, which he first learned at the feet of Roy Cohn, one of America’s most notorious legal bullies.\n\nIn the 1980s, Trump sued the Pulitzer-winning Chicago Tribune architecture critic Paul Gapp for $500m, for criticizing Trump’s plan to build the world’s tallest building in Manhattan, a 150-story tower that Gapp called “one of the silliest things anyone could inflict on New York or any other city”.\n\nTrump charged that Gapp had “virtually torpedoed” the project and subjected Trump to “public ridicule and contempt”. A judge dismissed the suit as involving protected opinion.\n\nBut such lawsuits are far worse when a president sues. He’s no longer just an individual whose reputation can be harmed. He’s the head of the government of the United States. One of the cardinal responsibilities of the media in our democracy is to report on a president – and often criticize him.\n\nThe legal standard for defamation of a public figure, established in the 1964 supreme court case New York Times Co v Sullivan, requires that public officials who bring such suits prove that a false statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nThat case arose from a libel suit filed by LB Sullivan, the police commissioner of Montgomery, Alabama, against the New York Times for an advertisement in the paper that, despite being mostly true, contained factual errors concerning the mistreatment of civil rights demonstrators.\n\nThe supreme court ruled in favor of the Times, finding that the ad was protected speech under the first amendment and that the higher standard of proof was necessary to protect robust debate on public affairs.\n\nUnder this standard, there’s no chance Trump will prevail in his latest lawsuits against the Times or Wall Street Journal. Nor would he have won his lawsuits against ABC and CBS, had they gone to trial.\n\nBut Trump hasn’t filed these lawsuits to win in court. He has sought wins in the court of public opinion. These lawsuits are aspects of his performative presidency.\n\nABC’s and CBS’s settlements are viewed by Trump as vindications of his gripes with the networks.\n\nHe’s likewise using his lawsuit against the New York Times to advertise his longstanding grievances with the paper.\n\nHis lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal is probably intended to send a message to the Journal’s publisher, Rupert Murdoch, that Trump doesn’t want Murdoch to muck around in the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\nThese lawsuits also put the media on notice that Trump could mess up their businesses.\n\nNot only is it expensive to defend against them, requiring attorneys’ fees, inordinate time from senior executives, and efforts to defend the media’s brand and reputation. When a lawsuit comes from the president of the United States, who also has the power to damage a business by imposing regulations and prosecuting the corporation for any alleged wrongdoings, the potential costs can be even bigger.\n\nWhich presumably is why CBS caved rather than litigated. Its parent company, Paramount, wanted to be able to sell it for some $8bn to Skydance, whose CEO is David Ellison (scion of the second-richest person in America, Oracle’s Larry Ellison). But Paramount first needed the approval of Trump’s Federal Communications Commission – which held up the sale until the defamation lawsuit was settled.\n\nHere we come to the central danger of Trump’s wanton use of personal defamation law. The mere possibility of its use – coupled with Trump’s other powers of retribution – have a potential chilling effect on media criticism of Trump.\n\nWe don’t know how much criticism has been stifled to date, but it’s suggestive that a CBS News president and the executive producer of 60 Minutes resigned over CBS’s handling of the lawsuit and settlement, presumably because they felt that management was limiting their ability to fairly and freely cover Trump.\n\nAmong the capitulations CBS’s owners made to the Trump administration was to hire an “ombudsman” to police the network against so-called bias – and the person they hired was Kenneth R Weinstein, the former president and chief executive of the conservative-leaning Hudson Institute thinktank.\n\nIt’s also suggestive that CBS ended Stephen Colbert’s contract, despite the fact that Colbert’s show is the highest-rated late-night comedy show on television. He’s also one of the most trenchant critics of Trump.\n\nIf we need any more evidence, on Wednesday ABC pulled off the air another popular late-night critic of Trump – Jimmy Kimmel – because Kimmel in a monologue earlier this week said “[w]e hit some new lows over the weekend with the Maga gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.\n\nABC announced the move after Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC, appeared to threaten ABC, and its parent company Disney, for airing Kimmel’s monologue — ominously saying: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”\n\nJeff Bezos, executive chair of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, has muzzled the paper’s editorial page, prohibiting it from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and imposing a stringent set of criteria on all editorials and opinion columns, which has led to the resignations of its opinion page editor and a slew of its opinion writers.\n\nTrump hasn’t sued the Washington Post for defamation, but Bezos presumably understands Trump’s potential for harming his range of businesses and wants to avoid Trump’s wrath.\n\nMake no mistake. Trump’s efforts to silence media criticism of him and his administration constitute another of his attacks on democracy.\n\nWhat can be done? Two important steps are warranted.\n\nFirst, the New York Times v Sullivan standard should be far stricter when a president of the United States seeks to use defamation law against a newspaper or media platform that criticizes him.\n\nInstead of requiring that he prove that a false statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth, he should have to prove that the false statement materially impaired his ability to perform his official duties.\n\nBetter yet, a president should have no standing to bring defamation suits. He has no need to bring them. Through his office he already possesses sufficient – if not too much – power to suppress criticism.\n\nSecond, antitrust authorities should not allow large corporations or ultra-wealthy individuals with many other business interests to buy major newspapers or media platforms. They cannot be trusted to prioritize the public’s right to know over their financial interests in their range of businesses.\n\nThe richest person in the world was allowed to buy X, one of the most influential news platforms on earth, and has turned it into a cesspool of rightwing lies and conspiracy theories.\n\nThe son of the second-richest person in the world now oversees CBS.\n\nThe fourth-richest person now owns the Washington Post.\n\nThe Disney corporation, with its wide range of business enterprises, owns ABC.\n\nThe problem isn’t concentrated wealth per se. It’s that these business empires are potentially more important to their owners than is the public’s right to know.\n\nIf Democrats win back control of Congress next year, they should encode these two initiatives in legislation.\n\nDemocracy depends on a fearless press. Trump and the media that have caved in to him are jeopardizing it and thereby undermining our democracy.\n\n Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Many conservatives fear that we have passed a threshold where civilized discussion seems impossible. When you kill the man whose entire career was based around dialogue with the other side, and on their turf, how can you expect those who remain after him to do the same?\n\nBut we don’t honor Kirk’s memory by shrinking from the hard work of persuasion. How, then, should we react? Returning to business as usual and hoping the Left will police its own rhetoric is nothing short of naïve. If the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump wasn’t enough to sober their tone, why would we expect a successful attack to do so? One look at social media reveals that many on the Left have no remorse, but openly revel in the carnage their words helped incite.\n\nTherefore, those seeking to preserve a civilized country must draw lines in the sand for acceptable political speech. We must do this from the highest institutional levels to the most basic personal interactions. \n\nWe’ve reached a point where rhetoric that demonizes opponents isn’t just reckless, it’s fatal, and we should demand its end. The words “fascist” and “Nazi” have no place being thrown around in American discourse except to refer to members of openly neo-Nazi organizations. The leader of the Aryan Brotherhood is a Nazi. Donald Trump is not.\n\nThese words have been the core of the leftist strategy to demonize the Right in recent years. Rather than call their opponents wrong, or misguided, or even stupid, the Left declared that they were Nazis, fascists, and white supremacists. They framed ordinary disagreement — and taking positions that were almost universally held just a few years ago — as a denial of someone’s existence and as sending someone to their death. \n\nNearly every Democrat employs this insidious tactic. Joe Biden does it. Kamala Harris does it. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez does it. It has become endemic of Democratic political strategy, and it has directly led to the rise of political violence and fanaticism on the left. \n\nTheir twisted logic goes that if “Nazis” are winning elections, if they are growing in power and influence through democratic means, they must be stopped, even if by brutality. \n\nThis is the thought process of a tormented 22-year-old man who climbs onto a roof with a bolt-action rifle and bullet cartridges inscribed with anti-fascist language. It was leftist rhetoric that killed Charlie Kirk.\n\nWe must insist that the use of this rhetoric end immediately. \n\nThose who use those words should be treated the same way society treats people who casually drop the “N-Word.” We don’t tolerate it, we demand that it stop, and if it doesn’t, we disassociate with those who do it. Political discourse should have a new “N-word” and a new “F-word” moving forward. We should not platform those who spew these words. We should call out the media when it does. We should not associate with people or companies that allow such messages on their platforms. And employers should terminate employees who use that rhetoric. \n\nGENERATION RAGE: AMERICAN YOUTH HERALD A NEW AGE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE\n\nFreedom of speech does not protect people from the consequences of their speech. And it does not shield them from being shamed and isolated by their peers. The power of association is one of the most potent tools we have to punish those who refuse to stop using such dangerous rhetoric.\n\nWe must step back from the vitriolic language that has come to define this age of American politics. If we do not, political violence will become the norm. And no one will be safe. It will come for our neighbors. It will come for our spouses. It will come for our children. We must do this for them. We must come back to the table, pick up that bloodstained microphone, and be willing to talk like Charlie did.\n\nBethany Shah is a partner at Jackson Walker LLP in Houston, Texas.

Instead, it’s reviving it. For years, the media promised America’s youngest generation would walk away from faith, embrace abortion, and lock in a progressive future.\n\nBut the opposite is happening. Church pews are filling up with young faces. Surveys show Gen Z is now more likely than millennials to attend worship weekly, and priests report a surge of young adults pouring into Catholic parishes. The antireligious youth movement that the Left banked on never showed up.\n\nTrump was also dismissed. He was supposed to be a “New York liberal” who would never govern as a pro-lifer. Instead, he has cut Planned Parenthood funding, protected conscience rights, appointed justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, and surrounded himself with one of the most pro-life, Catholic administrations in history.\n\nThe most pro-life president in American history has been embraced by the most pro-life generation in American history. Both were written off. Both proved the experts wrong.\n\nGen Z was labeled as abortion activists in waiting. Instead, it’s emerged as the first truly pro-life generation at its age. One reason is that every member of Gen Z grew up staring at their own ultrasound photo — watching science testify to their humanity before birth. They don’t need slogans to know when life begins.\n\nThe pro-life cause has always been a movement of converts, uniting women who’ve had abortions, former abortion doctors, and even ex-Planned Parenthood workers. Their change of heart wasn’t emotion. It was science and reason. Gen Z reflects the same reality. They are skeptical of empty narratives and trust what they can see. And what they’ve seen has made them the most pro-life generation yet.\n\nLike Trump, Gen Z doesn’t trust the system. His “drain the swamp” message resonated with a generation shut out of their own graduations by COVID-19 lockdowns, silenced by blatant social media censorship, and treated by the government as if they were too naïve to see through the lies.\n\nBoomers distrusted Washington and ran left. Gen Z distrusted Washington and ran right. Just as Trump bypassed the gatekeepers of legacy media by going straight to podcasts and social platforms, Gen Z gets its news outside the establishment. That shared skepticism forged a powerful alliance.\n\nTrump also connected with Gen Z on culture. He’s a celebrity who doesn’t beg for celebrity approval. They respected that. Hollywood’s constant outrage never moved them. Even Taylor Swift’s high-profile endorsement of 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris fell flat. That endorsement, combined with Beyoncé’s non-concert, was supposed to be the youth-vote knockout punch. Not so much.\n\nGen Z isn’t impressed by Hollywood lectures. It wants authenticity. That’s why it responded to Kirk. And Trump, blunt and unapologetic, became the “cool grandpa” who doesn’t BS the kids.\n\nThat’s why in 2024, 40% of women under 30 voted for Trump. The political class swore young women would scream their devotion to abortion “rights” from the rooftops. They didn’t. Instead, they voted for the president who stood for life without apology.\n\nTrump and Gen Z have delivered the most surprising political outcomes of the last decade. Both shattered the limits that the establishment tried to put on them. Both leaned into faith, life, and traditional values when doing so was supposed to be toxic.\n\nTHE AWAKENING FEW SEE COMING\n\nThe media wanted Trump and Gen Z to be each other’s undoing. Instead, they became the allies that delivered the political victory. And much of that is due to Kirk.\n\nHe showed that life, faith, and freedom aren’t relics of the past but instead light the way to a bright future — not the future the Left predicted, but the future the Left fears, and most of all, the future of the unborn, the voters of tomorrow. This could be the most powerful aspect of Kirk’s legacy.\n\nShawn Carney is the president and CEO of 40 Days for Life, the world’s largest pro-life organization, and bestselling author of four books, including What to Say When 2: Your Proven Guide in the New Abortion Landscape.

But How Does He Fare in a Podcast Studio?","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nIf the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election could be summed up in the style of Dustin Hoffman learning about plastics in The Graduate, it would be: Podcasts. (“One word, Benjamin: Manosphere.”)\n\nDonald Trump went on every show he could; Kamala Harris didn’t. And in the contemporary “attention economy,” as lab-grown paid-media sound bites lose their potency, Trump won decisively with the part of the electorate whose last-minute votes are guided by vibes and auras—also known as the most important part of the electorate.\n\nThat’s not really the entire story of 2024, but it’s true as far as it goes, and many of the Democrats who appear to be considering 2028 candidacies certainly seem to believe it. These fellows (and they are entirely fellows) are laser-focused on the power of streaming chit-chat: California Gov. Gavin Newsom has his own personal pod, as does Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear; former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg doesn’t, but he’s appeared on at least 14 others since March. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy have been similarly prolific in their guesting. California Rep. Ro Khanna is essentially a podcast in human form. Mansplaining, it would seem, is back in a big way.\n\nNone of those figures, though, has made as much noise IRL recently as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The governor’s effort to prevent Donald Trump from deploying the National Guard to Chicago by promising ferocious legal and political resistance has, at least temporarily, succeeded. This has led naturally to speculation that he might be “the guy”—a leader who can arrest Trumpist authoritarianism while also positioning himself for 2028.\n\nThe case for Pritzker is easy to make. He has publicly called on other Democrats to stop being so equivocal and cautious all the time, aligning himself with his party’s fed-up primary voters. But he is not a socialist, and has never advocated the kind of radical positions—defunding the police, putting billionaires in work camps, etc.—that are assumed, among influential centrists, to be poisonous with the general public. This makes some sense, because he is a billionaire and former venture capital executive himself. And while that’s a potential liability with certain lefty subgroups, he has handled it well by leaning into the big-bossman tycoon/warlord character that his fans have developed for him online. (He’s also been open to discussing and joking about his robust build.) Franklin D. Roosevelt, Pritzker’s supporters will have you know, was also a traitor to his class.\n\nWhat of his long-form audio skills, though? Does Pritzker have “the juice” in the format in which the campaign is expected to be won and lost? How does he fare in front of a hanging microphone, at a circular table, in a small studio with a neon sign that says BACON hanging behind him on a wall? Could he field questions about vaping, sports gambling, and raw milk for three hours from a 26-year-old named Jaydyn whose take on politics is that it’s “just so crazy sometimes”?\n\nI listened to Pritzker’s recent appearances on comedian Hasan Minhaj’s interview show and the American Fever Dream podcast to explore the question. And I regret to report to Pritzker’s fans that the answer to “Will he have what it takes in the crucible of the BACON studio?” is probably not. The governor, in these settings, was an amiable but not especially compelling guest. The coin of the realm on such shows is small-talk riffing and discursive, big-ideas bullshitting, and he excelled at neither. He does not have the podcast juice, or at least does not have it yet.\n\nOn American Fever Dream—a left-leaning program “dedicated to curing the collective malaise brought on by our chaotic political environment”—his response to a question about how Democrats can do a better job communicating with voters was indicative. This is a question any 2028 aspirant must expect, and it presents a dual opportunity: to show empathy for the working-class voters who’ve been leaving the party, and to make the case that one’s personal agenda—abundance, affordability, the rule of law, more Obamaphones, whatever!—would be a winning agenda. Here’s what Pritzker said:\n\n I think, in this country of—we have to get our message through to people. We have to make sure that there are platforms that we all subscribe to and are part of where we can get that message out. And then I think, you know, there have to be people who sit in important positions, governors, senators, and so on, who share our values, who are out on the hustings all the time, pushing that and coming onto programs like yours, right? A podcast like yours and, and just, you know, talking about what’s real. I don’t think Democrats have done enough of that, just being themselves, talking about what it is that really matters to average folks out there, and to the most vulnerable Americans.\n\nI’ve seen this question answered better in the last month by a state Senate candidate in Iowa—and by Fever Dream host Sami Sage, who, after describing the paranoid and defensive posture that the right wing encourages in American men, suggested that Democrats should try instead to “trigger their protective instinct towards things that actually need protecting.” Timely, memorably worded, sort of galaxy-brained—that’s podcast gold! Compare that to Pritzker’s wandering, generic “we need to communicate better by communicating better” take, which is something that anyone could have said, including, respectfully, former President Joe Biden.\n\nThat Pritzker doesn’t have a natural feel for such material is a bit surprising given his history in venture capital, a cultural space that celebrates the visionary elevator pitch. His mouth sometimes trails behind his brain; he told Minhaj he believed in protecting “the powerless” against “the most powered.” He drops press-release filler language like “railed against” and “running roughshod” into what is supposed to be casual conversation. And like many Democrats, he suffers from “Working Families” syndrome, using the phrase as a disfluent utterance in the way that others might say “um,” “like,” and “you know.” There are classes you can take for that, sir!\n\nThis is not necessarily just a public-speaking problem. Successful presidential candidacies are usually driven by a unifying idea that appeals to voters’ ideals and material interests alike. As a loyal Democrat, what would it say about you to support J.B. Pritzker? As an undecided voter, what would you get out of it? If you struggle to fill airtime on podcasts about big thoughts, maybe it’s because you haven’t done enough big thinking. When Pritzker finds himself explaining why he does what he does, he often falls back on the vague language of noblesse oblige—that “we” have a responsibility to “lift up” or “stand up” for “the vulnerable.” It’s patronizing, like something that would be said at a charity gala—and while well-meaning, potentially inadequate to a historically skeptical and cynical era. A let’s-do-good message may not be big enough to “meet the moment,” that is, when the nature of the moment is that everyone feels like things are going wrong everywhere, not just for the downtrodden folk on the news.\n\nSo should you be shorting Pritzkercoin on Polymarket? I’m not saying that. There are other forums to which he is well suited, like theatrically combative press conferences and high-stakes Sunday show segments. In these settings, he conveys confidence, toughness, and being-in-chargeness. He has a command of facts about how government works and what it should and shouldn’t do; his explanation on Face the Nation of how national and state/local authorities already cooperate on drug interdiction and gun violence in Chicago—without any help from the National Guard—is a good example of this. That’s meeting the moment with the force it calls for!\n\nSo should you be buying J.B. Pritzker on Polymarket? No, because the election is not until 2028 and there will be an entirely different set of national problems, zeitgeist sub-demographics (Abundance Dads?), and perhaps even mediums of communication (horizontal video????) to worry about by then. It’s also worth adding that Democrats maybe shouldn’t stake all their party’s hopes on finding a charismatic political genius messiah figure to put at the top of the national ticket; while this has been successful more often than you might think, they’re still only finding such a person at a rate of one every two decades. There are in theory other ways to construct a party besides an informal nationwide talent search for the man or woman with the most podcast juice. How? I don’t have space to get into all of it here, but it’s the kind of thing you could discuss for hours on end, if someone would give you the time.","summary":"The case for Pritzker is easy to make.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/09/jb-pritzker-democrats-chicago-vs-trump-podcasts.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/887009a2-8a09-411c-ae81-b791c96fdf42.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 09:45:00","author":"Ben Mathis-Lilley","authors":["Ben Mathis-Lilley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.284},{"id":361522964,"title":"Trump reveals a pattern as he tightens his grip","text":"Donald Trump has sued the New York Times for, well, reporting on Trump.\n\nRather than charging the Times with any specific libelous act, Trump’s lawsuit is just another of his angry bloviations.\n\nThe lawsuit says he’s moving against \"one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party.” And so on.\n\nAt least he sued The Wall Street Journal’s parent company for something specific — reporting Trump’s birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein (which Trump continues to deny even though it showed up in the Epstein files).\n\nLast year, Trump sued ABC and its host George Stephanopoulos for having said that Trump was found liable for rape rather than \"sexual abuse\" in the civil suit brought by E. Jean Carroll. The network settled for $16 million\n\nTrump sued CBS for allegedly editing an interview with Kamala Harris on \"60 Minutes\" to make her sound more coherent. CBS also agreed to pay $16 million.\n\nDefamation lawsuits are a longstanding part of Trump’s repertoire, which he first learned at the feet of Roy Cohn, one of America’s most notorious legal bullies.\n\nIn the 1980s, Trump sued the Pulitzer-winning Chicago Tribune architecture critic Paul Gapp for $500 million, for criticizing Trump’s plan to build the world’s tallest building in Manhattan, a 150-story tower that Gapp called \"one of the silliest things anyone could inflict on New York or any other city.”\n\nTrump charged that Gapp had \"virtually torpedoed\" the project and subjected Trump to \"public ridicule and contempt.\" A judge later dismissed the suit as involving protected opinion.\n\nBut such lawsuits are far worse when a president sues. He’s no longer just an individual whose reputation can be harmed. He’s the head of the government of the United States. One of the cardinal responsibilities of the media in our democracy is to report on a president — and often criticize him.\n\nThe legal standard for defamation of a public figure, established in a 1964 Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, requires that public officials who bring such suits prove that a false statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nThat case arose from a libel suit filed by L.B. Sullivan, the police commissioner of Montgomery, Alabama, against the New York Times for an advertisement in the paper that, despite being mostly true, contained factual errors concerning the mistreatment of civil rights demonstrators.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Times, finding that the ad was protected speech under the First Amendment and that the higher standard of proof was necessary to protect robust debate on public affairs.\n\nUnder this standard, there’s no chance Trump will prevail in his latest lawsuits against the Times or Wall Street Journal. Nor would he have won his lawsuits against ABC and CBS, had they gone to trial.\n\nBut Trump hasn’t filed these lawsuits to win in court. He has sought wins in the court of public opinion. These lawsuits are aspects of his performative presidency.\n\nABC’s and CBS’s settlements are viewed by Trump as vindications of his gripes with the networks.\n\nHe’s likewise using his lawsuit against the New York Times to advertise his long standing grievances with the paper.\n\nHis lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal is intended to send a message to the Journal’s publisher, Rupert Murdoch, that Trump doesn’t want Murdoch to muck around in the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n\nThese lawsuits also put the media on notice that Trump could mess up their businesses.\n\nNot only is it costly to defend against them — requiring attorney’s fees, inordinate time of senior executives, and efforts to defend the media’s brand and reputation.\n\nWhen a lawsuit comes from the president of the United States who also has the power to damage a business by imposing regulations and prosecuting the corporation for any alleged wrongdoings, the potential costs can be huge.\n\nWhich presumably is why CBS caved rather than litigated. Its parent company, Paramount, wanted to be able to sell it for some $8 billion to Skydance, whose CEO is David Ellison (scion of the second-richest person in America, Oracle’s Larry Ellison). But Paramount first needed the approval of Trump’s Federal Communications Commission — which held up the sale until the defamation lawsuit was settled.\n\nHere we come to the central danger of Trump’s wanton use of personal defamation law. The mere possibility of its use — coupled with Trump’s other powers of retribution — have a potential chilling effect on media criticism of Trump.\n\nWe don’t know how much criticism has been stifled to date, but it’s suggestive that a CBS News president and the executive producer of “60 Minutes” resigned over CBS’s handling of the lawsuit and settlement, presumably because they felt that management was limiting their ability to fairly and freely cover Trump.\n\nIt’s also indicative that CBS ended Stephen Colbert’s contract. Colbert’s show is the highest-rated late night comedy show on television. He’s also one of the most trenchant critics of Trump. \n\nAmong the capitulations CBS’s owners made to the Trump administration was to hire an “ombudsman” to police the network against so-called bias — and the person they hired was Kenneth R. Weinstein, the former president and chief executive of the conservative-leaning Hudson Institute think tank.\n\nNote also that on Wednesday ABC pulled off the air another popular late-night critic of Trump — Jimmy Kimmel — because Kimmel in a monologue earlier this week charged that Trump’s “MAGA gang” was trying “to score political points” from Charlie Kirk’s assassination. \n\nABC announced the move after Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, appeared to threaten ABC, and its parent company Disney, for airing Kimmel’s monologue —ominously threatening: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”\n\nJeff Bezos, owner of Amazon and related businesses, has muzzled the editorial page of the Washington Post — prohibiting it from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and imposing a stringent set of criteria on all editorials and opinion columns, which has led to the resignations of its opinion page editor and a slew of its opinion writers.\n\nTrump hasn’t sued the Washington Post for defamation, but Bezos presumably understands Trump’s potential for harming his range of businesses and wants to avoid Trump’s wrath.\n\nMake no mistake. Trump’s efforts to silence media criticism of him and his administration constitute another of his attacks on democracy.\n\nWhat can be done? Two important steps are warranted.\n\nFirst, the New York Times v. Sullivan standard should be far stricter when a president of the United States seeks to use defamation law against a newspaper or media platform that criticizes him.\n\nInstead of requiring that he prove that a false statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth, he should have to prove that the false statement materially impaired his ability to perform his official duties.\n\nBetter yet, a president should have no standing to bring defamation suits. He has no need to bring them. Through his office he already possesses sufficient — if not too much — power to suppress criticism.\n\nSecond, antitrust authorities should not allow large corporations or ultra-wealthy individuals with many other business interests to buy major newspapers or media platforms. They cannot be trusted to prioritize the public’s right to know over their financial interests in their range of businesses.\n\nThe richest person in the world was allowed to buy X, one of the most influential news platforms on earth, and has turned it into a cesspool of rightwing lies and conspiracy theories.\n\nThe family of the second-richest person in the world now owns CBS.\n\nThe third-richest person now owns the Washington Post.\n\nThe Disney corporation — with its wide range of business enterprises — owns ABC. \n\nThe problem isn’t concentrated wealth per se. It’s that these business empires are potentially more important to their owners than is the public’s right to know.\n\nIf Democrats win back control of Congress next year, they should encode these two initiatives in legislation.\n\nDemocracy depends on a fearless press.

Gavin Newsom posted a somber denunciation of the violence as “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible.” It was a step back from the governor’s relentless attacks on the Trump administration, one part in a multipronged rebellion that has brought Mr. Newsom a wave of national attention.\n\nFrom his California perch, the governor has spearheaded challenges to President Donald Trump’s agenda, which has had outsize impact on the Golden State – most notably on immigration, domestic use of the U.S. military, and congressional redistricting. At the same time, he has amped up his offense on social media, taunting Mr. Trump and his MAGA loyalists. The tone resonates beyond California: A recent poll from Emerson College shows Mr. Newsom leading among candidates for the Democratic Party’s 2028 presidential nomination.\n\nIn February, the governor hosted Mr. Kirk for his inaugural podcast – the first in a line of MAGA figures to join Mr. Newsom for conversations he hoped would bridge political divides. Now, says conservative strategist Rob Stutzman, the governor has a new strategy.\n\n“Circumstances changed. An opportunity came to him, and demand in his party grew to resist” Mr. Trump and his government overhaul, says Mr. Stutzman. “He’s a shapeshifter.”\n\nExperts say Mr. Newsom is recognizing how to capture the attention economy, and his rise in popularity reveals a Democratic hunger for someone who can effectively stand up to President Trump.\n\nMr. Newsom is among a group of governors seeking to fill a gap in party leadership. His break from the field is emerging as a test case for other presidential hopefuls searching for the combination of policy and messaging that could give Democrats a chance to win the White House in 2028.\n\nThe governor’s style and its popularity mark a shift in attitude among voters, says Democratic strategist Kevin Liao.\n\n“Folks are distinguishing between the politics of the past, when you could operate in a more passive manner and things will go okay,” says Mr. Liao.\n\nAs the president turns his focus to other cities and states – sending National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., and announcing a similar plan for Memphis – Mr. Newsom has established a model for how to respond “on behalf of your constituents, but also how to make the most of it for your political aspirations,” adds Mr. Liao.\n\nA challenge to troops in LA\n\nA key for Governor Newsom, says Mr. Stutzman, “is that he has not had to manufacture a conflict with Trump. It’s not contrived.”\n\nCalifornia, with more foreign-born residents than any other state, has been a center of the Trump administration’s immigration policy overhaul. In June, Mr. Trump ordered the state’s own National Guard to occupy parts of Los Angeles.\n\nThat power play stoked the governor’s strengths. “Gavin Newsom can be a pretty effective fighter on certain issues, and I think that’s when you saw it start again within this context,” says Lori Cox Han, the Doy B. Henley Chair of American Presidential Studies at Chapman University.\n\nShortly after the National Guard arrived, California sued the administration for federalizing troops to execute civil law enforcement in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. Earlier this month, a federal judge agreed with the state, but the Trump administration is appealing. (The troops have been allowed to stay, though most were sent home in July and August.)\n\nThat court decision has been closely watched by others.\n\nIn August, after Mr. Trump sent troops to Washington, the District of Columbia’s attorney general sued the administration using the same argument California had made successfully. Still, the president has said he might send the National Guard into other Democratic-led cities such as Chicago and Baltimore. Governors in those states have pushed back, in part saying such a move would be unconstitutional.\n\nThese confrontations allow new voices to come forward with novel solutions, says Shana Kushner Gadarian, a political science professor at Syracuse University. And governors are in position to gain national followings in a way that members of Congress might not.\n\n“They have their own constituencies that they are there to represent, but also they have the ability to capture media attention and be very clear and forceful, because they don’t have to deal with Trump in the Washington policymaking arena,” says Dr. Gadarian.\n\nMr. Newsom, a term-limited governor, is taking advantage of his best options to gain political traction before he leaves office in a year and a half, says Mr. Stutzman. “I think he’s capitalized on [the circumstances] so far superbly in order to get himself into the supreme leader position at this point.”\n\nA response to Texas redistricting\n\nIn response to Republican states’ redistricting efforts to strengthen the party’s hold in Congress, Mr. Newsom pushed through a special election to allow his state, a Democratic powerhouse, to redraw its own districts. If successful, California could offset conservative gains in Texas.\n\nProposition 50, which would temporarily change California’s congressional map, faces opposition for overriding the state’s independent redistricting process. But it could have a significant impact on national politics, and Mr. Newsom is appealing to donors nationwide with a high-profile fundraising campaign.\n\nHe is building his national campaign infrastructure, says Mr. Stutzman. That support accrues to the governor even if Proposition 50 loses, he adds.\n\nIf the redistricting is successful, and California and sends more Democrats to Congress, Governor Newsom can say he bolstered the party’s power, says Dr. Han. “That is his argument for, ‘I’ve done something successful to stop Trump, stop these MAGA Republicans.’”\n\nOn social media, a new narrative\n\nEarlier this summer, Mr. Newsom and his team supercharged his momentum with a shift to sharper social-media messaging, mimicking Mr. Trump’s style of combative posting. The governor’s Instagram following grew 30% in the past month, to more than 3 million followers. And his office told Politico the governor’s campaign accounts gained nearly 3 million followers across X, TikTok, Substack, and Instagram.\n\nMr. Newsom is mirroring President Trump’s irreverent tone and use of self-aggrandizing AI images, writing in all caps and posting memes that mock the president and MAGA. Those all-caps posts on X saw sharp spikes in sharing, according to a Washington Post analysis.\n\n“Newsom got the memo,” says Steven Fish, a political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley, whose book “Comeback” explores political dominance. “It’s about having a narrative and dominating the conversation. It’s not about who’s got the better facts, the more appealing policies.”\n\nThe governor, says Dr. Fish, is changing how people view the president’s style, which at first seemed “absurd … but then people got used to it. What Newsom is doing is re-abnormalizing those things.”\n\nFor Democrats, who can win in ’28?\n\nEstablishing a strong voice that cuts through the noise of politically polarized rhetoric is crucial to any candidate’s success, experts say, even more so than substance like policy records. That’s particularly true for Democrats, who are trying to dig out of the lowest favorability ratings for either party in three decades.\n\nThat sort of combativeness, done right, recognizes high stakes and gives a candidate authenticity, says Dr. Kushner.\n\nMr. Newsom’s political goals come with baggage, as he was mayor of far-left San Francisco and now heads a liberal state. Even Democratic voters have been skeptical: In the Emerson poll where he now leads, Mr. Newsom trailed both Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris three months ago.\n\nHis new branding has caused more people to rethink his electability, says Mr. Liao, the Democratic consultant. But “these spots at the top can be short-lived,” he says.\n\nMaintaining this offense takes stamina, and with three years to go until the next presidential election, there’s plenty of time for someone else to step into the spotlight.\n\n“Newsom is seeing a moment,’’ explains Mr. Liao. “But ultimately, what that primary electorate is going to look at is who can win.’’","summary":"California Gov.

We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said in a podcast interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson that aired Wednesday.\n\n“Disney needs to see some change here, but the individual licensed stations that are taking their content, it’s time for them to step up and say this, you know, garbage to the extent that that’s what comes down the pipe in the future isn’t something that we think serves the needs of our local communities.”\n\nAfter Carr spoke, Nexstar Media Group said it would stop airing the show on its 32 ABC affiliates, citing Kimmel’s comments. Nexstar, which needs FCC approval for its $6.2 billion deal to acquire smaller rival Tegna, drew praise from Carr, who thanked Nexstar for “doing the right thing.”\n\nShortly after Nexstar announced its decision, ABC, which holds FCC-approved licenses for the local broadcast affiliates that it owns, also said Kimmel would be pulled from the air.\n\n“‘Jimmy Kimmel Live’ will be preempted indefinitely,” an ABC spokesperson said, without elaborating.\n\nSinclair, the nation’s largest ABC affiliate group, then said it would not air Kimmel’s show, even if ABC decides to bring it back, unless “appropriate steps” were taken. Sinclair called on Kimmel to apologize and said it would air a tribute to Kirk in Kimmel’s time slot on Friday.\n\nKimmel, who was seen on Wednesday leaving the El Capitan Theatre where his show is taped, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump cheers, democrats criticize\n\nAs broadcasters took action, Trump applauded the news in a post on Truth Social while also calling on Comcast-owned NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, the hosts of late-night comedy shows on the network who often make jokes at Trump’s expense.\n\n“Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,” Trump said.\n\nDemocrats in turn criticized the removal of Kimmel from the air, with Senator Ed Markey calling it “censorship in action.”\n\nFCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the FCC’s only Democratic member, said U.S. free-speech laws should prevent the FCC from telling broadcasters what they can air.\n\n“This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression,” she told CNN.\n\nTrump has repeatedly sued, berated and threatened media companies whose coverage he disputes with legal or other action.\n\nTrump this week filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times and book publisher Penguin Random House, accusing them of treating him unfairly.\n\nCBS-parent Paramount paid $16 million in July to resolve a civil suit over what Trump alleged was the network’s deceptive editing of an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nABC in December paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ on-air description of the president’s conduct in the E. Jean Carroll case.\n\nFollowing Kirk’s killing, political analyst Matthew Dowd was fired from MSNBC after he described the activist as a “divisive” figure who spread “hate speech,” and added “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions.”\n\nMSNBC president Rebecca Kutler issued a statement apologizing for Dowd’s comments, which she said were “inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable.”\n\nWashington Post columnist Karen Attiah said on Monday she was fired by the newspaper over a series of social media posts she made following the killing of Kirk, including one in which she noted Kirk’s past comments on Black women.\n\nThe Post has said it does not comment on personnel matters and the newspaper’s union condemned the firing.","summary":"LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON: Walt Disney-owned ABC said on Wednesday it was pulling “Jimmy Kimmel Live” off the air, after comments by the late-night show’s host about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk prompted a threat by the head of the top U.S. communications regulator against Disney.\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pressured broadcasters to stop airing content he has found objectionable, celebrated the news in a social media post.\n\n\nA number of Democratic lawmakers assailed the decision, saying free speech was under attack.\n\n\nThe suspension of Kimmel’s show marked the latest action taken against media figures, academic workers, teachers and corporate employees over their remarks about Kirk following his assassination.\n\n\nRepublican leaders and conservative commentators have warned Americans to mourn Kirk respectfully or suffer consequences, and some people have been fired or suspended after discussing the killing online.\n\n\nKimmel, who has frequently targeted Trump on his late-","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40383401/disneys-abc-yanks-jimmy-kimmel-live-off-air-after-remarks-about-kirk","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/09/18135044032428a.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 08:51:10","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.003},{"id":361599282,"title":"South Park abruptly pulls first episode following Charlie Kirk assassination","text":"Strictly Come Dancing\n\nBig Brother\n\nGreat British Bake Off\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Sep 18th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Park abruptly pulls first episode following Charlie Kirk assassination\n\n Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS, US ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:21:16 BST, 17 September 2025 |Updated:08:43 BST, 18 September 2025 \n\nComedy Central has confirmed that South Park will not air its planned new episode this Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday, the network revealed it would be postponing it by one week.\nThe delay comes as the satirical series continues to face scrutiny in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was lampooned in an earlier episode this season.\n'Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don't get it done,' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted in a statement. 'This one's on us. We didn't get it done in time. Thanks to Comedy Central and South Park fans for being so understanding. Tune in next week!'\nThough Comedy Central had done none of its usual promotion for the shelved episode, fans speculated it might address Kirk's killing, given the show's tendency to riff on breaking news.\nAfter Kirk's assassination, some of his MAGA supporters lashed out at the series, claiming it had fueled hostility toward him.\n\nComedy Central has confirmed that South Park will not air its planned new episode this Wednesday\nOne user accused South Park of 'fomenting the hatred necessary to get Kirk assassinated,' while another went so far as to say Parker and Stone were 'responsible.'\nIn response, Comedy Central quickly pulled the episode, titled Got a Nut, featuring Kirk's parody character from its live broadcast schedule the night of the shooting.\n\n Read final texts Charlie Kirk suspect Tyler Robinson sent trans lover after assassination \nThe bizarre episode follows school counselor Mr. Mackey pursuing a career with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after he loses his job due to federal budget cuts. \nParody versions of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump and Vice President JC Vance appear.\nWhile Noem shoots at innocent dogs and Trump is seen in bed with the devil, the plot also follows character Eric Cartman, who imitates Kirk. \nCartman launches a podcast and starts debating 'woke, liberal students,' just as Kirk was known for doing. \nIn one portion of the show, Cartman fights with a college student on the topic of abortion, mirroring Kirk's blunt and combative style and his physical features. \nBut the Kirk-mocking character is battling the student virtually as he sits on a toilet bowl - a dig at the real-life conservative commentator. \n\nThe delay comes as the series continues to face scrutiny in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , who was lampooned in an earlier episode this season; seen in March 2025\nIn another scene, 'master debater' Cartman tackles another Kirk-esque influencer hosting a rally at a college campus and takes over the show - Bible in hand. \nIt still remains available on Paramount+.\nBefore his death, Kirk himself took the parody in stride. \nHe proudly reposted a clip from the episode and later told Fox News he was flattered by the attention.\n'Honestly, my first reaction is that I kinda laughed,' he said at the time, describing himself as a lifelong South Park fan. \nHe continued: 'They're going to obviously make fun of me… but I think it's kind of funny and it kind of goes to show the cultural impact and the resonance that our movement has been able to achieve.'\n'We as conservatives should be able to take a joke,' he added. 'We shouldn't take ourselves so seriously.'\n\n'Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don't get it done,' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone (seen in July 2025) admitted in a statement\nThis season of South Park is airing bi-weekly, with new episodes now slated for Sept. 24, Oct. 15, Oct. 29, Nov. 12, Nov. 26, and Dec. 10.\nKirk, 31, was assassinated while taking questions from the crowd at Utah Valley University last Wednesday. \nKirk leaves behind his wife Erika Frantzve, with whom he had a three-year-old daughter and a son, 16 months. \nKnown for spreading his Catholic faith, traditional values and conservative stances to America's youth and young adults through college campus debates, Kirk was killed during the first stop of his American Comeback Tour. \nWhat began as a normal one of Kirk's famous college student encounters ended in bloodshed when a single bullet struck his neck around 12pm local time.\nTerror ensued throughout the crowd as blood spilled from his neck while he tipped back in his chair.\n\nRing-winged influencer Charlie Kirk (pictured) eerily spoke about gun violence as he was gorily assassinated at a Utah Valley University Rally\n\nAfter the gun shot rang, panic ensued among the masses, causing them to flee the scene (pictured) \nHis death was announced a few hours later by President Donald Trump. \nIn honor of the passionate podcast host, Trump declared that all American Flags across the nation will be lowered to Half Mast until Sunday evening. \n'This is a dark day for our state, it’s a tragic day for our nation,' Republican Governor Cox said.\n'I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination.' \nKirk's death sparked chaos among the House of Representatives - with Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for his assassination after House Speaker Mike Johnson requested a prayer in his honor.\n\nKirk leaves behind his wife Erika Frantzve , with whom he had a three-year-old daughter and a son, 16 months (pictured: Kirk and his family)\nBut leaders across party lines have spoken out against the sickening act of violence, condemning politically-driven violence. \n'I am deeply disturbed by the shooting in Utah. Doug and I send our prayers to Charlie Kirk and his family,' Kamala Harris wrote on X. \n'Let me be clear: Political violence has no place in America. I condemn this act, and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence.'\nIn official remarks about Kirk, Trump said he is 'filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination.\n'Charlie inspired millions and tonight, all that knew him and loved him are united in shock and horror.'\nCharlie KirkSouth Park\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSouth Park abruptly pulls first episode following Charlie Kirk assassination\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 275\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Or Bill Clinton playing the saxophone.\n\nBut there have been very few occasions where US politicians have been able to determine the fate of late-night.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples, Dr Taveira says, also suggests its peril.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, a 1960s variety show, was abruptly yanked by CBS because of its persistent opposition to the Vietnam War, support of civil rights and criticism of authority.\n\nThe brothers responded to their firing by filing a breach of contract lawsuit, in which CBS lost and ultimately had to pay.\n\n\"Don't tell a comedian not to say a certain word. For sure they'll do it,\" Dick Smothers said in 2019.\n\nIn the wake of 9/11, Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect was also cancelled when he called the US military's bombing \"cowardly\".\n\nIn response, The White House asked for people to \"watch what they say and watch what they do.\"\n\nA second Trump term redefines the rules\n\nIn Mr Trump's first term, Colbert made a joke likening the president's mouth to Russian president Vladimir Putin's \"c*** holster\".\n\nHe later apologised but not to the president.\n\nInstead, Colbert directed his words at the LGBTQIA+ community for any implied homophobia.\n\nIt may be the best example to contrast late-night's relationship between the first and second Trump administrations.\n\n\"I think [Mr Trump] sees mainstream television, journalism, against him,\" Dr Taveira says.\n\n\"And in the second term, he is getting revenge. Essentially, I think he's motivated by vengeance.\"\n\nOne guaranteed way to get even is lawsuits.\n\nIn December, the US's ABC — the same broadcaster that aired Kimmel's show — agreed to give $US15 million ($23 million) to Mr Trump's presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over comments made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nParamount — former home to Colbert — will pay Mr Trump $US16 million ($24 million) to settle a lawsuit over an interview with former presidential rival Kamala Harris.\n\n\"These are commercial ventures,\" Dr Taveira says, of the sway these lawsuits may have on the axings.\n\n\"The whole point of network television and radio is to sell audiences to advertisers.\n\n\"There has been this kind of imbuing of popular culture with a great social and political importance, and as a scholar of mass media, I wouldn't want to underplay that.\n\n\"But, at the same time, to find one's kind of political lodestones in mass-produced pop culture objects and texts, I think you're going to be disappointed a lot of the time.\"\n\nStill, he says, it hints at Mr Trump's growing influence over his critics.\n\nPop culture as an easy target\n\nDespite priding itself on anti-cancel culture, the demise of Colbert and Kimmel have been largely supported by the MAGA crowd.\n\nDemocrats too, have veered away from any real signs of outrage over a gradual degradation of free speech, Dr Taveira points out.\n\n\"The Trump administration is happy to encourage the curtailment of free speech when it is speech that is against them,\" he says.\n\n\"Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places. But I'm just struck by the kind of acceptance of, you know, 'this is the way things are now'.\"\n\nAll in all, it paints a grim future for late-night and its strength \"as a site for contesting power\".\n\n\"That's a kind of a truism of cultural studies that messages get encoded by say, late-night talk show hosts or comedians, then they get decoded,\" Dr Taveira says.\n\n\"In that process, historically, there has been a kind of flexibility. So, you can take the meanings that you want from media.\n\n\"It would seem to me that the encoding is becoming so strong that you cannot take more than one message away.\n\nPerhaps Hacks best gets it right.\n\nIn a penultimate episode, Jean Smart's Deborah Vance is faced with the possibility of abandoning her dream of being a late-night host or abandoning her morals.\n\nShe chooses the former.\n\nIn a rousing monologue, Smart's Deborah climbs to a crescendo in front of a captive audience of millions: \"You can try to silence me but you'll never —\".\n\nBut it's too late. Her feed has been cut.","summary":"Emmys watchers could assume there's never been a better time in Hollywood to hold its most powerful to account, but Jimmy Kimmel's axing proves otherwise. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-18/jimmy-kimmel-stephen-colbert-late-night-in-trump-america/105788394","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a976f9abd06f6e161718cb391f0dd33d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=563&cropW=1000&xPos=0&yPos=31&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 07:13:15","author":"Tessa Flemming","authors":["Tessa Flemming"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.027},{"id":361472372,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel pulled off the air.

The decision comes amidst Republican criticism toward Kimmel for recent comments about right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk's killer.\n\n Jimmy Kimmel slams Trump's response to Charlie Kirk shooting\n\nAnnounced on Wednesday evening, Jimmy Kimmel Live!'s suspension came not long before filming for its next episode had been scheduled to commence. The long-running talk show's future is now unclear, with the looming possibility that its 22-year run may come to an abrupt end.\"Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be pre-empted indefinitely,\" an ABC spokesperson told CNN.The decision followed an announcement from Nexstar Media Group that its ABC-affiliated stations will not air Jimmy Kimmel Live! \"for the foreseeable future,\" citing objections to Kimmel's comments on Kirk's death.Why has Jimmy Kimmel Live! been suspended?\n\n window.videoEmbeds = window.videoEmbeds || [];\n window.videoEmbeds.push({\n elemId: 'video-container-01K5E3WM6CXCS7AZ70E1T3E1WW',\n data: {\"slug\":\"-j3YdxNSzTk\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=-j3YdxNSzTk\",\"start_time\":\"\"},\n videoPlayerType: 'in-content'\n\nWhile ABC has not officially stated why it has halted Kimmel's talk show, threats from the Trump administration appear to be a driving factor. Hours prior to ABC's announcement, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr accused Kimmel of deliberately lying about the motives of Kirk's killer, and called for the network to take action against him.Specifically, Carr took issue with comments Kimmel made during his monologue on Monday, in which the talk show host joked about Republicans' reactions to Kirk's death.\"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said.Kirk's suspected killer Tyler Robinson was arrested within two days of the fatal shooting, his motives quickly becoming an issue of widespread speculation and debate. Kimmel's monologue did not unequivocally claim that Robinson was right-leaning, only that Republicans have vehemently denied it as a possibility. Even so, his statement was not well-received by conservatives.\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson on Wednesday. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct — to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\" This appears to be an allusion to the FCC's ability to pull the entire ABC network off air, a measure which, while drastic, is not outside the realm of possibility. The FCC is responsible for issuing broadcast licences, without which television networks cannot operate. Carr noted that the FCC can also revoke such licences, stating that they come with \"an obligation to operate in the public interest.\" As such, Carr stated that broadcasters may run the risk of losing their licenses if they continue to air content which displays a \"pattern of news distortion\" — an offence of which Kimmel is accused.\"There's calls for Kimmel to be fired,\" said Carr, stating that a public apology from Kimmel would be a \"minimal step.\" \"I think you could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this. Again, the FCC is going to have remedies that we could look at.\"Trump reacts to Jimmy Kimmel being pulled off air\n\n Then-presumptive Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump was a guest on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in 2016.\n Credit: Mashable edit: Randy Holmes / Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images; @realDonaldTrump via Truth Social\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly called for ABC to lose its licence, accusing the network of being biased and airing \"97% BAD STORIES\" about him. He subsequently reacted to ABC's suspension of Kimmel with glee, taking to his social media platform Truth Social to celebrate it as a win. He also called for fellow talk shows The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers to face a similar fate.\"Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" Trump wrote. \"Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"Kimmel has not yet made any public statement regarding his show's suspension at time of writing. However, he did express his condolences to Kirk's family days prior to Monday's monologue.\"Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?\" Kimmel posted to Instagram shortly after Kirk's death. \"On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.\"He also addressed his show's then-hypothetical cancellation two weeks ago, after Trump predicted on Truth Social that Kimmel would be \"NEXT to go in the untalented Late Night Sweepstakes… and I hope I played a major part in it!\"\"You want us to be cancelled because we make jokes about you?\" Kimmel said in a monologue earlier this month. \"I thought you were against cancel culture? I thought that was like their whole thing? When did you become so woke?\"Meanwhile, FCC member Anna Gomez criticised the Trump administration for pressuring ABC to pull Kimmel off the air. The sole Democrat on the FCC, Gomez has previously expressed concerns that the biggest threat to Americans' freedom of speech is currently the U.S. government.\"An inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship and control,\" Gomez posted to X. \"This Administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression.\"Late night shows under increasing pressure from Trump administration\n\n Viewers protested CBS' cancellation of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" in July.\n Credit: CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP via Getty Images\n\nU.S. late night shows that are critical of Trump have faced significant trouble recently. The Emmy Awards audience gave the Late Show's Stephen Colbert two standing ovations on Sunday, showing their support in response to CBS' cancellation of the show in July. CBS has been widely criticised for axing the Late Show, some speculating that the move was an attempt to appease Trump while its parent company Paramount sought his approval for a merger with Skydance. Trump responded to the news at the time by stating that he \"absolutely love[ed] that Colbert got fired,\" and spruiking a conservative Fox News late night show as \"better than all of them combined.\"\"I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next,\" Trump posted to Truth Social in July. \"Has even less talent than Colbert!\"The Trump administration approved the Paramount/Skydance merger within a week of Colbert announcing The Late Show's cancellation.\"CBS has now made some commitments to us that they're going to return to more fact-based journalism,\" Carr told Johnson on Wednesday.Trump previously demanded that CBS be stripped of its license during his presidential campaign, filing a lawsuit alleging that it had deceptively edited a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to be favourable to her ahead of the election. Paramount ultimately agreed to pay $16 million to settle the lawsuit in July, after Trump had taken office. This settlement was heavily criticised by First Amendment and press freedom advocates, with Colbert labelling it a \"big fat bribe.\"","summary":"ABC has pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" from broadcast indefinitely, apparently due to Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's killer.","url":"https://mashable.com/article/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-off-air-trump","image":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07Lt2rs6FKolXDSEoVdqaz4/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1758175533.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 06:40:37","author":"Amanda Yeo","authors":["Amanda Yeo"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.324},{"id":361455188,"title":"Disney’s ABC yanks Jimmy Kimmel Live off air over Charlie Kirk remarks","text":"Walt Disney-owned ABC said on Wednesday it was pulling Jimmy Kimmel Live off the air, after comments by the late-night show’s host about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk prompted a threat by the head of the top US communications regulator against Disney.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pressured broadcasters to stop airing content he has found objectionable, celebrated the news in a social media post. A number of Democratic lawmakers assailed the decision, saying free speech was under attack.\n\nThe suspension of Kimmel’s show marks the latest action taken against media figures, academic workers, teachers and corporate employees over their remarks about Kirk following his assassination.\n\nRepublican leaders and conservative commentators have warned Americans to mourn Kirk respectfully or suffer consequences, and some people have been fired or suspended after discussing the killing online.\n\nKimmel, who has frequently targeted Trump on his late-night comedy show, drew fire for remarks he made about the killing in his monologue on Monday.\n“We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.\n\nKirk, a 31-year-old activist and Trump-world celebrity known for his right-wing views and pugnacious debating style, was shot in the neck while speaking at a Utah university a week ago. A 22-year-old suspect has been charged with his murder, and his precise motive remains unclear.\n\nKimmel’s comments led to a response from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who urged local broadcasters to stop airing Jimmy Kimmel Live on ABC. Carr suggested the commission could open an investigation and that broadcasters could potentially be fined or lose their licenses if there was a pattern of distorted comment.\n\n“This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney.

He also called on Comcast-owned CMCSA.O NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, the hosts of late-night comedy shows on the network who often make jokes at Trump’s expense.\n\nKimmel made remarks on Monday night about the September 10 assassination of Kirk.\n\n“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said on his Monday night show.\n\nKimmel also criticized Trump’s mourning of Kirk, pointing to a video of Trump’s comments on the White House lawn. “This is how a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish,” Kimmel said.\n\nKimmel did not respond to a Reuters request for comment yesterday. Trump has frequently credited Kirk for driving more young voters and voters of color in support of his successful 2024 presidential campaign. Kirk was a co-founder at age 18 of Turning Point USA, an organization dedicated to advancing conservative causes on college campuses and among young voters.\n\nABC made its announcement after Nexstar Media Group NXST.O said it would stop airing the show on its 32 ABC affiliates, citing Kimmel’s comments.\n\n“Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse,” said Andrew Alford, president of the broadcasting division of Nexstar.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, FCC Chair Brendan Carr had urged local broadcasters to stop airing “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC. He suggested the commission could open an investigation and that broadcasters could potentially be fined or lose their licenses if there was a pattern of distorted comment.\n\n“This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said in a podcast interview with conservative Benny Johnson that aired Wednesday. “Disney needs to see some change here, but the individual licensed stations that are taking their content, it’s time for them to step up and say this, you know, garbage to the extent that that’s what comes down the pipe in the future isn’t something that we think serves the needs of our local communities.”\n\nCarr praised Nexstar. “While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values,” he said.\n\nNexstar, which describes itself as the nation’s largest local television and media company, needs FCC approval for its $6.2 billion deal to acquire smaller rival Tegna TGNA.N.\n\nFCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the FCC’s only Democratic commissioner, criticized Carr. “This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression,” she said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers also criticized the move.\n\n“This is censorship in action. FCC Chair threatens ABC and Disney over Kimmel’s comments. Hours later, he’s off the air,” Senator Ed Markey said in a post on X.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker and Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii also weighed in on X with similar comments.

It raises a more troubling question: is this a genuine request for justice, or the use of financial pressure as a weapon against press freedom?\n\nThroughout history, democratic societies have recognized the role of the press as a cornerstone of liberty. Disputes between politicians and journalists should remain in the public arena, settled through debate, rebuttal, and transparency. \n\nYet this is not the first time such conflicts have reached the courtroom. Trump himself filed a $475 million lawsuit against CNN in 2022, while in Italy Silvio Berlusconi once sued The Economist. In both cases, the courts ruled in favor of the media. But the point, in many situations, is not to win the case — it is to try to silence a voice. \n\nAnd in some countries, the situation goes further still. In India, journalists have faced not only defamation suits but also open intimidation: as reported by The Guardian, some have been threatened with the demolition of their homes, detained under anti-terror laws, or silenced by financial pressure when their outlets risk losing government advertising.\n\nWhile astronomical sums can threaten the survival of major newspapers, in the daily battles of regions and cities even a much smaller amount can cripple local outlets or small independent sites. And if such a method is used by the President of the United States, why should it not be imitated by a governor, a mayor, or even a simple city or district councillor?\n\nThat is why the very act of filing such lawsuits is often less about legal redress and more about intimidation. From the moment a lawsuit is filed, editors and reporters know that their work is being met not with political criticism but with legal and economic retaliation. The message is clear: report critically, and you will pay for it—literally.\n\nHaving worked in print journalism, I can testify that there is no greater form of intimidation than the threat of financial ruin. It is a form of censorship that creeps into the decision-making of editors, publishers, and individual reporters, pushing them toward self-censorship long before any judge reaches a verdict.\n\nThis case is not about whether the New York Times was right or wrong in reporting on Trump’s alleged connections with Jeffrey Epstein, nor about whether its endorsement of Kamala Harris was appropriate. The heart of the matter is much bigger: it is about press freedom itself, and about whether political power can be used to undermine it through economic threats.\n\nJournalists must respect clear boundaries of accuracy and fairness, and when they fail, they can and should be held accountable. But what we are seeing now goes far beyond that. It may appear as the use of lawsuits as a blunt instrument to silence dissent, chill reporting, and weaken democracy.\n\nThe courtroom drama may unfold in Florida, but the implications stretch far wider. This is not just an American issue — small outlets in Europe and beyond face the same risks. Every journalist, every editor, and every citizen who values a free society should recognize the danger: a democracy where the press fears political lawsuits is a democracy at risk.\n\nSupport Florence Daily News\n\nFlorence Daily News is an independent news site covering the stories, culture, and life of Florence and Tuscany.

But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.”\n\n“And I think Pete also knew that — to our mutual sadness.”\n\nHarris ultimately tapped Walz, the governor of Minnesota, for the role and together, the pair went on to lose the popular vote, Electoral College and every single swing state to President Trump in the 2024 election. \n\nIn her book, Harris explained that Buttigieg topped her list of eight potential running mates because “he is a sincere public servant with the rare talent of being able to frame liberal arguments in a way that makes it possible for conservatives to hear them.”\n\n“I love Pete,” she wrote. “I love working with Pete. He and his husband, Chasten, are friends.”\n\nButtigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who burst onto the national political scene when he ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, is an early favorite get the party’s nod in 2028. \n\nAn Emerson College survey, released in June, found Buttigieg leading Harris – 16% to 13% – in a hypothetical Democratic presidential primary, with California Gov.

During his monologue, Kimmel claimed that the ‘MAGA gang’ was using Kirk’s murder to score political points.\n\nThe alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, 22, is now in custody and appeared in court on Tuesday facing multiple charges, including aggravated murder.\n\nKimmel also suggested that Robinson had conservative leanings, although investigators revealed that Robinson holds far-left ideologies and was romantically involved with his transgender roommate.\n\nNexstar, the network’s affiliate group, expressed its disapproval on Wednesday, stating it ‘strongly objects’ to Kimmel’s comments and announced plans to ‘replace the show with alternative programming in its ABC-affiliated markets.’\n\nStars have since shared their thoughts over Kimmel being taking off the air, with singer Halsey reposting the news to her Instagram stories.\n\nShe then added the text: ‘We’re in the “tell on your friends and neighbors” “extreme censorship” “indistinguishable propaganda” part of the fascism in case it wasn’t clear.’ \n\nSinger John Legend shared a post by David Frum which read: ‘”How dare you call us fascists just because our appointees threaten government retaliation against broadcast networks if their comedians don’t say what we want them to say.”‘ \n\nBen Stiller jumped over to X to repost the news of ABC taking Kimmel off their and typed out, ‘This isn’t right.’ \n\nPolitical commentator and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted, ‘This is the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I’ve ever seen in my life and it’s not even close.’ \n\nCommunity actress Alison Brie also jumped to Instagram to share the news and wrote, ‘This is unreal. And very scary.’\n\nDon Lemon labeled the news as ‘scary s**t’ on Threads and further expressed that ‘the folks that are complaining about canceling people are canceling people.’\n\nHe added, ‘What does that tell you? That they don’t believe in anything they’re saying. This is a very dangerous, scary moment.’ \n\nChristie Brinkley shared a photo of Kimmel posing with other talk show hosts such as Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers and John Oliver. \n\n‘I love these guys! The laughter they provide us is as important as the air we breath! And they are taking another one of them off the air tonight! WE MUST PROTECT their and OUR 1st Amendment RIGHTS!!!!’ \n\nJustin Theroux wrote on his Instagram stories, ‘Furious. Culture > Politics,’ while Succession actress Justine Lupe re-shared a post from Chris Gethard which read: ‘Colbert & Kimmel & NPR & CBS & The Kennedy Center. They’re coming for the arts.’\n\nWanda Sykes shared a clip to her main Instagram page and revealed that she had been slated to be a guest on tonight’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel. \n\n‘But as you have heard by now, the Jimmy Kimmel Show! has been pulled indefinitely, abruptly because of complaints from the Trump administration.’\n\nShe then told her followers that Trump ‘did not end the Ukraine War or solve Gaza within his first week. But he did end freedom of speech within his first year.’ \n\nThe concluded the post by encouraging for prayer and then sent love to Kimmel. \n\nPresident Donald Trump had a differing opinion and shared on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, ‘Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. \n\n‘Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible.’\n\nTrump concluded with, ‘That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.’ \n\nThe U.S. president referenced to late night talk show host Stephen Colbert whose show was cancelled back in July by CBS. \n\nThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert will come to an end next year in May 2026.\n\nDespite the cancellation, Colbert notably won an Emmy over the past weekend for Outstanding Talk Series. \n\nThe comedian recently mocked Trump on Tuesday for not having one of the awards as he kicked off the episode. \n\n‘Ladies and gentlemen, welcome one and all. Welcome to The Late Show. I’m your host, Steven Colbert. I’m sorry. I meant to say welcome to the Emmy Award-winning Late Show.’ \n\nFollowing applause from the live audience, the star then added, ‘Speaking of Emmys, uh, Donald Trump doesn’t have one.’\n\nBack in July, CBS announced the cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert after 10 years of being on the air.\n\nIt came just days after his furious rant live on air over the network’s parent company Paramount settling a $16 million lawsuit with President Trump.\n\nParamount reached a $16 million settlement after Trump accused the company for falsely editing a 60 Minute interview with then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nAlong with the settlement, the company also agreed to release unedited transcripts of 60 Minutes interviews with presidential candidates.\n\nColbert blasted Paramount’s settlement with Trump live on air and claimed the company could have ‘easily fought it.’\n\nEarlier this week on Tuesday, President Trump also announced that he is suing the New York Times in a $15B defamation lawsuit. \n\nTrump also filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch in July over the outlet sharing allegations about a birthday note Trump allegedly wrote for Epstein. \n\nKimmel was pulled off the air ‘indefinitely’ by ABC over his divisive comments regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe drastic move came after Kimmel shared a controversial statement about Kirk’s murder suspect – insinuating he was a conservative. However, investigators say Robinson held far-left ideologies and was dating his transgender roommate.\n\nThe TV personality’s unproven suggestion that Robinson was a proponent of the MAGA movement caught instant flak from Federal Communications Commission boss Brendan Carr.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carr told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson he was considering an investigation into Kimmel and his network ABC over the jarring remarks.\n\n‘When you look at the conduct that has taken place by Jimmy Kimmel, it appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible,’ Carr told Johnson.\n\n‘As you’ve indicated, there are avenues here for the FCC, so there… are some ways in which I need to be a little bit careful because we could be called ultimately to be a judge on some of these claims that come up,’ Carr said.\n\nKimmel’s comments about Robinson came during his Monday night monologue.\n\n‘We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,’ the host said.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live! has been a network staple for more than 22 years.\n\nIn response to Kimmel’s remarks, Carr floated the idea of suspending the host – one of several prospective ‘remedies’ for the situation, he said.\n\nAt one point, Johnson asked Carr what kind of action he thought should be taken, proposing an on-air apology from Kimmel.\n\n‘I think what you said there strikes me as a very reasonable, minimal step that can be taken,’ Carr replied.\n\nABC’s decision to pull the show came shortly after its affiliate group, Nexstar, also announced it would stop airing it effective immediately.\n\n‘Nexstar strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets,’ the company wrote on Wednesday.\n\nNexstar’s broadcasting division President Andrew Alford blasted Kimmel’s comments as ‘offensive and insensitive’ in the wake of the Turning Point USA co-founder’s gory assassination, which occurred at a Utah Valley University rally on September 10.\n\nSoon after the Donald Trump ally was fatally shot in the neck on the Orem campus – in front of an audience of 3,000 horrified spectators – Kimmel reacted to his death online.\n\n‘Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?’ Kimmel wrote.\n\n‘On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.’\n\nBut he seemingly changed his tune during the Monday night monologue that ultimately got his show pulled.\n\nIn reaction to Nexstar’s move to axe Kimmel, both Johnson and Carr posted celebratory sentiments on X.\n\n‘Great job @NXSTMediaGroup. Thank you for standing up for Charlie,’ Johnson wrote.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHollywood celebrities have rallied in support of Jimmy Kimmel after he was&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hollywood Celebrities Criticize ABC for Suspending Jimmy Kimmel first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/hollywood-celebrities-criticize-abc-for-suspending-jimmy-kimmel/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hollywood-stars-unleash-fury-on-ABC-over-Jimmy-Kimmel-suspension.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-18 05:03:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.035},{"id":361576706,"title":"Louisiana conservatives deserve better than Cassidy","text":"As we approach the midterm elections next November, the No. 1 priority for congressional Republicans is to grow or, at very least, maintain their majorities in the House and Senate and deny Trump-deranged Democrats the opportunity to again abuse their power and impeach the president for no reason.\n\nAlthough the 2026 Senate map doesn’t look overly daunting for Republicans’ prospects, some factors shouldn’t be taken lightly. Case in point: the notion that Democrats’ only chance to win a Senate seat in the South this election cycle is in North Carolina. Although the Tar Heel State will have a hard-fought contest between two talented and well-funded candidates (former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley and former Gov. Roy Cooper), the Republican Party would be foolish to overlook what might be brewing in Louisiana.\n\nAt first glance, two-term Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy might appear safe in his quest for a third term, but danger lurks under the surface in the form of John Bel Edwards, a Democrat who served as governor of the Pelican State from 2016 to 2024. Washington Democrats would like nothing more than to score another recruitment success with Mr. Edwards after getting Mr. Cooper into the race in North Carolina. If Mr. Edwards ultimately enters the race in Louisiana, the campaign against Mr. Cassidy would become competitive in the blink of an eye.\n\nMr. Edwards would attempt to peel off some Republican voters from the eventual Republican nominee, as he did in his races for governor, and Mr. Cassidy’s well-known shortcomings with his conservative base would exacerbate an issue that could be avoided. On his Wikipedia page, Mr. Cassidy is described as “a moderate Republican” and a critic of President Trump. In ruby-red Louisiana, to be known for this is horrendous. When you consider that Mr. Trump carried the state by wide margins in all three of his presidential campaigns, it’s easy to conclude that Mr. Cassidy is not representing his constituents well.\n\nIt’s no secret that Mr. Trump’s strong leadership style has been a good fit with Louisianans. Voters there feel comfortable knowing the president will always protect their God-given rights and liberties, no matter what. Despite this, it’s obvious that Mr. Cassidy has never been comfortable with Mr. Trump, the ultimate political outsider and steel-spined conservative change agent. Mr. Cassidy questioned Mr. Trump’s electability as early as May 2016, bolstering the fake news media’s phony narrative by remarking, “I’m not sure Mr. Trump will win, but we’ll have to see.”\n\nAfter the controversial 2020 presidential election, which was dominated by fraud-prone mail-in voting, Mr. Cassidy voted to impeach Mr. Trump, along with the likes of left-wing stalwarts Sens. Charles E. Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, after the president left office. Mr. Cassidy ignored exculpatory evidence, such as Mr. Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech, in which he told supporters to go to the Capitol “to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.” Hardly an incitement of insurrection, but that didn’t stop Mr. Cassidy from siding with Trump-hating career politicians and swamp creatures in Congress.\n\nTo make matters worse, Mr. Cassidy voted “Yea” even though Mr. Trump was afforded absolutely no due process by the House, where the impeachment vote was held just two days after the article of impeachment was introduced. The anti-American, undemocratic circus happened without a single hearing where Mr. Trump could have mounted a strong defense and cross-examined witnesses.\n\nThe entire ordeal was so corrupt that it would have made a tin-pot dictator from a banana republic blush. None of it fazed Mr. Cassidy; he just wanted to stick it to Mr. Trump, and he did.\n\nMr. Cassidy was also far from thrilled with Mr. Trump’s comeback against all odds, which was the greatest political return in U.S. history. In August 2023, fake news stronghold NBC News gleefully ran the headline “GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy says Trump should drop out of the 2024 presidential race.” In the story, Mr. Cassidy described the weaponized Biden Justice Department’s ultrapoliticized classified documents case against Mr. Trump as “almost a slam dunk.” (This was the case in which Mr. Trump’s house was raided. It was later completely thrown out by a federal judge. Some slam dunk, Mr. Cassidy.)\n\nIn March 2024, Mr. Cassidy went on far-left NBC News’ “Meet the Press” to label the presidential race between Mr. Trump and President Biden a “sorry state of affairs,” despite polls showing Mr. Trump faring extraordinarily well in the rematch. Even as late as September 2024, when it was all on the line for America with the unthinkable disaster of a potential Kamala Harris presidency, Mr. Cassidy was prominently mentioned in a news report titled “Why these 7 Republican senators still aren’t endorsing Trump.”\n\nFast-forward to today, and Mr. Cassidy still can’t help but grandstand at Senate hearings, causing political heartburn for Mr. Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over the COVID-19 vaccination. For someone like Mr. Cassidy, who knows he is walking a tightrope in a reelection campaign, playing a cheap “gotcha” game with a valued member of the president’s Cabinet on live TV is political malpractice. It also shows his true colors.\n\nFor Senate Republicans in Washington and conservatives across Louisiana, more of Mr. Cassidy isn’t the only path forward. In fact, there is a way to keep Louisiana in the “safe seat” column regardless of whether Mr. Edwards runs: with the entry into the race of a trusted, well-known conservative and 100% pro-Trump candidate, such as three-term Rep. Julia Letlow.\n\nThis move could force Mr. Cassidy to retire or face a monumental embarrassment in Louisiana’s newly closed primary system. Polling data suggests Republican voters in Louisiana have a good appetite for a superior conservative option to Mr. Cassidy, particularly one who wouldn’t vote to impeach the president. A Letlow candidacy would solidify the conservative base, energize MAGA voters and essentially put the race away.\n\nLouisianans deserve two rock-solid, conservative senators who are enthusiastically pro-Trump and “America First.” Sadly, Mr. Cassidy has become the living embodiment of the Republican officeholder who doesn’t realize (or doesn’t care) that Democrats are actively trying to destroy Mr. Trump, eviscerate the Constitution and fundamentally transform America into the world’s next failed socialist state.\n\nMr. Trump could use another conservative warrior in the Senate.\n\n• David N.
