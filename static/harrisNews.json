By contrast, only 50 percent of Republicans say the same.\n\nDemocrats are now looking to enter midterm elections in 2026 under similar circumstances as 2018 in an attempt to break up the GOP’s control of both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nDuring the 2018 elections, voters dealt a massive blow to President Donald Trump’s first-term agenda, with House Democrats gaining 23 seats to take control of the House.\n\nIn October 2022, two years into President Joe Biden’s term when Democrats narrowly controlled the trifecta, just 44 percent of Democratic voters expressed the same motivation to vote in the midterm. That figure was just slightly higher for Republicans, with 48 percent saying they were eager to vote.\n\nIn that election, Republicans clinched the House of Representatives while Democrats retained control of the Senate.\n\nStill, the poll shows Democrats could have some work cut out for them.\n\nJust 28 percent of respondents said they view the Democratic Party favorably. Meanwhile, 33 percent expressed a favorable view of the Republican Party.\n\n“I think that the Democratic Party, we have a lot of work to do to make sure we are meeting voters where they are, listening to what they have to say, and talking to them about issues that they want us to take action on,” Virginia Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan told CNN in response to the poll. \"What's going to matter is what we're doing on the ground in these districts.”\n\nRecovering from Kamala Harris’ defeat to Trump in 2024, Democrats are looking to harness an electorate that they lost in the last election.\n\nA separate poll by Lake Research Partners and Way to Win analyzed “Biden skippers,” those living in battleground states who voted for Biden in 2020 but sat out of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe survey poked holes in the idea that Harris was “too far left.” Progressive lawmaker Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez topped the list of public figures respondents viewed positively, with 78 percent having a favorable view of Sanders and 67 percent having a favorable view of Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nRepublicans are also making moves ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe White House is already strategizing to ensure the GOP retains the trifecta. The plan reportedly includes Trump returning to the campaign trail as well as him having a hand in advising which candidates run and which “stay put” in the upcoming election, sources told Politico.","summary":"Just 44 percent of Democratic voters expressed the same motivation four years ago","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-extremely-motivated-vote-midterms-b2797004.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/27/21/49/The-number-of-Democratic-voters-who-say-they-are-extremely-motivated-to-cast-their-ballots-in-the-mi.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/RXr3YWGg-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-27 21:49:12","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":345778042,"title":"MIKEY SMITH: 7 unhinged Donald Trump Scotland moments as he moans nobody thanked him for Gaza aid","text":"Donald Trump is still in Scotland, for some reason using it as a base to agree trade deals between the US and other countries. But at least we're all paying millions of pounds to ensure he can do that - and play some golf - without any pesky protesters bothering him. He welcomed Ursula Von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, to his Scottish White House - and very rapidly agreed a trade deal with her. Like, in less than an hour. And he, obviously, had another rant about wind farms. Here's everything you need to know about the happenings in Trump World: Scotland . Buckle up. back out on the course this morning for a chilly second morning of his golf holiday in Scotland. He was seen on his Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire, being transported between transported between holes in a motorcade of 26 golf carts plus one curious vehicle. This thing appears to be an articulated, secret service golf buggy. Sort of a golf equivalent of the Beast. It has reportedly been dubbed \"Golf Force One\". His adult sons Eric and Don Jr were both with him on the course. There was no sign of anti-Trump protesters outside the golf course this morning - three British Trump fans were out on the hill next to Turnberry. They wore Make America Great Again hats, waved small US flags and held a sign that read \"Don't trust Starmer\". Trump waved and blew a kiss towards the fans before he took his shot. Tom English, one of the group who had travelled from Blackburn, said: \"I can't believe we're the only ones, to be fair. I thought there'd be more people.\" Asked why he'd travelled so far to support the leader of another country, Mr English said: \"I've just loved him from day one when he ran. I like the way he speaks, his personality, the comedy gold he comes out with. \"He had me at Rosie O'Donnell to be honest with you.\" Ms O'Donnell has been the target of a long running campaign of abuse by Trump, who earlier this month threatened to revoke her citizenship. \"I've supported him all the way through. It's just because he'a not one of them, basically. He came in, said he's going to drain the swamp, end the deep state and that's what he's trying to do.\" \"I can see what's happening,\" said Tom English, who travelled from Blackburn to see Trump in the flesh. He said he was not bothered by the scandal - here's why. \"If you follow Trump from day one, and you know how he works, and you've read his book, The Art of the Deal, and you know he's studied the art of war, then you can see the tactics he's using.\" Asked what the tactics he's using are, Tom said: \"The Dems don't want it releasing. You've got judges and people in congress who don't want the Epstein files releasing for years on end now. \"So he says, it's all fake. It's fake news. The Democrats are making it up. \"All of a sudden it's the Republicans that are blocking it and the Democrats are voting for it to be released.\" Still with us? Good. He went on: \"Now what will happen is he'll order the MAGA lot to reverse the vote, and they'll be released...and Trump won't be in there. \"But his adversaries will. That's my prediction.\" So, to recap, the whole of the last few weeks, where Trump has been pulling out all the stops to divert attention away from discussions about the Epstein files, has been a massive red herring. It's a sneaky ruse to trick the Democrats into releasing the files - because it's only them who will actually be damaged by them. This seems like a high risk strategy to us, especially considering the weight of evidence and reporting that contradicts every element of it. Trump posted a massively unhinged rant on Truth Social, during which he threatened to have Beyonce and Oprah Winfrey prosecuted over things that never happened. It comes down to a baseless, evidence-free nonsense conspiracy theory posted online by people who made it up out of thin air, which claims Beyonce charged Kamala Harris $11m for her endorsement, and Oprah claimed £3m for expenses. Trump wrote: \"I'm looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats, after the Presidential Election, and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, Eleven Million Dollars to singer Beyoncé for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!), Three Million Dollars for \"expenses,\" to Oprah, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars to very low rated TV \"anchor,\" Al Sharpton (a total lightweight!), and others to be named for doing, absolutely NOTHING! These ridiculous fees were incorrectly stated in the books and records.\" Not a word of the above sentence (and yes, it is one sentence) is true. He went on: \"YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT. IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO. Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them. All hell would break out! Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter.\" Nobody did any of this. It was made up. Speaking ahead of his negotiations with Ursula Von der Leyen, Trump admitted he was \"not in a good mood.\" He fumed about America not getting more credit for sending humanitarian aid to Gaza. \"We gave $60 million two weeks ago and nobody even acknowledged it, for food,\" he said. \"And it's terrible. You know, you really at least want to have somebody say thankyou. No other country gave anything. We gave $60 million two weeks ago for food for Gaza and nobody acknowledged it.\" He went on: \"And nobody said 'Gee, thankyou very much'. And that would be nice, to have at least a thankyou.\" In his extended disco remix rant ahead of a relatively brief negotiation with Von der Leyon, Trump somehow managed to weave onto talking about wind farms. At length. Again. But in case you were wondering why the subject was on his mind, he gave the game away: \"Today, I'm playing the best course I think in the world . Turnberry. \"Even though I own it, it's probably the best course in the world. \"And I look over the horizon and I see 9 windmills at the end of the 18th. I say, isn't that a shame?\" We actually kind of believe him on this one. This seems to be a fairly natural reaction.","summary":"Donald Trump is still in Scotland, for some reason using it as a base to agree trade deals between the US and other countries","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mikey-smith-7-unhinged-donald-35627650","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35627643.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-President-Donald-Trump-Visits-Scotland-For-Golfing-Getaway.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-27 20:55:46","author":"Mikey Smith","authors":["Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":345769794,"title":"Rubio downplays 2028 talk, touts Vance as Trump's successor","text":"Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed speculation that he could be the Republican Party’s 2028 presidential nominee, instead throwing his support behind Vice President JD Vance. \"I think JD Vance would be a great nominee if he decides he wants to do that,\" Rubio said during an interview with Lara Trump that aired on the Fox News Channel Saturday.

The Office of Personnel Management tracks when political appointees transition to career positions—a process often referred to as “burrowing in” to the bureaucracy—and Tina Thomas did so in August 2024.\n\nBiden appointed Thomas as a political appointee in September 2021 to serve as senior counsel in the Office of Legal Policy at the Justice Department. She transitioned to a career role as assistant U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., also in the Justice Department. OPM approved the transition on Aug. 11. Thomas went from an annual salary of $110,460 to $121,435.\n\nAccording to her verified LinkedIn profile, Thomas graduated from Yale University in 2009 and from Yale Law School in 2014.\n\nAfter law school, she joined the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals for a year before joining the law firm Covington & Burling, where she worked as a senior associate in white collar defense and as adviser to Holder. She worked there from November 2015 to September 2021.\n\nHer LinkedIn profile states that she “served as a strategic adviser and counselor to the Hon. Eric H. Holder, Jr., 82nd Attorney General of the United States, on his firm-related and personal matters, including his work with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, speeches and op-eds, and client development at Covington & Burling.”\n\nWhile Thomas’ role advising Holder sounds prestigious, it may set off alarm bells in the new administration.\n\nEric Holder\n\nHolder may be most notorious for refusing to hand over records from the gun-running scheme code named “Operation Fast and Furious,” which led to him becoming the first Cabinet official to be held in contempt of Congress. However, perhaps the greatest gulf between his approach to the law and that of the current administration involves race.\n\nConservative classicist and commentator Victor Davis Hanson, a Daily Signal contributor, claimed Holder’s key legacy involved “re-teaching Americans to think of race as essential, not incidental, to our characters.”\n\nEarly in his tenure as attorney general, Holder called America a “nation of cowards” for supposedly failing to “confront our racial past and to understand our racial present.” He said Americans “simply do not talk enough with each other about things racial.” Holder took public stances on the fatal shootings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown before all the facts were known in those cases, breathing more oxygen into the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn a 2014 speech, Holder condemned policies that he said have “the appearance of being race-neutral” but have racial impacts. He claimed such policies “impede equal opportunity in fact, if not in form.” He noted that while “overt” race-based restrictions on the right to vote “cannot survive,” “new types of restrictions are justified as attempts to curb an epidemic of voter fraud that, in reality, has never been shown to exist.” He claimed these policies “disproportionately disenfranchise African-Americans, Hispanics, other communities of color and vulnerable populations such as the elderly.”\n\nHe noted that “Chief Justice John Roberts has argued that the path to ending racial discrimination is to give less consideration to the issue of race altogether,” but he argued that “this presupposes that racial discrimination is at a sufficiently low ebb that it doesn’t need to be actively confronted.” \n\nUnder Holder, the DOJ investigated police departments, issued official findings that the departments engage in racial discrimination, filed lawsuits, and forced the departments to agree to a “consent decree” as part of settling that lawsuit. These consent decrees require a change in the department’s culture to satisfy the DOJ and the court.\n\nHolder also reportedly directed the Justice Department to drop a voter intimidation case involving members of the New Black Panther Party reportedly wielded a club outside a polling place in Philadelphia in the 2008 election. \n\nThe second Trump administration has fought the kind of racial rhetoric and policy Holder encouraged. Trump ordered the termination of all “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and “equity” programs across the federal government, which had implemented the idea that America is a systemically racist society in need of fundamental reform. \n\nThomas’ Work With Holder\n\nHolder resigned as attorney general in 2015, but he remained active, particularly on the issue of redistricting. State legislatures draw maps determining congressional districts for elections to the U.S. House of Representatives. Holder blocked redistricting plans in several states, claiming they would dilute the voting strength of racial minorities. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which allowed the DOJ to block redistricting practices if it found them discriminatory, a practice Holder repeatedly used.\n\nHolder’s DOJ also brought legal action against a Texas law requiring valid ID to vote, claiming that it was racially discriminatory.\n\nIn 2016, Holder became the chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a political organization created to challenge maps and help Democrat candidates obtain majorities in the U.S. Congress ahead of the 2020 census. The committee claims that Republicans “seized control of the redistricting process” by “disenfranchising voters, especially Democrats and people of color.”\n\nThomas notably mentioned working with Holder on the National Democratic Redistricting Committee in her LinkedIn biography. \n\nBoth her LinkedIn biography and her Covington & Burling profile mention Thomas’ pro bono work advising the National Redistricting Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit aligned with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, “on litigation to challenge partisan and racial gerrymanders.”\n\nIn other words, she worked closely with Holder’s redistricting efforts both on and off the clock.\n\nDeep State Opposition\n\nA March poll found that 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nWhile some political appointees who took “career” positions may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that some staff inside the federal government may work against the goals of the current president, in this case Trump.\n\nFurthermore, a February Foundation for Government Accountability study found that Democrat employees outnumber Republican employees by a 2-to-1 margin across federal agencies. In the 2024 presidential election, 84% of the money that federal employees gave in political contributions went to Harris.\n\nFederal workers enjoy workplace protections that make them very difficult to fire. The new administration is seeking to reform these rules to enable the president to fulfill his duties as head of the executive branch without facing opposition from hostile bureaucrats.\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to Thomas, Covington & Burling, the National Redistricting Committee, and the Justice Department for comment. None responded by publication time.\n\nThis is the latest in a series on bureaucrats burrowing in. Part one covers eight appointees. Part two focuses on a former Russiagate adviser who works at the Federal Aviation Administration. Parts three and five expose a former lawyer for then-Sen. Kamala Harris who advised Harris during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and who now works at the Defense Department. Part four focuses on a former Biden campaign lawyer who now works at the Justice Department. Part six highlights a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who failed to get reconfirmed, “burrowed in” at the Department of Energy, and took the buyout.","summary":"A lawyer who worked closely with Obama-era Attorney General Eric Holder now works in President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration as an ostensibly nonpolitical staffer at the...

Not everyone makes the same mistakes over and over again.\n\nLast week, the geniuses in charge of maintaining the Democratic Party’s social media picked at a fresh wound — and showed, again, exactly why it lost the 2024 election. \n\nThe blue team’s official X account shared a line chart showing the change in the price of various groceries — meat, dairy, produce, etc. — over time, and asserting that “prices are higher today than they were on [sic] July 2024.”\n\n“Trump’s America,” read the caption.\n\nThe problem? The last part of the line barely went up. \n\nAnd what it actually showed was a massive increase in prices between 2021 and 2024.\n\nIn other words: over the course of former President Joe Biden’s White House tenure.\n\n“I would just advise Democrats not to post about inflation given their track record,” suggested conservative influencer A.G. Hamilton. “Might save them the embarrassment of having to delete their posts after getting dunked on” — which is exactly what they did.\n\n“This is the gang that couldn’t shoot straight!” marveled Fox Business host Stuart Varney. \n\nAnd of course Team Trump got in on the action.\n\nWhat’s notable about the braindead blunder, though, is not the blunder itself.\n\nIt was that it represented yet another admission, eight and a half months after they surrendered the presidency to Donald Trump for the second time in three election cycles, that the Democrats still haven’t made a sincere effort at diagnosing the reasons for their unpopularity — much less addressing them.\n\nA new Wall Street Journal poll found that their party continues to suffer as a result — to the point that just 33% of Americans hold a favorable view of it, and 63% view it unfavorably. \n\nBoth Donald Trump (-7) and the GOP (-11) are also underwater, but may as well be polling as well as ice cream compared to the Democrats. \n\nThe same holds true of the public’s view of various issues; voters still trust the GOP more than the alternative when it comes to the economy, inflation, immigration and foreign policy. \n\nIf that doesn’t wake Democrats up to the provenance of all their political pain, nothing will. \n\nThe Left has long relied on comforting fallacies to numb the discomfort that accompanies defeat.\n\nAfter 2016, elected Democrats and their media allies insisted that Trump’s shocking victory was only possible thanks to Russian meddling.\n\nAnd now, they’re laboring under the misimpression that return to power can be attributed to Republicans’ superior, but decepting messaging — an almost supernatural ability to compel Americans to believe that which isn’t so.\n\nIf only they could convince the public of the truth, they’d surely prevail.\n\nBut the cold, hard truth is that it’s always been about the substance, stupid — as the unflattering data they so proudly shared last week demonstrates.\n\nKamala Harris was deposited into the dustbin of history because she was the top lieutenant in an administration that had proven a miserable failure long before her boss’s implosion last summer. \n\nAmericans spent the entirety of the Biden years telling pollsters that their lives were demonstrably, palpably worse as a result of historic price hikes.\n\nBiden & Co. responded to these pleas for relief by denying the existence of inflation until they couldn’t any longer.\n\nThen, when they finally did implicitly admit to the effects of the nearly $2 trillion boondoggle they passed in 2021, they slapped the name “Inflation Reduction Act” on yet another profligate spending bill that every layman in America knew would only compound the problem.\n\nThere are similar stories to be told about Americans’ dissatisfaction with Biden’s approach to foreign policy, his abdication of his duty to secure the border, and his championing of a radical social agenda that maintains up is down, left is right, and black is white. \n\nTheir stubborn refusal to grapple with this incontrovertible truth is also reportedly set to be reflected in an upcoming 2024 autopsy conducted by the DNC.\n\nThe New York Times reports that it will “steer clear of the decisions made by the Biden-turned-Harris campaign,” and instead “focus more on outside groups and super PACs that spent hundreds of millions of dollars aiding the Biden and Harris campaigns through advertising, voter registration drives and turnout efforts.”\n\nIt’s like watching a restaurant serving inedible food invest in new plateware.\n\nThe gripe has never been with the Democrats’ presentation or voters’ tastes.\n\nIt’s with the product itself.","summary":"Everybody makes mistakes.

But the mother of four enjoyed her exploration of the Cotswolds region where the event was held enough to put it on the grid, and posted images from what appears to be the wedding celebration's tablescapes to her Instagram stories, where they'll expire after 24 hours.\nSaturday's ceremony at St Michael’s and All Angels Church in the Great Tew estate was reportedly attended by former Vice President Kamala Harris, a close friend of the bride's mother, Laurene Powell Jobs. (The bride's father, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, died in 2011.)\nA number of other guests are also members of famous families.

Jessica Springsteen, the equestrian daughter of Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa, served as one of Eve Jobs' nine bridesmaids. All were clad in identical red satin dresses, and—per the Daily Mail—carried fern bouquets.\nAlso spotted: New York chef turned Baroness Ruth Rogers, the owner of London's Michelin-starred River Cafe, as well as members of the Charles family, including his Olympian father, Peter Charles, and his mother, horsewoman Tara Charles.\nGiven the number of horse people in attendance, as well as Eve Jobs' own equestrian accomplishments, hopes were high that there would be some sort of equine component to the ceremony or reception—a couple’s entrance on horseback, perhaps. But that was apparently not part of Gatti's plan, nor was any sort of public showing for the bride and groom.\nAccording to the Mail, an assembled crowd of Cotswolds locals was disappointed when Jobs was whisked into the event area via a private road, unseen by the masses.

But people wind up cosying too much to one side or the other.”\n\nHe continued: “I don’t think anybody wants to hear a lecture … Why shoot for just half an audience? Why not try to get the whole? I like to bring people into the big picture. I don’t understand why you would alienate one particular group – or just don’t do it at all. I’m not saying you have to throw your support [on one side]. But just do what’s funny.”\n\nLeno also recalled being condemned for the same exact jokes by both Republican and Democrat supporters – which he suggested was a good thing.\n\n“That’s how you get a whole audience,” he said. “Now you have to be content with half the audience, because you have to give your opinion.”\n\nColbert’s The Late Show was axed earlier this month in what CBS claimed was a “financial decision”.\n\nBut many of Colbert’s fans and supporters – which include high-profile names including David Letterman and Elizabeth Warren – raised their eyebrows at the timing of the decision. The announcement came shortly after Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, agreed to pay Donald Trump $16m to settle the president’s lawsuit against the company over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris – which the network’s lawyers deemed “meritless” in recent court filings.\n\nTrump gloated over The Late Show’s cancellation on social media, writing: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next.”\n\nTrump had sued Paramount over what he claimed to be “electoral interference” over the editing of an answer to a question posed to Kamala Harris in an episode of 60 Minutes.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit was mocked in the season premiere of South Park, which was broadcast on Comedy Central a day after the show signed a $1.5bn (£1.1bn) deal with their network’s owners Paramount.","summary":"The former host of ‘The Tonight Show’ said that you lose ‘half an audience’ by making political jokes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jay-leno-politics-stephen-colbert-b2796878.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/19/21/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/s1PQbw9r-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-27 15:21:51","author":"Adam White","authors":["Adam White"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":345722330,"title":"Pritzker encourages North Carolina Democrats to fight","text":"In a roughly 25-minute speech, Pritzker both back-slapped friend Roy Cooper and his campaign for U.S. Senate and shouted down second-term Republican President Donald Trump. He sought to energize the partisans and explain how the messaging works best – showing voters the values of the party.\n\nIt is a state party that, a month ago in executive committee, passed a resolution against Israel calling for the United States to withdraw support of its closest Middle Eastern ally. And a state party that is in decline in registration numbers.\n\nThe Duke University graduate chuckled with the crowd, saying he couldn’t find fellow Blue Devils. He also rallied them to applause and shouts of encouragement.\n\n“I’ve been around long enough to many times hear the talking heads declare each party dead on the table,” Pritzker said. “The reports of demise of any political party are always greatly exaggerated.”\n\nDemocrats included, even as the ground where he spoke has been in a two-decade free fall. On Jan. 1, 2004, the state’s more than 5 million voters were split 47.6% Democrats, 34.4% Republicans and 17.7% unaffiliated. Today it’s barely above 30% for his party and falling, almost a dead heat with the Grand Old Party, and independents have soared to more than 38%.\n\nHead to head, the net difference of Democrats and Republicans has swung more than 800,000 registrations since 2008 Election Day.\n\nStill, Pritzker practiced what he preached on boldness. In what was easily a presidential ticket audience audition of sorts, the response was receptive. Each encouraged the other.\n\nHe’s one of several governors Democrats are checking for 2028. California’s Gavin Newsom, Minnesota’s Tim Walz, Maryland’s Wes Moore and Kentucky’s Andy Beshear are other notables visiting annual state party conventions, though Walz – on 92 of the 108 days in Kamala Harris’ ticket last year – says he won’t if he chooses to run for governor again.\n\nMore could be out there. Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro is the biggest governor name in that group, though he’s more low-profile nationally in 2028 presidential circles talk. And the potential tickets are certainly not limited to governors.\n\nFor Pritzker, he’s a fly in the ointment of Democrats’ rally cry against the wealthy because of his estimated personal net worth of more than $3 billion. He spoke of policies that hurt every day, middle class Americans.\n\nYet, Pritzker’s state is a Democratic trifecta and ranks No. 37 in tax competitiveness, according to the most recent analysis by The Tax Foundation. The report says Illinois is No. 13 in individual income taxes, No. 38 in sales taxes, No. 41 in property taxes, No. 42 in corporate taxes, and No. 43 in unemployment insurance taxes.\n\nNorth Carolina – where Republican policies of the last 15 years have turned the consensus of metrics about the economy – is No. 12 overall in the same report. Respectively by category, the Tarheel State is Nos. 21, 16, 20, 3 and 7.\n\nHe talked about what could happen in the future of North Carolina and the country economically, saying he had taken over and changed a poor fiscal situation in Illinois. Not all reports agree.\n\nIn the most recent analysis by the Reason Foundation released in December, state debt liability is $247.9 billion in Illinois – behind only California’s $498.1 billion. It’s $31.5 billion in North Carolina, better than 31 other states. Per capita, North Carolina is ninth best; Illinois is only in front of Connecticut, New Jersey and Hawaii.\n\n“Folks love Gov. J.B. Pritzker,” said Anderson Clayton, chairwoman of the North Carolina Democratic Party. “He’s someone that I think has really taken on the Trump administration like we need to see from the Democratic Party right now. It’s a great way to showcase the party that fights back.”\n\nPritzker described the values and fights as being different than what Republicans are telling voters.\n\n“It’s wrong to snatch a person off the street and ship them to a foreign gulag and not give them a chance in a court of law,” he said. “It’s about the Constitution, not immigration policy. They’re literally arresting U.S. citizens in broad daylight.\n\n“They’re not criminals. Law-abiding people, people paying taxes for decades, are being forced to go into hiding because of black or brown skin.”\n\nPritzker said, instead, that immigrants’ contributions are “incalculable.”\n\n“Our nation’s economy depends on attracting the best and the brightest to our shores,” he said, referring to Trump policies causing many college students from overseas to leave.\n\nHe went on to take swipes at a number of Cabinet members, saying Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon “hates teachers and doesn’t know the difference between AI and A-1 steak sauce.” He more than once called Tom Homan, Trump’s appointed border czar and the interim director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, “ICE Barbie.” Pritzker said Homan knows nothing of keeping America secure, even as border numbers from the government are without dispute showing the most secure in the history of the country.\n\nPritzker also spoke on behalf of the vulnerable, farmers, small business owners, autistic children and soldiers.\n\n“Our values are where they ought to be,” he said. “It’s time to stop apologizing when we’re not wrong. It’s time to stop surrendering when we need to fight.”\n\nThe governor reminded the dinner crowd this party “built Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. We created the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. And we have to fight like hell to preserve them.”\n\nHe indicated regulation is necessary for development of artificial intelligence.\n\nAnd he said the story being written by Democrats in 2026 and 2028 is “a chance to leave a story of restoration.”\n\nAmericans, Pritzker said, are wondering who will fight for them.\n\nJUDGE THROWS OUT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LAWSUIT OVER ‘SANCTUARY CITY’ CHICAGO\n\n“When we emerge from this, and we will emerge from this, our Democratic agenda must be bold,” Pritzker said. “And our ideas fearless. America needs us. We must be willing to slay sacred cows and get things done.”\n\n“We must deliver on an agenda centered on working families who truly make America great.”","summary":"(The Center Square) – Expressing the values of the party and fighting together are pivotal to North Carolinians winning 2026 midterms, as is making a change in the White House three years from now, Illinois Gov.

Smith, who has two new shows coming to Sirius XM in September, a sports show and a politics show. And there is no shortage of material on the political front. So, Stephen A., thank you for joining us. Great to have you back on “This Week”.\n\nSTEPHEN A. SMITH: My pleasure.\n\nKARL: So let -- let's start with the -- what we saw in the White House this week. Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, coming out making some extraordinary claims about Barack Obama. The President of the United States accusing Obama of treason. Again, no evidence whatsoever for any of this stuff. But what did you think as you were watching that?\n\nSMITH: I thought it was -- I thought it was a lot of hyperbole to be quite honest with you. You know, we can talk about the veracity of the things that she was saying and challenge that to some degree, and I'm quite sure people on the left will do so. But at the end of the day, courtesy of Donald Trump, what are you going to do about it in the end other than smear the former President of the United States, Barack Obama, and sully his name? What else is going to happen to him? He's not in danger of any lawlessness. He's not going to jail or anything like that. You know, based on the Supreme Court's decision from last, you know, from a few months ago, essentially, if you're the president of the United States, due to Trump and what he was pushing, you essentially get to operate with relative impunity as long as you're making decisions, you know, from a government perspective as the commander-in-chief. So, Barack Obama doesn't really have much to worry about. Once again, I think this is Trump throwing food to his base because, obviously, if you rile up MAGA to some degree by highlighting the things that have transpired in years past that basically buffer your points that you were making, you look good with them. And those kind of things that have been -- being discussed has me looking at the president with a raised eyebrow because I'm saying to myself since the bill was the Big, Beautiful Bill and there's so much good that emanates from the bill, you literally are distracting our attention away from that for issues like this? I find it hard to believe that this is going to amount to anything to be quite honest with you. There's -- obviously, you look at, you know, the CIA, the FBI, look at their involvement and look at weaponizing the intelligence agencies, I'm certainly not trying to dismiss that as a concern because it is a concern. It is something we should all pay attention to. But to call Barack Obama out by name with no evidence that you've put forth, I mean, I would need to see more. But if you're going to incriminate a former President of the United States like that with such, you know, hyperbolic words like treason and what have you --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: Treason. TREASON, he said.\n\nSMITH: -- more information before you do that. That's what he said. That's what she said.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKARL: And --\n\nSMITH: That's what he said.\n\nKARL: And to be clear, I mean, I went through all that Tulsi Gabbard did. It was -- there was no evidence whatsoever to the allegations they were making. And then, you know, to -- maybe, it's because of your point about the immunity decision, but Trump actually suggested last night- that that Kamala Harris should be prosecuted for allegedly buying the votes, endorsements of celebrities like Beyonce. Again, no evidence to this stuff. But I mean, what --\n\nSMITH: Well --\n\nKARL: -- this is back-to-back, almost in sports, a couple days- that the President of the United States calling for prosecuting the former president and the former vice president.\n\nSMITH: Well, listen, the -- at some point in time, somebody needs to challenge the president on what he's doing now because if what you're doing is so great, why would you want to distract our attention? Wait, that's not the Donald Trump we know. The Donald Trump that we know lives in the moment of things that he deems to be doing successfully in his eyes. If the Big, Beautiful Bill, you know, preserves the 2017 tax cuts and does so much for the economy and does so much for small businesses and what have you, like he has proclaimed, why would you want to distract our attention with all of this stuff? Maybe you're evading the issue of the Epstein files because your Administration overpromised and underproduced. We all know what you were telling MAGA, right, that there was a whole bunch of stuff to be released, and certainly it was forthcoming and certainly it did not happen. And so, when you look at it from that standpoint, you find yourself saying, excuse me, the former president, treason, former vice president and Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States, you know, you want her prosecuted. It just seems to be, I wouldn't say much ado about nothing because I'm not trying to absolve anything from anyone in terms of any kind of actions that they may have engaged in that, dare I say, are illegal. We don't know that. We haven't seen any proof of that. But for Trump to be focused on, on this, this is where the big problem comes in.\n\nSMITH: You are looking backwards when America needs to look forward, and that's the problem right now. Let's look -- let's move forward.\n\nKARL: OK. So let me move forward on the Democrats. We were just talking on the Roundtable --\n\nSMITH: Yeah.\n\nKARL: -- about this new Wall Street Journal poll that shows even on issues where the public does not approve of the president or of Republicans, they actually have a lower approval rating of the Democrats.\n\nSMITH: Yeah. Well, that's easy to understand. One party has a leader in Donald Trump. You can’t refute. Yeah. Nobody can refute that. He is the leader of the GOP and the Republican Party. Make no mistake about it. The Democrats don't have a leader. We -- I see -- who -- who's your leader? Who is it? Is it AOC? Is it Bernie Sanders? Is it Jasmine Crockett? Who is it? You know, we respect so many people on Capitol Hill. I'm certainly not here to cast aspersions upon individuals, but as a body, the Democratic Party just looks very, very bad right now because they look leaderless. They don't have a definitive voice that anybody can depend on. When we look towards 2028, for example, we see a guy like Governor Wes Moore, who I like a lot, and I think is very capable, a Josh Shapiro, the Governor of Pennsylvania, who I like and I think is very, very capable. But when you talk about a national voice for the Democratic Party, it is literally non-existent. You have no one right now. I'm in New York City. You've got this guy Zohran Mamdani that won the Democratic nominee over former government -- over former governor, Andrew Cuomo. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams are going against one another as an independent, and there's fear about them canceling one another out and set- and paving the way for Mamdani, who's a renowned socialist. That's not what America really, really is about. Nevertheless, he could end up being the mayor of New York City. Why?\n\nSMITH: Because when you don't have any kind of leader whatsoever, you are going to look to grab one any way --\n\nKARL: All right.\n\nSMITH: -- you can, any chance you get.

Reed Jobs, 33, and Erin Jobs, 29, will likely be at the wedding. However it's currently not known if her half sibling Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 47, will attend.\n\nAside from her siblings, Eve has a plethora of high-profile friends descended from other tech billionaires, who will have likely seen her walk down the aisle.\n\nShe is also friends with Lilli Hymowitz, daughter of billionaire Gregg Hymowitz, the CEO and founder of investment firm EnTrust Global.\n\nSteve died from pancreatic cancer aged 56 in 2011, when Eve was 12, and was worth an estimated $10.5 billion at the time of his death.\n\nBoth Steve and wife Laurene (pictured) have made it clear that their children won't inherit their wealth \n\nIn 2023, Eve was spotted mingling amongst high society's wealthiest members at a gala in New York City, including Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng, who she struck a pose with for photos, and Lili Buffett, the granddaughter of billionaire investor and philanthropist Warren Buffet.\n\nOn top of Eve's impressive connections, Harry has his own entourage.\n\nThe couple share a passion for horses and are frequently seen supporting each other at events.\n\nEve, a self-described 'horse girl', started riding when she was just six years old and had made some considerable achievements, including winning a bronze medal in the team event at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru.\n\nShe was front and centre to watch Harry win his gold medal last year and shared a loving post on Instagram with the caption: 'TEAM GOLD!!!!!! Beyond proud of you my love!!!!' \n\nEve made her modelling debut in a 2020 holiday campaign for makeup brand Glossier alongside Sydney Sweeney and Naomi Smalls. Eve is signed to DNA Model Management, who also represents Kaia Gerber and Emily Ratajkowski. \n\nAs the youngest daughter of late billionaire Apple mogul Steve Jobs, most would assume that Eve must've grown up without a want or need in the world. \n\nSteve Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, and according to his official biographer, Walter Isaacson, Jobs didn't doubt that it would be his youngest daughter who would run Apple in the future.\n\nIn his biography about Steve, writer Walter Isaacson described the youngest Jobs as a 'strong-willed, funny firecracker.'\n\nHe said that as a child, Eve would often call up her father's assistant and make her clear out his calendar so that they could spend one-on-one father-daughter time together.\n\nThe family grew up in a 'low-key Tudor-style house on a prosperous street' in Palo Alto, California, according to U2 front man Bono.\n\nIt's been said that the billionaire Apple founder did his best to give his children a normal upbringing, despite his immense wealth.\n\nThe outlet reported that he had 'no live-in help, no security guards, no drivers.'\n\nHe also once revealed that he limited his kids' technology use - even though he created one of the most successful tech companies on the planet. \n\nSteve passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011, when Eve was 12, and was worth an estimated $10.5 billion at the time of his death.\n\nBut Eve and her siblings won't get any of his money, as he left his immense wealth to wife Laurene who revealed in 2020 that she has no plans to give any of it to their kids.\n\nShe told the New York Times that her husband made it clear before his death that he didn't want to pass his earnings down to their kids because he wanted them to work for their own money.\n\n'I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn't care about the accumulation of wealth,' she said.\n\n'I'm not interested in legacy wealth building, and my children know that... Steve wasn't interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.'\n\nWhile both Reed and Erin lead relatively private lives out of the spotlight, Eve has opted for the opposite, launching a major modeling career.\n\nLike both of her parents, she graduated from Stanford University in 2021, where she majored in science, technology, and society.\n\nShe then made her runway debut at Paris Fashion Week while walking in the Coperni show that September. \n\nEve has since posed for a slew of big brands and magazines like Glossier, Louis Vuitton, Vogue, and Vanity Fair. \n\nBesides her modeling career, Eve is also an experienced equestrian and was named Show Jumping Hall of Fame 'Rider of the Month' in March 2017.\n\nShe has competed in show jumping competitions all around the globe, including events in the Hamptons, Lexington, Kentucky, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and was ranked as the fifth best rider under 25 in the world by Horse Sports in 2019.\n\nPrior to her relationship with Harry, Eve was linked to Mexican show jumper and University of Miami business student Eugenio Garza Pérez, according to the Latin Times.\n\nThere were also rumors that she dated singer Harry Hudson, Chainsmokers member Drew Taggart, and Outer Banks star Chase Stokes.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWho is Harry Charles?

IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO. Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them.

They should all be prosecuted!\" he said.\nAccording to The Hill newspaper, Oprah previously said she “was not paid a dime” to appear alongside Harris at a live-streamed event.

The 44-year-old Texas Democrat known for her viral comebacks was frowning as she walked into her hotel room in Atlanta last month. She glanced around before pulling an aide into the bathroom, where I could hear them whispering. Minutes later, she reemerged, ready to unload.\n\nShe was losing her race to serve as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, she told me, a job she felt well suited for. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus were planning to vote for the senior-most person in the race, even though that person wasn’t actually a Black Caucus member, Crockett complained. California members were siding with the California candidate. One member was supporting someone else in the race, she said, even though “that person did the worst” in their pitch to the caucus. Crockett was starting to feel a little used. Some of her colleagues were “reaching out and asking for donations,” she said, but those same colleagues “won’t even send me a text back” about the Oversight job.\n\nTo Crockett, the race had become a small-scale version of the Democratic Party’s bigger predicament. Her colleagues still haven’t learned what, to her, is obvious: Democrats need sharper, fiercer communicators. “It’s like, there’s one clear person in the race that has the largest social-media following,” Crockett told me.\n\nIn poll after poll since Donald Trump’s reelection, Democratic voters have said they want a fighter, and Crockett, a former attorney who represents the Dallas area, has spent two and a half years in Congress trying to be one. Through her hearing-room quips and social-media insults, she’s become known, at least in MSNBC-watching households, as a leading general in the battle against Trump. The president is aware of this. He has repeatedly called Crockett a “low-IQ” individual; she has dubbed him a “buffoon” and “Putin’s hoe.” Perhaps the best-known Crockett clapback came last year during a hearing, after Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia made fun of Crockett’s fake eyelashes. Crockett, seeming to relish the moment, leaned into the mic and blasted Greene’s “bleach-blond, bad-built, butch body.” Crockett trademarked the phrase—which she now refers to as “B6”—and started selling T-shirts.\n\nAt the time, I wrote that the episode was embarrassing for everyone involved. But clearly it resonated. Crockett has become a national figure. Last year, she gave a keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention and was a national co-chair of Kamala Harris’s campaign. This year, she has been a fixture on cable news and talk shows as well as a top party fundraiser; she was in Atlanta, in part, for a meet and greet with local donors. At an anti-Trump protest on the National Mall in April, I saw several demonstrators wearing B6 shirts. Others carried signs with Crockett’s face on them.\n\nCrockett is testing out the coarser, insult-comedy-style attacks that the GOP has embraced under Trump, the general idea being that when the Republicans go low, the Democrats should meet them there. That approach, her supporters say, appeals to people who drifted away from the Democrats in 2024, including many young and Black voters. “What establishment Democrats see as undignified,” Max Burns, a progressive political strategist, told me, “disillusioned Democrats see that as a small victory.” Republicans understand this, Crockett said: “Marjorie is not liked by her caucus, but they get her value, and so they gave her a committee chairmanship.”\n\nPerhaps inadvertently, Crockett seemed to be acknowledging something I heard from others in my reporting: that the forthrightness her supporters love might undermine her relationships within the party. Some of Crockett’s fellow Democrats worry that her rhetoric could alienate the more moderate voters the party needs to win back. In the same week that Democratic leadership had instructed members to focus on Medicaid cuts and tax breaks for billionaires, Crockett referred to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” (Crockett claimed that she was referring to Abbott’s busing of migrants.) In an interview with Vanity Fair after the 2024 election, Crockett said that Hispanic Trump supporters had “almost like a slave mentality.” She later told a CNN host that she was tired of “white tears” and the “mediocre white boys” who are upset by DEI.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Trump himself seems eager to elevate Crockett. “They say she’s the face of the party,” the president told my Atlantic colleagues recently. “If she’s what they have to offer, they don’t have a chance.” Some of the Republican targeting of Crockett is clearly rooted in racism; online, Trump’s supporters constantly refer to her as “ghetto” and make fun of her hair.\n\nNone of this appears to be giving Crockett any pause. The first time I met her, a month before our conversation in Atlanta, she was accepting a Webby Award, in part for a viral exchange in which she’d referred to Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina as “child” and Mace suggested they “take it outside.” Backstage, in a downtown-Manhattan ballroom, I asked Crockett whether she ever had regrets about her public comments. She raised her eyebrows and replied, “I don’t second-guess shit.”\n\nThis spring, I watched Crockett test her theory of politics in a series of public appearances. At the Webbys, most of her fellow award winners were celebrities and influencers, but only Crockett received a standing ovation. A week later, Crockett flamed Republicans and the Trump administration during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing about Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A 15-minute clip of her upbraiding ICE agents—“These people are out of control!”—has racked up more than 797,000 views on YouTube; I know this because she told me. On TikTok and Instagram, Crockett has one of the highest follower counts of any House member, and she monitors social-media engagement like a day trader checks her portfolio. She is highly conscious, too, of her self-presentation. During many of our conversations, Crockett wore acrylic nails painted with the word RESIST, and a set of heavy lashes over her brown eyes. The lock screen on her phone is a headshot of herself.\n\nBehind the scenes, the congresswoman speaks casually. At the Waldorf, I watched her deliver a quick Oversight-campaign pitch via Zoom. It was a virtual meeting of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, she’d explained to me beforehand. But then, after the call, she wasn’t sure. “CAPAC is the Asian caucus, right?” she asked. “Yes,” the aide confirmed. “That would’ve been bad,” Crockett said with a laugh. She can also be brusque. During our interview at the Waldorf, she dialed up a staffer in D.C. in front of me and scolded him for an unclear note on her schedule. Another time, in the car, after an aide brought Crockett a paper bag full of food from a fundraiser, she peered inside, scrunched her nose, and said, “This looks like crap.”\n\nStill, Crockett is often more thoughtful in person than she might appear in clips. Once, after a hearing, I watched as she responded to a request for comment with a tight 90-second answer about faith and service. Another time, a reporter who was filming her tried to provoke her by asking what she would say to people who think she is “mentally ill.” “They can think whatever they want to, because as of now, we live in a democracy,” Crockett answered calmly, before taking another question. “I don’t want people to lose sight of the fact that this is someone with a very fine, legally trained mind,” Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a mentor of Crockett’s, told me.\n\nCrockett’s Republican critics like to say that she’s a private-school girl playing a plainspoken Texas brawler for social-media clout. They’re not wrong about her background. Crockett grew up an only child in St. Louis, not Dallas, and attended private high school before enrolling at Rhodes College, a small liberal-arts school in Tennessee. When Crockett was young, her father was a life-insurance salesman and a teacher, she told me, and she has talked often about his work as a preacher; her mother, she said, still works for the IRS. Crockett’s stage presence precedes her political career. At Rhodes, from which she graduated in 2003, she was recruited to the mock-trial program after a team leader watched her enthusiastic performance as the narrator Ronnette in Little Shop of Horrors, her former coach, Marcus Pohlmann, told me. She won a national award during her first and only year in the program.\n\nAs Crockett tells it, she became interested in the law after she and a few other Black students at Rhodes received anonymous letters containing racist threats. The school hired a Black female attorney from the Cochran Firm, a national personal-injury-law group, to handle the case, Crockett told me. The attorney became Crockett’s “shero,” she said, and inspired her to attend law school herself. When I asked for the name of her shero so that I could interview her, Crockett told me that she did not remember. I reached out to a former Cochran Firm attorney in Tennessee who fit Crockett’s description; she remembered the incident in broad terms but was not sure if she had worked on the case or with Crockett. Although Rhodes College had no specific records of the incident, two people who worked at the college at the time told me that they recalled it.\n\nCrockett worked for a few years as a public defender in deep-red Bowie County, Texas, before starting her own law firm, where she drew attention for defending Black Lives Matter demonstrators. She was sworn in to the Texas state House in 2021 and became the body’s third-most progressive member, according to the Texas Tribune, authoring dozens of bills, with an emphasis on criminal-justice reform. (None of the legislation for which she was the main author ever passed the Republican-dominated legislature.) “Most freshmen come, they are just trying to learn where the restrooms are,” but Crockett “came with a fight in her,” Texas Representative Toni Rose, a former Democratic colleague of Crockett’s, told me.\n\nHaving defeated an incumbent Democrat to win her seat, Crockett was already viewed as an agitator by some of her new colleagues. Then, in 2021, she became the unofficial spokesperson for a group of more than 50 Texas Democrats who fled to D.C. in a high-profile effort to stall Republican legislation. Her dealings with the press built up “real resentment” with Democratic leaders, one Texas-based party strategist, who was familiar with caucus actions at the time, told me. (This person, like some others interviewed for this story, was granted anonymity to speak candidly.) “When they broke quorum and it was important that everything be secret, she was on the phone to the press talking about what they were getting ready to do,” the strategist said. Both Crockett and her chief of staff at the time, Karrol Rimal, denied this version of events and told me that she had not given an interview before arriving in D.C. Rimal said that Crockett had agreed to do press only if the story would not be published until the Texas lawmakers crossed state lines. He added that state Democrats were sometimes jealous because Crockett “outshined them.”\n\nThe state-House drama was short-lived: After one term, Crockett became the handpicked replacement for 15-term U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson. Crockett sailed to victory, and less than a year later, her breakthrough moment arrived: While questioning a witness in a committee hearing, Crockett held up a photograph of several boxes in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom. The classified documents, she said, looked like they were “in the shitter to me!” Trump critics praised her as an “absolute star” and their “new favorite Congresswoman.”\n\nNot everyone agreed. Johnson felt that the freshman congresswoman was dismissive of her experience and advice, according to two sources familiar with the relationship. “I don’t think it was a secret” that by the time Johnson died, in December 2023, “she had had second thoughts about Jasmine,” the Texas-based Democratic strategist said. Crockett strongly denied this characterization and said that she had never heard it from those close to Johnson. I reached out to Johnson’s son for his view, but he didn’t respond.\n\nThe race to replace the Oversight Committee’s top Democrat, the late Representative Gerry Connolly, presented a multipurpose opportunity. Democrats could preview their resistance strategy for a second Trump administration. And Crockett, who’d run an unsuccessful, last-minute bid for a leadership position the previous year, could test her own viability as a party leader.\n\nIn late May, Crockett brought me along to a private meeting in the green-walled office of a freshman member—Maxine Dexter of Oregon—where she made her pitch: The Democrats have a communication problem, Crockett said. “The biggest issue” with Joe Biden’s presidency wasn’t “that he wasn’t a great president,” she explained. “It was that no one knew what the fuck he did.” (Crockett acknowledged to Dexter that the former president is “old as shit,” but said, “He’s an old man that gets shit done.”) Crockett highlighted her own emphasis on social media, and the hundreds of thousands of views she had received on a recent YouTube video. “The base is thirsty. The base right now is not very happy with us,” Crockett continued, and if any lawmaker could make them feel heard, “it’s me.”\n\nCrockett told Dexter that she had big plans for Oversight. She wanted to take hearings on the road, and to show voters that “these motherfuckers”—Republicans—are all “complicit” in Trump’s wrongdoing. She wasn’t worried about her own reelection. “I guess it’s my fearlessness,” she told Dexter.\n\nDexter asked Crockett about her relationship with leadership. Another young firebrand, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, had bumped up against then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she arrived in Congress, Dexter noted. Crockett dismissed that concern, explaining that she had never wanted to “burn it down” and prefers to be seen as working on behalf of the party. The national “Fighting Oligarchy” tour featuring Senator Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez is a good idea, Crockett said, but it “kind of makes people be like, Oh, it’s about them, right? Instead of the team.” (Through a spokesperson, Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment. Crockett told me that the two have a positive relationship.)\n\nBy the end of the meeting, Dexter was ready to vote for Crockett. But she would never get the chance. Five days after Crockett’s fundraiser in Atlanta, Punchbowl News reported that she had “leaned into the idea of impeaching President Donald Trump,” which spooked swing-district members. Representative Robert Garcia of California was quickly becoming the caucus favorite. Like Crockett, he was relatively young and outspoken. But he had spent his campaign making a “subtle” case for generational change, Punchbowl said, and he’d told members that the Oversight panel shouldn’t “function solely as an anti-Trump entity.”\n\nThe same day the Punchbowl report was published, 62 Democratic leaders met to decide which of the four Oversight candidates they’d recommend to the caucus. The vote was decisive: Garcia, with 33 votes, was the winner. Crockett placed last, with only six. Around midnight, she went live on Instagram to announce that she was withdrawing her name from the race; Garcia would be elected the next morning. In the end, “recent questions about something that just wasn’t true” had tanked her support, Crockett told her Instagram viewers. She hadn’t campaigned on impeaching Trump, she told me later; she’d simply told a reporter that, if Democrats held a majority in the House, she would support an impeachment inquiry. And why not? She was just being transparent, Crockett told me, “and frankly, I may not get a lot of places because I am very transparent.”\n\nSome of Crockett’s fellow Democrats find that candor refreshing. “People don’t necessarily agree with her aggressive communication style,” Representative Julie Johnson of Texas told me. “I’m thrilled she’s doing it, because we need it all.” Garcia, in a statement from his office, told me that Crockett is “one of the strongest fighters we have,” and that, “as a party, we should be taking notes on the kinds of skills she exemplifies.” But several other Democrats I reached out to about the race seemed uninterested in weighing in. Thirteen of her colleagues on the Oversight and Judiciary committees, along with 20 other Democratic members I contacted for this story, either declined to talk with me on the record or didn’t respond to my interview requests. Senior staffers for three Democratic members told me that some of Crockett’s colleagues see her as undisciplined but are reluctant to criticize her publicly. “She likes to talk,” one of the staffers said. “Is she a loose cannon? Sometimes. Does that cause headaches for other members? 100 percent.”\n\nCrockett said that people are free to disagree with her communication style, but that she “was elected to speak up for the people that I represent.” As for her colleagues, four days before this story was published, Crockett called me to express frustration that I had reached out to so many House members without telling her first. She was, she told me, “shutting down the profile and revoking all permissions.”\n\nCrockett does not have supporters so much as she has admirers. Everywhere she goes, young people ask for selfies, and groups of her red-clad Delta Sigma Theta sorority sisters pop up to cheer her on. A few days before she dropped out of the Oversight race, a congregation outside of Atlanta full of middle-aged Black Georgians was giddy to host her: Here was Jasmine Crockett, recounting her feud with Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n“She thought she could play with me,” Crockett told Pastor Jamal Bryant, the leader of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church and a progressive activist. There were a few “oh no”s in the crowd. “The average, maybe, person in my party potentially would have just let it go,” Crockett went on. “I wasn’t the one.” There were claps and whoops. “I was steaming, and I was ready,” she said. “I was like, ‘Well, two wrongs gonna make a right today, baby, cause I ain’t gonna let it go!’” The righteous anger in Crockett’s voice was audible; people applauded for it, probably because it sounded a lot like their own.\n\nCrockett’s fans are rooting for her to go bigger. And when I asked if she was considering running for Senate in the future—John Cornyn is up for reelection next year—Crockett didn’t wave me off. “My philosophy is: Stay ready so you don’t have to get ready,” she said. Crockett imagines a world in which Democrats are associated with lofty ideals and monosyllabic slogans, like Barack Obama once was. When I asked her what the party should stand for beyond being against Trump, and what she stands for, she explained, “For me, I always just say ‘the people,’” adding that her campaigns have always been associated with “fire.”\n\nPlenty of other Democrats believe that Crockett’s approach comes dangerously close to arson. Her critics argue that it’s easy to be outspoken in a safe Democratic seat; they might also point out that Crockett received 7,000 fewer votes in 2024 than Johnson, her predecessor, had in 2020. You can see James Carville coming from a mile away. “I don’t think we need a Marjorie Taylor Greene,” the longtime Democratic consultant told me. Crockett is “passionate. She has an instinct for making headlines. But does that help us at the end of the day?” he said. “You’re trying to win the election. That’s the overall goal.”\n\nCrockett is not Marjorie Taylor Greene; for one, she is not peddling space-laser, weather-control conspiracy theories. Yet Crockett’s combative style could be a misreading of the moment, Lakshya Jain, an analyst at the political-forecasting site Split Ticket, told me. “People think the brand issue that Democrats have is they don’t fight enough and that they’re not mean enough,” Jain said, but “those are all just proxies for saying that they can’t get stuff done for people.” In Congress, Crockett has championed progressive causes and introduced plenty of legislation, but none of the bills she’s been the lead sponsor of has become law.\n\nClearly, though, lots of real-life voters want Jasmine Crockett. At the church outside Atlanta, Pastor Bryant triggered a standing ovation when he declared, “Jasmine Crockett for president” and “2028 is coming, y’all!” Outside, in the parking lot, someone shouted at Crockett, “First Black-woman president!” June was a disheartening month for Crockett. She was soundly rejected by her own colleagues and shut out of a chance at institutional power. But when we talked in her hotel room in Atlanta, she’d framed the situation differently: If Americans on the outside could vote, she’d insisted, “I absolutely feel like I know where it would go.”","summary":"Jasmine Crockett is testing out the coarse style of politics that the GOP has embraced.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/jasmine-crockett-democrats/683652/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_hLgSsuu7lxJdiH2M-TzIKhHOxw=/459x340:1539x1420/1080x1080/media/img/mt/2025/07/2025_07_24_jasmine_crockett_h/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-27 11:00:00","author":"Elaine Godfrey","authors":["Elaine Godfrey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.364},{"id":345662682,"title":"Jay Leno criticizes modern late-night comedy for alienating half the audience with partisan politics","text":"Jay Leno reflected on why he always kept his jokes politically balanced while hosting “The Tonight Show” for over two decades. \n\nThe 75-year-old comedian recently sat down for an interview with David Trulio, the president and CEO of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, during which he was questioned about his approach to political humor. \n\n“I read that there was an analysis done of your work on ‘The Tonight Show’ for the 22 years and that your jokes were roughly equally balanced between going after Republicans and taking aim at Democrats. Did you have a strategy?” Trulio asked. \n\n“It was fun to me when I got hate letters [like] ‘Dear Mr. Leno, you and your Republican friends’ and ‘Well, Mr. Leno, I hope you and your Democratic buddies are happy‘ — over the same joke,” Leno recalled.\n\n‘And I go, ’Well, that’s good,'” he said. “That’s how you get a whole audience.”\n\nLeno went on to note how late-night comedy has changed amid the current divisive political landscape. \n\n“Now you have to be content with half the audience because you have [to] give your opinion,” Leno said. \n\nWhen Trulio asked if Leno had any advice for comedians today, the “Jay Leno’s Garage” host referred to his longtime friendship with late comedy legend Rodney Dangerfield.\n\n“I knew Rodney 40 years,” he said. “I have no idea if he was Democrat or Republican. We never discussed [it], we just discussed jokes.”\n\n“And to me, I like to think that people come to a comedy show to kind of get away from the things, you know, the pressures of life, whatever it might be,” Leno continued. “And I love political humor, don’t get me wrong, but it’s just what happens when people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other.”\n\nWhile speaking with Trulio, Leno discussed how comedy could be used to create common ground.\n\n“Funny is funny,” Leno said. “It’s funny when someone who’s not….when you make fun of their side and they laugh at it, you know, that’s kind of what I do.” \n\n“I just find getting out — I don’t think anybody wants to hear a lecture,” he continued. “When I was with Rodney, it was always in the economy of words — get to the joke as quickly as possible.”\n\nTrulio pointed out that both Leno and Dangerfield achieved massive success during their careers, noting the two’s “approach worked in the marketplace.” \n\n“Well, why shoot for just half an audience all the time? You know, why not try to get the whole [audience],” Leno replied. \n\n“I mean, I like to bring people into the big picture,” he explained. “I don’t understand why you would alienate one particular group, you know, or just don’t do it at all. I’m not saying you have to throw your support or whatever, but just do what’s funny.”\n\nLeno’s comments come amid the uproar that ensued after CBS announced on July 17 that it was canceling “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” with the show’s final episode scheduled to air in May 2026. \n\nAt the time, the network clarified that the cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,” and noted, “It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”\n\nWeeks ahead of the cancellation, CBS and Paramount paid President Donald Trump a $16 million settlement following his lawsuit against the news network for airing an edited interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. \n\nColbert, who frequently blasts Trump on his show, criticized the settlement and described it as a “big fat bribe” during an episode that aired days before the cancellation was announced. \n\nThe host’s supporters, including several politicians, have accused CBS and Paramount of canceling “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” for political reasons. \n\nTrump celebrated the news of the cancellation in a post on his platform Truth Social, which drew a fiery response from Colbert, who told the president “Go f— yourself” during the opening monologue of his show on Monday. \n\nSeveral fellow late night show hosts and comedians have rallied around Colbert. “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon and “Late Night” host Seth Meyers, “Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver and “The Daily Show” host Jon Stewart attended Colbert’s taping on Monday in a show of support.\n\nStewart and Oliver previously worked alongside Colbert on “The Daily Show.”\n\nOn Friday, “The Late Show” creator David Letterman slammed CBS’ decision to cancel the long-running show as “pure cowardice” and asserted that the network mistreated Colbert, who succeeded him as host in 2015.\n\nFox News Digital’s Gabriel Hays contributed to this report.","summary":"Leno went on to note how late-night comedy has changed amid the current divisive political landscape. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/27/media/jay-leno-slams-late-night-hosts-for-alienating-half-audience-with-partisan-politics-against-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-m4t8znwxs-1753610251728.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1753595894&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-27 10:52:10","author":"Fox News,Gabriel Hays","authors":["Fox News","Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":345688524,"title":"The Left Is Still Denying Reality  ","text":"It’s not every day that ideas from quantum physics pass into political discourse.

He started it, and [Joe] Biden was there with him, and [James] Comey was there, and [James] Clapper. The whole group was there,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. \n\n“Whether it’s right or wrong, it’s time to go after people,” Trump said. “This was treason. This was every word you can think of. They tried to steal the election. They tried to obfuscate the election. They did things that nobody’s ever even imagined.”\n\nTrump referenced a trove of declassified documents released by Gabbard’s team on July 18. The team concluded that the evidence that Russia wanted Trump elected president in 2016 was much weaker than advertised. Nevertheless, the narrative that Russia sought a Trump victory was the framing that the Obama administration chose in its initial intelligence assessment.\n\n“There is irrefutable evidence that details how President Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an intelligence community assessment that they knew was false,” Gabbard said at a White House press briefing on Wednesday. “They knew it would promote this contrived narrative that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help President Trump win, selling it to the American people as though it were true. It wasn’t.”\n\nA spokesman for Obama denounced the “bizarre allegations” by Trump as “ridiculous” and “a weak attempt at distraction.” \n\nThe “distraction” presumably refers to the Jeffrey Epstein files. “The witch hunt that you should be talking about is they caught President Obama absolutely cold. … They tried to rig the election, and they got caught — and there should be very severe consequences for that,” Trump said in response to an Epstein-related question.\n\n“Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,” Obama’s spokesman continued. “These findings were affirmed in a 2020 report by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, led by then-Chairman Marco Rubio.”\n\nThe exchange highlighted a long-running feud between the two presidents. A famous real estate developer and reality TV star, Trump built his political brand through relentless attacks on Obama during the latter’s presidency. This included trafficking in conspiracy theories about Obama being constitutionally ineligible to serve as president because he was born in Kenya (all pertinent records show Obama was born in Hawaii).\n\nObama may have baited Trump into running for president with frequent snarky counterattacks, including an extended roast at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. In October 2016, Obama participated in a Jimmy Kimmel Live segment in which he read “mean tweets” about himself. He included one from Trump, saying Obama “will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!”\n\n“Hey, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president,” Obama shot back, triumphantly dropping his smartphone to laughter from the adoring studio audience.\n\nTrump was elected president the following month.\n\nThe Obama coalition was eroded in 2016 and blown apart in 2024. While some of that had to do with neither Hillary Clinton nor Kamala Harris sharing Obama’s charisma and political talents — not to mention former President Joe Biden’s unpopular single term in office — the 44th president’s failings received much less attention. \n\nThis was partly due to the Democrats’ fixation on Russia allegedly swinging the 2016 presidential election to Trump, which eventually exceeded the party’s focus on Obama-Trump voters in the battleground states. Majorities of Democrats even told pollsters they believed Russia altered vote totals to elect Trump, though the intelligence community and mainstream Democratic elected officials never alleged this.\n\nObama’s effectiveness on the campaign trail on Harris’s behalf in 2024 has been regularly questioned. (He once seemingly accused young black men who were reluctant to vote for the Democratic ticket of sexism.) But while Obama privately criticized Biden, his vice president, for the reelection campaign he had been running before dropping out and entertained similar doubts about Harris before she took over, the drubbing down-ballot Democrats took during the eight years he was president was a big reason the party was stuck with those two as options.\n\nNonwhite voters have slowly started drifting away from the Democratic Party after Obama put up two phenomenal performances with these voting blocs in 2008 and 2012. What remains of Obama’s “coalition of the ascendant” is college-educated white people, who weren’t quite enough for Harris last year.\n\nGabbard is a prime example of an Obama-era Democrat who has since defected to Trump’s GOP. She did not think Obama went far enough on foreign policy or civil liberties in office. She resigned from a Democratic National Committee leadership position because she supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and believed the DNC was biased against him in the 2016 Democratic primaries. Four years later, she launched a viral attack on Kamala Harris when she sought the nomination herself.\n\nNow, Gabbard is leading the charge in an investigation of the Trump-Russia investigators.\n\nTrump and Obama had seemingly buried the hatchet at former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral late last year, where the two were seen having a genial conversation. “I said, ‘Boy, they look like two people that like each other.’ And we probably do,” Trump said when asked about the viral video of their chat. “We have a little different philosophies, right? But we probably do. I don’t know. We just got along. But I got along with just about everybody.”\n\nTRUMP AND RUSSIAGATE, RECONSIDERED \n\nBut each of them believes the other undermined their legitimacy as president — Trump with the Obama birtherism and its racial undertones, Obama with his role in promoting the Russiagate scandal that took up much of Trump’s first term. Trump’s second term got off to a noticeably better start without any similar controversy hanging over him, and Democratic elected officials generally accepted he won without an asterisk.\n\nThe release of Gabbard documents has ripped open these old wounds. Depending on what the Department of Justice does next following Gabbard’s criminal referrals, things could be about to get uglier than ever.","summary":"This week brought another reminder that the political careers of President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama will forever be inextricably linked. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard put Obama squarely at the helm of a 2016 plot to discredit Trump before he took office, putting his successor in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s shadow.

Did you have a strategy?\" Trulio asked. \"It was fun to me when I got hate letters [like] ‘Dear Mr. Leno, you and your Republican friends’ and ‘Well, Mr. Leno, I hope you and your Democratic buddies are happy' — over the same joke,\" Leno recalled.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER At the time, the network clarified that the cancellation was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" and noted, \"It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\" Weeks ahead of the cancellation, CBS and Paramount paid President Donald Trump a $16 million settlement following his lawsuit against the news network for airing an edited interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election. Colbert, who frequently blasts Trump on his show, criticized the settlement and described it as a \"big fat bribe\" during an episode that aired days before the cancellation was announced. The host's supporters, including several politicians, have accused CBS and Paramount of canceling \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" for political reasons. Trump celebrated the news of the cancellation in a post on his platform Truth Social, which drew a fiery response from Colbert, who told the president \"Go f--- yourself\" during the opening monologue of his show on Monday.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (6%) could be considered “household names” at the national level. \n\nMoreover, the 2028 Democratic National Convention is roughly three years away. It is extremely difficult for voters to know now who they will prefer then, thus, they often default to the familiar face.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 – analogous to right now in the 2028 presidential cycle – Gallup released a poll among Democratic primary voters. \n\nHillary Clinton (40%) was dominating the field, trailed by John Kerry (16%) and John Edwards (15%). The eventual winner – former President Barack Obama – was not even considered a serious enough contender to be included in the poll. \n\nAll of this is to say that it is entirely possible that the Democrats’ eventual nominee is not even among the list of more than 20 candidates polled by Echelon Insights. \n\nUnderscoring the necessity for Harris to discount this poll is something I discussed earlier this month. \n\nA separate 2028 poll from Emerson, reported Buttigieg (16%) leading Harris (13%). \n\nAt the time, I wrote that Emerson’s data points to a wide-open race for the party’s nomination, and Echelon’s poll showing Harris with a lead reinforces the conclusion that there is no established Democratic front runner, including Harris.\n\nFinally, were Harris to read this poll as a desire for her candidacy in 2028, its highly likely that she will confront many – or all – of the same challenges that hobbled her 2024 candidacy. \n\nBack on the national stage, voters would be reminded of Harris’ position in the previous Biden administration, which was deeply unpopular at its end. \n\nOne can easily imagine how awkward the primary would be when Harris was forced to defend the Biden administration – and her role in it – against competitors from her own party.\n\nThroughout her campaign, Harris struggled to separate herself from former President Biden throughout her campaign, nor was she able to truly define a wholly new platform or agenda for a Harris presidency.\n\nAnd, when Harris did take decisive stands on various policies, she was seen as either too far-left or inauthentic. \n\nTaken together, it appears that Harris’ best bet for a continued political future would be to enter the race for California governor. \n\nShe is almost certain to emerge from the state’s primary either against a much lesser-known Democrat or a Republican, against both of whom Harris would be the clear favorite. \n\nAs governor, Harris would be able to gain experience in an executive position, remain politically relevant, and build a platform if she chose to run in 2032, when she’d only be 67 years old.\n\nIn that same vein, with the Democratic Party as a whole facing its own crossroads in the wake of Zohran Mamdani’s primary win in New York City, Harris would be able to survey shifting political landscapes and decide what type of candidate she wants to be in 2032.\n\nFurther, despite California’s shift to the center on certain issues such as crime and homelessness, Harris’ more left-leaning platform would not be the same obstacle in California that it would be in a national election.\n\nTo be clear, Harris would have to be extremely careful not to replicate former President Richard Nixon, whose bid for California governor was marred by suspicion that he was using California as a steppingstone back to Washington after his loss in the 1960 presidential election. \n\nUltimately, nobody – possibly even including Harris – knows what the former vice president will decide, and few could fault her for wanting a redo after the unprecedented circumstances that led to her presidential candidacy. \n\nHowever, if Harris hopes to have another shot as a truly viable candidate, her best course of action is undoubtedly to try her hand at the job in Sacramento. \n\nViewed in that light, Harris’ advisors would best serve her by convincing her that Echelon’s poll is a flash in the pan, not a sign of genuine desire for her return to the presidential conversation. \n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Ultimately, nobody – possibly even including Harris – knows what the former vice president will decide.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/27/whatever-the-polls-say-kamala-harris-shouldnt-run-for-president-in-2028/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP24311777031117.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-27 07:16:47","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":345654144,"title":"Celebrity Payments Row: Donald Trump Targets Kamala;

IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO,' Trump argued.\n\n'Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying people to endorse them? All hell would break out!'\n\n'Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW,' the president continued. 'They should all be prosecuted!'\n\nTrump has made similar claims in the past, writing in December that 'Beyoncé didn't sing, Oprah didn't do much of anything (she called it \"expenses\") and Al is just a third-rate conman.'\n\nBut the Harris campaign repeatedly denied that it had engaged in any wrongdoing, with Adrienne Elrod, who served as a senior spokesperson for the campaign, insisting it never paid anyone for their endorsements or campaign activity.\n\n'We have never paid any artist and performer. We have never paid a fee to that person,' he told Deadline in November.\n\nOprah also hit out at the claims, arguing that she did not get 'one dime' from the campaign.\n\nInstead, she said, the Harris campaign simply reimbursed her production company, Harpo Productions, for organizing a town hall event.\n\n'[M]y production company Harpo was asked to bring in set design, lights, cameras, microphones, crew, producers, and every other item necessary (including the benches and chairs we sat on) to put on a live production,' she wrote. \n\n'I did not take any personal fee,' she said. 'However the people who worked on that production needed to be paid. And were. End of story.'\n\nStill, the Chicago Tribune blasted the billionaire former talk show host over her decision to allow her company to accept the payment - suggesting Winfrey should have paid her workers' fees herself.\n\n'Frankly, $1 million is not all that much to Winfrey and so we very much doubt that she was seeking any kind of personal payday from her chosen candidate,' the editorial board wrote in a column. \n\n'But she does own Harpo and serves as its chairwoman and CEO. The production fees should have been a campaign donation.'\n\nMeanwhile, MSNBC's Al Sharpton also came under fire when it was revealed his National Action Network had accepted $500,000 from the Harris campaign ahead of a sit-down interview with the then-vice president.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager and Trump supporter Bill Ackman led the charge, telling Megyn Kelly on her show that the payments were an attempt 'to manipulate the audience.' \n\nThen on October 20, Sharpton praised Harris' 'extraordinary historic campaign' in a gushing interview, as he branded Donald Trump 'hostile and erratic.' \n\nAs the controversy continued, a spokesman for MSNBC said it was 'unaware' of the Harris campaign's donations to National Action Network. \n\n'MSNBC was unaware of the donations made to the National Action Network,' the spokesman told the Free Beacon as he declined to share whether the network would take any actions against the reverend.\n\nHe said that the company does not comment on 'personnel matters.' \n\nIt remains unclear where President Trump got the $11 million figure for Beyoncé, but Federal Election Commission records show the Harris campaign did pay her production company, Parkwood Production Media LLC $165,000.\n\nSuch reimbursements are frequently associated with large event productions and cannot be donated to political campaigns, according to The Hill. \n\nDaily Mail has reached out to representatives for Oprah, Beyoncé and MSNBC for comment.","summary":"Trump suggested he would prosecute Democrats for paying celebrities like Oprah and Beyoncé - claiming they were illegally bribing the A-listers to endorse Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14944275/Trump-illegal-payout-Democrats-Kamala-Harris-Beyonce-Oprah.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/27/06/92072253-0-image-m-80_1753595466672.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/10/26/5090067307202232891/1024x576_MP4_5090067307202232891.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-27 05:54:50","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.635},{"id":345595522,"title":"Trump Demands Prosecution of Kamala Harris Over Alleged Paid Endorsements","text":"Washington: US President Donald Trump demanded the prosecution of Vice President Kamala Harris and several top American celebrities for allegedly receiving and paying millions of dollars for endorsements during the 2024 presidential election. Trump called the practice \"totally illegal\" and accused Democrats of violating campaign finance laws. In a post on his Truth Social account, Trump alleged that Harris spent millions to secure endorsements from public figures such as singer Beyoncé, TV host Oprah Winfrey, and civil rights activist Al Sharpton. He claimed these endorsements were paid for, not genuine, and called for legal action. \"I'm looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats, after the Presidential Election, and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, Eleven Million Dollars to singer Beyoncé for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!), Three Million Dollars for 'expenses,' to Oprah, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars to very low rated TV 'anchor,' Al Sharpton (a total lightweight!), and others to be named for doing, absolutely NOTHING!\" Trump wrote.

He further claimed the Epstein investigation is just another politically charged \"Russia Hoax,\" now being used under a new pretext: \"the Jeffrey Epstein SCAM.\" According to The Hill, Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to work on releasing grand jury testimonies related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Beyonce’s mother Tina Knowles previously said the accusation that her daughter was paid for her endorsement is a “lie” and that Beyonce also paid for the flights for herself and her team to and from the event.\n\nIt’s not the first time that Trump has targeted Beyonce and other celebrities over their alleged “illegal campaign donations” late at night.\n\nThe president lashed out at the Lemonade singer as well as Bruce Springsteen and Bono in a 2 a.m. Truth Social post on May 19.\n\nIn another pair of posts shortly after 1 a.m. while still in Scotland, Trump threatened NBC and ABC, and suggested that networks he believes are “political pawns for the Democrat Party” should be stripped of their licenses to broadcast.\n\n“It has become so outrageous that, in my opinion, their licenses could, and should, be revoked! MAGA,” he wrote\n\nTrump has also routinely used threats of legal action to threaten media outlets, publishers and journalists over what he perceives as antagonistic coverage.\n\nFollowing lawsuits against the networks during his campaign, Trump reached massive financial settlements with both ABC News and CBS News, sparking fears among press freedom advocates.\n\nSuch fears have not been allayed, after the president this week filed a $10 billion lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, The Wall Street Journal and its parent companies, as well as two journalists, following the newspaper’s publication of the president’s alleged birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThat suit came fresh of the back of a $16 million settlement with Paramount for a lawsuit concerning the editing of an episode of 60 Minutes interview with Harris, which the president claimed was unfair to his campaign.","summary":"The president, who is currently touring his golf resorts in the UK, baselessly alleged they ‘BROKE THE LAW’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-lawsuit-beyonce-oprah-kamala-harris-b2796708.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/27/4/26/FILE-PHOTO-U-S--President-Trump-visits-Scotland-e0l42x74.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/sO4QU0X5-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-27 04:09:23","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.326},{"id":345597330,"title":"Trump calls for major TV network to have license revoked for being 'pawn' for Democratic Party","text":"Donald Trump called for NBC News to be stripped of its license for being a 'pawn' of the Democratic Party in a blistering social media spree. \n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Saturday night as he slammed the network for having 'terrible' programming, and that 'their management is even worse.' \n\n'They are an arm of the Democrat Party, and should be held accountable for that,' Trump wrote. \n\nHe added that 'likewise, Fake News ABC!!!

He had previously accused Harris of paying high-profile public figures to support her campaign. He has now restated those figures publicly: $11 million to Beyoncé, $3 million to Oprah, and $600,000 to Al Sharpton.Live EventsIn an earlier post from December, Trump commented, \"Beyoncé didn’t sing, Oprah didn’t do much of anything (she called it ‘expenses’), and Al is just a third rate Con Man.\"Trump’s posts suggest he believes these payments were disguised as event costs or production expenses, misrepresented in campaign finance records.Responses and backgroundOprah Winfrey addressed similar accusations last year, saying, “I was not paid a dime to appear. The people who worked on that production needed to be paid. And were. End of story.”Records from the Federal Election Commission show the Harris campaign paid $165,000 to Parkwood Entertainment, Beyoncé’s production company. Such payments are legally allowed when related to event production, and cannot be treated as donations or personal compensation.No formal evidence has been presented so far to support the claim that endorsements were bought. The Harris campaign previously denied that any payments were made in exchange for political support.Epstein case clouds Trump’s commentsTrump’s accusations against Harris and the Democrats come at a time when he is under growing pressure over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. The renewed interest in the case has drawn attention from both Republican and Democratic voters, with public calls for more transparency.Trump has dismissed the Epstein-related scrutiny as politically motivated. In another Truth Social post, he wrote:\"The Radical Left Democrats are doing everything in their power to distract and obfuscate from our GREAT six months of service to America, results of which many are saying is the BEST six months in Presidential history.\"He added, \"They have gone absolutely CRAZY, and are playing another Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax but, this time, under the guise of what we will call the Jeffrey Epstein SCAM. Hopefully, the Grand Jury Files will put an end to this HOAX.\"According to The Hill, Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to work on releasing the grand jury testimonies of both Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The move follows mounting demand from across the political spectrum for full disclosure of court records linked to the Epstein case.Trump’s accusations, though unproven, place public pressure on Harris and the Democratic Party at a sensitive moment. They also reflect his broader strategy of casting doubt on the integrity of his political rivals, while deflecting criticism of his own record.The Federal Election Commission has not commented on the claims, and no official investigations into the alleged payments have been announced.Whether Trump's allegations lead to any formal inquiry remains uncertain. But they have already stirred debate over transparency, legality and ethics in American election campaigns.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onDonald Trump Kamala Harris allegations2024 presidential election endorsementslegal action against Kamala HarrisTrump Truth Social postTrump Epstein case scrutinypolitical endorsements legalityBeyonce endorsement controversyFederal Election CommissionDemocratic Party campaign financeOprah Winfrey political endorsements\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

He alleged the endorsements were paid for and not genuine, and called for legal action.\n\"I'm looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats, after the Presidential Election, and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, Eleven Million Dollars to singer Beyonce for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!), Three Million Dollars for 'expenses,' to Oprah, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars to very low rated TV 'anchor,' Al Sharpton (a total lightweight!), and others to be named for doing, absolutely NOTHING!

All hell would break out! Kamala and all of those who received Endorsement money BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted,\" he further added. Trump's fresh attack comes amid controversy over his own handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files.\nEarlier, Trump slammed the investigation into the Epstein case as a politically motivated campaign. He referred to it as a \"con job\" by Democrats to distract from his performance, The Hill reported.\n\"The Radical Left Democrats are doing everything in their power to distract and obfuscate from our GREAT six months of service to America, results of which many are saying is the BEST six months in Presidential history,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\nHe added, \"They have gone absolutely CRAZY, and are playing another Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax but, this time, under the guise of what we will call the Jeffrey Epstein SCAM. Hopefully, the Grand Jury Files will put an end to this HOAX.\"\nAccording to The Hill, Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to work on releasing the grand jury testimonies of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The decision follows public pressure for more transparency from both parties, including members of Trump's MAGA base.

He arrived in his mother&apos;s birth country on Friday evening local time. His presence has turned the picturesque and normally quiet area into a virtual fortress, with roads closed and police checkpoints in place. Police officers — some on quad bikes and others on foot with sniffer dogs — patrolled the famous course and the sandy beaches and grass dunes that flank it. Secret Service snipers were positioned at vantage points while some other golfers on the course were patted down by security personnel. The 79-year-old Trump touched down Friday at nearby Prestwick Airport as hundreds of onlookers came out to see Air Force One and catch a glimpse of its famous passenger. The president has professed a love of Scotland, but his controversial politics and business investments in the country have made for an uneasy relationship. Speaking to reporters on the tarmac, Trump immediately waded into the debate surrounding high levels of irregular migration, and lashed out at renewable energy efforts. \"You better get your act together or you&apos;re not going to have Europe anymore,\" he said, adding that migration was \"killing\" the continent. \"Stop the windmills. You&apos;re ruining your countries,\" he added. Trump&apos;s five-day visit, which is set to mix leisure with business and diplomacy, has divided the local community. His resort is not only well protected but it&apos;s also in a relatively remote area, meaning most protesters chose to make their voices heard in Scotland&apos;s big cities. Over on the east coast, several hundred protesters demonstrated outside the US consulate in the capital Edinburgh and further north in the city of Aberdeen, near where Trump owns another golf resort. The protests were organised by the Stop Trump Coalition, which has called on Scotland&apos;s First Minister not to attend a scheduled meeting with Trump. Participants held placards with slogans like \"Scotland hates Trump\" and waved Palestinian flags. \"I am here because of fascism in America under Trump&apos;s rule. I am here because of genocide in Gaza that is being funded and enabled by British and American governments,\" said 44-year-old Amy Hanlon in Aberdeen. Others said they did not want him in Scotland. \"People need to stand up to Trump and he needs to know there’s people who don’t like what he’s doing, what he’s doing to the world and the affect he’ll have on our children’s future,\" one protester said. Many were furious about the cost of the US president&apos;s trip. \"He&apos;s here on a private trip to look around his golf courses and the amount of money it&apos;s costing the Scottish tax payer is absolutely obscene,\" one protester said. The anger was not just directed at Trump, but also at British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has put a lot of time and effort into building a good working relationship with the US president. \"I&apos;m disgusted by him … It&apos;s disgraceful. He&apos;s pandering to the right and he has been since the start of his Prime Ministership,\" one protester told SBS News. Starmer will meet Trump on Monday AEST while on Tuesday the President is expected to meet Scotland&apos;s First Minister John Swinney, who publicly endorsed Kamala Harris. \"I can see that on balance it probably needs to happen, it could be really awkward on some counts if the First Minister does not meet with him, but personally I think it would have said a lot more if John Swinney had said &apos;I&apos;m not meeting with that man&apos;,\" a protesting Scot said. Not everyone was against his visit. At Prestwick Airport on Friday evening a boy held a sign that read \"Welcome Trump\" while a man waved a flag emblazoned with Trump&apos;s most famous slogan — Make America Great Again. \"I think the best thing about Trump is he&apos;s not actually a politician yet he&apos;s the most powerful man in the world and I think he&apos;s looking at the best interests of his own country,\" said 46-year-old Lee McLean, who had travelled from nearby Kilmarnock. \"Most politicians should really be looking at the best interests of their own country first before looking overseas,\" he told Agence France-Presse. Trump is due to discuss trade with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen in Turnberry on Monday AEST. Trump is scheduled to return to the US on Tuesday but will be back in the UK for a state visit between 17-19 September, when he will be hosted by King Charles III. download our app subscribe to our newsletter</b","summary":"Protests have been held across Scotland against US President Donald Trump’s visit to the country.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/donald-trump-plays-golf-as-angry-scots-protest-visit/2np7dbx89","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/13dee85/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+594/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2F87%2F873531714d7eae872c136c812658%2Fdonald-trump-scotland.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-27 03:11:15","author":"Pa / Jane Barlow","authors":["Pa / Jane Barlow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":345593752,"title":"'Illegal': Trump says Democrats Paid Celebrities For Endorsements, Seeks Kamala's Prosecution","text":"US President Donald Trump on Saturday (local time) accused the Democratic Party of illegally paying millions of dollars to celebrities in return for their endorsements during the 2024 presidential election campaign.\nHe said that Kamala Harris – who was his rival in last year’s polls – broke the law and should be prosecuted, stating that “all hell would break out” if politicians started paying people to endorse them.\nIn a lengthy post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump claimed that the Democrats owed a “large amount of money”.\n“I’m looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats, after the Presidential Election, and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, Eleven Million Dollars to singer Beyoncé for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!), Three Million Dollars for “expenses,” to Oprah,” Trump posted on X.\n\n“Six Hundred Thousand Dollars to very low rated TV “anchor,” Al Sharpton (a total lightweight!), and others to be named for doing, absolutely NOTHING!

Winfrey “appeared alongside Kamala Harris in a televised townhall-style interview in September” and at a rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the night before the presidential election:\n\nOprah Winfrey — who is estimated to be a billionaire — appeared alongside Kamala Harris in a televised townhall-style interview in September and later at a rally in Philadelphia the night before the election where the former talkshow queen fear-mongered toward women, claiming that if they did not show up to vote, they might never get the chance again.\n\nHarris’s campaign has also denied that Beyoncé was paid for an endorsement, though records from the Federal Elections Commission shows that Harris’s campaign paid “Beyoncé’s production company” $165,000, the Hill reported.\n\nFinance records have shown that Harris’s presidential campaign, which ended up $20 million in debt after having raised $1 billion, also gave Sharpton’s civil rights organization, National Action Network (NAN), $500,000, which was “split between two payments.”\n\nFinance records show that Harris for President gave half a million dollars to the National Action Network (NAN), founded by Sharpton in 1991, split between two payments on September 5 and October 1.\nOn October 20, Sharpton tossed Harris “softball questions” on his MSNBC show, PoliticsNation.\n\nTrump previously called “for a major investigation” as to whether the Harris campaign paid entertainment elites for endorsements, and questioned “how much” Harris paid Bruce Springsteen “for his poor performance during her campaign for president” and whether he accepted the money.\n\n“I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post from May. “Candidates aren’t allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment.

IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO. Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted!”\n\nThe claims, unsupported by any public evidence and not corroborated by campaign filings or independent fact-checkers, come at a time when Mr Trump faces intensifying scrutiny over his own dealings, especially renewed attention to his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and demands from both supporters and critics for full disclosure of the “Epstein files.”\n\nJeffrey Epstein was a wealthy financier charged with operating a sex trafficking ring that exploited dozens of underage girls for sexual abuse, including recruiting victims from multiple countries, before he died in jail awaiting trial in 2019.\n\nThe release of the Epstein files has been highly anticipated, with many hoping the documents will reveal new information about powerful individuals connected to Epstein’s trafficking network and shed light on unresolved questions about his death.\n\nMr Trump’s latest social media outburst follows a pattern of rapid-fire postings unrelated to the mounting questions about Epstein’s death and Mr Trump’s own actions.\n\nThis includes recent Truth Social posts ranging from attacking US agency officials and Washington football team branding, to sharing AI-generated videos of Barack Obama’s fictional arrest and promoting unrelated government document dumps.\n\nRepublican strategists and political analysts note that such diversions are typical of Mr Trump’s tried-and-tested playbook: generating new controversies or provoking media outrage in an effort to overwhelm coverage of more damaging topics.\n\n“As controversy over Epstein refuses to die down, Mr Trump and his inner circle have repeatedly tried to pivot public attention to new outrages,” said Republican strategist Alex Conant in a recent interview.\n\n“Nobody turns the page better than Donald Trump.

And so when you've harnessed it, that feels like such a better victory.' \nIn 2013, Drew sold her 1937 country estate, located in beautiful Montecito, California, for $6.35million, which was well below the asking price of $7.5million.\n\nView gallery\n\nShe now regards happiness as a 'choice' that one has to 'work for'\nThe Charlie's Angels star bought the two-acre home in 2010 for $5.7 million dollars, so she was able to walk away with a sizable profit.\nThe traditional home is six thousand square feet, has six bedrooms, seven and a half baths and an additional one bedroom guesthouse.\nAfter moving from the mansion in 2013, Drew reportedly moved on to Manhattan duplex with her then-husband Will Kopelman while still having a California space.\nWhen they split in 2016, Will moved to New York and Drew followed so that they could 'carry on as a family', despite being separated - adding that she didn't want it to affect her kids. \nFollowing her move, she has since kept the details of her properties private.\n\nSubscribe to continue reading\n\nTry 4 weeks for free then just $0.50 per week\nStart trial\n\nUnlimited access to DailyMail.com\n80% fewer ads on web\nHundreds of exclusive articles per month\nBest of DailyMail+ weekly newsletter\nAlready a subscriber?

Trump’s election alongside a Republican Congress meant the previous administration’s failed tax-and-spend policies would soon be replaced by policies similar to those that helped the economy thrive during the first Trump term. The magnitude of the capex comeback is enormous.\n\nAs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently highlighted, “Business equipment production jumped 11% (annualized) in Q2, following a massive 23% gain in Q1 — the strongest non-pandemic back-to-back growth since 1997.” (For the math-challenged among us, 1997 is nearly 30 years ago!)\n\nIndeed, capex — what businesses spend on purchasing, maintaining, or upgrading their fixed assets, including buildings, machinery, and vehicles — is up 16.6% in the first half of 2025. This didn’t happen by accident. (RELATED: Majority Of Small Business Owners Are Optimistic About Trump Policies, Survey Says)\n\nWhy the sudden turnaround?\n\nIn short, the future isn’t what it once was. It’s better. Allow me to explain.\n\nIt would be a severe understatement to say Kamala Harris and Donald Trump offered voters different visions of the future, based on wholly divergent policies and priorities. Perhaps never before has the contrast in a presidential election been starker.\n\nHarris offered a continuation of the Biden administration’s endless addiction to regulation, taxes, and federal spending. Paraphrasing President Ronald Reagan, Harris’ “view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.”\n\nTrump, meanwhile, emphasized less regulation, lower taxes, and less federal spending. (Drain the swamp!) With Trump’s win, the outlook for economic growth and investment opportunity changed dramatically for the better. Businesses responded by investing heavily in a future that did not exist prior to his re-election.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n• According to the American Action Forum (AAF): “[T]he cumulative total of regulatory costs under the Biden Administration added up to more than $1.8 trillion — far exceeding any preceding administration on record.” Harris promised more of the same.\n\n• By contrast, President Trump’s Executive Order 14192, signed day one of his second administration, mandates eliminating 10 existing federal regulations for each new regulation. AAF estimates that the Trump administration has, to date, reduced the regulatory burden by $86 billion. And Trump has only begun.\n\n• Deregulation leads to more growth.\n\n• President Biden’s budgets routinely proposed massive tax increases. His final budget, for example, included a $4.9 trillion tax increase. That’s telling, considering that Harris, when asked if she would have done anything differently than President Biden, replied, “[N]ot a thing comes to mind.”\n\n• President Trump campaigned on blocking a $4 trillion tax hike that was scheduled to occur next year. Not only did Trump successfully block the tax increase, but he also signed tax provisions into law to spur investment in tools, machinery, structures, and cutting-edge research and development.\n\n• Pro-growth tax policy leads to more growth.\n\nFederal Spending • President Biden’s budgets routinely proposed massive spending increases. His final budget, for example, included a $1.7 trillion spending increase. Apparently, the $84.931 trillion that the federal government was then projected to spend over fiscal years 2025-34 was insufficient, proving that Biden never saw a dollar he didn’t want to spend. Harris promised more of the same.\n\n• The Trump administration has yet to submit its full budget for fiscal year 2026, but the “skinny budget” it issued calls upon Congress to slash non-defense discretionary spending by 22.6%. It’s doubtful Congress will adopt cuts of that magnitude, but the administration is making progress, having unleashed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to produce an estimated $190 billion in savings thus far. That’s $190 billion extracted from the public sector and returned to the private sector.\n\n• Extracting fewer resources from the private sector generally leads to more growth.\n\nBusiness investment is typically the most volatile element of gross domestic product, but the capex comeback is very real. And it’s happening because the Trump administration, with Congress’ help, is putting into place economic policies that will ignite American growth and prosperity.\n\nJames Carter is a Principal with Navigators Global.

We are not allowed to charge more or less.’\n\nHe added: ‘I’ve done a lot these high society weddings, it’s nothing new to me.’\n\nMeanwhile bewildered tourists were today seen wandering into the church yard, renowned as one of the most beautiful in the country.\n\nOutside the church, thousands of red roses were placed into 5ft-tall balls dotted around the yard.\n\nSt Michael’s is one of the most beautiful venues in the Cotswolds and was the choice when film director Sam Mendes and classical musician Alison Balsom had their 2017 ceremony there. \n\nEve, who once was named by society bible Tatler as one of its ‘new generation of It Girls’, and sportsman Harry got engaged last September and began dating in 2022, making their debut just a year ago at the Paris Olympic Games. \n\nOn Thursday, the couple – joined by their groomsmen and bridesmaids – completed a final dress rehearsal at the church for a 90-minute run through. \n\nParents of the bride and groom – Eve’s mother Laurene and Harry’s parents Peter and Tara – arrived in the picturesque village of Great Tew by private limousine.\n\nThe glamorous bridesmaids and the groomsmen, meanwhile, were bussed to the event in private hire coaches.\n\nUpon their arrival, the party were shielded from prying eyes as they entered the church grounds surrounded by orange umbrellas hoisted by private security guards.\n\nThe wedding party is due to take place at the stunning Estelle Manor country hotel set at Eynsham Hall this evening, where rooms start at £795.\n\nThe Manor is renowned internationally as venue for huge weddings as its copious grounds can accommodated hundreds of guests – while some guests are believed to be staying at the and the celebrity-famous Soho Farmhouse nearby.\n\nSoho Farmhouse is a glamorous private members club is beloved by A-list celebrities – even hosting Meghan Markle’s hen do in 2018 – as the place to go for private events for the social elite, all with the background of Britain’s finest countryside. \n\nAnd on the guestlist are a mixture of British sports stars, American politicians and even a sprinkling of royalty. \n\nFormer US Vice President Kamala Harris was pictured at a pre-wedding evening in The Bull pub in Charlbury, which also reportedly included Bruce Springsteen’s equestrian daughter, Jessica. \n\nBlacked-out SUVs and men in black suits identifying themselves as US secret services swarmed the country pub as it held the event.\n\nEve’s mother Laurene, left a widow following Jobs’ passing in 2011 aged 56 from pancreatic cancer, is said to have gone ‘all out’ for the wedding with help from renowned society events planner Stanlee Gatti.\n\nA-list parties flew to Oxford airport on their private jets, where they were met by helicopters to transport them to the venue.\n\nMaking the VIP guestlist are Kamala’s daughter Phoebe and Bill Gates’s daughter Jennifer, according to The Sun newspaper.\n\nKamala’s attendance is thanks to her long-time friendship with Eve’s mother.\n\nLaurene and Kamala have been friends for over 20 years, with the billionaire philanthropist backing Kamala’s run for US presidency last year, which she eventually lost to President Donald Trump. \n\nAnd it’s not just Kamala set to make an impression from the politics scene in the US – as a source told the paper that ‘a lot of important American political figures’ will be present. \n\nBelieved to have joined them are celebs including Arctic Monkeys star Matt Helders, Apple designer Jony Ive, Sofia Abramovich, daughter of ex-Chelsea owner Roman and Bill Gates’ daughter Jennifer. \n\nSources close to the family previously said invites have gone out to figures from fashion, sport, and business, with Princess Beatrice and her husband Edo among the confirmed guests. \n\n Brooklyn Peltz-Beckham and his wife Nicola Peltz, 30, are understood to have attended the wedding, just a stones throw away from the Beckham family home in the Cotswolds.\n\nNicola and Brooklyn, who is estranged from his former footballer father David, fashion designer mother Victoria and from brothers Romeo and Cruz, is said by guests to be staying at Soho Farmhouse which neighbours the Beckham’s estate.\n\nIt’s not known how the Peltz-Beckhams know that happy couple, and a spokesman for Brooklyn did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.\n\nKourtney Kardashian is also believed to have jetted in for after sharing a number of idyllic snap from the Cotswolds on Instagram ahead of the wedding.\n\nEve, a model and show jumper in her own right, has two older siblings and one half-sibling. Reed Jobs, 33, and Erin Jobs, 29, will likely be at the wedding. However it’s currently not known if her half sibling Lisa Brennan-Jobs, 47, will attend.\n\nAside from her siblings, Eve has a plethora of high-profile friends descended from other tech billionaires, who will likely see her walk down the aisle.\n\nShe is also friends with Lilli Hymowitz, daughter of billionaire Gregg Hymowitz, the CEO and founder of investment firm EnTrust Global.\n\nIn 2023, Eve was spotted mingling amongst high society’s wealthiest members at a gala in New York City, including Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng, who she struck a pose with for photos, and Lili Buffett, the granddaughter of billionaire investor and philanthropist Warren Buffet.\n\nOn top of Eve’s impressive connections, Harry has his own entourage.\n\nHis father is Peter Charles, whose team won Britain’s first team jumping gold medal for 60 years at the 2012 London Summer Olympics.\n\nWhile his Olympic teammates Scott Brash and Ben Maher would have been expected to make the guestlist, having claimed victory in team jumping together at the Paris Olympics. \n\nHarry has represented Great Britain internationally and is currently one of the sport’s top-ranked athletes.\n\nThe couple share a passion for horses and are frequently seen supporting each other at events.\n\nEve, a self-described ‘horse girl’, started riding when she was just six years old and had made some considerable achievements, including winning a bronze medal in the team event at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru.\n\nShe was front and centre to watch Harry win his gold medal last year and shared a loving post on Instagram with the caption: ‘TEAM GOLD!!!!!! Beyond proud of you my love!!!!’ \n\nEve made her modelling debut in a 2020 holiday campaign for makeup brand Glossier alongside Sydney Sweeney and Naomi Smalls. Eve is signed to DNA Model Management, who also represents Kaia Gerber and Emily Ratajkowski. \n\nAs the youngest daughter of late billionaire Apple mogul Steve Jobs, most would assume that Eve must’ve grown up without a want or need in the world. \n\nSteve Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, and according to his official biographer, Walter Isaacson, Jobs didn’t doubt that it would be his youngest daughter who would run Apple in the future.\n\nIn his biography about Steve, writer Walter Isaacson described the youngest Jobs as a ‘strong-willed, funny firecracker.’\n\nHe said that as a child, Eve would often call up her father’s assistant and make her clear out his calendar so that they could spend one-on-one father-daughter time together.\n\nThe family grew up in a ‘low-key Tudor-style house on a prosperous street’ in Palo Alto, California, according to U2 front man Bono.\n\nIt’s been said that the billionaire Apple founder did his best to give his children a normal upbringing, despite his immense wealth.\n\nThe outlet reported that he had ‘no live-in help, no security guards, no drivers.’\n\nHe also once revealed that he limited his kids’ technology use – even though he created one of the most successful tech companies on the planet. \n\nSteve passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011, when Eve was 12, and was worth an estimated $10.5 billion at the time of his death.\n\nBut Eve and her siblings won’t get any of his money, as he left his immense wealth to wife Laurene who revealed in 2020 that she has no plans to give any of it to their kids.\n\nShe told the New York Times that her husband made it clear before his death that he didn’t want to pass his earnings down to their kids because he wanted them to work for their own money.\n\n‘I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn’t care about the accumulation of wealth,’ she said.\n\n‘I’m not interested in legacy wealth building, and my children know that… Steve wasn’t interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.’\n\nWhile both Reed and Erin lead relatively private lives out of the spotlight, Eve has opted for the opposite, launching a major modeling career.\n\nLike both of her parents, she graduated from Stanford University in 2021, where she majored in science, technology, and society.\n\nShe then made her runway debut at Paris Fashion Week while walking in the Coperni show that September. \n\nEve has since posed for a slew of big brands and magazines like Glossier, Louis Vuitton, Vogue, and Vanity Fair. \n\nBesides her modeling career, Eve is also an experienced equestrian and was named Show Jumping Hall of Fame ‘Rider of the Month’ in March 2017.\n\nShe has competed in show jumping competitions all around the globe, including events in the Hamptons, Lexington, Kentucky, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and was ranked as the fifth best rider under 25 in the world by Horse Sports in 2019.\n\nPrior to her relationship with Harry, Eve was linked to Mexican show jumper and University of Miami business student Eugenio Garza Pérez, according to the Latin Times.\n\nThere were also rumors that she dated singer Harry Hudson, Chainsmokers member Drew Taggart, and Outer Banks star Chase Stokes.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nApple heiress Eve Jobs has exchanged vows with Team GB showjumper Harry&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Apple Heiress Eve Jobs Marries Team GB Olympian in Charming Cotswolds Ceremony first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/apple-heiress-eve-jobs-marries-team-gb-olympian-in-charming-cotswolds-ceremony/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Apple-heiress-Eve-Jobs-weds-Team-GB-Olympic-star-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 22:32:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.192},{"id":345560980,"title":"Democratic Party Hits Lowest Approval in Over 30 Years: Poll","text":"A Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday shows the Democratic Party's image has deteriorated to its lowest point in over three decades according to the newspaper's records that date back to 1990.Only 8 percent of registered voters said they view the Democratic Party \"very favorably,\" while 63 percent said it's out of touch with the everyday concerns of Americans. In contrast, Republicans are now trusted more on key issues like the economy, immigration and crime.The poll, which surveyed 1,500 registered voters between July 16-20, found Republicans have taken the lead on eight of 10 issues tested. Despite President Donald Trump's continued unpopularity in the polls, the GOP leads in overall party identification. The Journal's poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.Why It MattersIn last year's presidential election, Trump beat then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, by 2 points in the popular vote, 50 to 48 percent. Trump also won the electoral vote, which decides the winner, 312-226.The Democratic Party faced a string of defeats in the 2024 election cycle when it came to the U.S. House and Senate, with the party's struggles for a clear message and effective leadership intensifying as the 2026 midterm elections approach.The new poll signals a significant warning for Democrats. Although Trump remains a polarizing figure, the data suggests that voters are increasingly viewing the party as ineffective on core issues like inflation, border security, and crime.What To KnowAccording to the Journal's poll, Democrats now face a net favorability of -30 points, with only one-third of voters expressing any positive sentiment toward the party. This marks the worst performance for Democrats in the newspaper's polling history to date.While Trump's handling of inflation and tariffs drew significant disapproval—11 and 17 points respectively—voters still trust Republicans more than Democrats to manage those issues in Congress. The GOP holds a 10-point advantage on inflation and a 7-point edge on tariffs.The only policy areas where Democrats outperform Republicans in the poll are health care and vaccine policy, suggesting the party retains some credibility on public health issues.The president's net unfavorability stands at -7 points, with the GOP slightly worse at -11. However, Trump's favorability has remained relatively steady through the first six months of his second term, even as other polls show sharper declines.Despite the negative sentiment, 46 percent of voters say they would back a Democrat for Congress if an election were held today, compared to 43 percent who would support a Republican. That margin is narrower than the 8-point advantage Democrats had at the same point in Trump's first term in 2017.What People Are SayingBill McInturff, a Republican pollster not connected to the Journal's survey, said: \"We were already watching the tide moving out for the Republican Party by this point in 2017, and that's not where we are today. And that's worth jumping up and down and trying to explain: how much more competitive Trump and the Republicans are today than in 2017.\"John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster who worked on the Journal survey, said: \"The Democratic brand is so bad that they don't have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party. Until they reconnect with real voters and working people on who they're for and what their economic message is, they're going to have problems.\"What Happens Next?Democrats face mounting pressure to redefine their economic message and rebuild trust with working-class voters. Meanwhile, Republicans are likely to double down on their perceived strengths in fiscal and foreign policy ahead of next year's midterms.","summary":"The only policy areas where Democrats outperform Republicans in the new poll from the Wall Street Journal are health care and vaccine policy.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-party-approval-rating-hits-30-year-low-wsj-poll-2104572","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2690902/chuck-schumer.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=5c33b35b0790e7ee1ff3997195e2def6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 21:53:08","author":"Amanda Castro","authors":["Amanda Castro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":345559150,"title":"Rep.

Ro Khanna sounded off on the Democratic Party establishment in his address to the Voters of Tomorrow Summit for young progressives in Washington, D.C.\n\n“How can we trust government to do big things when government has been corrupted? My friends, for those who want a progressive future, for those who want a government that works to build security and opportunity for the working class, we must get rid of the big money in politics,” Khanna said in his address on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe California Democrat then mentioned the Jeffrey Epstein files, which have become a major point of debate in Washington as some demand more information about the case.\n\n“We must restore a government for the people, by the people, of the people. The release of the Epstein files is not a magic cure for trust, but it is a first step. \n\n“It’s a first step to say we will have a new era of transparency,” he continued.\n\nKhanna then bluntly called out his party’s establishment in his closing call to action.\n\n“I’ll end with this clear point: The old guard needs to go. The old ways have not been working. This party needs a new rebirth. This party needs a rebirth to stand for human rights,” he said. “This party needs a rebirth to stand for the working class. This party needs a rebirth to stand for people over the donor class.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to give virtual remarks at the summit on Friday, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi was also a major speaker at the event.\n\n“We have no doubt that we will win the election with the House of Representatives,” Pelosi said during her speech. “No doubt.”\n\n“It’s important to be strong in the year in advance, because that’s when the troops line up. We have our messaging, we have our mobilization, we need the money to do it, but they go only next to a school to hold up the most important part: the candidate,” she continued.\n\nYounger Democrats, like freshman Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari and Illinois congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, took part in panels at the summit.\n\nKhanna’s address comes as the Democratic Party is striving to navigate the second Trump administration and adapt to the major shifts that occurred across voter demographics in the 2024 election, including among Generation Z. \n\nThe 2026 election is being seen as an opportunity to get more information about Gen Z voters, as many voted for the first time in 2022 and 2024.\n\nSome in the party have encouraged a more moderate direction, while others have echoed Khanna’s populist sentiment.\n\n“This party needs a rebirth to find our courage in standing up for immigrant rights instead of running away when people talk about immigration. This party needs more people like you in Congress than the current people we have in Congress,” Khanna added.\n\n“I’m here to say that a new Democratic Party, a reborn Democratic Party, a populist Democratic Party, a multiracial Democratic Party, a Democratic Party that centers the working and middle class, a Democratic Party that looks like the future is a Democratic Party that can lead us back to victory and lead us to a better America. \n\n“It’s time to take back our party and then to take back our country,” he continued.","summary":"Pelosi believes Democrats will win House while progressive wing pushes for party overhaul.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/26/us-news/dem-rep-ro-khanna-demands-old-guard-must-go-calls-for-rebirth-of-party/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-7ewlty0s8-1753563267293.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1753548905&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-26 20:59:17","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":345546484,"title":"Apple heiress Eve Jobs weds Team GB Olympic star in front of high society friends and family in idyllic Cotswolds village - but disappoints locals as blushing bride sneaks into her own nuptials through rear entrance","text":"Apple heiress Eve Jobs has tied the knot with Team GB showjumper Harry Charles in a star-studded ceremony in front of high society friend in the picturesque Cotswolds countryside.\n\nThe late Apple CEO's wife Laurence Powell Jobs, 61, is said to have splashed out £5million to make the four-day wedding of model daughter Eve, 27, and her gold medalist fiancé Harry, 26, the society wedding of the year.\n\nTheir nuptial celebrations started on Wednesday - almost exactly one month after Eve jetted to the Italian isle of Capri for a glitzy hen do - and culminated in today's extravagant ceremony. \n\nThe model and her new husband practically took over the Cotswolds, where the Beckhams, Simon Cowell and Ellen De Generes all have country homes, for the lavish wedding at St Micheal’s and All Angels Church in Great Tew.\n\nGuests celebrating their wedding wearing elegant dresses and dinner jackets, as a stream of Mercedes limousines and top class Range Rovers, and luxury minibuses dropped off the family and friends of the Apple founder heiress.\n\nBruce Springsteen daughter, Jessica, was among nine bridesmaids who were dressed in startling red satin cocktail gowns, holding posies made of ferns, with groomsmen arriving just before them wearing flowers in their button holes.\n\nThe blushing bride arrived to the church via a private road, around half an hour late, at 6pm, and around 45 minutes later, she and Harry Charles said 'I do' as wedding balls rang to signify the beginning of their marriage. \n\nHowever locals were left disappointed as they didn't see the bride enter or the newlyweds leave the church hand-in-hand, as they were quickly whizzed away in the back of a Mercedes limousine van to their evening celebrations.\n\nOne resident told HELLO!

Eve is signed to DNA Model Management, who also represents Kaia Gerber and Emily Ratajkowski. \n\nAs the youngest daughter of late billionaire Apple mogul Steve Jobs, most would assume that Eve must've grown up without a want or need in the world. \n\nSteve Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, and according to his official biographer, Walter Isaacson, Jobs didn't doubt that it would be his youngest daughter who would run Apple in the future.\n\nIn his biography about Steve, writer Walter Isaacson described the youngest Jobs as a 'strong-willed, funny firecracker.'\n\nHe said that as a child, Eve would often call up her father's assistant and make her clear out his calendar so that they could spend one-on-one father-daughter time together.\n\nThe family grew up in a 'low-key Tudor-style house on a prosperous street' in Palo Alto, California, according to U2 front man Bono.\n\nIt's been said that the billionaire Apple founder did his best to give his children a normal upbringing, despite his immense wealth.\n\nThe outlet reported that he had 'no live-in help, no security guards, no drivers.'\n\nHe also once revealed that he limited his kids' technology use - even though he created one of the most successful tech companies on the planet. \n\nSteve passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2011, when Eve was 12, and was worth an estimated $10.5 billion at the time of his death.\n\nBut Eve and her siblings won't get any of his money, as he left his immense wealth to wife Laurene who revealed in 2020 that she has no plans to give any of it to their kids.\n\nShe told the New York Times that her husband made it clear before his death that he didn't want to pass his earnings down to their kids because he wanted them to work for their own money.\n\n'I inherited my wealth from my husband, who didn't care about the accumulation of wealth,' she said.\n\n'I'm not interested in legacy wealth building, and my children know that... Steve wasn't interested in that. If I live long enough, it ends with me.'\n\nWhile both Reed and Erin lead relatively private lives out of the spotlight, Eve has opted for the opposite, launching a major modeling career.\n\nLike both of her parents, she graduated from Stanford University in 2021, where she majored in science, technology, and society.\n\nShe then made her runway debut at Paris Fashion Week while walking in the Coperni show that September. \n\nEve has since posed for a slew of big brands and magazines like Glossier, Louis Vuitton, Vogue, and Vanity Fair. \n\nBesides her modeling career, Eve is also an experienced equestrian and was named Show Jumping Hall of Fame 'Rider of the Month' in March 2017.\n\nShe has competed in show jumping competitions all around the globe, including events in the Hamptons, Lexington, Kentucky, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and was ranked as the fifth best rider under 25 in the world by Horse Sports in 2019.\n\nPrior to her relationship with Harry, Eve was linked to Mexican show jumper and University of Miami business student Eugenio Garza Pérez, according to the Latin Times.\n\nThere were also rumors that she dated singer Harry Hudson, Chainsmokers member Drew Taggart, and Outer Banks star Chase Stokes.","summary":"Apple heiress Eve Jobs has tied the knot with Team GB showjumper Harry Charles in a star-studded ceremony in front of high society friend in the picturesque Cotswolds countryside.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14942647/Apple-heiress-Eve-Jobs-Team-GB-Olympic-Cotswods-wedding.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/26/17/100595069-0-The_happy_couple_pictured_tied_the_knot_today_after_getting_enga-a-5_1753547355593.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/05/671253307486129849/1024x576_MP4_671253307486129849.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-26 20:57:12","author":"Editor,Nick Fagge,Robert Folker,Shannon McGuigan","authors":["Editor","Nick Fagge","Robert Folker","Shannon McGuigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.181}]}
