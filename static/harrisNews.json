He didn’t think that she was the best choice for Democrats, and he worked really behind the scenes for a long time to try to have a mini-primary, or an open convention, or a mini-primary leading to an open convention, did not have faith in her ability to win the election.”\n\nAllen, a senior politics reporter at NBC News, and Amie Parnes, a senior political correspondent for The Hill, joined MSNBC to discuss their new book set to be released this month, titled, “FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House.”\n\n“As it turned out, she didn’t win, but he was really working against her,” Allen continued.\n\nAllen also said Obama was not willing to endorse Harris when he talked to the vice president on the day Biden dropped out.\n\nObama and former first lady Michelle Obama did eventually endorse Harris, but their support came five days after the president announced he was dropping out and endorsed Harris himself.\n\n“In one moment, he had set up a phone call with Congressman [James] Clyburn from South Carolina on the day that Joe Biden handed off the baton to Kamala Harris, and Obama had set up a call with Clyburn for like 5:30 that afternoon. And Clyburn thought to himself, this guy is going to try to rope me into the open convention thing, I better get my endorsement of Harris out there fast, so this is a short conversation,” Allen said. \n\nObama and Harris’ offices did not immediately return requests for comment. \n\nThe book, according to an excerpt published by The Hill, also details how Biden repeatedly urged Harris not to break with him publicly on his administration’s policies. \n\n“But the day of the debate Biden called to give Harris an unusual kind of pep talk — and another reminder about the loyalty he demanded. No longer able to defend his own record, he expected Harris to protect his legacy,” authors Allen and Parnes wrote. \n\n“Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him — especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans. To the extent that she wanted to forge her own path, Biden had no interest in giving her room to do so.”\n\nBiden told Harris, “No daylight, kid,” during their phone call ahead of the debate, according to the book excerpt. \n\nHarris was criticized throughout her campaign for not breaking with the president on more issues after she took his spot at the top of the Democratic ticket. \n\nAt one point, she told “The View” that she couldn’t think of anything she would have done differently than Biden during his first term.","summary":"Reporter and author Jonathan Allen said Tuesday that former President Barack Obama was working against former Vice President Kamala Harris after former President Joe Biden dropped out.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/01/us-news/barack-obama-was-working-against-kamala-harris-behind-the-2024-scenes-didnt-think-she-could-win-new-book/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-q1q3yxdyy-1743552780779.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1743538648&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 00:33:33","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":306652906,"title":"Activists call for Doug Emhoff to resign after the law firm where he is a partner pledges pro bono work for Trump","text":"Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the law firm where Doug Emhoff, former Vice President Kamala Harris' husband, is a partner, is pledging at least $100 million in pro bono legal work for causes aligned with \"conservative ideals,\" President Donald Trump said on Tuesday via social media.Willkie would be the third top law firm to formalize such a deal with Trump, following similar pledges from Paul Weiss and Skadden.\"Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP proactively reached out to President Trump and his Administration, offering their decisive commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession,\" said the White House, according to Trump's post on Truth Social.Doug Emhoff and Willkie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump's social media post also said that Thomas M.

The agreement makes Willkie Farr & Gallagher the third law firm in the last two weeks to cut a deal with the White House to avert sanctions from the US government.

It was reached just two days after leaders at Willkie learned that the White House intended to issue a executive order against the firm, an action that could have carried “potentially grave consequences,” according to an internal email from the firm's executive committee obtained by The Associated Press. The resolution reflects the differing responses being taken by the legal community as Trump continues to target some of the world's most elite law firms and extract concessions from them, such as the renunciation of diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in hiring and promotion decisions.

Many of the firms that have been the subject of his executive orders are associated with lawyers who previously investigated Trump, either when he was president or between his terms in the White House. Willkie is home to Doug Emhoff, the husband of 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and Timothy Heaphy, who was chief investigative counsel to the House of Representatives committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. The firm also represented two former Georgia election workers in a successful defamation lawsuit against former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Three of the targeted firms have now made deals with the White House — resolutions that critics within the legal community call a capitulation — but others have challenged them in court and have been successful in getting key portions of the edicts blocked. The internal email from Willkie acknowledged that ambivalence. “While the agreement ultimately reached with the Administration focuses on activities that are already in place at our Firm, similar agreements at peer firms have been publicly criticised, and there is heightened conversation across our industry as law firms grapple with the consequences of potential Executive Orders and the impact for their clients, their employees and their businesses,” the email said. “In making this difficult decision, we concluded, after due consideration of the implications of each possible course of action, that accepting the Administration's final proposal was the path that best serves our clients' needs and protects the Firm's various stakeholders, avoiding potentially grave consequences,” it added. Leaders of Willkie learned Sunday that they would be targeted for an executive order like the one leveled at nearly a half-dozen other major firms over the last month, the email said. The White House then “outlined a proposed alternative” consisting of three principles on which an agreement could be based. Emhoff made it known internally that he disagreed with this deal and told firm leadership they should fight, according to a person familiar with the situation who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The firm email downplayed the scope of reforms and suggested that firm had simply agreed to continue its longstanding practices. That includes following “the law related to our employment practices,\" representing clients across varied political and ideological spectrums and continuing to “represent underrepresented individuals and groups.” The White House, by contrast, portrayed the changes in more sweeping terms, saying Willkie had affirmed “its commitment to Merit-Based Hiring, Promotion and Retention. Accordingly, the Firm will not engage in illegal DEI discrimination and preferences.” The Trump executive orders have threatened the security clearances of attorneys at each of the targeted firms as well as the termination of the firms' federal contracts and access by employees to federal buildings. Last Friday, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom agreed to provide USD 100 million in pro bono legal services to avert an executive order, following the path of Paul Weiss, a firm that cut a deal just a week after it was targeted. The Paul Weiss chairman has said the Trump action risked destroying the firm. In some instances, federal judges have blocked from enforcement key portions of the orders having to do with federal contracts and access to federal buildings, as has happened in lawsuits brought by WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie. WilmerHale is the firm where special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Trump during his first term, worked for years before retiring. Jenner & Block previously employed Andrew Weissmann, who was a top lawyer on Mueller's team, and Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. The first firm to be targeted was Covington & Burling, which has offered legal services to special counsel Jack Smith, who investigated Trump in his second term.

It’s easy to explain our obsession with the show as an escapist pleasure, but in the Trump era, perhaps those LBHs (“losers back home,” in the show’s parlance) are familiar: A critical mass of wealthy and entitled people who want to communicate to you exactly how well-off they are, opting for a locale where everyone who isn’t a traveling companion is there expressly to serve. The loud luxury of The White Lotus and the real world bears enough volume to drown out questions about who’s donning the outfits, such as: What do they say about the wearer?\nIn the era of Trump 2, do you know exactly who’s MAGA in your life? Are you sure? Fashion may hold the clues.\nAlex Bovaird, the show’s costume designer, tells Vanity Fair that the homogeneity of the three friends’ looks, despite their hailing from different regions (New York, Texas, and California), purposefully gestures toward the assumptions we tend to make: that people who look like us are, in fact, like us.\n“I wanted to keep them throughout as kind of still interchangeable, so that when they reveal themselves, it’s sort of subtle, and it starts to make you think, Oh yeah, they’re not all the same,” she says. “It’s not like Kate comes off the boat wearing a MAGA hat or anything.”\nBovaird drapes the show’s characters in brands meant to invoke expensive taste and the social background that can afford them, whether by way of generational wealth, marriage, long hours of white-collar work, or simply long hours of white-collar crime. They’re carelessly rich: Jaclyn wears an open Chanel gown to the pool over a swimsuit, treating a $7,000-plus archival runway look as casually as a hotel robe. (Her Eres one-piece swimsuit retails at a friendlier $600.) Kate later dons a similarly simple hot-pink tank suit; it’s by Valentino. Men are sockless in Gucci loafers; women are lounging in Loewe and pulling lip balm and lorazepam out of their capacious JW Anderson bags. Bovaird says she would have stacked “like 20” of the Cartier bracelets on Kate, had budget allowed (“like 20” would run around $147,000).\nAnd then, of course, there are the caftans. Bovaird was inspired by Southern vintage queen Susan Dumas, especially while building the wardrobe of Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey), who has only visited the beach once—in a dream. She spends her time in and around her villa, swathed in billowing dresses and caftans. They’re comfy, but not practical for non-horizontal activities.\nBovaird thinks back on the very, very hot months she spent in Thailand filming, musing that a caftan presents the option of wrapping ourselves in a garment that’s as comfortable as it is obfuscating. “The world is cooking, and maybe we’re all gonna have to wear caftans,” she jokes. “Maybe, if there’s an apocalyptic movie, everyone’s gonna be really elegant.”\nThe loud luxury of the White Lotus—here we mean the fictitious resort franchise, rather than the show itself—stands in contrast to both the “quiet luxury” obsession of the past few years, all single strands of pearls, cashmere sweaters, and varying tones of camel, as well as the demure Republican breeder garb of the tradwife, in florals and girlish smocked dresses. Since Trump’s reelection, we’ve come to expect cardboard-stiff barrel curls and a fresco of full-coverage foundation at an ICE raid, neon pink blazers in the front row of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation hearing, and a bra worn as a shirt on the dais at the presidential inauguration. The official MAGA crew feels empowered and entitled, and they invite you to take a good, long look. It’s those in the in-between, clad in Valentino maxis—that cost more than a month’s rent on a one-bedroom downtown—for another strenuous afternoon of sitting on a chaise longue, who are asking, “Do we really need to talk about politics right now?” Cartier bangles a-clinking. It’s that no-consequences vacation mindset, an OOO autoresponder for confronting uncomfortable moral and ethical questions about Trump, just as long as the economy and those executive orders aren’t impacting them.\nPosey’s Victoria sums up this entitled, frippery-filled mindset perfectly when she murmurs that, “I just don’t think, at this age, that I’m meant to live an uncomfortable life.”\nThe whodunit of Mike White’s immensely popular HBO show is part of the allure, sure, but so is the fascination of seeing the fabulously wealthy on vacation. Bovaird calls the show and her “postcard styling” “really good escapist TV,” but maybe it’s more real than that—the daily news is also full of the fabulously wealthy (or so they keep telling us) behaving poorly at Americans’ expense. The high-end fashion statements of Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump’s Mar-a-Lago is situated, are migrating into the wider world along with the MAGA carefree-as-long-as-it-works-for-me attitude.\nFashion remains a form of art and self-expression, not to mention just plain fun. However, for some, that self-expression has taken a turn since the election, with a new emphasis on access, wealth, and privilege. If it were even somewhat socially acceptable to leave a price tag visible, you know many of these MAGAfluencers would be right there with their hangtags proudly on display. They’re wielding loud luxury like a bullhorn inches from the ear: Look. At. Me. Even Duke, the university that multiple members of the show’s Ratliff family have attended, objected to Jason Isaacs’s character, the money-laundering Timothy, wearing a shirt emblazoned with the school’s logo as he contemplates suicide, holding a gun to his temple. (Bovaird declined to comment to VF on the Duke upset.)\nAlix Friedberg, the costume designer for Palm Royale, the Palm Beach–set period show currently wrapping production on season two, tells VF that she’s noticed a recent sartorial shift toward dressing like a social climber dying to be seen in the latest and greatest.\n“It’s letting everybody know that you just bought that, and it cost this amount of money, and it’s very identifiable,” she says. “I feel like that definitely correlates to the Mar-a-Lago of it all in the sort of epicenter of our current political leadership. It’s loud, proud Americana—kind of, ‘We’re the leaders of the of the free world, and let’s say that from the top of a mountain with the color and the brand.’”\nThe resortwear influence on current trends, she says, is cosplay in a sense. As she puts it, you’re “living in this sort of luxury lifestyle where it’s poolside and bright colors, big sunglasses and gold chains, kind of that world, saying a lot about you before you open your mouth.” To avoid a target on your back, blend in and play the part of a carefree beachgoer.\nOn the popular Instagram account “Class of Palm Beach,” Devorah Ezagui begins most clips crooning “I love your outfit!” from behind the lens of an iPhone. Then, Ezagui’s subjects rattle off their fashion credits: Oscar de La Renta sundress this, Chanel sandals that, wrists laden with Rolexes, Van Cleef & Arpels, and jewels galore. There’s no such thing as being overdressed in Palm Beach, Ezagui, 29, tells VF, “not even a bit. And it’s welcome in every way.”\n“Palm Beach is incredibly on the map right now, probably because of Trump, and because of what’s going on here: It’s being built up like never before,” she says. Ezagui is not a member of Mar-a-Lago, but “almost every single one of my friends is,” she says, and she’s gone there for events on numerous occasions. Postelection, she had an influx of followers, and she now regularly receives messages, “a lot, I would say, [asking] if I can help them in ways that they can get into Mar-a-Lago.”\nEzagui says she would “love” to get Melania Trump on “Class of Palm Beach.” “I think that she doesn’t get enough credit for her style, nothing to do with politics,” says Ezagui. “She has it. She’s a class act; she’s stylish. I know I would get a lot of remarks on that, but for me, it’s nothing political. It’s about her style.” She notes she would also feature Kamala Harris.\nPolitics come up while filming outfits “a whole lot of times,” but Ezagui edits around the commentary, committed to staying apolitical while depicting the millionaires and possibly billionaires she’s interviewing to the audiences who want to emulate them. “I’m really neutral, and I really just see people for who they are. I’m really that kind of a person.”\nEric Javits, the Miami-based designer of the first lady’s Inauguration Day hat, however, sees the current political landscape as a major part of the luxurious, beachy trend spreading, including the demure suiting of Capitol Hill getting a bit brighter and the logos more prominent. The Palm Beach region’s high-end fashion fixation, he tells VF, is aspirational.\n“The people here have access to the best of everything,” he says. “Against that backdrop, the wealthiest group with access to everything, you know, why not up the fashion game?” In other words, who wouldn’t want to be one of them?\nHe attributes the rise of resortwear to postelection optimism, “bringing back a lot of this sort of positivity and opulence and all that in fashion.”\n“Things are progressing the way that [Trump] promised they would,” Javits says. “He was trying to make the country safer and trying to negotiate the ending of wars and so forth. I mean, all that’s in the news daily, right? So I see that he’s sort of working to fulfill his campaign promises and all that’s positive.”\nDo people actually have more money and more optimism, a belief that America is, in fact, great (again?); or is that just the image that they’d like to project, while their legs furiously kick under the chlorinated surface, trying to stay afloat in society? The MAGA girlies are excited to don their American flag–print bikinis and bedazzled red ball caps (another right-on-the-nose Victoria Ratliff summation: “Just because they’re rich doesn’t mean they’re not trashy”), while the quiet-luxury aesthetic of the recent Democratic-majority years didn’t have an equivalent to that billboard vibe. Is there really something to be loud and proud about these days?\nCostume designer Bovaird presents a flipside to that optimism: “I definitely think that resort, where people are gravitating towards it, maybe it’s because of the same thing with the allure of The White Lotus: People want to escape. There’s a lot of drudgery and fear in people’s worldview at the moment, so maybe it helps to project a party, you know?”","summary":"Alex Bovaird, the show's costume designer, and Devorah Ezagui, the

new victim — and America isn’t safe","text":"Elections are supposed to be decided at the ballot box, not in the courtroom — unless you’re French, or, in this country, a liberal.\n\nWhat a judge in France has just done by disqualifying Marine Le Pen from running in that nation’s next presidential election is what Democrats dream of doing here.\n\nThe controversial populist was ahead in the polls, but now Le Pen isn’t even eligible to run, thanks to a court that found her guilty of using European Union funds to pay for political expenses.\n\nShe insists the spending was legitimate, but as things stand French voters won’t get to decide for themselves who’s right.\n\nAmericans might feel safe from this kind of lawfare — when New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg went after President Donald Trump on campaign-finance technicalities, he won his case but lost his gambit.\n\nThe nakedly political prosecution only added to the momentum propelling Trump back to office, and in our country voters, not judges, get the final word: Bragg’s convictions couldn’t stop the Republican from running, and winning.\n\nYet, in many ways, the lawfare Democrats waged during and after Trump’s first term succeeded.\n\nThe price of serving in a Republican administration has gone up, with incoming staffers urged to buy legal insurance to cover the costs of defending against lawfare.\n\n“It’s edging into absolute requirement territory,” an official who served in Trump’s first administration told NBC News in January.\n\n“It would be reckless” to do without the insurance, he continued, “if you have any assets to protect — the house, college funds, whatever.”\n\nThe legal bills from complying with — never mind fighting — federal investigations or congressional inquiries can be ruinous, as first-term Trump personnel discovered.\n\nLawfare isn’t just a legal weapon, it’s economic warfare, and the threat of it is a deterrent to anyone considering working for Trump.\n\nBut it won’t stop with Trump: Whatever succeeds against his administration will be used against every future Republican White House, too.\n\nYou don’t even have to serve in government to be a target.\n\nSome of the most powerful institutions of the legal establishment not only supported the lawfare against Trump but also, after the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, punished lawyers who dared represent anyone questioning the 2020 election.\n\nIn one of the defining early moments of the American Revolution, John Adams went to court to defend the British soldiers who perpetrated the Boston Massacre.\n\nEven they deserved respectable legal representation — but Trump and his associates, in the eyes of Big Law, did not.\n\nOnce back in office, Trump’s response was to threaten these powerful firms with losing access to government privileges, from security clearances to permission to enter federal buildings — the settings for their lobbying activity.\n\n(It’s surprising that progressives, who often view lobbying as inherently corrupt, didn’t cheer Trump on for this.)\n\nFirms like Paul Weiss and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom were quick to come to agreements with the president on how they could change their ways.\n\nYet what happens once Trump is gone?\n\nHad he lost last year’s election, Trump would likely have been sent to prison by his enemies, and other Republicans would have been next on the legal hit list.\n\nIf Democrats win back the House next year, they’ll use Congress’ investigative powers to turn this administration inside-out, forcing testimony on every contentious policy and practice that Trump officials have implemented since Day 1.\n\nAnd if the Republicans don’t hold the White House in 2028, the kinds of political prosecutions that would have happened this year if Kamala Harris had won will take place four years from now.\n\nVoters said no to lawfare as loudly as possible last November, awarding Trump every presidential battleground state, a popular-vote plurality and GOP control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nBut to break bad habits of lawfare will take more than one election cycle.\n\nDemocrats themselves have begun complaining that Biden officials can’t get the legal representation they want because law firms are now frightened of Trump.\n\nThe left’s lawfare is turning America into the legal equivalent of a “Mad Max” wasteland, where the instigators of this brutal abuse of law are themselves prey to the forces they’ve unleashed.\n\nTrump is right to pressure the law firms, and they should be quick to admit their mistakes rather than repeating them — either against Republicans in the future, or Democrats now.\n\nAs Washington Post columnist Jason Willick has argued, Congress should also step up, codifying into law the Justice Department’s guidelines against political prosecutions.\n\nFederal legislation can stop state officials like Alvin Bragg from bringing cases using federal campaign-finances laws, which because of their intricacy are easily weaponized.\n\nYet the only sure and lasting remedy for lawfare is to beat it at the ballot box.\n\nAnd thankfully we Americans, unlike the French, still get to have our say there.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review.","summary":"A judge kicked Marine Le Pen out of France's next presidential

Randy Fine and Democratic school teacher Josh Weil within the margin of error.\n\nIn a Monday interview, Florida GOP Chairman Evan Power told the Washington Examiner that a massive fundraising disparity in favor of the Democratic Party, the style of Republican voters, and tactical errors by Fine were all to blame for the alarmingly close race.\n\n“In Florida, special elections have always been tricky for us. It’s just the way it is. But the fact that [the Democrats are] pumping tens of millions of dollars into the state is interesting. I think that obviously they have a mechanism in Act Blue that works well for that, and they nationalize these races and made us work to turn out our voters that are a little fatigued from just voting in November,” he said.\n\n“We were late … The candidate was late on TV, which gave them an advantage. And obviously, I don’t think this is any credit to anything that the Florida Democratic Party is doing. It’s the fact that they pumped in over $10 to $12 million into … [the Sixth Congressional District], and our candidate had a million dollars total cash on hand, and I think at some point that plays into the early numbers … we had to activate our ground game to turn out our voters,” Power added.\n\nPower said he was pitching funding for the race as early as December, but it was hard to convince Republican donors due to Waltz’s 33-point victory in November. Democrats eyed a weakness and, “desperate for a good story,” funneled massive sums of money into the race.\n\nOne disadvantage unique to Fine is that none of the districts he represented as state senator are in FL-6, making voters unfamiliar with him. Another point speaks to a larger disadvantage Republicans are facing in special elections.\n\n“Because there aren’t the domino effects that normally occur here. We don’t have a state Senate race, and we don’t have a State House race going on simultaneously with the congressional race,” Power said.\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nA unique challenge for the GOP in FL-6 — one analysts have said plagued Republicans in other winnable races in 2022 — is candidate quality. In addition to low name recognition, Fine is nationally known for a series of controversies, often related to Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\nIn April 2019, Fine called a Jewish constituent of his a “Judenrat” for supporting an event discussing the Israel-Hamas conflict, a term referring to Jewish councils that collaborated with the Nazis.\n\nHis most inflammatory statement came on Feb. 21, after the bodies of the kidnapped Bibas family were returned to Israel. In a post on X, he denied the existence of “innocent Palestinian civilians,” accusing Gazans of taking part in the kidnapping and murder.\n\n“There are demons that live on Earth,” he said of Palestinians in Gaza. “They deserve no state. They only deserve death.”\n\nThe post was partially hidden on X for violating its policies against hate and violent speech.\n\nHowever, most of the problems Power mentioned are common for Republicans in special elections, particularly lower voter enthusiasm during off-cycle contests.\n\nRandy Ross, a Florida-based conservative activist who campaigned there for Trump in 2016 and 2024, told the BBC that historically, special elections favor the party with higher enthusiasm. A Democratic victory would serve as a canary in the coal mine for national political trends.\n\n“You can’t go just on name recognition in a special election,” he said. “You’ve got to drive people out to vote for you.”\n\nTrump has been a significant enthusiasm booster for Republicans, with turnout dropping when he’s not on the ballot. In races like FL-6, Democrats have framed the contest as a national referendum on Trump’s agenda. Republicans, meanwhile, have struggled to rally their voters, with many complacent after the jubilation of November’s victory.\n\nDemocratic voters are also known to be higher propensity voters, largely thanks to an activist and younger base.\n\nDemocrats have fared well in special elections since Trump’s inauguration. Of 14 special elections since January, 11 have been won by the Democrats, showcasing an average margin of 10% greater than former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 showing, according to data collected by the Downballot. This includes flipping two reliably red State Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania.\n\nFLORIDA SPECIAL ELECTIONS GIVE TRUMP WAKE-UP CALL IN HIS BACKYARD\n\nDespite Democratic confidence, victory on Tuesday is still a long shot. While Wisconsin looks to be a likely Democratic victory, Power is confident that Republicans will hold FL-1 and FL-6.\n\n“We’re pretty confident. We had a great day on Saturday, getting us up to about 9% Republican turnout advantage. Obviously, we assume that we’re going to have a great Election Day turnout like we always do, and I think that puts us in a great place to send Randy fine to D.C. to fight for President [Donald] Trump,” he said, adding that a victory in FL-1 was hardly even up for question.","summary":"The Florida Democratic Party is in its worst spot in modern history after years of defeats.

However, before you tune out the election noise this year, consider the impact of one horrific constitutional amendment in Virginia that will be decided in the next General Assembly session.\n\nConservatives want to block House Joint Resolution 1, or as they call it, “the abortion amendment.” HJ 1 would enshrine in the Virginia Constitution the “right” to abort a baby right up until it is about to be born. One delegate was heard saying that “it used to be the second trimester, now it’s the second contraction.”\n\nGiven the unanimity that supporters of the amendment in the Democratic Party have, the GOP needs to take the majority in the House in this fall’s Virginia General Assembly elections to have any hope of blocking it, so they are looking past the gubernatorial race to races for House seats they feel are “flippable.” \n\nThose districts are:\n\n97th District: Part of Virginia Beach, where the Democrat that represents the seat won in 2023 by 1,179 votes in a district of 63,000 registered voters.\n\n84th District: Suffolk City and surrounding areas, where the Democrat incumbent won the seat in 2023 by 1,853 votes in a district of 66,666 registered voters.\n\n65th District, Stafford County and Fredericksburg, where the Democrat won in 2023 by a margin of 1750 votes out of 62274 registered voters.\n\nAnd the 21st District, Prince William County, where the Democrat won in 2023 by a margin of 975 votes out of 58142 registered voters.\n\nThe game plan is simple: turnout. Only one of these races saw a turnout higher than 46.6% (the 97th District saw 54.4%), so the idea is to motivate a percentage or two of the GOP voters who didn’t turn out in 2023 and flip the seat in each district. Only two would be necessary to take the House majority and block the amendment.\n\nWarning to anyone counting chickens before you’ve finished paying off the eggs. While those plans are being worked on, the Democratic Party is targeting eight House districts held by Republicans that Kamala Harris carried in 2024. The GOP will have to spend resources to hold those seats this fall, as well.\n\nOf course, the fallback position is that if the bill is not stopped in the 2026 legislative session in January, it then will be on the ballot later that year during the 2026 midterm congressional elections for Virginia voters to have the final say on.\n\nWhile polling says that 65% of Virginians oppose abortion that late into a pregnancy, conservatives and the GOP leadership are worried that an aggressive advertising strategy by the amendment’s advocates could sufficiently cause voters to misjudge what the amendment would allow. That, coupled with the inertia of the midterm congressional races stealing the focus away from the amendment, you could see Virginia end up enacting one of the most liberal abortion laws in the United States.","summary":"If we all had a dollar for every time we’ve been told, “This is the most important election of our lifetime,” we could afford to...

What’s more, the New York City area “also has sufficient minority representation that has not been directly impacted by the shooting and its aftermath,” so a diverse and representative jury should be able to be selected, the defense lawyers said.\n\nThe court has not yet set a deadline for prosecutors to respond to the defense motion.\n\nBut the suggestion for a venue change drew immediate opposition from family members of the victims.\n\n“There’s no question that our families strongly believe that he should stand trial in this venue where he committed these awful crimes,” said Buffalo attorney Terrence M. Connors, who represents the families of seven of those killed in the May 14, 2022, mass shooting as well as the three who were wounded.\n\nFamily members of the victims have attended each of the 19 court proceedings so far in Gendron’s federal case since his initial appearance on June 16, 2022. Gendron has attended only three of the hearings.\n\nThe criteria for changing venue includes convenience and impartiality, Connors said.\n\n“So convenience means that it’s for the convenience of all the parties and the witnesses, and a change of venue would inconvenience all of these families who have steadfastly followed these proceedings and waited patiently for some closure and some justice,” Connors said.\n\nGendron’s lawyers also say it would be “virtually impossible” to select a jury in Western New York that reflects the diversity of the community.\n\n“If the verdict in this case is to carry any moral authority, it should be delivered by a diverse group of citizens,” his lawyers said. “But, given the history of segregation in Buffalo, that is exceedingly unlikely if the case is tried in the Western District of New York.”\n\nHis lawyers said about 85% of Black Buffalo residents live in neighborhoods in the city’s East Side. Outside the city, the Black population “is sparse,” they said.\n\n“The fact that the Black population is centered nearly exclusively in East Buffalo makes it highly unlikely that potential jurors of color will survive jury selection because of personal connections of minority East Buffalo residents to the shootings and its aftermath,” according to the defense filing.\n\n“The importance of a jury that reflects the diversity of the community is at its apex in a case where racial animus is the alleged motive, but such a jury is virtually impossible to secure if the case remains in Buffalo,” the defense lawyers said.\n\nGendron, 18 years old at the time of his attack, drove from his Binghamton-area home to the grocery store and got out of his car wearing a tactical-style helmet, camouflage clothing, body armor and a video camera. He carried a Bushmaster XM-15 .223 caliber rifle and multiple loaded magazines.\n\nHe fatally shot three Black people in front of the store – Roberta Drury, 32, Pearl Young, 77, and Heyward Patterson, 67 – and wounded another.\n\nAfter entering the store, he kept shooting and killed seven more Black people: Ruth Whitfield, 86; Celestine Chaney, 65; Aaron W. Salter Jr., 55; Andre Mackniel, 52; Margus Morrison, 52; Katherine Massey, 72; and Geraldine Talley, 62.\n\nBut Gendron did not shoot at only them.\n\nDuring the mass shooting, about 69 other people were in and around Tops, mostly Black shoppers and workers, who were not murdered, according to prosecutors.\n\nAfter a federal grand jury returned a 27-count indictment against Gendron in July 2022, the Justice Department announced in January 2024 that it would seek the death penalty.\n\nGendron already has been sentenced by an Erie County judge to life in prison without parole on his guilty pleas to 10 state charges of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree attempted murder, among other charges. Gendron’s federal public defenders have said he would plead guilty to the federal charges if the government drops the death penalty as a potential punishment.\n\nIn their filing Monday, Gendron’s lawyers – Assistant Federal Public Defender Sonya A. Zoghlin, Senior Litigator MaryBeth Covert; Julie Brain, a death penalty resource counsel from Philadelphia; and Monica Foster, executive director for Indiana Federal Community Defenders Inc. – said they have tracked some 850 local news articles related to the shooting or the people involved.\n\nBut they called that number an underestimate of how many stories have been published or aired, because their efforts to collect stories were not always robust.\n\nGiven the number of articles during a sampling period, a more accurate estimate for local news articles would be roughly 1,847, they said.\n\nThe coverage included former President Joe Biden calling Gendron “a hate-filled soul.”\n\nAnd they cited a Buffalo News article that quoted former Mayor Byron Brown saying seeking the death penalty against Gendron was “the right decision.”\n\nBiden, then-Vice President Kamala Harris and then-Attorney General Merrick Garland also came to Buffalo to meet with surviving family members.\n\nThe defense tracked 130 local news articles in the two weeks following the shooting.\n\n“The media frenzy in the days and weeks following the shooting was extraordinary though perhaps not entirely unexpected,” according to the defense filing.\n\nBut the defense lawyers cited three factors that have kept the shooting in the news in the years that followed.\n\nNinety-one stories have explored and documented “the historic racism and segregation experienced in East Buffalo.”\n\nThe defense lawyers have collected 235 articles about the victims who were killed and remembrances of them.\n\n“Many of these articles describe in detail the impact of the crime on the families that were affected,” the defense lawyers wrote. “Although the anger and the sadness is wholly understandable, survivors’ feelings and opinions about whether Payton Gendron should receive the death penalty is inadmissible.”\n\nAnd then there were stories about two of the people affected by the shooting who became active in local politics. Last December, former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield announced he was running for mayor. His mother was killed in the Tops shooting.\n\nAlso, Zeneta Everhart, the mother of a surviving victim, won election to the Buffalo Common Council for the Masten District. Stories about both frequently mention their connection to the Tops shooting.\n\n“We’ve had many cases where there’s been widespread media coverage,” Connors said. “The question is whether or not it influences potential jurors.”\n\nThe judge, either through a questionnaire or during questioning of potential jurors, can determine if there is no ability to pick fair and impartial jurors.\n\n“That’s not usually the case,” Connors said. “It’s rare ... even a case with this type of publicity to have a change of venue.”","summary":"Lawyers for the man charged with killing 10 people and injuring three others in his racist attack at the Tops grocery store on Jefferson Avenue said he cannot get a fair trial in Buffalo and want him tried nearly 400…","url":"https://buffalonews.com/news/local/crime-courts/article_dbb5881e-6308-4d22-b5bb-2550e6041523.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/bb/dbb5881e-6308-4d22-b5bb-2550e6041523/67ec539a6f5ec.preview.jpg?crop=1576%2C827%2C2%2C50&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 20:55:00","author":"Patrick Lakamp","authors":["Patrick Lakamp"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":306659824,"title":"The Democrats are in denial about 2024 | New York Times","text":"Last year’s election was close, despite President Donald Trump’s hyperbolic claims about his margin of victory. Still, the Democratic Party clearly lost — and not only the presidential race.\n\nIt also lost control of the Senate and failed to recapture the House of Representatives. Of the 11 governor’s races held last year, Democrats won three. In state legislature races, they won fewer than 45% of the seats.\n\nIn the aftermath of this comprehensive defeat, many party leaders have decided they do not need to make significant changes to their policies or their message. They have instead settled on a convenient explanation for their plight.\n\nThat explanation starts with the notion that Democrats were merely the unlucky victims of post-pandemic inflation and that their party is more popular than it seems: If Democrats could only communicate better, particularly on social media and podcasts, the party would be fine.\n\n“We’ve got the right message,” Ken Martin, the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said while campaigning for the job. “What we need to do is connect it back with the voters.”\n\nA key part of this argument involves voter turnout. Party leaders claim that most Americans still prefer Democrats but that voter apathy allowed Trump to win. According to this logic, Democrats do not need to worry about winning back Trump voters and should instead try to animate the country’s natural liberal majority.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going to win over those 77 million that voted for Donald Trump,” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the party’s 2024 vice-presidential nominee, said this month. “I’m concerned with the 90 million who stayed home.” It was an unfortunate echo of Hillary Clinton saying that millions of Trump voters were “deplorables” and “irredeemable.”\n\nAs comforting as these explanations may feel to Democrats, they are a form of denial that will make it harder for the Democratic Party to win future elections.\n\nEven many conservatives and Republicans should be concerned about the Democratic denial. The country needs two healthy political parties. It especially needs a healthy Democratic Party, given Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party and his draconian behavior. Restraining him — and any successors who continue his policies — depends on Democrats taking an honest look at their problems.\n\nThe part of the Democratic story that contains the most truth is inflation. Prices surged during COVID-19's supply-chain disruptions, and incumbent parties around the world have suffered. Whether on the political right or left, ruling parties lost power in the United States, Brazil, Britain, Germany and Italy.\n\nBut some incumbent parties managed to win reelection, including in Denmark, France, India, Japan, Mexico and Spain. A healthier Democratic Party could have joined them last year. The Democrats, after all, were running against a Republican whose favorability rating rarely exceeded 45%. Most voters did not like Trump. They did prefer him to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. ...\n\nPolls make clear that inflation was not the only reason. Voters also trusted Republicans more than Democrats on immigration, crime, government spending, global trade and foreign policy. Among the few exceptions were abortion and health care. As the headline of a recent Times news article summarized, “Support for Trump’s Policies Exceeds Support for Trump.” Only 27% of Americans now have a favorable view of the Democratic Party. It is the party’s lowest approval rating in decades.\n\nThe part of that Democratic story that contains the least truth is voter turnout. Nonvoters appear to have favored Trump by an even wider margin than voters, as Nate Cohn, The Times’s chief political analyst, has reported. David Shor, the bracingly honest Democratic data scientist, put it well: “We’re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do.”\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that winning over nonvoters and Trump voters is not in conflict. People who do not vote have many of the same concerns as voters who flipped to Trump. Nonvoters are disproportionately working class, young, Asian, Black, Latino or foreign-born, and each of these groups shifted away from Democrats. When Democrats call for ignoring the country’s 77 million Trump voters, they are writing off a diverse group of Americans, many of whom voted Democratic before.\n\nWe recognize that the Democratic Party is in a difficult position. It must compete with a Republican Party that shows an alarming hostility to American democracy. And we urge Democrats to continue speaking out against Trump’s authoritarian behavior — his bullying of military leaders, judges, law firms, universities and the media; his disdain for Congress; his attempts to chill speech through deportation; his tolerance for incompetent cabinet secretaries who endanger American troops. Whatever polls say about the political wisdom of such criticism, Democratic silence on these issues would only encourage timidity from other parts of society.\n\nIt is the rest of the Democratic strategy that requires more rigorous and less wishful reflection. To regain voters’ trust, Democrats should take at least three steps.\n\nFirst, they should admit that their party mishandled Biden’s age. Leading Democrats insisted that he had mental acuity for a second term when most Americans believed otherwise. Party leaders even attempted to shout down anybody who raised concerns, before reversing course and pushing Biden out of the race. Already, many voters believe that Democrats refuse to admit uncomfortable truths on some subjects, including crime, illegal immigration, inflation and Covid lockdowns. Biden’s age became a glaring example. Acknowledging as much may be backward looking, but it would send an important signal.\n\nSecond, Democrats should recognize that the party moved too far left on social issues after Barack Obama left office in 2017. The old video clips of Harris that the Trump campaign gleefully replayed last year — on decriminalizing the border and government-funded gender-transition surgery for prisoners — highlighted the problem. Yes, she tried to abandon these stances before the election, but she never spoke forthrightly to voters and acknowledged she had changed her position.\n\nEven today, the party remains too focused on personal identity and on Americans’ differences — by race, gender, sexuality and religion — rather than our shared values. On these issues, progressives sometimes adopt a scolding, censorious posture. It is worth emphasizing that this posture has alienated growing numbers of Asian, Black and Latino voters. Democrats who won last year in places where Trump also won, such as Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, adopted a more moderate tone. They were hawkish about border security and law enforcement, criticizing their own party. They did not make the common Democratic mistake of trying to talk about only economic policy and refusing to engage with Americans’ concerns on difficult social issues.\n\nThird, the party has to offer new ideas. When Democrats emerged from the wilderness in the past, they often did so with fresh ideas. They updated the proud Democratic tradition of improving life for all Americans. Bill Clinton remade the party in the early 1990s and spoke of “putting people first.” In 2008, Obama, Clinton and John Edwards offered exciting plans to improve health care, reduce inequality and slow climate change. These candidates provided intellectual leadership.\n\nHarris failed to do so in last year’s campaign, and few Democrats are doing so today. Where is the Democrat with bold plans to cut living costs? Or fight the ills of social media? Or help aimless boys who are struggling in school? Where is the governor who does more than talk about an abundance agenda and actually cuts regulations to help America build? New ideas should come from both the party’s progressives and its centrists. The most successful American politicians, like Obama and Ronald Reagan, deftly mix boldness and moderation. One benefit of being out of power is that it offers time to develop ideas and see which resonate. It is not a time to say, “We’ve got the right message.”\n\nEven without reforming themselves, Democrats may fare well in elections over the next two years. Opposition parties usually thrive in midterms. The longer-term picture is less sanguine. The next Republican leader may be more disciplined than Trump. And both the Senate and the Electoral College look challenging for Democrats.

The bullet grazed Trump’s ear. \n\nTrump, who was raised Presbyterian but in 2020 switched to be non-denominational Christian, said that the near-death experience made him “more of a believer.”\n\n“It changed something in me,” he said at a national prayer breakfast on Feb. 6. “I feel even stronger. I believed in God but I feel much more strongly about it.” \n\nAt the time Trump also said that God has a “glorious mission” for America and that the country needs to “make religion a much more important factor now.”\n\nSome Democrats have expressed concern about Trump’s newfound spirituality. Although the president has historically surrounded himself with deeply religious figures, it isn’t until his most recent term that he’s been so vocal about Christianity that he committed to “eradicate anti-Christian bias” through a task force led by Attorney General Pam Bondi. The new group will “move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide,” Trump said. \n\nThe task force aims to “identify any unlawful anti-Christian” actions that took place under Biden’s administration. Trump has taken aim at his predecessor’s apparent “anti-Christian weaponization” due to his prosecution of anti-abortion activists that blocked reproductive healthcare clinics. \n\nCritics say that the task force only further empowers an already majority group and blurs the lines between church and state. Trump also created a special White House Faith Office led by pastor Paula White-Cain, an American televangelist.\n\nTrump’s inner circle has also been connected with the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a fast-growing evangelical order that maintains that Christianity is supreme over all other religions. NAR leaders are outspoken in their goals to create a Christian government for the U.S. and see Donald Trump as chosen by God to lead the country. White-Cain has been linked to NAR and so has Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who has appeared on NAR pastors’ radio shows. Catholic convert JD Vance also appeared at a town hall hosted by NAR leader Lance Wallnau last September. Wallnau received backlash from the left after accusing former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris of “witchcraft.” \n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth also attends Pastor Doug Wilson’s church, a conservative preacher who firmly believes in theocracy and Christian nationalism and condemned women’s right to vote. \n\nOther Republican members of Congress like Marjorie Taylor Green have also commented on Trump’s religiosity. The rightwing Georgian representative compared Trump to Jesus at a rally in Las Vegas last year. \n\nLeavitt also said she holds a prayer before each press briefing, and said that she relied on her faith to do her job. “My faith is incredibly important to me, I would argue, now more than ever, being in a role that is very demanding and at times controversial, and there’s a lot of public pressure and discussion online about who you are and your family,” she said. “And you know, it could be difficult for someone who doesn’t have faith but with faith, all things are possible.” \n\nLeavitt, despite using the language of evangelical Christians, is herself a Catholic. The 27-year-old credits her faith and Catholic high school and college education for her conservative values. She had her first child in July 2024 with her then-fiance Nicholas Riccio, 59. They married in January 2025 in a private ceremony. It is unclear if it was at a Catholic church.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyHis opponents include Democrats, the deep state, RINO Republicans—and now, “evil forces.”\n\nDonald Trump’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has painted his administration as engaged in a “spiritual battle,” and suggested that he was “saved by the grace of God” to become president.\n\nThe language reflects Trump’s successful appeal to evangelical Christians.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-press-secretary-karoline-leavitt-claims-hes-facing-evil-forces/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/RCYIAGTW3VBNTMBSQOS3CQBTK4.gif?smart=true&auth=ad0d9e69dba2ac30991f8e166dd9207b8ccb3e9a63a847ed358786dc1bae2c4e&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 18:42:28","author":"Kenneal Patterson","authors":["Kenneal Patterson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.047},{"id":306598422,"title":"One Nebraska","text":"This month, Nebraska lawmakers will debate whether to pass legislation that makes Nebraska's electoral system \"winner-take-all.\" \n\nIn last November’s election, four of the state's five electoral votes went to Donald Trump, with one from Nebraska's Second Congressional District (the \"blue dot\") going to Kamala Harris.\n\n“Blue dot” proponents hope the practice of splitting electoral votes in presidential elections (followed only by Nebraska and Maine) spreads to more states.\n\nJane Kleeb, chairman of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said Nebraskans should be proud of the Second District's \"blue dot\" because it makes the state \"unique.\" \n\nAnd so, Kleeb said, “let the other states follow our lead in true representative democracy.\"\n\nShe sees the “blue dot” as an opportunity to influence national politics and attract media attention; I see the \"blue dot\" as fomenting urban vs. rural resentment, and as a wedge that drives Nebraskans apart. \n\nThe sharpest divide in American politics is urban vs. rural. \n\nStatistics show that roughly two-thirds of urban voters choose Democrat candidates; roughly two-thirds of rural voters choose Republicans. Though many Nebraskans can trace their family histories back to the farm, the growth of cities means more people are removed from those early pioneers who shaped our state’s identity.\n\nThis principle holds true for other states. \n\nIn February, Indiana's House of Representatives passed a bill to consider annexing 33 counties in rural Illinois, a move toward which some Illinois residents have worked for five years. Illinois ranks third nationally in the export of agricultural commodities, and rural residents believe their values and way of life are worlds away from Cook County and the city of Chicago.\n\nLike those Illinois residents, rural voters in Nebraska, especially in western Nebraska, argue that their interests are underrepresented in state politics. While the state's economy is anchored in Omaha and Lincoln, most of Nebraska is dedicated to the production of corn, soybeans, cattle, and other agricultural products.\n\nOne of the goals of Nebraska politics should be to reconcile differences, to speak with one voice rather than two.\n\nThat was the secret to Ben Nelson's winning campaign for Nebraska Governor in 1990.\n\nNelson, a lawyer, reached out to people from across the state, encouraging a sense of solidarity in \"One Nebraska.\" He asked voters to think about issues in terms of their families, neighbors, and community. Nelson said the secret to his success was to make government work for everybody, and to stop fighting over whether people are rural or urban.\n\nBut the \"blue dot\" aggravates that division, splitting Nebraska's electorate and encouraging politicians to focus time, money, and attention on urban rather than nationwide issues.\n\nIf rural Nebraska counties were to follow Illinois’ example, they certainly would find a more favorable tax climate in South Dakota or Wyoming. I hope they wouldn’t find a stronger spirit of solidarity and state pride.\n\nTo solve the problem, state legislators have put forward a \"winner-take-all\" bill to align Nebraska with 48 other states, though recent history suggests Legislative Bill 3 may not pass into law.\n\nWhatever the outcome of this legislative session, something needs to change. \n\nLess \"blue dot\" or \"winner-take-all.\" \n\nMore \"One Nebraska,\" standing tall. \n\nJohn J.

As we commemorate the embattled farmers who set us on the road to independence, ironies abound.\n\nI live in Massachusetts, the home of supersized government. We have high taxes, absurd regulations, draconian gun laws and sanctuary cities. There isn’t a single Republican in statewide office. Hadassah, the ladies’ Zionist service organization, has a bigger presence in Tehran than the Republican Party has in our state legislature.\n\nWe send hard-core leftists such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and squad member Rep. Ayanna Presley to Washington. It has been 41 years since a Republican carried Massachusetts in a presidential election. We have gone from the Cradle of Liberty to the Sandbox of Socialism.\n\nIt’s not just Massachusetts. In the November elections, 48% of voters opted for the welfare state on steroids, even though its champion rarely expressed a coherent thought.\n\nIn 2021, the average American family paid $17,902 in federal, state and local taxes. The Colonists revolted against a 3-pence-a-pound tax on tea.\n\nConservatives are the real heirs to the Spirit of ’76. The left has more in common with the French and Russian revolutions – the guillotine and the gulag – than the American Revolution, which gave us the Declaration of Independence, acknowledging God-given rights, and the U.S. Constitution, with its balance of powers based on a distrust of government.\n\nAlthough the left seeks to rule in the name of the people, it believes the people are pitiful fools who can’t be trusted to come in out of the rain unless the government leads them by the hand. Reaction to such elitist arrogance includes polling, which shows that only 27% of voters have a positive view of the Democratic Party.\n\nRonald Reagan said: “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected and handed on for them to do the same.”\n\nLike the Minutemen of 1775 and the GIs of 1944, we are engaged in a monumental struggle that will determine humanity’s fate.\n\nA little more than four months after voters rejected the divine right of politicians and bureaucrats, the Democrats have doubled down on woke.\n\nAs if Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz weren’t enough, the Democratic Party has a new de facto leadership team: Sen. Bernard Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the mummified Marxist who honeymooned in the Soviet Union and the Bolshevik Barbie whose district looks like Gaza City after urban renewal by the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe Minutemen weren’t spoiling for a fight. They didn’t want to go up against the best professional army in the world. They believed in the rights of Englishmen, including free speech, freedom of religion and trial by a jury of their peers. Eventually, they began thinking of themselves not as Englishmen but as Americans.\n\nThey were descendants of the Pilgrims and Puritans who believed in a simple, unvarnished form of Christianity. They saw a government 3,000 miles away – a king and his Parliament – taking from them while giving little in return. They came to see the Redcoats as an army of occupation.\n\nIf they felt that way about the 18th-century British Crown, imagine how those yeomen farmers who fired the shot heard around the world would feel about the government we have today.\n\nCould they even begin to comprehend a government under which children are indoctrinated in public schools, churches are investigated for domestic terrorism, there are subsidies for everything under the sun (including universities that allow mob rule on campus), and their sons and daughters are involved in endless foreign wars, children are mutilated in the name of an insane gender ideology, gun ownership is constantly under attack, judges believe they are anointed, we have a multigenerational dependent class, and our cities look like gypsy encampments where savages who commit the most heinous offenses are treated like those with overdue library books?\n\nFor the commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Democratic Party, which controls it, to celebrate Lexington and Concord is obscene.

Gates attended Stanford University, graduating in 2024 with a bachelor of science in human biology, according to her LinkedIn profile. She describes herself as a reproductive rights advocate on her LinkedIn, which she has advocated for in op-eds, posts on social media and through docuseries she has produced. Gates was recognized by the Reproductive Freedom for All nonprofit as its Rising Reproductive Freedom Champion last year, as the organization praised her for using her platform to advocate for reproductive rights. Gates told the Wall Street Journal last year she planned to give millions to abortion rights groups, citing her disappointment over the Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. Gates is also active on social media, with 500,000 Instagram followers and 250,000 followers on TikTok, where she often posts pro-abortion rights content.\n\nKey Background\n\n“The Burnouts” is the latest venture by Cooper’s Unwell Network, which she founded in 2023 on the heels of the success of “Call Her Daddy.” Cooper, a Forbes 30 Under 30 alum who placed eighth on Forbes’ Top Creators list in 2024, with estimated earnings of $22 million, signed a $125 million deal with SiriusXM last year, giving the platform exclusive advertising and distribution rights to “Call Her Daddy” and other shows produced by The Unwell Network. Other shows under The Unwell Network include “Hot Mess with Alix Earle” and “Pretty Lonesome with Madeline Argy.” Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” ranked as Spotify’s second most-popular podcast behind “The Joe Rogan Experience” last year, to which she attracts high-profile guests, including a highly publicized interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nGates’ father, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, is worth an estimated $107 billion, making him the 11th richest person in the world, according to Forbes estimates. Melinda French Gates is worth an estimated $30 billion, (No. 57 on the list), according to Forbes estimates. Gates’ parents divorced in 2021 and also co-chaired the Gates Foundation together until 2024, when Melinda stepped down.\n\nBill Gates said on the “Figuring Out With Raj Shamani” podcast earlier this week his three children will inherit less than 1% of his wealth. “It's not a dynasty, I'm not asking them to run Microsoft. I want to give them a chance to have their own earnings and success,” Gates said.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nInside Alex Cooper’s $125 Million Deal To Grow Her Multimedia Empire (Forbes)\n\nForbes Top Creators 2024 (Forbes)\n\nBill Gates says his children will inherit ‘less than 1%’ of his wealth (Fortune)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Vendimi ngjalli reagime të menjëhershme.\n\nReagimet e aleatëve\n\n“Je suis Marine!” ose “Unë jam Marine”, deklaroi kryeministri ultrakonservator hungarez Viktor Orbán , një aleat kryesor i Le Pen, sapo u shpall vendimi. “Sot, jo vetëm që Le Pen u dënua padrejtësisht, por sot u vra demokracia franceze,” tha zëvendësi dhe pasardhësi i saj Jordan Bardella, i cili kishte njoftuar më parë se do të zinte vendin e saj në garë nëse ajo nuk do të ishte në gjendje të kandidonte në zgjedhje. Aleati i saj i madh në Itali, zëvendëskryeministri Matteo Salvini, kreu i Ligës së ekstremit të djathtë, foli gjithashtu. “Ata që kanë frikë nga verdikti i votuesve shpesh gjejnë lehtësim në vendimet e gjykatës,” tha Salvini, duke shtuar se rezultati i gjyqit ishte “një shpallje lufte nga Brukseli”: “Ne nuk do të frikësohemi apo ndalemi. Vullnet e plotë përpara, miq!”.\n\nVendimi për Le Pen\n\nDuke shpallur vendimin për përvetësim të parave evropiane, gjykatësi francez Benedicte de Perthuis tha se Le Pen ishte në qendër të një sistemi që partia ngriti për të përdorur paratë evropiane për të financuar partinë në Francë. Sipas De Perthuis, hetimi vërtetoi se nuk ishte një gabim administrativ, por qëllimi ishte të uleshin kostot e partisë. Gjatë leximit të vendimit, Le Pen, e ulur në rreshtin e parë, tundi kokën, duke shprehur mospajtimin e saj me fjalët e saj. Përveç Le Pen, tetë parlamentarë të tjerë evropianë dhe 12 asistentë u shpallën fajtorë për përvetësim të parave evropiane. Gjykatësi tha se kërkesa e prokurorit për ndalimin e funksioneve politike me efekt të menjëhershëm ishte e bazuar dhe Le Penit, ndër të tjera, iu ndalua të kandidojë për poste publike për pesë vjet. Ajo do të mund të përfundojë mandatin e saj si deputete e Parlamentit francez. Partia e saj ka këmbëngulur se kjo është një aktakuzë e motivuar politikisht që synon të ndalojë rritjen e krahut të djathtë francez, i cili ka qenë në rritje të vazhdueshme në mbështetje që nga viti 2012.\n\nKandidatët për president\n\nMegjithatë, vendimi nuk do të thotë domosdoshmërisht se Le Pen definitivisht nuk do të jetë në gjendje të kandidojë në vitin 2027. Kjo do të varet nga apelimi i vendimit dhe rezultati i tij. Kë mund të nxirrte partia si kandidat presidencial? Jordan Bardella, 29-vjeçari i djathtë i TikTok që gati u bë kryeministër i Francës? Vështirë se ai është ende “shumë i gjelbër” për të mbajtur postin më të rëndësishëm dhe më të lartë politik në vend. Megjithatë, askush tjetër nuk ka arritur të vendoset në nivel kombëtar si një “zëvendësues i denjë” për kandidaten, programin dhe botëkuptimin e së cilës çdo francez e njeh mirë, sepse ajo është në arenën politike prej dekadash. Asambleja Kombëtare, në atë rast, nuk do të kishte zgjidhje tjetër veçse t’i drejtohej zgjidhjes ” Kamala Harris”, e vetëdijshme se si rezultoi ai opsion në zgjedhjet në SHBA. Por as Emmanuel Macron dhe centristët nuk janë të lumtur as për këtë çështje. Veç faktit që u përshtaten hallet e rivalit të tyre kryesor politik, ata vetë nuk kanë një zgjidhje të lumtur personeli për vitin 2027. Kushtetuta e Republikës së Pestë e pengon Macron të kandidojë për një mandat të tretë. Deri më tani, vetëm Edouard Philippe, kryeministri i deritanishëm, i cili nuk është tepër i popullarizuar në mesin e bashkatdhetarëve të tij, e ka hedhur në mënyrë diskrete dorën në ring.","summary":"Makthi më i keq i Marine Le Pen është bërë realitet.

But with only six of that Super Bowl-winning team still playing for the Chiefs, Hunt implied that getting something finalized isn't a straightforward task.\n\n'We’re very honored that the president would think about us, going back to the 2019 season, when we didn’t get to go to the White House,' Chiefs owner Hunt said this week.\n\n'We certainly would like to try to figure out how to make that happen. We have six players from that roster that are still on the team\n\n'We’re working through those (details) with the White House. Hopefully, we’ll be able to make it work. It was completely unexpected (the invite). It was very, very thoughtful of him.'\n\nTravis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes could head to the White House later this summer\n\nDonald Trump has invited Kansas City's 2019 Super Bowl-winners to the White House \n\nIf the visit goes ahead, it would see Kelce and Mahomes meet with Trump in-person at the White House. Chiefs quarterback Mahomes has never revealed who he has voted for but his wife and mother both went public with support for Trump.\n\nFor Kelce, it's a different story. His girlfriend Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris and days after, Trump posted on Truth Social 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!'.\n\nTrump made history in February by becoming the first sitting President to attend a Super Bowl, where he watched the Chiefs get blown away by the Philadelphia Eagles in a 40-22 scoreline that makes the game sound closer than it was. At one stage, the Eagles led 34-0.\n\nTrump taunted Swift - who was booed when she appeared on the jumbotron - after the game, saying on Truth Social: 'The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. \n\n'She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!'\n\nKelce was diplomatic about Trump's presence in the buildup to the game, saying: 'It's awesome. It's a great honor, I think no matter who the President is.\n\n'I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life and having the President there, it's the best country in the world so it's pretty cool.'\n\nTrump incorrectly backed the Chiefs to beat the Eagles due to Mahomes, saying: 'I don't want to say [who will win] but there's a certain quarterback that seems to be a pretty good winner.'\n\nTaylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris at the election but Brittany Mahomes supported Trump\n\nThe Chiefs visited Joe Biden twice at the White House off the back of Super Bowl successes\n\nMahomes responded the next day by saying: 'I didn't see that clip, but obviously it's cool to hear that he's seen me play football and respects the game that I play.\n\n;It's always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president, someone in the top position in our country.'\n\nMahomes, Kelce and the Chiefs visited the White House twice during Joe Biden's presidency after their other two Super Bowl victories. \n\nTravis KelceKansas City ChiefsTaylor Swift\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTravis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes' Donald Trump White House visit hits a snag\n\nAdd comment","summary":"President Trump is keen to welcome the 2019 Kansas City Chiefs to the White House this summer but planning the visit isn't simple for Chiefs owner Clark Hunt.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14560233/Travis-Kelce-Patrick-Mahomes-Donald-Trump-White-House-visit-snag.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/01/18/96797865-0-image-m-46_1743528134178.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 17:33:30","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.518},{"id":306659876,"title":"Kristi Noem refused to say who financed some of her travel. It was taxpayers who were on the hook","text":"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — As then-Gov. Kristi Noem crisscrossed the country — stumping for President Donald Trump and boosting her political profile beyond her home state — she refused to reveal what her extensive travel was costing taxpayers.\n\nIn the weeks since Noem became Trump’s Homeland Security secretary, that mystery has been solved: South Dakota repeatedly picked up the tab for expenses related to her jet-setting campaigning.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of recently released travel records found more than $150,000 in expenses tied to Noem’s political and personal activity and not South Dakota business. That included numerous trips to Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump lived before retaking office.\n\nMost of those costs covered the state-provided security that accompanied Noem, irrespective of the reason for her travel. Over her six years as governor, AP’s analysis shows, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related costs incurred by the governor’s office.\n\nThe expenditures include $7,555 in airfare for a six-day trip to Paris, where she gave a speech at a right-wing gathering, costs associated with a bear hunt in Canada with her niece and a book tour that included a stop in New York. An additional $2,200 stemmed from a controversial trip last year to Houston for dental work she showcased on Instagram.\n\nThe expenses, released last month following a lawsuit by The Dakota Scout, have incensed Republicans in the deep-red state, with several GOP lawmakers accusing Noem of tapping state funds to fuel her own political ascendancy.\n\nThe uproar comes as the Trump administration seeks to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in government and as Noem has taken over DHS, the third-largest federal agency, with a budget and workforce many times the size of South Dakota's.\n\nThe spending “offends a lot of people,” said Dennis Daugaard, a former Republican South Dakota governor, who added that costs generated by Noem’s ambition for higher office could’ve been paid with campaign funds.\n\nTaffy Howard, a GOP state senator who clashed with Noem over her refusal to disclose her travel expenses, expressed shock at the price tag. “It seems like an incredible amount of money,” Howard told AP.\n\nA spokesman for Noem, Tim Murtaugh, declined to answer detailed questions about the expenses but did not dispute that some of the travel lacked an apparent connection to state business. There’s no indication the former governor broke any laws having the state foot the bill for security expenses — even on trips that critics said benefited her more than South Dakota taxpayers.\n\n“Unfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials,\" Murtaugh said. “When it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.”\n\nJosie Harms, a spokesperson for Noem’s gubernatorial successor, said security requirements were “a matter of state business no matter where the governor may be.\"\n\n“The scope of that security is not up to the governor,” Harms added.\n\nDuring her years in office, Noem frequently said that releasing her travel expenses would jeopardize her safety.\n\nSouth Dakota has relatively lax disclosure requirements for such travel expenses. Governors from both parties have used state funds to finance the travel expenses of their security details and staffers.\n\nCritics called on Washington’s Jay Inslee, a Democrat, to reimburse the state for similar costs resulting from his unsuccessful 2019 presidential run. And Ron DeSantis, Florida's GOP governor, also came under fire for racking up hefty travel tabs for his security detail during his bid for higher office.\n\nMurtaugh, a spokesman for Noem in her personal capacity, questioned why Democratic governors were not being scrutinized for their travel on behalf of former Vice President Kamala Harris, their party's 2024 presidential nominee.\n\n“They maintained aggressive political schedules on behalf of Kamala Harris but somehow escape media attention for costs associated with that, while Kristi Noem is being held to a different standard?” Murtaugh wrote in an email.\n\nThe more than 3,000 pages of records released to the Scout by the state auditor included hotel receipts, restaurant bills and credit card statements.\n\nThe AP obtained the same records, as well as dozens of additional documents that show state officials acknowledged that “campaigning for Trump is not an official duty” of the governor in denying one of several requests to release her travel expenses.\n\nThe receipts are heavily redacted, so it’s not always clear who incurred the expense. Only 30 items totaling $2,056.72 were charged on the governor’s state-issued Mastercard, according to her attorney.\n\nSome expenses seemingly had no link to state business, such as $21 hotel-room movie purchases. It’s also unclear who attended meals that included unnamed “federal officials.”\n\nThe state auditor questioned some of the charges, including the governor’s office’s use of a luxury airline travel agency for a flight to Paris and a $2,000 change fee.\n\nThe state also ran up more than $3,300 in late fees and interest. The record doesn’t indicate how much was paid in overtime for staff and security accompanying Noem on her political excursions.\n\n“Spending for security detail, as well as where and when they are deemed necessary, falls under the discretion of the governor,” Jenna Latham, a supervisor in the state auditor's office, wrote to AP in an email.\n\nMost of the expenses were incurred as Noem became a rising star in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” universe and a contender to be his 2024 running mate. Her fortunes appeared to have suffered a blow after she revealed in a memoir that she shot and killed her farm dog, Cricket, after it scared away some game during a pheasant hunt.\n\nThis is not the first time Noem’s travel has come under the microscope. A state government accountability board in 2022 had requested an investigation into her use of the state plane to attend political events, but a prosecutor found no grounds for charges.","summary":"An Associated Press analysis has found that South Dakota taxpayers subsidized Gov.

Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk are backing conservative judge Brad Schimel while progressive billionaires and Democrats support liberal Susan Crawford.\n\nTwo Republican-friendly Florida congressional seats could give the GOP some breathing room in the narrowly divided chamber. But Democrats in both districts have far outraised their GOP counterparts, and national Republicans have been publicly concerned in particular about the race to replace Mike Waltz, now Trump’s national security adviser.\n\nHere are the places to watch as the vote results are reported on election night:\n\nWisconsin: How big will Democrats win in Milwaukee and Madison?\n\nIn any statewide election in Wisconsin, Democrats tend to win by large margins in the populous counties of Milwaukee and Dane (home of Madison). But the size of that win is usually a big factor in who wins statewide, especially in a close contest.\n\nIn 2024, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris carried Milwaukee with 68% of the vote and Dane with 75% while narrowly losing statewide. That same night, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin ran about 2 percentage points ahead of Harris in both counties and narrowly won reelection.\n\nIn 2023, the Democratic Party-backed Supreme Court candidate Janet Protasiewicz received 73% of the vote in Milwaukee and 82% of the vote in Dane and went on to win statewide by an 11-percentage-point margin.\n\nWisconsin: How big will Republicans win in the ‘WOW’ counties?\n\nRepublicans tend to do well in the suburban Milwaukee counties of Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha — the so-called “WOW” counties. A strong Republican showing in these counties can help counter the Democratic advantage in urban areas. Republican candidates have carried all three counties in every major statewide election going back to at least 2016.\n\nWisconsin: Who’s ahead in Green Bay?\n\nRepublican candidates tend to win Brown County, which is home to Green Bay, but not by huge blowouts. Trump carried the county in all three of his presidential campaigns with between 52% and 53% of the vote.\n\nBut since the 2016 election, there have been two Democrats who carried Brown County and went on to win statewide: Tony Evers in his bid for governor in 2018 and more recently Protasiewicz in her 2023 state Supreme Court race.\n\nA Democrat can still win statewide without winning Brown (such as Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, Evers’ reelection in 2022 and all three of Baldwin’s U.S. Senate runs). But if they do carry Brown, it’s probably going to be a rough night for Republicans.\n\nWisconsin: What’s the situation in Sauk?\n\nSauk County, northwest of Madison, is a competitive area in statewide elections that usually ends up supporting the Democratic candidate, albeit by slim margins. It falls somewhere in the middle of Wisconsin’s 72 counties in terms of population, and the margins are usually so small that statewide elections aren’t typically won or lost in Sauk.\n\nDemocrats or Democratic-backed candidates had a long winning streak in Sauk, having carried the county in eight of the last 10 major statewide elections. But the two exceptions are notable: Trump carried Sauk in 2016 and 2024, when he won Wisconsin and the White House.\n\nWhile Sauk won’t likely place a decisive role in Tuesday’s elections, a victory there by a Republican-backed candidate may be a good sign for the party statewide.\n\nFlorida: Voting history favors Republicans\n\nDemocrats are encouraged by the strong fundraising performances of their nominees to replace Waltz and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, but the special elections take place in two congressional districts that have long been safe Republican territory.\n\nTrump received about 68% of the vote in 2024 in the Florida Panhandle’s 1st Congressional District, slightly outperforming the 66% Gaetz received in his reelection bid. In the 6th Congressional District on the Atlantic coast, Trump received roughly 65% of the vote, just behind the 67% Waltz received in his final House reelection bid.\n\nThe four counties that make up the 1st District have voted for Republican presidential candidates almost continually for the past 60 years. Only Walton County went for a Democrat on one occasion since 1960, although all four voted for Democrat-turned-independent candidate George Wallace in 1968. Today, the part of Walton County that falls within the 1st District is the most reliably Republican of the four counties.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates have carried all six counties in the 6th District for the last four presidential elections. The Republican winning streak in some of the counties stretches back for decades before that. Lake County, for instance, hasn’t supported a Democrat for president since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. Trump and Waltz performed best in Putnam County, where they both received about 74% of the vote.\n\nFlorida: Where to look for signs of a possible Democratic upset\n\nIf Democrats manage to pull off upsets in either the 1st or 6th districts, the first indications may be in their best performing counties.\n\nGiven the Republican advantage in both districts, the Democrats’ best areas are still places where Republicans performed well. In the 1st District, Trump and Gaetz did comparatively the worst in Escambia County, although they still received 59% and 57% of the county vote, respectively.\n\nIn the 6th District, Democrats may do best in Volusia County, where Trump received 58% and Waltz received about 60%. Republican presidential candidates have carried Volusia in the last four elections, but the area used to be more friendly territory for Democrats, who won the county for six consecutive elections from 1992 through 2008.","summary":"Elections in Florida and Wisconsin have become key tests of President Donald Trump’s political standing.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/04/01/wisconsin-florida-key-places/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wisconsin_Supreme_Court_64793.jpg?w=1024&h=768","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 17:00:54","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.06},{"id":306560372,"title":"The key places to watch in Tuesday’s elections in Wisconsin and Florida","text":"By ROBERT YOON\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Elections in Florida and Wisconsin have become key tests of President Donald Trump’s political standing two months into his second White House term.\n\nThe marquee race Tuesday is for a swing seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, a technically nonpartisan election that has drawn at least $90 million in spending.

Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk are backing conservative judge Brad Schimel while progressive billionaires and Democrats support liberal Susan Crawford.\n\nTwo Republican-friendly Florida congressional seats could give the GOP some breathing room in the narrowly divided chamber. But Democrats in both districts have far outraised their GOP counterparts, and national Republicans have been publicly concerned in particular about the race to replace Mike Waltz, now Trump’s national security adviser.\n\nHere are the places to watch as the vote results are reported on election night:\n\nWisconsin: How big will Democrats win in Milwaukee and Madison?\n\nIn any statewide election in Wisconsin, Democrats tend to win by large margins in the populous counties of Milwaukee and Dane (home of Madison). But the size of that win is usually a big factor in who wins statewide, especially in a close contest.\n\nIn 2024, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris carried Milwaukee with 68% of the vote and Dane with 75% while narrowly losing statewide. That same night, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin ran about 2 percentage points ahead of Harris in both counties and narrowly won reelection.\n\nIn 2023, the Democratic Party-backed Supreme Court candidate Janet Protasiewicz received 73% of the vote in Milwaukee and 82% of the vote in Dane and went on to win statewide by an 11-percentage-point margin.\n\nWisconsin: How big will Republicans win in the ‘WOW’ counties?\n\nRepublicans tend to do well in the suburban Milwaukee counties of Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha — the so-called “WOW” counties. A strong Republican showing in these counties can help counter the Democratic advantage in urban areas. Republican candidates have carried all three counties in every major statewide election going back to at least 2016.\n\nWisconsin: Who’s ahead in Green Bay?\n\nRepublican candidates tend to win Brown County, which is home to Green Bay, but not by huge blowouts. Trump carried the county in all three of his presidential campaigns with between 52% and 53% of the vote.\n\nBut since the 2016 election, there have been two Democrats who carried Brown County and went on to win statewide: Tony Evers in his bid for governor in 2018 and more recently Protasiewicz in her 2023 state Supreme Court race.\n\nA Democrat can still win statewide without winning Brown (such as Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, Evers’ reelection in 2022 and all three of Baldwin’s U.S. Senate runs). But if they do carry Brown, it’s probably going to be a rough night for Republicans.\n\nWisconsin: What’s the situation in Sauk?\n\nSauk County, northwest of Madison, is a competitive area in statewide elections that usually ends up supporting the Democratic candidate, albeit by slim margins. It falls somewhere in the middle of Wisconsin’s 72 counties in terms of population, and the margins are usually so small that statewide elections aren’t typically won or lost in Sauk.\n\nDemocrats or Democratic-backed candidates had a long winning streak in Sauk, having carried the county in eight of the last 10 major statewide elections. But the two exceptions are notable: Trump carried Sauk in 2016 and 2024, when he won Wisconsin and the White House.\n\nWhile Sauk won’t likely place a decisive role in Tuesday’s elections, a victory there by a Republican-backed candidate may be a good sign for the party statewide.\n\nFlorida: Voting history favors Republicans\n\nDemocrats are encouraged by the strong fundraising performances of their nominees to replace Waltz and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, but the special elections take place in two congressional districts that have long been safe Republican territory.\n\nTrump received about 68% of the vote in 2024 in the Florida Panhandle’s 1st Congressional District, slightly outperforming the 66% Gaetz received in his reelection bid. In the 6th Congressional District on the Atlantic coast, Trump received roughly 65% of the vote, just behind the 67% Waltz received in his final House reelection bid.\n\nThe four counties that make up the 1st District have voted for Republican presidential candidates almost continually for the past 60 years. Only Walton County went for a Democrat on one occasion since 1960, although all four voted for Democrat-turned-independent candidate George Wallace in 1968. Today, the part of Walton County that falls within the 1st District is the most reliably Republican of the four counties.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates have carried all six counties in the 6th District for the last four presidential elections. The Republican winning streak in some of the counties stretches back for decades before that. Lake County, for instance, hasn’t supported a Democrat for president since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. Trump and Waltz performed best in Putnam County, where they both received about 74% of the vote.\n\nFlorida: Where to look for signs of a possible Democratic upset\n\nIf Democrats manage to pull off upsets in either the 1st or 6th districts, the first indications may be in their best performing counties.\n\nGiven the Republican advantage in both districts, the Democrats’ best areas are still places where Republicans performed well. In the 1st District, Trump and Gaetz did comparatively the worst in Escambia County, although they still received 59% and 57% of the county vote, respectively.\n\nIn the 6th District, Democrats may do best in Volusia County, where Trump received 58% and Waltz received about 60%.

We all saw the sickening scenes with Zelensky in the White House. And at lightning speed, Trump has already enacted an estimated 42% of Project 2025.\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNow, the idea of a Trump third term isn’t a punchline anymore – it’s a plan. I’ve been in rooms with strategists, overheard campaign staff, and studied these unhinged proposals more than I care to admit.\n\n‘But how?’ I hear incredulous readers screaming.\n\nWell, the theory from right-wing voices is simple: yes, they concede, the Constitution lays out that no one shall be elected president more than twice. But it says nothing about succession.\n\nTrump, the theory goes, could run as vice president in 2028 – perhaps alongside his current VP, JD Vance. If they win, Vance could be sworn in as Commander-in-Chief and then resign, allowing Trump to assume the presidency through the line of succession.\n\nComment nowDo you believe that Trump could serve a third term?Comment Now\n\nThis isn’t a legal argument – or one that makes much sense. But in MAGA-land, grievance is disguised as logic.\n\nSteve Bannon – a former chief strategist to Trump who was convicted for defying a subpoena related to the January 6 Capitol riot investigation, and pled guilty to fraud – has floated the idea of ‘four more years after the next four.’ \n\nFormer advisors talk openly about Trump being ‘restored’. Republican lawmakers table bills to ‘repeal the 22nd.’ At Trump rallies, I’ve seen T-shirts printed with ‘Trump 2024. 2028. 2032.’\n\nMany assumed this was a reference to his children standing, or a joke. \n\nBut now, they are preparing for Trump to complete over a decade in the Oval Office. \n\n This is how democracies slip (Picture: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nTrump is surrounded by more loyalists and fewer checks and balances than ever before. The ‘grown-ups in the room’ (I use that term loosely) from his first term are long gone. This administration is stacked with MAGA loyalists who see constitutional norms as optional.\n\nIf they think they can force a third term – through lawsuits, executive orders, or sheer chaos – believe me, they will.\n\nThe movement isn’t trying to win on policy, governance, or compromise but through sheer brute force. They believe might is right and they’re high on power. Their plan isn’t to govern. It’s to outlast, outmaneuver, and outlive any opposition to its poisonous agenda.\n\nThis is how democracies slip: not always with tanks in the streets, but with technicalities, semantics, and very serious men in suits saying, ‘It’s actually more complicated than that.’\n\nIn Britain, we’ve been used to believing that America has institutions too sacred, a constitution too set in stone, to be broken. But opposition leaders in the US – especially those working to stop this – are under no such illusion.\n\n To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe courts are politicised. Congress is broken. State legislatures are in hock to Trump. A President who tried to overturn an election and incited an insurrection is not only not in jail – he’s been re-elected.\n\nWe need to stop treating the Trump third term as hypothetical. The groundwork is being laid right now. And from where I’m sitting – just like I predicted nationwide bans on abortion and betraying Ukraine at every turn – it’s terrifyingly plausible.\n\nFor those watching from abroad, don’t make the mistake of thinking this is America’s problem alone. We know what can happen when authoritarianism gathers pace.\n\nIn the UK, we aren’t powerless. \n\nRebuilding and strengthening our European alliances are essential in countering America’s democratic slip ‘n’ slide.\n\nSo the next time you hear talk of Trump’s third term, believe it. They’re not joking. They’re not testing the waters. They are planning for a third term.\n\nAnd if you think the Constitution will save America from it – well, you haven’t been paying attention.\n\nDo you have a story you’d like to share?

We know what is at stake. Our freedom and liberation is at stake, our freedom of speech is at stake, and so much more,” Tlaib added.\n\nRoughly 270 people joined the Zoom call, though it wasn’t immediately clear how many of them were Big Apple voters. \n\nTlaib, a member of the US House of Representative’s far-left “Squad” alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), is known for her disdain of her own party’s support for Israel.\n\nAs the only Palestinian-American in Congress, she has been openly supportive of Hamas during her time in office and has even been censured by colleagues for defending Hamas and calling for the destruction of Jewish state.\n\nDuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s address to Congress last spring, Tlaib was widely ripped for brandishing a sign accusing the Israeli leader of being a “war criminal” and “guilty of genocide.” \n\nShe also repeatedly berated then-President Joe Biden as an “enabler” over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war and even declined to endorse Kamala Harris as her party’s 2024 presidential pick. \n\nBranded by some Republicans as the “poster child” for Trump derangement syndrome, Tlaib most recently held up real-time signs during President Trump’s joint session of Congress last month declaring him a “liar.”\n\nMamdani, for his part, staunchly defended Tlaib in the wake of her public backing, telling The Post on Tuesday that “New Yorkers deserve a mayor who will stand up to the Trump administration.”\n\n“There are few who have fought back harder against this administration in its first term and now than Congresswoman Tlaib,” he said, adding “together we spoke about the importance of fighting back against Donald Trump’s billionaire backed assault on working people at every level.”\n\nDuring the call, Tlaib had praised Mamdani as a candidate who wasn’t “going to waver.”\n\n“Even if that title changes from state assembly to mayor, he is not going to sell out his community. He’s not gonna bow down like many others to this fascist regime,” she gushed. \n\n“I can go on and on about him… There’s something incredible, something beautiful about his own lived experience but also the fact that someone like Zohran has been successful in telling our story.”\n\nTlaib’s support for the firebrand mayoral candidate comes as recent polling showed his support rising in a crowded Democratic mayoral primary.\n\nOne recent survey had him as the clear second-place finisher behind ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo (41%) — with 18% of support. His campaign, too, is expected to hit the fundraising cap set by the city’s Campaign Finance Board amid a flurry of small-dollar contributions. \n\n— Additional reporting by Craig McCarthy","summary":"Radical anti-Israel “Squad” member Rashida Tlaib has rallied “comrades” to back democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani to become New York City’s next mayor.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/01/us-news/anti-israel-squad-member-rashida-tlaib-rallies-comrades-to-back-socialist-nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/101503893.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F9VSESdS-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-01 16:20:29","author":"Dorian Geiger,Emily Crane,Haley Brown","authors":["Dorian Geiger","Emily Crane","Haley Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":306612466,"title":"Erasing Lincoln","text":"President Trump stunned Nebraskans today with his demand that the state change the name of its capital, Lincoln, or lose federal funding.\n\n“Lincoln was the original DEI president,” Trump said on his site Truth Social. “Not only did he give racial preferences to former slaves in his land grab program of forty acres and a mule.

On April 1, the New York Times reported his intent to target the firm where Kamala Harris’ husband Dough Emhoff works.\n\nTransforming these tools of conducting government business into weapons deployed against of the state furthers the USA’s rapid descent into authoritarian governance.\n\nThe history of executive orders includes the good, bad and ugly. Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation—a precursor to modern-day executive orders—comes to mind as a good one, while Roosevelt’s infamous Executive Order 9066 that un-Constitutionally imprisoned American citizens on the basis of the ancestry is certainly a bad one. (Ugly ones, in particular, can be thought of as those subject to claims they came from Presidents overstepping their executive authority.) But while orders like the Emancipation Proclamation and 9066 targeted specific groups of people, past presidents have not used executive orders to target people they simply don’t like.\n\nMaybe because they know this, the Trump orders targeting law firms try to invoke national security and “national interests.” One focused on the firm Jenner & Block, whose crime in Trump’s view was having hired as a partner one of Robert Mueller’s top deputies from the Mueller investigation, attests how “Big Law” firms “engage in conduct detrimental to critical American interests” and “take actions that threaten public safety and national security.” These justifications lack credibility on their face, to be clear. But that doesn’t make them any less dangerous.\n\nThe fact that Trump is specifically focusing on “Big Law” is significant because it demonstrates his recognition of them as institutions that could pose a threat to his power. Then there’s the subjugation part. NYU law professor Stephen Gillers points out that Trump’s orders, “warn other law firms that they face the same punishment if they cross Trump.” (Journalist Sam Stein adds on X that they are likewise, “very much tied into the deportation regime. Those firms would likely take these cases as pro bono work.”) \n\nThe half-dozen targeted firms so far—Jenner & Block as well as Covington & Burling, Perkins Coie, Wilmer Hale, Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps—are all major entities with hundreds of lawyers and revenues that can be in the billions of dollars each year. With these kinds of resources, you might expect they would not be intimidated by the federal government. \n\nYou would be wrong.\n\nPaul Weiss quickly capitulated to Trump’s demands, disavowing “the use of diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in its hiring and promotion decisions,” and confirming it would “dedicate the equivalent of $40 million dollars in (pro bono) legal services to support Trump administration policies.” In return, Trump lifted the Executive Order against the firm.\n\nSkadden Arps soon bowed further still. Offering a perfect example of what Yale historian Timonthy Snyder refers to as “anticipatory obedience,” the firm offered $100 million dollars in free legal services to initiatives backed by the Trump administration. In a statement from its executive partner, Skadden Arps said it “looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Admin” and that the outcome “is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.” (Not quite all of them, though: One attorney’s subsequent resignation letter stated that, “if my employer cannot stand up for the rule of law, then I cannot continue to ethically work for them.”) \n\nIn sharp contrast, Perkins Coie, Wilmer Hale and Jenner & Block and have all fought back, with early successes in court. Federal judge Beryl Howell granted a temporary restraining order against Trump’s executive order targeting Perkins Coie, saying it “sends little chills down my spine.” Ruling on a case brought by Jenner & Block, Judge John Bates said the law firm had shown that the government likely was targeting them for the exercise of their First Amendment free speech rights and would suffer irreparable harm from the executive order. \n\nWhy some mega-rich law firms fight (and lick their wounds) while others lick the boot is a complex question. Some may face greater revenue peril from clients with federal contracts avoiding them. Whether a firm has a strong history and practice in defending clients against the government might also affect how they view going up against an authoritarian trending administration. \n\nNo doubt, super-rich lawyers can make many compelling arguments about why making a deal with Trump was the smart business move. And time may show that it was the more profitable move to make. But that kind of thinking is clear “capitalistic cowardice,” as an associate lawyer who tendered her conditional resignation from Skadden Arps even before the firm showed Trump its belly; a “fear for the bottom line of firms that already clear billions and billions of dollars a year in revenue.” \n\nMy first boxing trainer-—two-time world heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson—often spoke about cowardice and fear, remembering a quote imparted from a mentor of his own: ‘’Heroes and cowards feel exactly the same fear. Heroes just react to it differently.” So too with lawyers. The ones that stand up to the Trump administration feel the same fear about their livelihoods as those who bow down before him. The difference lies only in what they choose to do. \n\nIn the ring cowardice wounds only the fighter. But cowardice by lawyers—the very people best situated to defend the rule of law against Trump’s attacks—wounds us all.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyLike the spectacle that was his hawking Tesla cars on the White House front lawn, the use of executive orders and memorandums to attack individual businesses—and individuals—by name would have been unimaginable before the Trump era. \n\nBut that is exactly what President Donald Trump is trying to do, in recent days directing that numerous major law firms be prohibited from doing business with the federal government, and that lawyers from the firms lose their security clearances and be barred from entering federal buildings. \n\nThe directives range from vague claims that the firms use their pro bono practices “for destructive causes” and otherwise engage in “partisan ‘lawfare’” to remarkably specific insults against specific lawyers who are singled out by name for actions like having worked on the Mueller investigation.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, said in a video last week that it could be a strong way to get people and businesses that left in the wake of the pandemic and high costs in the state to return. \"What a better way to bring all of my friends back, bring all the businesses back that have left to eliminate California income tax. Other states have done it. There's nine states that don’t have a state income tax. So why does the greatest state in the country have an income tax?\" he asked. BLUE STATE SHERIFF ISSUES STARK WARNING FOR ACTIVISTS WHO DEFY ICE, RIPS MEDIA ‘FEAR MONGERING’ \"I believe that our hard workers in California could spend their money far better than our current government,\" the sheriff continued. There is a national conversation underway about tax reform, as nationwide cuts are anticipated under the Trump administration and Republican Congress. Additionally, Mississippi just passed a law that will completely eliminate their income tax in the coming years, and Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte is supporting state legislation to cut taxes in his state further. The California legislature currently has a Democratic supermajority, meaning that Bianco could have an uphill battle with his proposal.

Regarding the gas tax, many have called for a holiday to provide temporary relief for drivers in the Golden State. Tennessee, Florida, South Dakota, New Hampshire, Nevada, Wyoming, Alaska, Washington and Texas do not have an individual income tax. \"So, as your governor, we will work immediately on eliminating California income tax for all of Californians,\" the sheriff said, adding that he plans to announce more details at a later date on the execution of the proposal. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is not able to run for re-election in 2026, which is fueling speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. While the state is largely considered deep blue, a recent poll provided some silver linings for Republicans.

The Democratic Party leadership was engaged in an extensive effort to hide former President Joe Biden’s signs of ageing, at the same time devising a contingency plan for his sudden death, The Hill senior political correspondent Amie Parnes and NBC News senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen wrote in a new book.\n\nThe excerpt from \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" released to The Hill, says the Democrats started to raise concerns about Biden’s health back in April 2023, when the then president announced plans to run for re-election. Up until his disastrous performance during the election debates with Republican candidate Donald Trump and the subsequent decision to withdraw from the presidential race, senior party officials worked to mask the physical signs of Biden’s ageing from the general public, but expressed concern about the president's physical and mental abilities behind closed doors.\n\nA makeup artist met with Biden in the morning when he traveled, or before Zoom calls with his aides, the authors say. Also, the former president needed a teleprompter to speak to just a small group of people. Meanwhile, plans started to come together behind the scenes in 2023 to prepare for the event that another candidate needed to take over from Biden should he not seek reelection or die.\n\nAn aide to former Vice President Kamala Harris carried a spreadsheet of Republican federal judges Trump hadn’t appointed, so if Harris needed to be sworn in on short notice, it could be from someone seen as more credible to Republicans, The Hill writes.\n\nAt the same time, despite widespread concerns about Biden’s health, his closest allies and his wife insisted on seeking re-election and assured other Democrats of his ability to perform presidential duties even after the failed debate with Trump in June 2024. One friend of Biden and former President Obama called the choice for Biden to seek reelection the \"original sin\" of the 2024 election, putting the blame on the president’s family and close aides for not advising him to forgo a reelection bid, The Hill said.\n\nOn November 5, 2024, Republican Donald Trump won the US presidential election, defeating Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris, who was serving as US vice president at the time.

The Hill published a report on Monday based on excerpts from the new book. The reporters revealed that the former president's team had put extensive precautions in place to hide Biden's decline and had several plans in place if the president died while in office or if he chose to step aside, according to The Hill. BIDEN INSIDER EXPRESSES HOW WHITE HOUSE ‘GASLIT’ THE PUBLIC ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT'S DECLINE Allen and Parnes reported in their book that Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., was worried about Biden's decline in June 2023, after speaking to the president at a White House event. The authors revealed that Biden did not immediately recognize Swalwell, according to the report, and that the California Democrat needed to remind the former president of who he was with personal details. Allen and Parnes also reported that the president met with a makeup artist every morning, prior to travel and before calls with his aides, to cover up visible signs of aging. The president also occasionally canceled the briefings that followed his makeup appointments, according to the book.

But privately, including in conversations with her, he repeated an admonition: let there be no daylight between us,\" the authors wrote. \"But the day of the debate Biden called to give Harris an unusual kind of pep talk — and another reminder about the loyalty he demanded. No longer able to defend his own record, he expected Harris to protect his legacy,\" Allen and Parnes continued. \"Whether she won or lost the election, he thought, she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him — especially during a debate that would be watched by millions of Americans.

Walz, who has been holding rallies across Republican districts nationwide, spoke to New York Magazine’s Intelligencer on Monday about what he’s learned since the 2024 election. Overall, he felt Harris and the campaign weren’t \"bold\" enough and likely too cautious during the election because of the limited amount of time. He used himself as an example by explaining how he warned Harris about his own shortcomings ahead of campaigning. \"I think we’re cautious by nature,\" Walz said. \"And look, I said this, and I told the vice president, I said I know my strengths and weaknesses.

Within the interview itself, Intelligencer politics reporter Daniel Strauss had to issue a correction to one of Walz’s comments after he appeared to claim President Donald Trump advocated for \"terrorists.\" \"Critics keep saying, ‘Well, you’ve got to message better to them.’ Well, I’m not going to demonize immigrants, and I’m not going to advocate for terrorists [after the interview, a spokesman said Walz was referring to defending Vladimir Putin and foreign dictators], and I’m not going to do a White-power thing.

And, what with devils being immortal and all, it looks as if they might stay there indefinitely. Now, before I seamlessly segue from fun devil facts into talking about Donald Trump threatening to run for a third term, the current political climate compels me to make a few things clear. I recently had to submit my US green card for renewal (impeccable timing!) so I’d like to explain to any United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers reviewing my file that the first line of this piece was just riffing on Shakespeare. I’m absolutely not comparing Trump, the greatest man to walk this Earth, to Satan. Nor am I suggesting evil people seem to live long lives.\n\nOn the contrary, I am thrilled that our 78-year-old president has suggested he is looking into “methods” that will allow him to serve this wonderful country longer. And it’s a shame my enthusiasm isn’t universally shared. I mean, to quote JD Vance (who is up there next to Shakespeare in the words department), have any Trump detractors SAID THANK YOU ONCE? Trump could be relaxing with his billions; he could be playing golf every day. Instead, the poor man only gets to play golf every few days – costing taxpayers millions of dollars – and has to spend most of his time sorting out the US. The economy doesn’t just crash itself, you know? So thank you, Mr President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nBut, look, while I’m obviously overjoyed by the idea that our esteemed leader might stick around far longer than norms, conventions and the constitution allow, just how realistic a prospect is Trump 3.0? The president has insisted he is “not joking” about seeking a third term in office, but is all this talk just a tactic to distract us from what he is getting up to in his current term?\n\nObviously, I can’t tell you what goes on in the murky depths of Trump’s mind. But I can tell you this: Trump has no regard for norms or laws, and will do whatever he wants if he thinks he can get away with it.\n\nPerhaps the better question to ask isn’t whether Trump is serious about extending his rule, but – should he seek a third term – who might stop him? Unless they all get spine transplants, the Democrats aren’t going to put up a fight. Want to know what Kamala Harris is doing now? Getting ready to speak at a real estate conference in Australia. It’s obviously not Harris’s job to safeguard US democracy but, after raising enormous amounts of money from regular people who believed in her campaign promises, you would think she might care a little more about the optics.\n\nAs for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader – the person whose job it actually is to represent the opposition – his strategy for dealing with Trump appears to be to give Republicans whatever they want and hope that, somehow, this turns out badly for them. It’s not surprising then, that a recent survey showed 70% of Democratic voters gave the party’s response to Trump a “C” grade or below.\n\nIt is not just the Democrats who appear to have capitulated to Trump: a number of big legal firms have also bowed down to the president’s efforts to get them to comply with his interpretation of the law. Elite universities such as Columbia University have also caved in to Trump’s demands. Even the White House Correspondents’ Association just cancelled an appearance by an anti-Trump comedian in an attempt to stay on the president’s good side. And, as we all know, Silicon Valley has been bending the knee to Trump for months.\n\nMeanwhile, as any opposition to Trump seems to evaporate, Elon Musk is running around handing out checks to voters in Wisconsin in what many critics have characterised as an attempt to influence the state’s supreme court election. Even if Trump doesn’t go for a third term, even if the Democrats win the next election, the US’s descent into techno-authoritarianism isn’t going to be easily reversed. Not, to be clear to any USCIS officers reading this, that I’m complaining. Not little old me! I’m renaming my daughter Donalda, getting a Tesla tattoo, and cheering as all my rights are systematically taken away.","summary":"So many people and organisations are capitulating to the US president, from Silicon Valley to the Democrats, legal firms and elite universities.

Did anyone doubt that Trump would act on his anger and his resentment, and then follow through executing the detailed plans laid out in Project 2025? Did anyone believe he would turn the other cheek at those who tried to impeach him and send him to jail? Surely every single elected Democrat knew that Trump’s election would be a disaster for everything the party claimed to stand for. \n\nNevertheless, the Democrats handed Trump the election on a bitcoin-plated platter. They stuck with Biden—make that sucked up to Biden—until it was too late to run primaries and find the strongest Democratic candidate. (I’m not saying Kamala Harris necessarily was the weakest one, but four years earlier she flunked out before the first presidential primary. Just saying.)\n\nWhy the hell did they do that?\n\nI’m no political genius, but nearing Biden’s 81st birthday, in November of 2023, I begged him not to run again. It was clear to me, based on polling, his lack of energy, and my own intuition, that he had no business running again. \n\nI was alone, but not entirely so. Obama’s campaign maestro, David Axelrod was pounded for suggesting Biden wasn’t the best candidate. That so successfully quelled any dissent that it wasn’t until six months later (July 2, 2024) that Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) became the first sitting Democratic congressman to ask Biden to withdraw. Profiles in courage, the Democrats were not, including all the governors lining up for 2028. \n\nIf I could see the trainwreck coming why couldn’t the Democrats? \n\nI think I know why. They didn’t get upset about it because they were blinded by power and wealth. \n\nBiden represented power. You cross him and you lose access to that power even while his grip on reality is diminishing. You become a target for party loyalists, and risk losing credibility in the party if you call for him to step down. You become an outsider. Even Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) didn’t want to lose their influence over Biden’s pro-worker agenda as they continued to support his candidacy until the bitter end. \n\nThe Democrats today are imploding, and that’s exactly what they deserve. They blew it.\n\nThe attraction to wealth is an even bigger problem. Far too many Democrats are enamored by the rich and famous. They went to school with them. They lean on them for campaign funds. They plan to join them when they leave public office. The wizards on Wall Street and in corporate America form the class they see themselves as part of, or in the class they aspire to. \n\nIt is not a coincidence, therefore, that the Democratic Party has become the representatives of the managerial class. Too many party members with working-class roots tore them out long ago. \n\nMany probably discounted their worries about Trump, thinking that the rich and powerful would tame him. Because that’s where the Democratic Party thinks real power lies. The financial class wouldn’t let Trump wreck the economy, would it? Surely, the corporate class wouldn’t back down on DEI programs or forgo their access to inexpensive immigrant labor. The wealthiest Democratic law firms aren’t going to cave, right? Wouldn’t the elites prevent Trump’s excesses the way they did last time? Hmmm.\n\nAlong the way, most Democrats lost their anger. They lost their fight. They lost their connection to the working people who have seen their way of life crushed after 40 years of neoliberalism. Which is why many modern Democrats found it easy to cavalierly go along with the worst political decision since Nixon taped himself committing crimes during the Watergate scandal. (Please see Wall Street’s War on Workers for why working people abandoned the Democrats, and visa vera.) \n\nAlong the way, most Democrats lost their anger. They lost their fight. They lost their connection to the working people who have seen their way of life crushed after 40 years of neoliberalism.\n\nBiden clearly did not have the capacity to run again. The Democrats knew that even before he proved it to the world during his disastrous June 2024 debate with Trump. But they didn’t care enough to oppose his decision, publicly, where it would matter. He told his advisors during the 2020 race that he wouldn’t run for a second term, he would be 82 years old by his second inauguration, but the party refused to hold him to it when he changed his mind. \n\nThe Democrats today are imploding, and that’s exactly what they deserve. They blew it. They can’t be reformed into a working-class party, because that’s not who they are or what they want to be. From my perspective, reforming them is an utter waste of time and energy, an exercise in window dressing and spin. Instead, we need a new party, an Independence Party that comes with the slogan: The billionaires have two parties, we need one of our own!\n\nStop with the Spoiler Argument\n\nAll I hear from friend and foe is that third parties are impossible in America, that they only serve as spoilers and can never succeed. \n\nRalph Nader’s run, they tell me, elected Bush. We can argue about whether that’s true, it might be, but there’s very little argument against the idea that Biden’s run in 2024 elected Trump—for the second time! \n\nSo, we start with identifiable targets. There is nothing to spoil if we concentrate on running independent working-class candidates in one-party Congressional districts of which there are many! \n\nIn 2022, five out of every six races were decided by more than 10 percentage points, according to FairVote.org. One out of every 13 races went entirely uncontested! These districts are where the battle should be joined. The call for a new Independence Party is a call for a vibrant second party, not a third!\n\nDan Osborn, a former local labor leader, was surprisingly competitive in the 2024 Senate race in Nebraska, running against an unopposed Republican and far ahead of Kamala Harris. Bernie Sanders always runs as an independent as well, and he has now come out urging others to do the same. \n\nThe need for a new party could never be clearer. The time could never be more urgent.\n\nThere’s a hunger out there for something new, but it will take courage and guts to create it. That can only happen when key labor unions decide to do what their membership has been telling them to do for a generation – get away from the corporate Democrats! \n\nPrivate sector unions, diminished as they may be, are still the seat of worker power in the U.S. And they can galvanize the working class around an agenda that enhances the well-being of all working people. They are key to building a new political formation that protects us all from Wall Street-driven job destruction.\n\nThe need for a new party could never be clearer. The time could never be more urgent. The opportunity is there staring us in the face, if only we have the nerve to grab it. \n\nNOW READ: Stadium heist: Inside the plan to give a $500 million handout to a billionaire","summary":"Each day the Democrats are outraged about another outrage coming from Trump and his enablers—stomping on immigrants, undermining the courts, attacking Canada, claiming Ukraine started the war, violating campus free speech, destroying the EPA, firing forest rangers—and on and on and on.\n\nBut why the surprise?

But things have gotten a bit awkward, as Mr President apparently was not on Bezos’ mind when planning the guest list. In recent times, Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos have become quite cordial but Trump’s missing name has taken the internet by the storm, as per Daily Mail.\n\nEven though their guest list is far from exhaustive, Donald Trump was noticeably not mentioned among the several public figures who reportedly received an invitation.

For example, Katy Perry campaigned for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election about 7 years after she used her 2017 Brit Awards performance to seemingly criticize the then-president.\n\nCelebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Leonardo DiCaprio have also been invited. Even Oprah Winfrey endorsed Kamala Harris for president and has been outspoken and critical about Trump over the years.\n\nOnline spectators are now of the view that Trump and Bezos’s friendship might not be what it seems like. As recent events prove that they may not be quite as chummy as they want people to believe.\n\nBefore dishing out a massive Trump snub with Lauren and Jeff’s wedding invitation, it seemed that Bezos and Trump were political allies. In addition to blocking his newspaper, The Washington Post, from endorsing 2024 presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, Bezos expressed some direct support for his fellow billionaire. “I’m actually very optimistic this time around,” Bezos told The New York Times about Trump in November 2024.\n\nJeff Bezos & Lauren Sanchez’s wedding guest list: Kushners, Kardashians & Oprah https://t.co/JUvLMVh2yB pic.twitter.com/PCFduTAihC\n— celebitchy (@celebitchy) March 27, 2025\n\n“He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help do that, I’m going to help him.” Bezos also implied that Trump was a changed man, at least regarding his disdain for the media. “You’ve probably grown in the last eight years,” he said. “He has, too. This is not the case. The press is not the enemy.”\n\nRoughly four months later, Trump proved that Bezos’ supportive commentary had paid off, as he returned the favor with positive words of his own. “I find it to be that the media hasn’t changed that much,” Trump said in March (via The Hill). “I think a guy like Bezos is — I’ve gotten to know him, and I think he’s trying to do a real job. Jeff Bezos is trying to do a real job with The Washington Post,” he added.\n\nIt’s a no-brainer that Bezos’ wedding invitation list will impact their bond in some way or another.

The Democrat is reportedly eyeing a third term following confirmation in February that he would not run for his state's open Senate seat in 2026.What To KnowOn a recent episode of The Mike Lindell Show, which airs on Lindell TV, the MyPillow CEO said: \"I live here in Minnesota. Everywhere I go, nobody wants Tim Walz.\"He said he was doing \"due diligence\" as he considered entering the race and teased \"bigger announcements\" to come.Walz comfortably won Minnesota's gubernatorial elections in 2018 and 2022, and according to RealClearPolitics polling, he has a 42.5 percent favorability rating.Prior to becoming governor, Walz served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2007 to 2019. Last year, he gained a national profile after then-Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as her running mate in November's election.Lindell became a vocal Trump supporter in 2016 and rose to prominence in the MAGA movement while arguing that the 2020 election was rigged against the president.In 2024, he was ordered to pay $5 million to computer forensics expert Robert Zeidman after making a public pledge to pay that sum to anyone who could disprove his claim that the 2020 election was rigged in Joe Biden's favor.What People Are SayingMike Lindell said on Lindell TV: \"Right now we have a voice that could be big enough, where when I do my due diligence—and we're gonna do polling. We're gonna get a couple of different polls to be taken. We're gonna be doing all kinds of due diligence. I'm just checking into all this now.\"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on January 1: \"Happy New Year, Minnesota! More grateful than ever to have the privilege of serving this great state. Looking forward to the work ahead in making Minnesota the best place to live, work, and raise a family.\"What Happens NextThe next Minnesota gubernatorial election is scheduled to take place on November 3, 2026.Do you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

Waltz won reelection in November 2024 by 33 points, and Trump defeated then Vice President Kamala Harris in the district by 30 points.The few polls available on the race suggest Fine may significantly underperform Tuesday, or that Weil could even pull off a surprise victory.A poll released March 26 showed Fine, a Trump-endorsed firebrand, with a 4-point lead over Weil (48 percent to 44)—well below the 33-point margin Waltz achieved just five months ago.The Florida Politics survey, conducted by St. Pete Polls, of 403 likely voters in the 6th District was conducted March 22 and has a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points, more than Fine's lead.Elsewhere, an internal poll conducted in late March by Trump-aligned polling firm Fabrizio Ward showed Weil leading Fine by 3 points (44 percent to 41 percent), with 10 percent undecided, according to Politico.A previous February poll from Fabrizio Ward had shown Weil trailing Fine by 12 points, reported GZERO Media.Several Republican figures have voiced concerns that Fine will underperform in Tuesday's race, potentially giving Democrats a much-needed post-2024 elections boost.At a recent press conference, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said if Fine fails to achieve something like a 30-point victory margin, it would be a \"candidate-specific issue\" rather than a reflection of voter backlash against Trump or the GOP.Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters on March 24 that Fine \"needs to do better\" with regards to fundraising.Weil is reported to have raised $10 million for his congressional bid—more than 10 times as much as Fine. Federal Election Commission filings in mid-March showed Weil had more than $1.2 million in cash on hand, compared to Fine's $92,600.Fine has dismissed concerns about his campaign, telling Politico it's \"going fine,\" and adding, \"I wish the Democrats weren't lighting $10 million on fire.\" A spokesperson for Fine's campaign previously told Newsweek the Republican will be \"victorious\" on Tuesday.Early voting in the 6th District special election, which closed on Friday, is plus 9 Republican, according to data from the Florida Division of Elections.More Republican voters typically cast their ballots on Election Day, suggesting Fine's actual margin of victory could be greater.What People Are SayingRandy Fine campaign spokesperson Bryan Piligra previously told Newsweek: \"The only thing that matters is making sure Republicans are united to defeat radical Democrats like Josh Weil, who will stop at nothing to destroy President Trump. When Randy is victorious on April 1, it will be because of the strength of the Trump agenda and the faith the American people have in him. Randy is grateful for the president's unwavering confidence in him. The voters of CD 6 know they can count on Randy to fight fiercely alongside President Trump to Make America Great Again.\"Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried told Newsweek on Monday: \"These special elections aren't just important races for Floridians; they are important for all Americans. If Florida Democrats continue the national trend and overperform on Tuesday, any Republican in a close seat should be scared about their reelection chances in 2026. Any blue wave in the next few cycles has to start in the South.\"Scott Tranter, director of data science at Decision Desk HQ, told The Hill: \"Given GOP voters tend to turn out more on Election Day, we expect the electorate to settle in the R+14 range once all the [6th District] votes are counted Tuesday. All that being said, we have seen special elections recently where the Democratic candidate has overcome R+15 electorates. That's why this race remains close in a district President Trump won handily in 2024.\"What Happens NextResults for Florida's 6th District special election are expected to be announced Tuesday night.Another special election takes place Tuesday in the GOP-friendly 1st Congressional District, where Republican candidate and Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis faces off against Democratic hopeful Gay Valimont.","summary":"The Republican candidate is running for the seat that National Security Adviser Michael Waltz won by 33 points in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/randy-fine-chances-losing-special-election-florida-6th-polls-2053474","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2618501/randy-fine-florida.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 11:38:25","author":"Ewan Palmer","authors":["Ewan Palmer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":306452480,"title":"Sen.

CNN host Dana Bash asked Coons on Monday’s \"Inside Politics\" about what the Democratic Party’s focus needs to be against Trump as he enacts several policies on issues like immigration enforcement and foreign tariffs. The Delaware senator said the primary focus should be \"making America affordable again,\" arguing that Democrats lost to Trump because of Americans choosing not to vote and their failure to reach them.

But Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, complained that \"her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better.\" As Trump saw it, that was \"A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal.\"\n\nHow so? According to a lawsuit that Trump filed against CBS in the U.S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Texas on October 31, editing the Harris interview to make her seem slightly more cogent violated that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act and caused Trump \"at least\" $10 billion in damages. A lawsuit that Trump filed against The Des Moines Register on December 16 follows the same playbook, claiming the newspaper's coverage of an inaccurate presidential poll violated a similar Iowa law.\n\nIn both cases, Trump—the man now elected president—implausibly describes news reporting as \"election interference\" that constitutes consumer fraud because it misleads\nviewers or readers. It is hard to overstate the threat to freedom of the press posed by such reasoning, which transforms journalism that irks Trump into a tort justifying massive damage awards.\n\nAlthough neither lawsuit is likely to make much headway, the cost of defending against such litigation is apt to have a chilling effect on journalism, which is what Trump wants. \"We have to straighten out the press,\" he told reporters, explaining his motivation for suing CBS and the Register.\n\nThe lead defendant in the latter case is pollster J. Ann Selzer, who conducted a preelection voter survey for the Register that indicated Harris had a small lead over Trump in Iowa. According to that poll, which was released on the Saturday before the election, 47 percent of Iowa voters favored Harris, compared to 44 percent for Trump. Those results proved to be off by more than a little: Trump won Iowa by a 13-point margin.\n\nTrump was outraged by the poll. \"It's called suppression,\" he said at a rally in Pennsylvania the day after the Register reported that Harris had taken the lead in Iowa. \"And it actually should be illegal.\"\n\nIn fact, it was illegal, Trump's lawsuit argues. It says publication of the erroneous poll's surprising results, which generated wide news coverage, amounted to \"brazen election interference\" that violated Iowa's Consumer Fraud Act.\n\nTrump's use of that law, like his use of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, is plainly frivolous. Both laws are aimed at fraud that harms consumers by misleading them in connection with their purchases of products or services.\n\n\"You would have to prove that a false statement was made and that the statement was made\" with the intent that consumers\nwould \"rely on it,\" UCLA law professor Rick Hasen told The Washington Post. \"If someone is accurately reporting the results of a poll, that wouldn't be a false statement. The poll might have errors in it, but that wouldn't be a false statement.\" Hasen added that the lawsuit's \"somersaults\" do not plausibly connect Trump's complaints to the sort of commercial misrepresentations that the fraud statute covers.\n\nWhy bother then? \"I'm doing this not because I want to,\" Trump told reporters.\n\"I'm doing this because I feel I have an obligation to…..I shouldn't really be the one to do it. It should have been the Justice Department or somebody else. But I have to do it [because] our press is very corrupt.\"\n\nAs Trump sees it, the U.S. Department of Justice should be policing the press to make sure it is telling the truth. Exactly how that would work is unclear: What\nstatutes, specifically, would authorize the Justice Department to sue or prosecute news outlets for reporting that Trump views as inaccurate or unfair?\n\nMore to the point, any such action would be clearly unconstitutional. But Trump thinks he can achieve similar results by filing his own lawsuits.\n\n\"Newspapers and polling firms are not engaged in 'deceptive practices' just because they publish stories and poll results Trump doesn't like,\" said Robert Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which is representing Selzer pro bono, in a statement. \"Getting a poll wrong is not election interference or fraud.\" Corn-Revere called the \"absurd\" lawsuit \"a direct assault on the First Amendment.\"","summary":"The president is arguing in court that journalism he doesn't like is \"election interference\" that constitutes consumer fraud.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/04/01/trumps-war-on-the-press/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/02/topicslaw.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 11:00:14","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.656},{"id":306450624,"title":"Florida goes national","text":"In 2024 Florida gained nearly half a million residents, 88% of them through net international migration; it was struck by five major hurricanes; and its politicians departed for the Trump White House. Its 1,200km western coastline of stunning white sandy beaches makes up half of the US portion of the recently rebranded Gulf of America. ‘Make America Florida’, the slogan of the failed presidential campaign of its famously anti-woke governor Ron DeSantis, did not quite triumph. However, through the migration of most of the rest of Florida’s political establishment to the White House, Florida is remaking America.\n\nElection night in Florida surprised no one. The national Democratic party did not even bother putting up a fight. Ceding the state to the Republicans, it left its local members to show largely symbolic resistance. The results came in fast. Kamala Harris yard signs had predominated in my surprisingly walkable, if architecturally uninspired, lakefront neighbourhood in Orlando. Espousing 2000s-era new urbanism, it unites high densities of housing, retail and neoclassical columns. That evening, Harris signs were taken down as promptly as her ill-starred candidacy had been christened.\n\nElsewhere in the country, though, there was a revelation in the early hours of the night: the Florida results were no swampy aberration but a reflection of national patterns. Repudiating Obama-era visions of ‘demographic destiny’ – that Democrats would inevitably gain from the country’s growing racial and ethnic diversity – the party lost ground almost everywhere.\n\nDonald Trump won among non-white men under 24, and journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson suggest that as much as half of the swing to Trump between 2020 and 2024 can be attributed to naturalised citizens, a demographic he also won. Reeling from defeat, Democrats confronted a destiny they had refused to countenance: a future in which the US becomes like Florida.\n\nWhere is the American left?","summary":"The Sunshine State was long a swing state, but not any more.
