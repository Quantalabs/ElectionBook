The actress has been left 'fearing' for her career, and appears to be lying low with her popstar bestie at her $17m home in Rhode Island Exclusive DailyMail.com pictures show Lively with her arms around husband Ryan, who donned a cap and a backpack The blonde was seen frowning into the sunshine, dressed in floral shorts and a coral bikini top, with her long tresses up in a bun Blake, for her part, has been slammed for using her alcohol brand to promote the film , which focuses heavily on domestic abuse Cooper cut a relaxed figure in a black t-shirt and shorts as he headed down to Swift’s pool with the kids, rubbing shoulders with Patrick Mahomes, his wife Brittany. The youngsters giggled and laughed as they jumped into the pool – hidden from public view – as their famous parents dipped in an out of the house while soaking up the sunshine. Blake, for her part, has been slammed for using her alcohol brand to promote the film , which focuses heavily on domestic abuse, and for the way she appeared to make light of serious questions about the themes during interviews. Blake was furiously slammed online last week after a reporter asked her if people who related to what her character went through could talk to her about it if they saw her in person - and she replied with a sarcastic quip. 'If someone understands the themes of this movie and comes across you in public and they want to really talk to you, what's the best way for them to be able to talk to you about this? How would you recommend they go about it?' asked the interviewer. She sarcastically responded: 'Ask for my address or my phone number.' 'Or I could just share my location with you and then we could...,' she trailed off before laughing. The star was also blasted online after she hosted an interview with her It Ends With Us costars Jenny Slate and Isabela Ferrer, as well as author Colleen, and failed to discuss the topic. The four women giggled together as they chatted about everything from their dream jobs to their zodiac signs, but there was no mention of domestic violence during their talk. Social media users were quick to criticize them - particularly Blake, who hosted the interview - for partaking in the lighthearted questionnaire given the serious nature of the film. Several hours later, Blake took to Instagram to share information about domestic violence, as well as some resources for her followers. Amid the controversy, a journalist resurfaced an 'uncomfortable' interview that she had with Blake in 2016, which further increased the fury.

After the moment went viral, Kjersti, 51, told DailyMail.com exclusively that Blake's response was especially hurtful because she cannot conceive. Taylor was seen back in the US for the first time since finishing the European leg of her Era’s Tour, spending some quality time with her Kasnas City Chief’s beau before the NFL season started up again. The power couple have reunited for an end-of-summer getaway - this time seen today on the balcony of the singer's epic Rhode Island mansion. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor's legendary star-studded Independence Day parties. The pop superstar, however, was forced to skip the festivities this year thanks to her 51-date tour across Europe which wrapped up on Tuesday. But Taylor has returned to her iconic holiday house for the first time this summer - now with her beau in tow. And it looks like their friends and family - including Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes - joined them. Blake has also been bashed for repeatedly referring to transgender people as 'trannies' in old interviews Travis Kelce (R) and Taylor Swift (C) sit with Patrick Mahomes on the mansion's balcony The loved-up couple were seen chatting to Sterling - Patrick and Brittany's three-year-old daughter Travis' brother and sister-in-law were also in attendance. Pictured is Kylie and her daughter Swift and Kelce - pictured in March - are reunited during her tour hiatus at her famous Rhode Island mansion Locals and fans were quick to realize the pop sensation had returned after dozens of armed guards were spotted along the perimeter of the property. Taylor's security shooed fans dying for a glimpse of The Eras Tour star away, but not before they snapped a selfie on her driveway. One group even went up to the guards offering them $50 to catch a glimpse of the star and her beau. Taylor and Travis were accompanied by Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, enjoying the sunshine ahead of the season - with the quarterback and tight end enduring a difficult pre-season with three straight losses. Kylie and Jason joined the all-star Chiefs line up with their children, as the latter continues to enjoy his first offseason after retirement, and ahead of his new TV role with Amazon Prime, starting next month. In 2012, Blake and Ryan Reynolds became spouses in such secrecy that their marriage stunned Hollywood Blake was previously slammed for the way she answered an interview question about domestic violence, which is heavily covered in the film Lively appeared to acknowledge the criticism Tuesday by publishing a statement to her Instagram Story along with a violence against women PSA The star, seen here appears as Lily Bloom in It Ends With Us follows Lily Bloom as she finds herself in an abusive relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, Justin Baldoni The presence of Brittany comes at a potentially-difficult time, just hours after she liked a Donald Trump post on social media, sparking huge backlash. While Taylor has not publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November's election, she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Fans had speculated over whether Brittany's apparent Trump endorsement might cause a rift in their friendship, but her attendance at the Rhode Island festivities appears to signal that won't be the case. Taylor seems to be letting her hair down after missing out on her annual July 4 bash because she was on tour, with sold-out dates across Europe. The lovebirds, who began dating just about a year ago, have spent much of their time jetting off to see one another amid their busy schedules since the start of their romance. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor's legendary star-studded Independence Day parties Their turn next? Patrick, Taylor and Travis crowd around Sterling on the Rhode Island balcony The trio laughed as they chatted away during their vacation ahead of the new NFL season Mahomes could later be seen holding son Bronze, one, as he checked his phone The Chiefs quarterback and wife Brittany welcomed their son back in November 2022 They have previously shacked up at each other's various pads across the country, but it is believed to be Travis's first time at his girlfriend's Watch Hill manse. As reported by DailyMail.com at the time, they spent a week together during the pop icon's last tour hiatus which coincided with the NFL off-season in March. The two enjoyed quality time together at her home base in Beverly Hills after a whirlwind few months of jet-setting and international rendezvous as a long distance couple. Swift was reported to have purchased the Colonial-style mansion, also known as High Watch, with cash back in 2013. Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state. With an expansive backyard and massive swimming pool overlooking the ocean, the pad makes for the perfect summer home. And Kelce wouldn't be the first boyfriend to visit the iconic residence. The Reputation hitmaker has been snapped over the years at the home canoodling with her former flames such as exes Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston. The couple are seen here seconds before sharing a kiss seemingly after Reynolds arrived at the property The Gossip Girl and her husband shared a smooch while enjoying. aSummer getaway at Swift's beach house It Ends With Us hit theatres last Friday — competing with Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds' superhero flick Deadpool & Wolverine at the box office Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state The Reputation hitmaker has previously been snapped at the home over the years canoodling with her former flames such as ex Calvin Harris (pictured in 2015) In 2016, She was seen getting cozy with then-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston in a cute couples photo with best friend Blake Lively and husband Ryan Reynolds In a follow-up post on her Instagram Story, Lively shared statistics relating to domestic violence in the United States and provided fans with a link to the National Domestic Violence Hotline And now the it-couple are likely eager to soak up the last few weeks of summer together at the mansion before the NFL tight end heads back to Kansas City for the start of the season next month. Sources tell DailyMail.com Swift landed back in the US on Wednesday, while Kelce, who has been playing in pre-season games, arrived in Rhode Island on Friday. Kelce had been seen being every inch the supportive boyfriend throughout his girlfriend's European tour earlier this summer, making appearances in Dublin, Paris, London, and Amsterdam. He attended his last concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany where he was seen hugging the popstar at the end of her set in July before reporting to Chiefs training camp in Kansas City. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday. He is set to return to the field on September 5 for the first official game of the NFL season. Rumors of tensions brewing between Justin Baldoni - who on top of starring in it also directed and served as one of the producers for the film - and Lively have been swirling for weeks A source told DailyMail.com recently that Blake and Justin allegedly clashed over his 'dismissive' attitude to her 'input' while they were filming scenes that involved abuse The NFL player became a regular fixture at his girlfriend's European concerts over the summer, and was seen hugging the pop star at the end of her show in Germany in July - his last before reporting back to training camp in Kansas City Kelce had continued his tour of Europe by flying to Amsterdam to watch Taylor Swift Travis Kelce stunned the crowd at Wembley by appearing on stage with girlfriend Taylor Swift in June Taylor, meanwhile, will enjoy a nice two-month break before embarking on the last leg of her Eras Tour in Miami in mid-October. And it is likely she will return the favor and support her man at his games during her hiatus. While he may have been busy training for another exciting run on the field, he still has time for romantic gestures. Earlier this week the football star was reported to have splashed out over $30,000 on flowers for Taylor to congratulate her on the end of the European leg of her Eras Tour. According to The Sun, Kelce ordered a huge 51 boxes of red roses that greeted his girlfriend when she returned to the US. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday It is likely Taylor will return the favor and support her man at his games during her tour hiatus from now to October The singer returned to London's Wembley Stadium for five performances of her smash-hit tour following the cancellation of shows in Vienna, when a planned terrorist attack was foiled by authorities. Swift now has no shows on her schedule until the Eras Tour, which has surpassed $1billion in revenue, returns to the United States in October and ends in Canada in December. A report emerged last week that said Kelce and Swift have found ways to 'prioritize' each other despite their hectic schedules and being in different countries for a lot of their relationship. 'Taylor and Travis always prioritize each other even when they are physically apart. They are still in constant communication texting and FaceTiming each other,' per ET. Swift and Kelce are 'very affectionate with each other even when they're apart,' added ET, with the Chief showing his affection for the 'Anti-Hero' singer through lavish gifts.

The actress has been left ‘fearing’ for her career, and appears to be lying low with her popstar bestie at her $17m home in Rhode Island, with a host of other Hollywood pals. Images obtained by DailyMail.com show Lively with her arms around husband Ryan, who donned a cap and a backpack, seemingly welcoming the Deadpool actor to the bash. The blonde was seen frowning into the sunshine, dressed in floral shorts and a coral bikini top, with her long tresses up in a bun – looking relieved at the arrival of her husband. Blake isn’t the only member of Taylor’s Girl Squad in attendance, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Gigi Hadid also celebrated the stars Era’s Tour success, with her beau Bradley Cooper and his daughter. Cooper cut a relaxed figure in a black t-shirt and shorts as he headed down to Swift’s pool with the kids, rubbing shoulders with Patrick Mahomes, his wife Brittany. The youngsters giggled and laughed as they jumped into the pool – hidden from public view – as their famous parents dipped in an out of the house while soaking up the sunshine. Blake, for her part, has been slammed for using her alcohol brand to promote the film , which focuses heavily on domestic abuse, and for the way she appeared to make light of serious questions about the themes during interviews. Blake was furiously slammed online last week after a reporter asked her if people who related to what her character went through could talk to her about it if they saw her in person – and she replied with a sarcastic quip. ‘If someone understands the themes of this movie and comes across you in public and they want to really talk to you, what’s the best way for them to be able to talk to you about this? How would you recommend they go about it?’ asked the interviewer. She sarcastically responded: ‘Ask for my address or my phone number.’ ‘Or I could just share my location with you and then we could…,’ she trailed off before laughing. The star was also blasted online after she hosted an interview with her It Ends With Us costars Jenny Slate and Isabela Ferrer, as well as author Colleen, and failed to discuss the topic. The four women giggled together as they chatted about everything from their dream jobs to their zodiac signs, but there was no mention of domestic violence during their talk. Social media users were quick to criticize them – particularly Blake, who hosted the interview – for partaking in the lighthearted questionnaire given the serious nature of the film. Several hours later, Blake took to Instagram to share information about domestic violence, as well as some resources for her followers. Amid the controversy, a journalist resurfaced an ‘uncomfortable’ interview that she had with Blake in 2016, which further increased the fury. During the sit-down, the actress made a snarky comment about Norwegian reporter Kjersti Flaa’s ‘bump’ after she had congratulated a then-pregnant Blake on her impending arrival – but the journalist was not pregnant. After the moment went viral, Kjersti, 51, told DailyMail.com exclusively that Blake’s response was especially hurtful because she cannot conceive. Taylor was seen back in the US for the first time since finishing the European leg of her Era’s Tour, spending some quality time with her Kasnas City Chief’s beau before the NFL season started up again. The power couple have reunited for an end-of-summer getaway – this time seen today on the balcony of the singer’s epic Rhode Island mansion. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor’s legendary star-studded Independence Day parties. The pop superstar, however, was forced to skip the festivities this year thanks to her 51-date tour across Europe which wrapped up on Tuesday. But Taylor has returned to her iconic holiday house for the first time this summer – now with her beau in tow. And it looks like their friends and family – including Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes – joined them. Locals and fans were quick to realize the pop sensation had returned after dozens of armed guards were spotted along the perimeter of the property. Taylor’s security shooed fans dying for a glimpse of The Eras Tour star away, but not before they snapped a selfie on her driveway. One group even went up to the guards offering them $50 to catch a glimpse of the star and her beau. Taylor and Travis were accompanied by Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, enjoying the sunshine ahead of the season – with the quarterback and tight end enduring a difficult pre-season with three straight losses. Kylie and Jason joined the all-star Chiefs line up with their children, as the latter continues to enjoy his first offseason after retirement, and ahead of his new TV role with Amazon Prime, starting next month. The presence of Brittany comes at a potentially-difficult time, just hours after she liked a Donald Trump post on social media, sparking huge backlash. While Taylor has not publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November’s election, she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Fans had speculated over whether Brittany’s apparent Trump endorsement might cause a rift in their friendship, but her attendance at the Rhode Island festivities appears to signal that won’t be the case. Taylor seems to be letting her hair down after missing out on her annual July 4 bash because she was on tour, with sold-out dates across Europe. The lovebirds, who began dating just about a year ago, have spent much of their time jetting off to see one another amid their busy schedules since the start of their romance. They have previously shacked up at each other’s various pads across the country, but it is believed to be Travis’s first time at his girlfriend’s Watch Hill manse. As reported by DailyMail.com at the time, they spent a week together during the pop icon’s last tour hiatus which coincided with the NFL off-season in March. The two enjoyed quality time together at her home base in Beverly Hills after a whirlwind few months of jet-setting and international rendezvous as a long distance couple. Swift was reported to have purchased the Colonial-style mansion, also known as High Watch, with cash back in 2013. Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state. With an expansive backyard and massive swimming pool overlooking the ocean, the pad makes for the perfect summer home. And Kelce wouldn’t be the first boyfriend to visit the iconic residence. The Reputation hitmaker has been snapped over the years at the home canoodling with her former flames such as exes Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston. And now the it-couple are likely eager to soak up the last few weeks of summer together at the mansion before the NFL tight end heads back to Kansas City for the start of the season next month. Sources tell DailyMail.com Swift landed back in the US on Wednesday, while Kelce, who has been playing in pre-season games, arrived in Rhode Island on Friday. Kelce had been seen being every inch the supportive boyfriend throughout his girlfriend’s European tour earlier this summer, making appearances in Dublin, Paris, London, and Amsterdam. He attended his last concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany where he was seen hugging the popstar at the end of her set in July before reporting to Chiefs training camp in Kansas City. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday. He is set to return to the field on September 5 for the first official game of the NFL season. Taylor, meanwhile, will enjoy a nice two-month break before embarking on the last leg of her Eras Tour in Miami in mid-October. And it is likely she will return the favor and support her man at his games during her hiatus. While he may have been busy training for another exciting run on the field, he still has time for romantic gestures. Earlier this week the football star was reported to have splashed out over $30,000 on flowers for Taylor to congratulate her on the end of the European leg of her Eras Tour. According to The Sun, Kelce ordered a huge 51 boxes of red roses that greeted his girlfriend when she returned to the US. The singer returned to London’s Wembley Stadium for five performances of her smash-hit tour following the cancellation of shows in Vienna, when a planned terrorist attack was foiled by authorities. Swift now has no shows on her schedule until the Eras Tour, which has surpassed $1billion in revenue, returns to the United States in October and ends in Canada in December. A report emerged last week that said Kelce and Swift have found ways to ‘prioritize’ each other despite their hectic schedules and being in different countries for a lot of their relationship. ‘Taylor and Travis always prioritize each other even when they are physically apart. They are still in constant communication texting and FaceTiming each other,’ per ET. Swift and Kelce are ‘very affectionate with each other even when they’re apart,’ added ET, with the Chief showing his affection for the ‘Anti-Hero’ singer through lavish gifts.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBlake Lively broke cover for the first time amid the ongoing It&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Blake Lively seen in public for the first time after It Ends with Us controversy, holding onto husband Ryan Reynolds at Taylor Swift&#8217;s star-studded home first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/blake-lively-seen-in-public-for-the-first-time-after-it-ends-with-us-controversy-holding-onto-husband-ryan-reynolds-at-taylor-swifts-star-studded-home/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1724545146_rewrite-this-title-Blake-Lively-breaks-cover-for-the-first.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 00:22:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.255},{"id":254856766,"title":"Trump Struggles To Keep Media Spotlight In Battle With Kamala Harris","text":"Donald Trump, touting plans on taxes and health, tried on Friday to turn the page on a week in which he was overshadowed by Kamala Harris and struggled to focus on policy issues instead of personal attacks on his opponent in the US presidential race. From a lectern at a Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, the Republican candidate spoke about his plan to eliminate taxes on tips to waiters and other service employees. He discussed his campaign's efforts to court Hispanic voters in Nevada, a battleground state that could help determine the Nov. 5 election, and nationwide. The tax proposal, a pillar of Trump's economic agenda, is the kind of issue his advisers have been pressing him to focus on, rather than his frequent personal attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris' looks, Black and Indian heritage and intelligence, warning they could turn off the moderate voters he needs to win. At an event in Arizona later, the former president repeated his tax pledge, while promising to set up a commission to investigate presidential assassination attempts. He also said he would install a panel to investigate \"an increase in chronic health problems and childhood diseases.\" Both proposals are apparent concessions to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump at the event after dropping out of the race. Trump's comments come one day after Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination with a muscular speech that laid down broad foreign policy principles and sharp contrasts with Trump with 11 weeks left until Election Day. Trump sought to counter-program the four-day convention with events of his own around the country, hoping to steal some media attention from Kamala Harris. However, his speeches on foreign policy, the economy and crime did little to dislodge the spotlight from Kamala Harris and received little attention - a stunning turnabout for a politician used to dominating headlines. The Republican and his aides hope Thursday's boisterous convention finale marks the end of the honeymoon period for Kamala Harris, who emerged as the Democratic candidate little more than a month ago, after President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed her. During Kamala Harris' acceptance speech in Chicago, Trump attacked her with dozens of posts on his Truth Social platform, calling her a liar, a Marxist and \"Comrade Kamala Harris.\" One post simply asked: \"IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?\" William Rosenberg, a political science professor at Drexel University, said Trump's personal attacks on Kamala Harris underscored his frustration with having to face a biracial woman, a task complicated by his history of making racist remarks. \"His anger and his words speak volumes,\" Rosenberg said. \"He's navigating a path which is full of problems for him.\" Kamala Harris has surged in the polls since entering the race, with polling aggregator website FiveThirtyEight putting her ahead of Trump in six of seven battleground states. She is also outraising her Republican counterpart. Her campaign told the Federal Election Commission this week that it raised $204 million last month, compared to $48 million reported to the body by Trump's main fundraising group. One question still to be answered is whether Kamala Harris will also outpace Trump on the trail in the coming weeks. Biden, 81, made relatively few campaign stops, easing pressure on Trump to travel more around the country. That may now change with Harris, 59. Trump, 78, will travel to Detroit on Monday to address a conference of the National Guard Association of the United States and is scheduled to give a speech at a conservative women's group's annual summit in Washington on Friday. Campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump would hold at least one additional campaign stop between those two events, without providing details. The Kamala Harris campaign has not yet released details of her movements for next week. Leavitt blamed the media for focusing their stories on Trump's personal attacks, which she said made up a fraction of his otherwise policy-heavy rallies and speeches. At a speech event on Wednesday in Asheboro, North Carolina, billed as one on national security, Trump said he had rejected the recommendations of his advisers to focus on policy, and he insulted Kamala Harris and other Democrats in personal terms. He again recounted those conversations with advisers at the rally in Arizona on Friday. \"My geniuses, they get paid a fortune - actually not that much - but I call up my people, I say, 'They're knocking the hell out of me, and you say I shouldn't get personal.

An outside adviser to Trump told Reuters on condition of anonymity that several advisers had told the former president that a continued focus on insults rather than policy could doom his chances in November. Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump could still win the race, which he predicted would be close, but to do that he should focus on inflation, illegal immigration and other issues that polling show many voters give him higher marks on.

The actress has been left ‘fearing’ for her career, and appears to be lying low with her popstar bestie at her $17m home in Rhode Island, with a host of other Hollywood pals. Exclusive DailyMail.com pictures show Lively with her arms around husband Ryan, who donned a cap and a backpack, seemingly welcoming the Deadpool actor to the bash. The blonde was seen frowning into the sunshine, dressed in floral shorts and a coral bikini top, with her long tresses up in a bun – looking relieved at the arrival of her husband. Blake isn’t the only member of Taylor’s Girl Squad in attendance, with sources telling DailyMail.com that Gigi Hadid also celebrated the stars Era’s Tour success, with her beau Bradley Cooper and his daughter. Cooper cut a relaxed figure in a black t-shirt and shorts as he headed down to Swift’s pool with the kids, rubbing shoulders with Patrick Mahomes, his wife Brittany. The youngsters giggled and laughed as they jumped into the pool – hidden from public view – as their famous parents dipped in an out of the house while soaking up the sunshine. Blake, for her part, has been slammed for using her alcohol brand to promote the film , which focuses heavily on domestic abuse, and for the way she appeared to make light of serious questions about the themes during interviews. Blake was furiously slammed online last week after a reporter asked her if people who related to what her character went through could talk to her about it if they saw her in person – and she replied with a sarcastic quip. ‘If someone understands the themes of this movie and comes across you in public and they want to really talk to you, what’s the best way for them to be able to talk to you about this? How would you recommend they go about it?’ asked the interviewer. She sarcastically responded: ‘Ask for my address or my phone number.’ ‘Or I could just share my location with you and then we could…,’ she trailed off before laughing. The star was also blasted online after she hosted an interview with her It Ends With Us costars Jenny Slate and Isabela Ferrer, as well as author Colleen, and failed to discuss the topic. The four women giggled together as they chatted about everything from their dream jobs to their zodiac signs, but there was no mention of domestic violence during their talk. Social media users were quick to criticize them – particularly Blake, who hosted the interview – for partaking in the lighthearted questionnaire given the serious nature of the film. Several hours later, Blake took to Instagram to share information about domestic violence, as well as some resources for her followers. Amid the controversy, a journalist resurfaced an ‘uncomfortable’ interview that she had with Blake in 2016, which further increased the fury. During the sit-down, the actress made a snarky comment about Norwegian reporter Kjersti Flaa’s ‘bump’ after she had congratulated a then-pregnant Blake on her impending arrival – but the journalist was not pregnant. After the moment went viral, Kjersti, 51, told DailyMail.com exclusively that Blake’s response was especially hurtful because she cannot conceive. Taylor was seen back in the US for the first time since finishing the European leg of her Era’s Tour, spending some quality time with her Kasnas City Chief’s beau before the NFL season started up again. The power couple have reunited for an end-of-summer getaway – this time seen today on the balcony of the singer’s epic Rhode Island mansion. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor’s legendary star-studded Independence Day parties. The pop superstar, however, was forced to skip the festivities this year thanks to her 51-date tour across Europe which wrapped up on Tuesday. But Taylor has returned to her iconic holiday house for the first time this summer – now with her beau in tow. And it looks like their friends and family – including Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes – joined them. Locals and fans were quick to realize the pop sensation had returned after dozens of armed guards were spotted along the perimeter of the property. Taylor’s security shooed fans dying for a glimpse of The Eras Tour star away, but not before they snapped a selfie on her driveway. One group even went up to the guards offering them $50 to catch a glimpse of the star and her beau. Taylor and Travis were accompanied by Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, enjoying the sunshine ahead of the season – with the quarterback and tight end enduring a difficult pre-season with three straight losses. Kylie and Jason joined the all-star Chiefs line up with their children, as the latter continues to enjoy his first offseason after retirement, and ahead of his new TV role with Amazon Prime, starting next month. The presence of Brittany comes at a potentially-difficult time, just hours after she liked a Donald Trump post on social media, sparking huge backlash. While Taylor has not publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November’s election, she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Fans had speculated over whether Brittany’s apparent Trump endorsement might cause a rift in their friendship, but her attendance at the Rhode Island festivities appears to signal that won’t be the case. Taylor seems to be letting her hair down after missing out on her annual July 4 bash because she was on tour, with sold-out dates across Europe. The lovebirds, who began dating just about a year ago, have spent much of their time jetting off to see one another amid their busy schedules since the start of their romance. They have previously shacked up at each other’s various pads across the country, but it is believed to be Travis’s first time at his girlfriend’s Watch Hill manse. As reported by DailyMail.com at the time, they spent a week together during the pop icon’s last tour hiatus which coincided with the NFL off-season in March. The two enjoyed quality time together at her home base in Beverly Hills after a whirlwind few months of jet-setting and international rendezvous as a long distance couple. Swift was reported to have purchased the Colonial-style mansion, also known as High Watch, with cash back in 2013. Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state. With an expansive backyard and massive swimming pool overlooking the ocean, the pad makes for the perfect summer home. And Kelce wouldn’t be the first boyfriend to visit the iconic residence. The Reputation hitmaker has been snapped over the years at the home canoodling with her former flames such as exes Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston. And now the it-couple are likely eager to soak up the last few weeks of summer together at the mansion before the NFL tight end heads back to Kansas City for the start of the season next month. Sources tell DailyMail.com Swift landed back in the US on Wednesday, while Kelce, who has been playing in pre-season games, arrived in Rhode Island on Friday. Kelce had been seen being every inch the supportive boyfriend throughout his girlfriend’s European tour earlier this summer, making appearances in Dublin, Paris, London, and Amsterdam. He attended his last concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany where he was seen hugging the popstar at the end of her set in July before reporting to Chiefs training camp in Kansas City. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday. He is set to return to the field on September 5 for the first official game of the NFL season. Taylor, meanwhile, will enjoy a nice two-month break before embarking on the last leg of her Eras Tour in Miami in mid-October. And it is likely she will return the favor and support her man at his games during her hiatus. While he may have been busy training for another exciting run on the field, he still has time for romantic gestures. Earlier this week the football star was reported to have splashed out over $30,000 on flowers for Taylor to congratulate her on the end of the European leg of her Eras Tour. According to The Sun, Kelce ordered a huge 51 boxes of red roses that greeted his girlfriend when she returned to the US. The singer returned to London’s Wembley Stadium for five performances of her smash-hit tour following the cancellation of shows in Vienna, when a planned terrorist attack was foiled by authorities. Swift now has no shows on her schedule until the Eras Tour, which has surpassed $1billion in revenue, returns to the United States in October and ends in Canada in December. A report emerged last week that said Kelce and Swift have found ways to ‘prioritize’ each other despite their hectic schedules and being in different countries for a lot of their relationship. ‘Taylor and Travis always prioritize each other even when they are physically apart. They are still in constant communication texting and FaceTiming each other,’ per ET. Swift and Kelce are ‘very affectionate with each other even when they’re apart,’ added ET, with the Chief showing his affection for the ‘Anti-Hero’ singer through lavish gifts.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBlake Lively broke cover for the first time amid the ongoing It&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Blake Lively emerges publicly for the first time following drama surrounding &#8220;It Ends with Us&#8221;, seen with husband Ryan Reynolds at Taylor Swift&#8217;s star-studded residence first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/blake-lively-emerges-publicly-for-the-first-time-following-drama-surrounding-it-ends-with-us-seen-with-husband-ryan-reynolds-at-taylor-swifts-star-studded-residence/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Blake-Lively-breaks-cover-for-the-first.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 23:48:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.251},{"id":254855304,"title":"Breanna Stewart is latest WNBA star to weigh in on presidential election","text":"BROOKLYN — Just a few hours ahead of the New York Liberty’s matchup against the Connecticut Sun, WNBA star Breanna Stewart weighed in on the upcoming presidential election, and lauded the league’s deep-rooted emphasis on social justice. Just days removed from Democratic National Convention, and a few months away from the November presidential election, Stewart was asked about the league’s role and history of social activism. “In the W, we always use our platform for social change and justice,” Stewart said. “You guys know, this is an extremely important time with the election coming up. Just making sure that everybody is registered to vote — I think that’s the biggest thing. Everyone is entitled to go out and vote.” Stewart has a long history of social activism on a long list of issues, including racial justice, support for victims of sexual violence, The league has a whole has taken up a variety of issues, including addressing racism, gender pay equity, LGBTQ+ issues, and more. Earlier this week, Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese similarly expressed to reporters the importance of voting, though she noted she wasn’t up-to-speed on the latest political issues. “I’m not that educated right now, but just continuing to learn and just get feedback. But everybody go out there and vote,” Reese said. “I commend that. I’ve been telling a lot of people to go out there and do vote, because we need it for this election.” Last month, Aces star A’ja Wilson also weighed in on the presidential election, expressing her support for Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign.

It’s a tale as old as time – a story that pops up every election, almost like clockwork. The narrative is the same this election cycle. There is a palpable excitement about the possibility of young people making their voices heard in 2024. Young people, in particular, have broadly voiced their support for Vice President Kamala Harris, who will official-ly accept her party’s presiden-tial nomination at the Democrat-ic National Convention on Aug. 22, 2024. Harris’ young supporters have created popular TikTok videos and widely-shared me-mes with coconut trees and am-ple allusions to the trendy term “brat.” Both former President Don-ald Trump and Harris are try-ing to build on young people’s excitement – through partici-pating in livestreams with pop-ular, young content creators and by copying some of the specif-ic colors and themes that often come up in young people’s on-line content. The vibes suggest, perhaps, that a “youth wave” is coming. Young People Mostly Support Harris At present, Harris holds a commanding lead among young people. Depending on the poll that you look at, if the election were held today, Harris would probably command about 50% to 60% of the youth vote, meaning people ages 18 to 29, or in some cases 18 to 34. Trump would pull in only about 34% of young peo-ple. That’s a big difference. A per-son might see that difference and think that young people could, indeed, tip the scales at the ballot box in November. Knowing exactly how many young voters Harris needs to win over to carry the election is difficult, but many political pundits have argued that Har-ris needs to make sure that she secures a dominant majority of them. But regardless of whether they support Harris in preelec-tion polling, my research finds that many young people aren’t likely to show up and actually cast their ballots. Young People Often Don’t Vote Young citizens’ track record of participation in American elections is dismal. Although young people are the biggest group of citizens who are eligi-ble to vote, they turn out at sig-nificantly lower rates than older Americans. In the November 2022 mid-terms, for instance, only 25.5% of 18- to 29-year-olds cast a bal-lot, whereas 63.1% of those age 60 or older voted. Though November 2020 set re-cords for youth voter turnout, only 52.5% of 18- to 29-year-olds cast a ballot, compared with 78% of those 60 or older. While it’s hard to know how many young people will cast a ballot in November 2024, early indicators – such as the number of young people who say they plan to cast a ballot – suggest that this pattern of low youth voter turnout will continue. The United States has one of the lowest rates of youth voter turnout in the world. The gap between 18- to 29-year-olds and those over 60, a common mea-suring stick, is more than twice as large here than it is in oth-er countries such as Canada or Germany. In our 2020 book, “Making Young Voters: Converting Civic Attitudes into Civic Action,” po-litical scientist Sunshine Hilly-gus and I tried to better under-stand what stops young people from voting and what can be done to change this trend. Why More Young People Don’t Vote Two main hurdles stand in the way of young people cast-ing a ballot. One problem is that young people are not especially interested in voting. In recent polls, for example, about 77% of young people say that they plan on definitely voting in the upcoming November election. For older citizens, that num-ber is 90%. However, a second – and a per-haps more consequential – prob-lem is that young people who are interested in voting often don’t follow through on their inten-tions. By examining survey data and conducting interviews with dozens of young people in 2018, Hillygus and I found that many young people lack confidence in themselves and their ability to navigate the voting process for the first time. Many told us that in their busy, hectic and ever-changing schedules, voting often simply falls by the wayside. With school and work com-mitments, as well as a lack of experience filling out voter reg-istration forms and casting a ballot, voting seems like an in-surmountable burden for many young people. What Works To Increase Youth Voter Turnout A common assumption of many youth advocacy groups seems to be that more young people would vote if voting were considered cool. We’ve seen that approach again this cycle, with advocates clamoring, for exam-ple, for celebrity endorsements from the likes of singer Taylor Swift. The problem is that this ap-proach doesn’t square with the fact that young people care about politics – they just strug-gle to follow through. The biggest hurdle for many young people, in particular, is voter registration. In 2022, data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that only 40% of young people said they were registered to vote in the midterm election. Programs that help young people register to vote can be particularly effective at getting them to cast a ballot. It has also become increas-ingly common for political campaigns to help young adults make a plan to vote – by outlin-ing when and where they are go-ing to vote, as well as how they will get to their polling location. Other methods, such as send-ing text message reminders, creating automated calendar reminders and offering trans-portation to the polls, are also effective at helping young people who want to vote actually do so. Though some of these strategies are being used in the 2024 elec-tion, many are not common. Government policies that make registering to vote and casting a ballot easier would also increase youth voter turnout. Same-day voter registration is particularly effective at encour-aging young people to vote. Like-wise, letting 16- and 17-year-olds preregister to vote before they turn 18 can also substantially increase the number of voters under 30. At present, 21 states, including California, Massachu-setts, Florida and Louisiana, let 16- and 17-year-olds preregister to vote. Our research suggests that when states implement these types of reforms, they close the gap between older and younger voters by about a third. There is some evidence that Harris has reinvigorated the youth vote. Whether young citizens will show up and deliver the pres-idency to Harris or stay home and yield to Trump remains to be seen.

As of Friday, it is down to $22.81. Last quarter, TMTG reported over $16 million in losses and less than a million dollars in revenue.Meanwhile, TMTG said in a report to the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company's \"success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump. The value of TMTG's brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer,\" adding that \"TMTG's business plan relies on President Donald J. Trump bringing his former social media followers to TMTG's platform.\"O'Brien told Witt that Trump's stake in TMTG makes up \"probably about half of his net worth now—at least, I would think,\" adding that his stake is worth around $2.7 billion.\"We're in the very unusual position of having a publicly traded stock that is actually a barometer for Trump's political fortunes because Truth Social's business model is nothing more than the cult of Donald Trump's personality and social media presence,\" O'Brien said.Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, told Newsweek via email on Saturday evening: \"President Trump has been massively successful throughout his career— starting businesses, building iconic buildings, creating one of the biggest television shows in history, and then becoming President of the United States. He will return to the White House once again.\"Newsweek reached out to TMTG and O'Brien's agents via email for comment on Saturday evening.The biographer explained how recent political events contributed to the successes and failures of Trump's media company.He said that TMTG's stock \"jumped\" in the first few days after Trump was shot in the right ear at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 in what the FBI is investigating as an assassination attempt.Along with President Joe Biden's weak showing at a debate with Trump in late June, the former president \"had so much momentum at that point in time and he came to the Republican [National] Convention with that kind of momentum,\" O'Brien said.He added: \"Since the Republican convention, all of the momentum has gone to the Democrats...and you've seen Truth Social's stock start to weaken again.\"On July 21, Biden exited the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris who later became the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris has hit the ground running, raising about $500 million since joining the race at the top of the ticket, according to Reuters' sources.Her campaign has also amassed 4.7 million followers on TikTok and 1.3 million followers on X, formerly Twitter. Meanwhile, Trump joined X again earlier this month where he has 89.8 million followers. He only has 7.6 million followers on Truth Social.Witt asked O'Brien what would happen to the value of TMTG if Trump loses the upcoming election and if he wins it.O'Brien told Witt that if Trump loses the election the value of his media company \"becomes negligible. I can't say necessarily that it goes to zero, but it declines even more dramatically from where it is right now.\"He added that if Trump wins the election, the value of his company will go back up.When asked if Trump \"weakened the financial upside of Truth Social\" when he joined X again, O'Brien said, \"Of course, he did,\" however, he said Trump \"realized that he couldn't have reached the political audience he wants to reach.\"","summary":"Trump's former biographer, Tim O'Brien, said on Saturday that the value of Trump's media company \"becomes negligible\" if he loses in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-biographer-tim-obrien-net-worth-election-loss-1944002","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457492/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 22:33:10","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":254853768,"title":"Court rules Cornel West can’t be on ballot in Pennsylvania","text":"In a 15-page opinion, Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer sided with the Pennsylvania secretary of state’s office in rejecting West’s candidacy paperwork. The secretary of state’s office said the paperwork lacked the affidavits for 14 of the 19 presidential electors required by the Aug. 1 filing deadline. Jubelirer, a Republican, agreed that minor-party presidential electors should be considered candidates for office and must file affidavits, even if major-party presidential electors are not. Matthew Haverstick, West’s lawyer who is referred to as the “counsel of choice for state Republicans in a number of recent policy fights,” argued in the now-failed legal challenge that he saw “no good reason for Mr. West to be kept off the ballot or Pennsylvanians otherwise prevented from voting for him.” The Pennsylvania presidential election is expected to be very close, with former President Donald Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris in a two-way race by less than 1 percentage point, 47.7% to 47.5%, according to RealClearPolitics.

In a recent podcast episode, Cohen offered some pointed advice to Kamala Harris, the newly named Democratic presidential nominee, ahead of her upcoming debate with Trump. His suggestion? Harris should ask Trump a question that could leave him fumbling for an answer. He said, \"We're stupid, our economy is in the toilet, there's crime, everyone's a rapist, drug addict, murderer. I would say, if I was Kamala Harris—hopefully during the debate—maybe you could tell me, since America is so bad, in your opinion, I mean every time this idiot opens his mouth, he's s***-talking the United States of America...so I would just like to ask you, Donald, what country would you like to go live in that you think is better than the United States of America?\" As per Newsweek, Cohen’s suggestion is a strategic one. It highlights a contradiction in Trump’s messaging: he claims to love America, yet often speaks about the country as if it’s beyond saving. Cohen exclaimed, \"It's a great question to ask him because there's no answer that he could give that would be acceptable…We're [the country is] surging in everything that we're doing, what's better?\" As per The Hill, Cohen, who was at the Democratic National Convention in support of Harris, also took a moment to reflect on how Republicans, including Trump, might react to the presence of anti-Trump Republicans at the event. Cohen brushed off the concerns and said, “I don’t really care what he’s thinking. This isn’t about him…It’s not my first Democratic convention that I have ever been at. This is a massive mistake that is regularly made by people,” he said. “I have been a Democrat virtually my entire life.” Cohen’s transformation from Trump’s personal attorney to one of his fiercest critics is emblematic of a broader shift among some former allies who have become disillusioned with Trumpism. Cohen asserted, “I don’t care about his feelings. What I care about is seeing a big, gigantic blue wave come November and not just for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz but the entire down ballot…Trumpism is fascism, and we must eradicate it from our body politic, otherwise, we’re going to lose our Democratic Republic. We’re not going back to Trump-era politics.” Cohen further continued, “2016 through 2020 was a very tumultuous, chaotic time in America’s history. The question is, do we want to go back there? Of course, people start chanting when Kamala is talking, we’re not going back. Why would you want to live in chaos? Why do you want to live with the tumult that this man brings? I know the man and I’m telling you, if he, God forbid a million times, wins the election right now in 2024, there will never be another election ever again.\"","summary":"Cohen said, “It’s not my first Democratic convention that I have ever been at.

Known for his taciturn persona, when news of his passing in 1933 became public, wisecracking writer Dorothy Parker quipped: “how can they tell?” Coolidge’s nickname was Silent Cal. Now, we’ve got Silent Kam – as in Kamala Harris – who’s banking that her strategy of soundlessness will carry her all the way to the White House. “Silence is golden” goes the ancient proverb; in Kamala’s case, it may also win her the presidency. After a successful debut on the national stage during Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court Senate Judiciary Hearings in 2018, it looked like Kamala was poised to become the next Democratic darling: a woman with both an African-American and Indian-American background, a U.S. Senator, and a prosecutor, to boot. But it was not to be: in her 2020 presidential bid, she didn’t even make it to 2020. It was a colossal failure and Kamala dropped out before the Iowa Caucus. Even though Joe Biden picked her as his running mate and she became the first female VP, the administration’s been hiding her for the most part ever since. That seems to be working rather well, as she’s become the Democratic presidential nominee by coronation. Personally, I received exactly as many delegates to the Democratic Convention during the primaries as she did: zero. Ever since the Democrat Syndicate pulled out the rug from Biden, forcing him into retirement for his own good – the way some mob bosses are strongarmed when they’ve fallen out of favor with the other families – Silent Kam’s enjoyed a honeymoon, whereby she sees her poll numbers soar even as she says and does next to nothing. She doesn’t have to. She’ll get a free ride, the way Thomas Jefferson did when the Louisiana Purchase practically fell into his lap, or Bill Clinton did when his presidency coincided with the advent of the Internet, resulting in a juggernaut economy. After all, we all know how the vast majority of Americans didn’t want to see a Biden-Trump rematch, and now they won’t have to. Kamala’s advantage is that unlike Donald Trump, she is, by default, not one of the two names comprising that rematch. She’s a sight for sore eyes to those for whom presidential elections are amusing parlor games, with no consequences expected based on candidates’ platforms. She’s a woman, she’s young(ish), and she’s black: “woo-hoo, you go, girl!” As for Trump, he hasn’t done much as yet to slow Kamala’s momentum. He’s gone back to namecalling and picking pointless fights with Republican governors in crucial swing states. It’s as if he doesn’t realize it’s his election to lose: immigration is the top issue on voters’ minds, and the Harris campaign has the audacity to portray her as the one who’s tough on the border. Americans also care about rampant crime, wokeness run amok, and the longterm effects of runaway inflation. However, unlike a master campaigner like Ronald Reagan, who also ran against inflation the last time it was significant, in 1980, Trump’s not done a good enough job of explaining to the American people that now-falling inflation doesn’t mean grocery and gas prices will go down, it just means when they go even higher, they’ll rise at a slower rate. It’s like credit cards: if a cardholder runs up a $50,000 tab and then cuts spending in half, that means the debt will rise slower than before, but it’s not going to get smaller. Trump also needs to explain why things got as bad as they did under Biden, why Harris would only make them worse, and what Trump would do, specifically, to make them better. Otherwise, Trump’s not going to attract any new voters, and that’s a problem. When Biden was Trump’s opponent, it didn’t matter; Trump was likely going to win by attrition because many Democrats, independents, and apolitical Americans were going to stay home. But now, they’re turning out for Kamala, which is why she closed the gap and jumped ahead. Debates are back in style again, after that last one back in June. Trump needs to score big against Kamala on September 10. As the Wall Street Journal’s Daniel Henninger wisely recommends, Trump should stop the rallies filled with his own sycophants – which are breeding grounds for him going dangerously off script, to the mainstream media’s delight, as they’ll play the clips over and over again – and instead hold town hall meetings with undecided voters in swing states. If Trump really wants this thing – and I’m not unequivocally convinced he does – then he’s got to go out and work for it, harder than he’s been. Speaking of the mainstream media, where have all the responsible journalists gone? Is there one reporter out there – other than those in Trump’s camp – who has the intestinal fortitude to demand that Silent Kam holds a press conference and starts appearing on the Sunday morning shows? Even if she does, would the hosts of Meet the Press, Face the Nation, and This Week challenge her with tough questions, or will they ask her to, say, name a song that inspired her? As for those undecided voters, they don’t need any skills to do their ‘job’ or voting. Pilots need to know how to fly airplanes. Surgeons to perform operations. Mechanics to fix cars. Not voters, though. They just have to be U.S. citizens (well, theoretically anyway), 18 or older, and not in prison. And they can have fun walking to their favorite neighborhood dropbox weeks before the election to plop in their ballot: for Silent Kam, simply because she’s not Trump.","summary":"Exactly 100 years ago, the incumbent president was Calvin Coolidge.

The Republican candidate told Daily Mail on Wednesday, August 21, 2024, that he's refused to get intelligence briefings he's entitled to as the Republican party's nominee so he couldn't be accused of leaking classified information like he's been before. He told the correspondent, \"I don't want them, because, number one, I know what's happening. It's very easy to see what's happening,\" as he alleged a trap laid out for him before attacking rivals POTUS Joe Biden and his newly installed election opponent Vice President Kamala Harris. \"We have an incompetent leader, and we have two incompetent leaders. The 78-year-old is noticeably playing safe amid the tight race with his Democratic rival. Although as a presidential nominee, he's entitled to be briefed by the United States spy agencies to prepare him for the role as commander-in-chief, Trump however denied accepting any sensitive information. His decision could be a lesson he learned after the FBI recovered classified documents from his Palm Beach property Mar-a-Lago. Trump further called Harris a Marxist, \"We have a Marxist that's going to try and be president, and this country is not ready for a Marxist or a communist president, and that's what she is. She destroyed San Francisco, she destroyed California, and this country is not ready for it. So I don't want that, because as soon as I get that, they'll say that I leaked it. So the only way to solve that problem is not to take it I don't want it understood. I'll have plenty of them when I get in.\" Historically, former presidents are also briefed by the US Intelligence as a courtesy to keep them updated in case their advice is needed. But back in 2021, Biden prohibited his predecessor Trump from receiving the country's sensitive information citing his \"erratic behavior.\" The now-81-year-old told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell, \"I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings. What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?\" This decision marks the first time any former president has been barred from the briefings ever since President Harry Truman introduced them in the early 1950s. They are designed for a smoother transition of power conducted by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Currently, ex-presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama are briefed on a regular basis. Aside from Biden, other White House officials had trust issues regarding Trump's ability to retain secret information. For instance, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, echoed, \"[A] number of intelligence partners around the world started withholding information from us because they didn't trust the president would safeguard that information. And that makes us less safe,\" per The New York Times.","summary":"Currently, ex-presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W.

Democrats shouldn't get out over their skis, this is still a toss up race - despite how many celebrity endorsements they have,\" she wrote.Numerous celebrities have backed both campaigns, with Spike Lee, Kerry Washington, and Mark Cuban among those supporting Vice President Kamala Harris, and Dana White, Elon Musk, and Kid Rock supporting Trump's campaign.The Hill's Arizona aggregate poll of Trump, Harris, and Kennedy Jr., which is based on 12 polls prior to Kennedy Jr.'s withdraw, showed Harris at 44.8 percent of the vote, Trump with 43.3 percent, and Kennedy Jr. at 6 percent in the state.Hours before McCain's X post, Kennedy Jr., the third-party candidate with the highest polling, dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, the GOP's nominee. On average, national aggregate polls found Kennedy Jr. drawing about 5 percent of the vote, a figure that could influence the outcome of the election given the small margin between Trump and Harris.Most national aggregates show Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the lead, though she and Trump are deadlocked in battleground states, such as Arizona, which are often most indicative of the path to 270 Electoral College votes and The White House.Aggregate polls, both state and national, are consistently updated as new polling data is added, shifting the averages in real time, the following percentages are reflective of Saturday afternoon.

Don’t bet on it","text":"In a close election campaign with both sides looking for an edge, the party with more people watching their midsummer convention would seem to have an important sign of success. Yet historically speaking, that measurement means next to nothing. Eight times over the past 16 presidential election cycles dating back to 1960, the party with the most popular convention among television viewers won in November. Eight times they lost. The Democrats will see what a summer advantage means this November. Vice President Kamala Harris’ party averaged 22 million viewers for its convention this week, compared to the Republican average of 19.1 million in July, the Nielsen company said on Friday. “It’s one of those interesting things about covering politics is that you see these indicators about what really matters, and a lot of times it doesn’t,” said veteran journalist Jeff Greenfield, who covered the Democrats this week for Politico. Popularity contests in TV ratings don’t necessarily translate This week’s numbers mean the Democrats have been more popular with viewers in 13 of the past 17 presidential election year summers, Nielsen said. Although Democrats have won eight of the first 16 elections, their candidate recorded the most votes in 10 of them. The last time a party lost despite having a more popular convention was in 2016, although it was close: Democrat Hillary Clinton’s nominating session beat Donald Trump by less than a million viewers per average, Nielsen said. For all of his vaunted popularity as a television attraction, Trump fell short in the convention ratings three straight times. A convention’s last night, with the nominee’s acceptance speech, generally gets the most viewers. Trump reached 25.4 million people with his July speech, less than a week after an assassination attempt, and the average would have undoubtedly been higher if his 92-minute address hadn’t stretched past midnight on the East Coast. Harris’ shorter speech reached 26.2 million. Despite Barack Obama’s historic election as the nation’s first Black president in 2008, Republican John McCain’s convention actually had more than 4 million viewers each night on average. People probably are watching their own party’s convention For four straight cycles, between 1976 through 1988, the party with the most-watched convention lost the election. That included the two lopsided victories by Republican Ronald Reagan — although a nomination fight between Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy in 1980 and the selection of Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 as the first woman on a national ticket probably boosted the Democrats’ convention audience in those years. Typically, people are more likely to watch their own party’s convention, Greenfield said. That’s reflected in the ratings this year: Fox News Channel, which appeals to Republicans, had by far more viewers than any other network for the GOP convention, while left-leaning MSNBC has dominated this past week. It will also be interesting to see if star power — or potential star power — boosted Harris. Rumors of a surprise Beyoncé or Taylor Swift appearance, ultimately unfounded, hung over the Democratic session. Both conventions are highly produced television events as much as they are political meetings, and Greenfield said it was clear the Democrats had the upper hand. “I think if you were going strictly on entertainment value,” he said, “Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder trump Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan.”","summary":"In a close election campaign with both sides looking for an edge, the party with more people watching their midsummer convention would seem to have an important sign of success.

The Grim Reality of Harris-Walz in Office’, TNH August 17, 2024, Constantinos E. Scaros futilely and unconvincingly argues: “Are you going to let your hatred of Mr. X deter you from doing the logical thing and supporting his taking over the ship’s wheel? Are you really going to let some amateur steer the ship instead, putting all your lives at risk, just to keep Mr. X from basking in the spotlight and getting the credit?” “Donald Trump is Mr. X, and the amateur in question is Kamala Harris.” In the outset, we must expose the fallacy here: if that’s the argument, then Trump, with no political experience whatsoever (not even as a local councilperson), was unqualified and too risky to have been voted president in the first instance, according to Dr. Scaros’ exemplum. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and District Attorney, was a U.S. Senator, who served on prestigious committees, and is the Vice President, being the most active President of the Senate in tie-breaking votes. She is well qualified and experienced – no amateur to the contraire. Without an appealing or persuasive Trump record upon which to braggingly argue, Dr. Scaros deflects and engages in partisan wishful (and fear-mongering) speculation (a la Trump) with a “[s]ampling of what a Harris-Walz administration will look like:” on borders, crime, wokeness, foreign policy, and the economy. That’s no reality. Let’s look at reality: the facts, irrespective of political opinion or ideology. Trump talks a good game but didn’t do a good job as president. Here are a few representative substandard facts of the Trump presidency, from FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan, nonprofit, consumer advocate organization: The economy lost 2.7 million jobs. The unemployment rate increased by 1.7 percentage points to 6.4%. The international trade deficit Trump promised to reduce went up. The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services in 2020 was the highest since 2008 and increased 36.3% from 2016. The number of people lacking health insurance rose by 3 million. The federal debt held by the public went up, from $14.4 trillion to $21.6 trillion. Illegal immigration increased. Handgun production rose 12.5% last year compared with 2016, setting a new record. The murder rate rose to the highest level since 1997. Dr. Scaros may be unperturbed by the unglamorous Trump record and Trumpers may suffer from opacity of mental clarity in reality reasoning, but, as the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan indelibly said: “You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.” It’s a flawed premise from which to argue that having been president in and of itself makes Trump soundly experienced, knowledgeable, and of good judgment. Here, it reassures the same old thing – or even worse, as a vengeful and egocentric Trump will wreak havoc upon our democratic institutions and retaliate against his political nemeses. Trump steered the national welfare down inimical avenues and shipwrecked our nation on January 6th. Trump, erratic and impulsive, was an oblivious and unschooled president on the intricacies and ramifications of policy and prudent decision-making. But he did spend a lot of time playing golf (and he cheats at that too). Now, let’s look at Trump’s ranting and acerbic promises. Trump hoodwinked his voters; he broke most of his promises. Trump in 2016 made a couple of hundred campaign promises, and in his announcement speech for his 2024 presidential bid Trump (a convicted felon with a multitude of state and federal indictments pending) made at least 20 false and misleading claims, according to CNN. The overwhelming majority of Trump’s promises were broken, and a second term will not fare better. If one fails to heed its lessons, history tends to repeat itself. The broken promises range from the Mexican-U.S. wall to COVID vaccines, to the debt, to the trade deficit, to GDP growth, to manufacturing, to jobs, to medical pre-existing conditions, to coal fuel and mining, to guns, to draining the swamp, to lobbying, etc. There are sufficient and varied reliable sources (from liberal to conservative) one may reference for specific meritless claims or promises made and broken by Trump. A narrative top 40 list of broken Trump promises is presented by the renowned Robert Reich, a distinguished university professor, author, former member of the President’s National Economic Council and U.S. Labor Secretary, in ‘The American Prospect’ in 2020. Funnily, Trump criticized President Obama for flying to Hawaii to play golf, when Trump broke the record for golf visits during his presidency. This hypocrisy is also comically cynical because Trump promised that he would not have time to play golf if elected president. A stupefying broken promise, that’s forgotten from many accounts, is that Trump promised to self-fund his campaign. Not only did the exaggerated billionaire take so much of other people’s money but he also duped folks to pay for his super-expensive teams of lawyers. Trump does not put his money where his mouth is. Trump breached his covenants (Trump proclaimed a Contract with the American Voter) with the American people who voted for him and Trump failed to deliver especially when graded against his (inchoate) solutions and (appeasing) promises. Instead, his vitriolic politics have been roiling the nation. The plea to fellow Americans is let us heed what independent (and real billionaire) Michael Bloomberg said in his memorable 2016 DNC convention speech that’s so apt in 2024: “let’s elect a sane, competent person.” The risk is if Mr. X should win.

Kennedy, Jr., the eldest son of Robert F. Kennedy, Sr. and the best-known surviving scion of the Kennedy family dynasty, took the stage to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States. It was an iconic and consequential moment: A member of the Kennedy family, royalty in Democratic politics for generations, turning his back on the party of his family's legacy to endorse a Republican candidate. In so doing, Kennedy did something extraordinary; he stood on principle over politics and embraced actual democracy instead of the rigged candidate system created by the Democratic National Committee. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. TO APPEAR ON ‘FOX NEWS SUNDAY’ IN FIRST EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SINCE ENDORSING TRUMP In the space of a few sentences, Kennedy erased four days of speeches at the DNC. His clarion call for truth, accountability and the democratic system, has reverberated loudly for many middle of the road voters, people who feel alienated by the politics of both left and right, folks who no longer believe that people in positions of power care about their concerns at all. Having initially sought the nomination of the Democratic Party, Kennedy was blocked at every turn by President Joe Biden's supporters in the DNC. They wouldn't allow debates, wouldn't allow a full contest for the party's nomination. Even though Biden was mentally and physically a shell of the man he'd once been, the DNC protected Biden, arguing anyone sharing videos of his clear mental and physical deterioration was participating in \"cheap fakes.\" So too did their allies in the left-wing media. Remember, it was only 60 days ago that CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other left-wing media allies attacked anyone who dared to suggest Biden was anything other than sharp as a tack behind closed doors. Kennedy lambasted this in his address Friday afternoon endorsing Trump for president, and articulating the primary challenge of our times quite clearly. \"When a U.S. president colludes with, or outright coerces, media companies to censor political speech, it's an attack on our most sacred right of free expression,\" he said. \"And that's the very right upon which all of our constitutional rights rest.\" Democrats have become so corrupt that even a Kennedy can't support them any longer. RFK Jr. asserted that in the 16 months of his campaign, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, and CNN combined gave him only two live interviews. \"The mainstream media was once the guardian of the First Amendment and democrat principles, but has since joined the systemic attack on democracy,\" he said. To bring this point into clear focus, after ignoring him for 16 months, as soon as he endorsed Trump, CNN had a member of the Kennedy family on last night in primetime to attack RFK Jr. The network that wouldn't carry Kennedy himself or any of his arguments was happy to offer live primetime guest spots to members of his family who would trash him. All of this led to what I believe will be seen as an important legacy of the 2024 campaign. Democrats have become so corrupt that even a Kennedy can't support them any longer. Kennedy's embrace of Trump, which he compared to Abraham Lincoln's team of rivals in his address, represents yet another incredible twist in an election season that has so far been propelled by the unexpected. Less than two months ago, on June 27, Trump took the stage to debate Biden in Atlanta. I know it feels like two years since then, but consider what has happened since that night. Trump knocked out Biden, ending his political career. It was the first true knockout we've ever seen in the history of American presidential debates. It took several weeks -- including Trump becoming the first president to be shot by a would-be assassin since Ronald Reagan in 1981 -- for Biden to realize he couldn't get back up off the electoral canvas, but on July 21 -- three weeks and three days after the debate -- the Biden campaign finally waved the towel in the corner of the ring. Biden was done. He withdrew from the race and has barely been seen since. Next up, Kamala Harris. Yes, the same Kamala Harris who Democrats spent months arguing should be dropped from the political ticket because she was the least popular vice president in the history of modern American politics. Hell, Dick Cheney shot someone in the face while he was vice president(!), and was still more popular than Harris. In one fell swoop, without receiving a single vote for president, Democrats canceled the expressed will of 14 million primary voters and elevated Harris to the nomination. Amazingly, Harris, who has never received a single vote for president, is the nominee. Yes, the same Harris who dropped out of the 2020 presidential race before a single vote had been cast. The same Harris who most with functional brains realize would have never been the Democrat nominee if Biden had done what he should have done and announced he wasn't running in the late spring of 2023. That would have allowed an actual Democratic primary but, alas, we've all come to realize Democrats don't want elections, they want selections. Hillary Clinton in 2016, Biden in 2020, now Harris in 2024. They're all the product of the people running the DNC, the hand-selected nominees of the party, will of the voters be damned. The party that claims Trump is a threat to democracy has now, incredibly, charged Trump with felonies in three different states and Washington, D.C., seeking jail time in each case, removed the president who received the Democrat nomination for president and replaced him with a nominee who received not a single vote for that nomination, fought every third party challenger, including Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the green party, Cornel West, and the libertarian party, who has sought ballot access in the 2024 election, and dutifully hidden Harris from all media, refusing all interview requests and all press conference availabilities. This is not the democratic process. This is not how candidates should be chosen. Kennedy realized all of this. It's why he couldn't stand silently by and allow himself to be a spoiler in this race. It's why he felt compelled to speak out, stand on principle, and endorse the only presidential candidate who actually won a primary, to support the only presidential candidate who supports free speech and believes in sharing his vision for the world. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Ultimately, even if it required him to turn his back on the party that made his family a mythological heir to Camelot, Kennedy had only one choice. The result -- Trump and Kennedy are now a team. Thanks to the bevy of interviews, press conferences, and public events both men have had, we know exactly where Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy stand on all the issues. But we still don't have a single policy page on Harris' website. Her team has spent more time telling us what she doesn't believe than what she does.

So now, here we are, it's Harris vs. Trump and Kennedy, and if you're paying attention to the slightest degree, even if you're a lifelong Democrat like Kennedy, it isn't a tough call at all.

The Harris plan released earlier this month aims to boost the inventory of affordable housing by encouraging more construction, while also offering $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time buyers. Parrott, who is the co-owner of housing advisory firm Parrott Ryan Advisors and a former White House economic advisor, and Zandi pointed to the expansion of a tax break for developers known as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which would increase affordable rental supply. To add more affordable homes for purchase, the Harris plan would also allow builders to get a tax break on profits on homes that are built and sold to first-time buyers. Yet another part of the plan would create a new tax credit for renovating homes that couldn’t be sold for a price high enough to recoup repair costs. That would bring into the market additional supply that would otherwise sit unused. To overcome infrastructure shortfalls and any local political resistance, the Harris plan would provide more money for states and communities. “Each of these moves would be meaningful on its own, but together they would amount to the most aggressive supply-side push since the national investment in housing that followed World War II,” Parrott and Zandi wrote. That’s when the federal government provided assistance to veterans via the G.I. Bill, which included, among other things, favorable terms for buying a home. That spurred more demand and construction. Harris housing plan cost To be sure, the plan comes with a big price tag: $125 billion. It would have to be paid for with tax revenue or offset with spending cuts elsewhere, they noted. Otherwise, it would add to the federal budget deficit and help lift mortgage rates, making homes less affordable. But the upfront costs of boosting supply are far outweighed by the long-term costs of allowing the housing crisis to worsen, they warned. “Our lack of affordable housing will continue to depress savings, opportunity and growth in ways that will do long-term harm to the nation’s economy,” Parrott and Zandi said. “A thoughtful effort to address the problem now will ultimately lead to more growth and less cost.” Trump housing plan For his part, Donald Trump told Bloomberg that he would lower housing costs by easing environmental and permitting rules. But he also has suggested at campaign events that he would limit low-income housing developments in suburbs. The Republican Party’s 2024 platform blames high housing costs on illegal immigrants and vows to deport them, which some housing experts have said would reduce the availability of construction workers and add to costs. The platform also promises a mix of demand- and supply-side measures. “To help new home buyers, Republicans will reduce mortgage rates by slashing Inflation, open limited portions of Federal Lands to allow for new home construction, promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers, and cut unnecessary Regulations that raise housing costs,” it says.","summary":"\"Our lack of affordable housing will continue to depress savings, opportunity and growth in ways that will do long-term harm to the nation’s economy.\"","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/24/kamala-harris-housing-plan-affordable-construction-postwar-supply-boom-donald-trump/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2167179802-e1724529499345.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 21:18:08","author":"Jason Ma","authors":["Jason Ma"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":254851264,"title":"Sir Keir Starmer’s top aides love-bombed Kamala Harris’s team this week","text":"SEVERAL of Sir Starmer’s closest aides have been love bombing Kamala Harris’ team this week.

Later that night, he joined Trump at a campaign rally in Glendale, Arizona.During his speech, Kennedy Jr. mentioned the issues that he and Trump agree on such as \"having safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic,\" ending the Russia-Ukraine war, free speech and rebuilding the middle class.Before Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race, there were reports that he met with Trump and attempted to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, about his political future.The Washington Post reported in July that Kennedy Jr. spoke with Trump about endorsing the former president and taking a job his administration if he wins in November, according to people familiar with the matter. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign confirmed that he met with Trump \"to discuss national unity\" but didn't go into the specifics of the meeting.Meanwhile, Kennedy Jr.'s campaign officials told the Post in an August 14 report that he sought a meeting with Harris the week before to discuss a possible role in her administration if he supported her. The report said that the vice president did not show any interest in meeting with Kennedy Jr., according to people familiar with the matter.When he announced that he would drop out and endorse Trump, Kennedy Jr. said that the former president had \"asked to enlist me in his administration,\" but did not specify what role he may be given.On Tuesday, Trump told CNN that he \"probably would\" consider appointing Kennedy Jr. to a role in his administration if he wins the presidential race later this year.Trump has not been charged with any new crimes and neither he nor Kennedy Jr. has admitted to this alleged quid pro quo exchange.

The Guardian reported that legal experts warned that Nigeria and the other countries, which are signatories to the Genocide Convention and Geneva Conventions, are contravening the 26 January landmark ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding Israel’s military operations in Gaza. The ruling ordered Israel to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and reminded state parties to the genocide convention of their “common interest to ensure the prevention, suppression and punishment of genocide”. After the ICJ ruling, Israeli tanks, fighter jets, military vehicles and bulldozers continue to bombard Gaza and raze Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank using shipments from foreign countries to power them, The Guardian reported. The newspaper referenced an investigative research which was commissioned by Oil Change International (OCI), a global nonprofit, showing that some countries, including Nigeria, continued to supply crude oil and fuels to Israel to fuel its bombardments and further destruction of Gaza after the ICJ ruling. Energy supplies According to the news platform, the research analysed shipping logs, satellite images and other open-source industry data. It tracked 65 crude oil and fuel shipments to Israel between 21 October last year and 12 July. It identifies Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Gabon, Nigeria, Brazil and recently, Republic of the Congo and Italy as the major suppliers of crude oil to Israel. According to the research, the countries have supplied 4.1 million tons of crude oil to Israel, with almost half of the supply coming after the January ruling of the ICJ. The research also estimated two-thirds of crude came from investor-owned and private oil companies. It also found that the United States has supplied jet fuel, diesel and other refined petroleum products to Israel before and after the ICJ ruling. Almost 80 per cent of the supply to Israel in the last nine months was said to be shipped after the January ruling. Warnings, call for embargo “UN and other international law experts called for an energy embargo to prevent further human rights violations against the Palestinian people – and an investigation into any oil and fuels shipped to Israel that have been used to aid acts of alleged genocide and other serious international crimes,” the newspaper reported. The ICJ ruled that countries must cooperate to ensure an end to Israel’s illegal presence in the occupied Palestinian territory and must not render aid or assistance in maintaining the unlawful situation created by Israel. Israel rejected the ruling. “After the 26 January ICJ ruling, states cannot claim they did not know what they were risking to partake in,” Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory told The Guardian. “In the case of the US jet-fuel shipments, there are serious grounds to believe that there is a breach of the genocide convention for failure to prevent and disavowal of the ICJ January ruling and provisional measures,” said Albanese. “Other countries supplying oil and other fuels absolutely also warrant further investigation.” Omar Barghouti, co-founder of the boycott, divestment, sanctions (BDS) movement, which has called for an energy embargo on Israel, also told The Guardia, “Palestinians appreciate the diplomatic and rhetorical support of states such as Brazil, Russia, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, among others. However, this cannot exonerate their direct complicity in literally fueling Israel’s genocide and underlying system of settler-colonial apartheid.” The governments of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment, and neither did Greece or Albania. The President Joe Biden administration did not respond to the newspaper’s requests for comment, nor did Vice-President Kamala Harris’s presidential election campaign team. Corporate involvement Also, the research also highlighted the role of corporations in supplying fuel to Israel since the ruling, finding that just six major international fossil-fuel companies – BP, Chevron, Eni, ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies – could be responsible for 35 percent of crude oil supplied to Israel since October. David Tong, industry campaign manager at Oil Change International, told The Guardian, “Every day that oil companies provide fuel to Israel these companies expose themselves to potential legal action for their complicity in genocidal acts against civilians in Gaza.” Lydia de Leeuw, researcher and co-author of Fuelling the Flames in Gaza at the Dutch non-profit Somo, similarly told the newspaper, “Given the well-documented ongoing war crimes and warnings of a genocide, these oil corporations have the responsibility to identify and prevent any contribution to violations by the Israeli army.” Shell and Total declined The Guardian’s request to comment. BP and Exxon did not respond. A spokesperson for Chevron, which owns stakes in oil production in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and the Congo, denied any wrongdoing, “Chevron operates in compliance with all applicable laws,” the company told The Guardian. Also denying any wrong doing, Eni said, “In general, oil supplies primarily support the functioning of social, economic, and industrial systems in countries.” The research work, reported exclusively by The Guardian, indicates that African countries contributed a total of 37 percent crude oil exports to Israel. Of this figure, 9 per cent came from Nigeria, six per cent from the Republic of the Congo and 22 per cent from Gabon. While Azerbaijan remains the leading supplier of crude oil to Israel, Italy, Albania and Greece also supplied unrefined oil to the warring country. Devastating war In July, PREMIUM TIMES reported that an Israeli attack on a designated humanitarian zone claimed the lives of about 90 people and injured 300 others, according to Palestinian health officials. Authorities in Palestine said that Israel’s ground and air campaign in Gaza has killed more than 40,000 people, mostly civilians. Health officials feared the devastating war had driven most of the enclave’s 2.3 million people from their homes. The war began on 7 October after Hamas militants stormed across the border into Israeli communities. Israel said the militants killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 253 into captivity in Gaza. As of 15 August, the Palestinian Health Ministry said 40,005 Palestinians were dead and 92,401 wounded.","summary":"In a historic decision delivered in January 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered  Israel to take actions to ensure its forces do not commit acts of genocide in Gaza. \n\n\nThe post Gaza War: Nigeria, other Israel’s crude oil, fuel suppliers risk war crimes probe &#8211; Report appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.","url":"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/727641-gaza-war-nigeria-other-israels-crude-oil-fuel-suppliers-risk-war-crimes-probe-report.html","image":"https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2023/12/Damage_in_Gaza_Strip_during_the_October_2023_-_27-e1702381886967-1728x1080.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:58:08","author":"Mohammed Taoheed,Owei Lakemfa","authors":["Mohammed Taoheed","Owei Lakemfa"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":254851304,"title":"Media plots to fool us into thinking Kamala Harris is a good person","text":"If you’ve been following what the media has been churning out in recent weeks, surely you heard the great news. Kamala Harris is an awesome person. If you didn’t before, you now know that she’s a brilliant, compassionate, and deeply caring individual. Numerous articles and columns have been written recently explaining to us how wonderful Harris is. My view of Harris used to be that she was a callous individual, indifferent to suffering and willing to do what she thought she had to do to advance her political career. Now, given all of this new information, I’m not so sure. Perhaps it’s time for me to update my beliefs about Harris. Jason Kander, the former secretary of state of Missouri, wrote a piece this week where he recounted how Harris was the only person that would check in on him as he retreated from the political arena and received treatment for PTSD he suffered from as a veteran. Kander wrote, “At best, we’re friendly acquaintances who used to work in the same field. And that’s my point. She is the type of person who is thoughtful enough to treat a peer like a peer, even when that person has bowed out and is no longer really a peer at all. And that’s the kind of everyday decency I believe she’ll bring to the presidency.” This insight into Harris’ personal interactions certainly paints her as a thoughtful person who cares about the struggles of others despite having little to gain. Katie Porter wrote about her time working with Harris, recounting how compassionate she was despite Porter needing to care for her newborn. Porter wrote, “We changed lives on the ground. That’s how Kamala is: She sees things through, not stopping until people get help, because she cares about our families. When she called me to offer me the job as California monitor, I had a 2-month-old. Like many working moms, I had to bring my infant to work because she had nowhere else to go. […] I nervously confessed that I had my baby with me. Kamala didn’t hesitate. She asked how my baby and I were doing and how her siblings were adjusting. She wasn’t making small talk; she genuinely wanted to know.” Despite not birthing any children of her own, she is able to connect to and empathize with the challenges of a working mother – personality traits which are certainly desirable to have in our highest office. If she truly does embody these great virtues, then why has she shown such callousness when her actions have mattered the most? In 2011, the Supreme Court ordered California to release thousands of nonviolent prisoners who had been determined to pose little risk to the public. The problem was that California’s prisons were extremely overcrowded, which created truly awful conditions for the inmates. The court claimed that it violated their right against cruel and unusual punishment. With all of the power she wielded as California’s Attorney General, she fought tooth and nail to keep these suffering inmates in custody. A prisoner was dying per week because of poor medical care and overcrowding. In the Supreme Court’s opinion, Justice Anthony wrote that as many as 54 inmates had to share a single toilet and that suicidal inmates were placed in tiny cages for 24 hours at a time. Of course, Kamala knew of these inhumane conditions but repeatedly delayed proceedings and flat out ignored court orders to the point that they considered holding the state in contempt of court. She went so far as to challenge the Supreme Court’s authority to make such determinations … about the Constitution. After serving 13 years of his 27 year to life sentence, a judge ruled that Daniel Larsen was innocent and to be released. Harris challenged the release, claiming that Larsen didn’t provide proof of his innocence in time. So perhaps I won’t be updating my beliefs about Harris. What should be clear is that this is all part of a plan by the left-leaning media to bombard us with heartwarming stories with the intent of changing Kamala Harris’ image. The extent of this ridiculous PR project can be appreciated by reading an article by a New York Times columnist titled, “The Meaning – and Power – of Kamala Harris’ Smile” where he wrote that he “can’t stop noticing and basking in her happy face.” I was creeped out to say the least. But a virtuous and compassionate person doesn’t fight so hard against the easing of suffering and so vigorously to avoid dislodging the continued administration of cruelty.

We have a very different [U.S. Supreme] Court now than we had when marriage equality became the law of the land in 2015. We've lost three judges who ruled in the majority on that case. And I think we can't possibly overstate the importance of having Kamala Harris be the one who gets to nominate Supreme Court justices who actually care about protecting people's freedoms, protecting their fundamental rights and who understand and supports due process and equal protection under the law,\" Michigan's attorney general said.Newsweek has reached out to Nessel's office and Trump campaign via email for comment.Phang then asked, \"How worried are you about Donald Trump and his allies trying to repeat what they attempted to do four years ago?\" noting how Michigan is in the process of prosecuting fake electors who tried to subvert the state's 2020 election results.It comes after thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S Capitol building on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. The riot erupted following claims from Trump that the election had been stolen from him via widespread voter fraud. Despite there being no evidence to back up his claims, Trump's allies have continued to spread the same claims.\"I think it is probably his number one strategy...I think that what we saw in 2020, it is going to pale in comparison to what we are likely going to see in 2024 and, again, it is not my job to decide winners or losers. It is my job to defend the will of the people, whatever that might be. But I can tell you this: if the will of the people here in Michigan is that they support Kamala Harris as our next president of the United States, it is going to be tough,\" Nessel said.She added: \"I don't think anybody should underestimate how hard we are going to have to fight to defend people's votes against an effort by the Trump campaign to subvert democracy here in Michigan and likely in states all across the nation.\"Nessel announced felony charges against 16 Republicans \"for their role in the alleged false electors scheme\" in July 2023, accusing them of submitting false certificates that portrayed them as legitimate electors in the 2020 election, which saw Biden winning the state by more than 154,000 votes. Nessel has said all 16 people would face eight criminal charges, including forgery, conspiracy to commit election law forgery, and uttering and publishing. The top charges carry a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.More than a year later, the case still continues as preliminary examinations concluded earlier this month for six of the individuals charged with examinations for six others charged in the case that concluded in April.According to the Detroit Free Press, after all preliminary exams are completed, district Judge Kristen Simmons is expected to rule on whether there is sufficient evidence to send 12 of the people charged to a jury trial. Meanwhile, three others will have preliminary hearings at future dates.","summary":"Dana Nessel took the stage on night three of the Democratic National Convention as she gave a speech warning against a second Trump term.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/michigan-attorney-general-dana-nessel-issues-warning-donald-trump-1943987","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457477/dana-nessel.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:54:23","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.41},{"id":254851110,"title":"Nikki Haley in Taiwan says an isolationist policy is not healthy while expressing support for Trump","text":"Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on a visit to Taiwan Saturday that an isolationist policy isn't “healthy” and called on the Republican Party to stand with her country's allies, while still putting in good words for the party's nominee, Donald Trump. Haley, who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, told reporters in the capital, Taipei, that supporting U.S. allies, including Ukraine and Israel, is vital. She underscored the importance of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory, to be brought under control by force if necessary. “I don’t think the isolationist approach is healthy. I think America can never sit in a bubble and think that we won’t be affected,” she said. While the U.S. doesn’t formally recognize Taiwan, it is the island’s strongest backer and main arms provider. However, Trump’s attempt to reclaim the presidency has fueled worries. He said Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek published in July and dodged answering the question of whether he would defend the island against a possible Chinese military action. When Haley shuttered her own bid for the Republican nomination, she did not immediately endorse Trump, having accused him of causing chaos and disregarding the importance of U.S. alliances abroad. But in May she said she would be voting for him, while making it clear that she felt her former boss had work to do to win over voters who supported her. On Saturday, she spoke in Trump's favor. She said that having previously served with Trump's administration, “we did show American strength in the world,\" pointing to their pushback against China and their sanctioning of Russia and North Korea, among other efforts. “I think that all of that strength that we showed is the reason that we didn’t see any wars, we didn’t see any invasions, we didn’t see any harm that happened during that time. I think Donald Trump would bring that back,” she said. Trump has claimed that if elected, he would end the conflict in Ukraine before Inauguration Day in January. But Russia’s United Nations ambassador said he can’t. Trump’s public comments have varied between criticizing U.S. backing for Ukraine’s defense and supporting it, while his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has been a leader of Republican efforts to block what have been billions in U.S. military and financial assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022. Concerns among Ukraine and its supporters that the country could lose vital U.S. support have increased as Trump’s campaign surged. Haley criticized Trump's rival, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she would “do exactly” what President Joe Biden had done. She said Harris was part of his administration when the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and when the Hamas-Israel war broke out last year. “She was in the situation room right next to Joe Biden. She was there making the exact same decisions. Those decisions have made the world less safe,” she said. Haley added that while the Republicans and Democrats may not currently concur on much, they agree on “the threats of China,” adding that Taiwan is now looking “to make sure that if China starts a fight with them, that they are prepared to make sure that they can fight back.” She said her party should stand with the country's allies and make sure that U.S. shows strength around the world. She also said any authoritarian regime and “communists” harming or hurting other free countries should be a personal matter to the U.S. “We don’t want to see communist China win. We don’t want to see Russia win. We don’t want to see Iran or North Korea win,” she said. Haley met Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during this week's trip. She called for more international backing for the self-ruled island, a coordinated pushback against China’s claims over it, and for Taiwan to become a full member of the United Nations. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Saturday that 38 warplanes and 12 vessels from China were detected around the island during a 24-hour period from Friday morning. Thirty-two of the planes crossed the middle of the line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary that’s considered a buffer between the island and mainland. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The song was originally released by the US rock band – made up of Dave Grohl, Nate Mendel, Chris Shiflett and Pat Smear, Rami Jaffee, and Josh Freese – in 1997 and has become the latest tune to land Trump in hot water. It was played at an Arizona rally on Friday to introduce wildcard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. onto stage after he suspended his independent candidacy and endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee and hopeful to win the US election. When asked on social media if the band had given permission for its use, the account decisively replied: ‘No’. A statement later issued to PA confirmed: ‘Foo Fighters were not asked permission, and if they were they would not have granted it.’ Representatives for the band later followed up with Billboard to add that ‘appropriate actions are being taken’ and that any royalties received as a result of this usage will be donated to the Harris/Walz campaign. Let us be clear. pic.twitter.com/gexHWjPMYh— Foo Fighters (@foofighters) August 24, 2024 The music played behind Robert Kennedy Jr’s stage entrance (Picture: AP) A video of his entrance is currently still up on Kennedy Jr’s X account with the caption: ‘Unite America’. The nephew of the US’s 35th president, John F Kennedy, said he has been a Democrat since birth but has accused the party of ‘abandoning democracy’ and embarking on unjust ‘legal warfare’ against him and Trump. This is far from the first time the Republican presidential hopeful has faced issues for unauthorised music use. In the past few weeks alone, it has been reported that Beyonce threatened the Trump campaign with a cease-and-desist letter after her song Freedom was used in a 13-second social media video. The Foo Fighters are one of many artists to have complained about Trump’s song usage (Picture: Getty) The clip, uploaded by Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung, showed the Republican nominee deplaning in Michigan overlayed by the singer’s Lemonade hit and has since been deleted. Freedom is currently the unofficial anthem for the Democratic campaign run by vice-president Kamala Harris. Other artists who have voiced complaints this year also include Celine Dion for My Heart Will Go On and The Smiths with their song Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want. Celine Dion issued a brutal statement just weeks ago (Picture: Getty) ‘In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use,’ Celine’s statement read. ‘…And really, THAT song?’ As for Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, he responded: ‘Ahh…right…OK. I never in a million years would’ve thought this could come to pass. Consider this s**t shut right down right now.’ They are in good company. The Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Black Sabbath and Rihanna have also hit back against Trump over the years. Metro.co.uk has reached out to Foo Fighters for comment. Got a story?

Sullivan will travel to Beijing from August 27 to 29 in the first visit by a US national security adviser to China since 2016, although other senior officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken have visited over the past two years. The visit comes months ahead of US elections in November. The Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, would be expected, if she wins, to continue Biden’s approach of seeking dialogue with China while also maintaining pressure. Her Republican rival Donald Trump has vowed, at least rhetorically, to take a harder line, with some of his aides seeing a far-reaching global showdown with China. A senior US official told reporters that the Biden administration’s engagement with China did not indicate any softening of approach and that it continued to believe that “this is an intensely competitive relationship.” “We are committed to making the investments, strengthening our alliances, and taking the common steps on tech and national security that we need to take,” the official said, referring to sweeping restrictions on US technology transfers to China imposed under Biden. “We are committed to managing this competition responsibly, however, and preventing it from veering into conflict,” she added, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. A key area of friction has been Taiwan, the self-ruling democracy which Beijing considers its territory and has not ruled out “reuniting” through force. China has kept up its saber-rattling since the inauguration this year of President Lai Ching-te, whose party emphasises Taiwan’s separate identity. “We’re going to raise concern about the PRC’s increased military, diplomatic and economic pressure in Taiwan,” the administration official said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. “These activities are destabilising, risk escalation, and we’re going to continue to urge Beijing to engage in meaningful dialogue with Taipei,” she said. The official said Sullivan would also discuss the South China Sea, where tension has been rising between China and US ally the Philippines. Key role The official did not indicate that the United States expected breakthroughs on the trip, in which Sullivan will meet with China’s foreign policy supremo Wang Yi. The official said Sullivan will reiterate US concerns about China’s support for Russia in its major expansion of its defense industry since the Ukraine invasion. Beijing counters that, unlike the United States, it does not directly give weapons to either side. China has historically been eager to work with US national security advisers, seeing them as decision-makers close to the president who can negotiate away from the media spotlight that comes with the secretary of state or top leadership. The modern US-China relationship was launched when Henry Kissinger, then national security adviser to Richard Nixon, secretly visited Beijing in 1971 to lay the groundwork for normalisation of relations with the communist state. Sullivan and Wang have met four times over the last year and a half — once in Washington and the other times in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok — as well as alongside Biden and President Xi Jinping at their November summit in California. The meetings between Wang and Sullivan were sometimes announced only after they were finished and the two had spent long hours together behind closed doors. Sullivan will also speak to Wang about North Korea and the Middle East. China has criticised US support for Israel, and the United States has sought to call Beijing’s bluff by urging it to use its relations to rein in Iran.","summary":" \n\n\nWASHINGTON — Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, will visit China next week in a new bid to manage tensions months before US elections, the White House said on Friday.\n\n\nSullivan will travel to Beijing from August 27 to 29 in the first visit by a US national security adviser to China since 2016, although other senior officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken have visited over the past two years.\n\n\nThe visit comes months ahead of US elections in November.

The “Cruel Summer” singer and her NFL boyfriend were pictured on the balcony of her $17 million Rhode Island beach house on Saturday. In photos obtained by the Daily Mail, Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, both 34, can be seen having fun with friends and family, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his son, Bronze. Kelce’s sister-in-law, Kylie Kelce, and niece were also spotted on the mansion’s balcony. Travis’ brother, Jason Kelce, and Patrick’s wife, Brittany Mahomes, were also present, according to the Daily Mail. Though, they were not seen in photos. With Swift recently wrapping the European leg of her Eras Tour and Travis’ NFL season quickly approaching, the couple appears to be taking advantage of the brief time off they have together. “He has a long weekend break. [The Chiefs] were off yesterday, today and tomorrow, but he won’t be staying long. [He and Patrick] to be back tomorrow night for a Monday morning meeting with the team,” a source close to the NFL told Page Six exclusively. Brittany’s presence comes at an interesting time — just hours before these photos surfaced, she faced backlash for “liking” a post of Donald Trump’s on Instagram. Swift, of course, has not yet publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November’s election, but she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Following Brittany’s “like,” fans of the singer started speculating that the incident might cause some tension in their friendship. However, her attendance at Swift’s Rhode Island mansion seems to suggest that won’t be the case. This fun-filled get together comes a little over one year after Swift and Travis started dating. The last time they were seen together was in Germany, following her Eras Tour show on July 18. He wrapped his arm around her waist as they exited a venue together. Since then, they’ve been pretty busy. She was performing across Europe and he was training with the Chiefs. She’s now off until early October, while the Chiefs’ opening game against the Baltimore Ravens will take place on Sept. 5.","summary":"Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end were spotted having fun with friends and family, including Patrick and Brittany Mahomes.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/08/24/celebrity-news/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-pictured-at-her-17m-rhode-island-mansion/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/88250952.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:34:09","author":"Chris Rogers,Eileen Reslen","authors":["Chris Rogers","Eileen Reslen"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":254851404,"title":"Trump’s Biggest Critic, Niece Mary Has an Empowering Message for Kamala Harris Post DNC Speech","text":"Mary Trump, the outspoken rival of her uncle- presidential candidate Donald Trump, was present at the four-day Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. She also posted a brief social media message endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris' acceptance speech. She penned on X, \"We are witnessing history tonight. #DNC2024.\" In another X post, she demonstrated her unwavering support for Harris by remarking, \"Kamala has been part of the best administration of my lifetime. Now let’s nominate her for President of the United States of America.\" A third tweet characterized the opening night of the convention as 'incredible'. She shared a picture of the United Centre and captioned the same, \"We're not going back!\" alluding to Donald's first and so far only term as POTUS. In another statement she made on Tuesday, she gushed, \"I have never been more proud to be a Democrat than this week.\" In the lead-up to the debate in early September, Mary has also offered Harris some advice, including the suggestion that she draw on her experience as a prosecutor. As reported by USA Today, she opined, \"Honestly, my advice to her would be to keep doing what you're doing. I think the setup of the prosecutor versus the criminal is right in her wheelhouse, but she has also proven not to be afraid to mock Donald because he deserves our mockery. I like the fact that she refers to him as Donald because he doesn't deserve anybody's respect at this point, and she will not let him get away with lying repeatedly.\" Additionally, she also argued that Harris should focus on discrediting the president's lies rather than outlining her policies. \"I think she [Harris] needs to understand that she is going to have to do the job of fact-checking in real time and should focus more on uncovering Donald Trump's nonsense by refuting his lies and underscoring just how dangerous his vision for America is, and not worry so much about outlining the Democratic party's policy positions. It will be the first time a lot of the American people actually see what a petty, small, insecure, and weak man Donald Trump really is.\" Much to Mary's delight, Harris in her DNC speech did precisely that— cautioned that the former president's docile demeanor concealed a grave danger to the American people. As reported by Deadline, she stated, \"Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.\" Not to be outdone, Donald too took to Truth Social to respond with several posts. He mocked Harris' speech and shared it on his platform, \"Too many 'Thank yous', too rapidly said, what’s going on with her?\" In yet another post he stated, \"A lot of talk about childhood, we’ve got to get to the Border, Inflation, and Crime!\" The former president contacted conservative news outlets Fox News and Newsmax to share his thoughts shortly after Harris finished speaking. He stated, \"I personally thought it was a terrible speech. It was very nonspecific. It was also very short.

Jeff Van Drew: I get why RFK Jr. left the Democratic Party","text":"The Democratic Party is not the party it used to be. As someone who spent nearly two decades in the New Jersey state legislature as a Democrat before moving to the United States Congress, I have had a front-row seat to the drastic changes within the party over the years. When I first entered politics, the Democratic Party was dedicated to standing up for the working class. We were focused on fairness and supporting those who needed it most. Regardless of differences between the political parties, we all still believed that the Democratic Party leadership loved America and saw it as the best nation on the face of the earth. This is no longer true. Over the years, the party has veered off its original course. Instead of championing the needs of everyday Americans, it now seems to be driven more by corporate interests and big donors. The policies coming out of the party often favor the wealthy, leaving hardworking average Americans behind. As elected representatives of the people of America, it is our privilege and our duty to serve in their interests. The Democratic Party has failed to do this time and time again. Today, their policies favor big corporations at the expense of American workers and small businesses. Trade deals and economic policies that once aimed to support local businesses now often prioritize the interests of multinational companies. They choose to rely on foreign entities for energy rather than bring energy dependence back home to America, putting jobs and our national energy security at risk. CONGRESSMAN WHO LEFT DEMOCRATS BLISTERS BIDEN ADMIN AS ‘WORST IN AMERICAN HISTORY’ Internationally, the Democratic Party's lack of decisive leadership has weakened our global standing, emboldened adversaries, and neglected crucial allies. Domestically, the Biden-Harris administration has led to unprecedented economic strain since they took office, with inflation up almost 21% and Americans spending $13,000 more annually on basics. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s move to denounce the Democratic Party and endorse Donald Trump should serve as a wake-up call to their leadership that there is a need for substantial change. As a legacy Democrat, RFK’s choice to prioritize the country over party loyalty shows just how far the party has drifted from its core values. His stance reflects the growing sentiment among Americans that the Democratic Party no longer aligns with the nation’s needs. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I saw a similar sentiment when I ran against Ted Kennedy’s daughter-in-law, Amy Kennedy, in 2020. Despite having her family’s substantial backing and resources, she couldn’t overcome the growing frustration among voters. People in South Jersey were fed up with the direction the Democratic Party had taken. They were looking for a change, a departure from the status quo that the party had come to represent. Americans across the nation are tired of the new burdens they bear under this administration. Look at our nation’s current state: rising illegal border crossings that have led to tragic loss of innocent life, and an economy struggling under the weight of rampant inflation. The Democratic Party’s responses to these critical issues have been underwhelming at best. Vice President Kamala Harris’s recent speech at the Democratic National Convention, filled with lofty promises and goals, rings hollow when weighed against nearly four years of inaction and failure to address pressing concerns. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A political shift is urgently needed, one that genuinely represents the interests of everyday Americans and confronts our nation’s challenges head-on. We need an approach that prioritizes the people’s needs and delivers real solutions. Under President Donald J.

Famous for her sharp wit and fierce critiques, Warren seized the moment to roast both Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, with a quip that cleverly played off a viral internet meme, proving once again that she’s not just a policy wonk but also got serious comedic chops. She said, “Trust Donald Trump and JD Vance to look out for your family? Shoot, I wouldn’t trust them to move my couch.” As Warren took the stage, the energy in the United Arena was electric. The crowd’s applause was deafening, with Warren taking a moment to soak in the overwhelming support. Dressed in her signature blue, the senator was visibly pleased as she mouthed ‘thank you’ to the cheering crowd. She remarked, “You know what I love best about Kamala Harris? Kamala Harris can’t be bought— and she can’t be bossed around. You know what else I love about Kamala? She gets it. We need to make life more affordable for working people,” as reported by the Daily Mail. As per HuffPost, Warren praised Harris, contrasting her dedication to working families to Trump’s self-serving behavior. She exclaimed, “We need to make life more affordable for working people. Donald Trump, the felon, has no plans to lower costs for families. He doesn’t know how, and basically, he doesn’t really care. When did he ever fill up a gas tank or worry about a grocery bill? The only bills he worries about are from his criminal defense lawyers.” Warren was not the only one to roast Trump at the DNC convention. President Joe Biden didn’t mince words either when he stressed, “Yet, I believe then and I believe now, that progress was and is possible. Justice is achievable, and our best days are not behind us. They are before us…With a grateful heart, I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed. Democracy has delivered, and now democracy must be preserved. I hope you know how grateful I am to all of you. Giving my word as a Biden, I can honestly say I’m more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States senator.” He further added, “Violent crime has dropped to the lowest level of more than 50 years, and crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon. We have had one of the most extraordinary four years of progress ever, period. Just think about it. COVID-19 no longer controls our lives. We have gone from economic crisis to the strongest economy in the entire world.”","summary":"Warren also praised Harris, contrasting her dedication to working families to Trump’s self-serving behavior.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/elizabeth-warren-steals-the-show-at-the-dnc-with-a-perfectly-timed-couch-joke","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/712293/uploads/e204b140-61e8-11ef-be70-e1fe842fb7ef_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.163},{"id":254849602,"title":"Can Democrats successfully persuade anti-Trump Republicans to support Kamala Harris?","text":"The Democratic National Convention had the usual political fanfare from prominent Democrats making thunderous speeches and attendees decked out in patriotic red, white and blue. But it also featured one unusual standout element for such a massive blue celebration: Republicans. Between remarks from the most beloved and powerful Democrats in the country over four days was a parade of current and former Republicans all speaking in support of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. ‘If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, you’re not a Democrat, you’re a patriot,’ declared former Republican Georgia Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan taking the stage at the DNC to wild cheering. Former national security official in the Trump White House Olivia Troye said in her remarks ‘you’re aren’t voting for a Democrat, you’re voting for democracy.’ Former GOP Congressman Adam Kinzinger declared Democrats ‘love this country just as much as we do’ as the crowd chanted ‘USA!’ And former top Melania Trump aide and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham claimed Trump calls his supporters ‘basement dwellers’ behind closed doors. Republican strategist Kevin Madden said the speakers themselves won’t have a major impact because few voters know who they are, but he believes ‘they are an avatar for a lot of Republicans who describe themselves as “conscientious objectors” to Trump’s vision of their party.’ ‘There are enough of them in battleground states to make a difference,’ Madden said. The Harris campaign has been making a concerted effort to engage Republican and Independent voters ready to reject the former Republican president and have recruited Republicans to help. It was on full display at the United Center in Chicago and a stark contrast from the Republican National Convention a month earlier where no Democrats took the stage in Milwaukee. After her speech, Grisham said she was terrified to make an appearance at the DNC but that everyone was welcoming. She said even if it only changes the minds of just a few Republicans and Independents, her appearance would have been worth it. ‘The winning strategy for Kamala Harris is to reanimate and remobilize the anti-Trump coalition that defeated Donald Trump in 2020 and in that coalition on the margins are the center right swing voters who have historically identified as Republicans,’ said John Conway from Republicans Voters against Trump. He argued the inclusion gave others ‘permission’ to vote blue. Conway’s group has been conducting focus groups and outreach to such voters and noted the convention did not just include ‘elite’ Republicans but everyday GOP voters. Throughout the four day event were a series of videos featuring former Trump voters playing on big screen as millions of Americans tuned in to the convention from home. Former Trump voter Kyle Sweetser, a Republican from Alabama, also walked on stage and shared that he was voting for a Democrat for the first time in his life in front of thousands of Democrats. ‘I feel more at home here than in today’s Republican party,’ said John Giles, GOP Mayor of Mesa, Arizona, who also spoke at a recent Harris rally in his battleground state. Giles invoked late Republican Senator and GOP presidential nominee John McCain during his speech when he declared ‘Country First.’ The push to flip Republicans started while Biden was still running for reelection. The Biden-Harris campaign jumped on welcoming dejected Nikki Haley primary voters into the fold as Trump attacked her candidacy earlier this year. Haley has since announced she would vote for Trump but that has not stopped Democrats from seeking support from her voters. In June, the campaign announced the addition of a full-time National Republican Engagement Director dedicated to furthering outreach to Independents and moderate Republicans. Virginian Austin Weatherford was the former chief of staff for Kinzinger with 25 years of GOP political experience. He said the convention programming was just a latest effort to ‘reach out to anti-Trump Republicans,’ and they will continue to remind Republican and Independent voters ‘Donald Trump doesn’t represent their values.’ The campaign has also been regularly in touch with GOP leaders and organizations that want to combat Trump’s vision for the country, according to a campaign official and will continue to work behind the scenes to help secure support. It has spent more than seven figures on ads targeting swing voters and earlier this month launched Republicans for Harris, a grassroots program to conduct outreach efforts to millions of GOP voters. Critics have questioned whether convention organizers should have given so much time to Republicans during the event. Some of the speakers acknowledged they were still Republicans and didn’t agree with Harris on policy. Questions have also been raised over whether the GOP voters who split for Biden in 2020 would also vote for the vice president, a black woman who ran to the left of Biden in the 2020 primary and Republicans have attacked as more liberal. But Conway’s research has found those Republican voters who broke for Biden in 2020 had more concerns about the president than the vice president heading into November. ‘It was clear that Joe Biden was facing issues from these voters, but those were Joe Biden specific problems,’ he said. Conway said they really ‘saw the bottom drop out’ after the president’s disastrous June debate, but with Harris at the top of the ticket, they’ve seen a ‘sharp rebound’ with Harris at the top of the ticket including among 2016 Trump, 2020 Biden voters.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Democratic National Convention had the usual political fanfare from prominent Democrats&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Can Democrats successfully persuade anti-Trump Republicans to support Kamala Harris? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/can-democrats-successfully-persuade-anti-trump-republicans-to-support-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Democrats-are-desperately-trying-to-flip-Republican.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 20:04:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.184},{"id":254849262,"title":"STOSSEL: The REAL Kamala Harris","text":"Harris needs this media cover, because she says radical things, like wanting “equity” over equality and equal opportunity. “There’s a big difference,” she says in an animated video. “Equality suggests everyone should get the same amount.

The first speaker, Hala Hijazi, was in tears before she'd even finished introducing herself to the room. \"I'm here because I've had over 100 of my family killed in Gaza,\" Hijazi said. \"Just two last week.\" For years, Hijazi's served the Democratic Party and its causes in San Francisco: fundraising, doorknocking for candidates, and serving on the board of a group that trains Democratic women to run for office. But for all her public service, she said, she felt she'd let her family in Gaza down. \"I feel guilty because for 25 years I've been living my American dream while they've been under occupation, struggling and dying,\" she said. \"I'm a fraud for not speaking up for them for the past 25 years. But that has changed.\" Hijazi is part of a growing Democratic movement pressuring the party, from within, to rein in military support for Israel. But it's up against some powerful forces that want to maintain the status quo. \"Dark money\" is a big one, Jewish ex-congressman Andy Levin told the panel event. Pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC spent millions to help another Democrat unseat Levin in 2022, after he spoke out on Palestinian rights. It recently did the same thing to two other outspoken Democrats in Congress. (AIPAC says the success of the candidates it backs shows it is \"good politics and good policy to stand with the Jewish state\".) But Levin is optimistic about the party's new presidential candidate. He points to her impassioned calls for a ceasefire back in March, and her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington last month. \"She refused to go to his absurd speech to a joint session of Congress,\" Levin said. \"Then when she met with him, she did speak some truth to power to him. I don't think that's that easy.\" Hijazi has hope too. As a longtime Democratic organiser in Harris's home state of California, she's known the vice-president for more than 25 years. \"She's trying,\" Hijazi told the panel. \"We have to hold her accountable too, but we also have to give her a chance.\" First 'Genocide Joe', now 'Killer Kamala' As the panel was taking place in a packed conference room, pro-Palestinian protesters were gathering in a park closer to the convention arena. \"Genocide Joe\" has long been a popular chant at these protests. This time, the catchcry was \"Killer Kamala\". The US gives Israel several billions of dollars' worth of military support each year, and President Joe Biden ticked off on a $US14.1 billion boost in April. Protesters who spoke to the ABC had little faith in Harris adopting any different stance to Biden. \"Her political career, if you trace it, she has received heavy backing from many of the same Zionist donors who are backing Joe Biden,\" said Nima Homami, who'd travelled from Ohio for the protest. \"I don't know, honestly, if the Democrats will ever listen. It feels like there's just too much money involved.\" But inside the Democratic Party tent, the lobbying efforts persist. Most of the delegates attending the convention on behalf of their state parties were there to support Harris. But about 30 were there to represent Democrats who voted \"uncommitted\" when asked to choose the party's presidential candidate in primary elections this year. \"We saw 101,000 'uncommitted' voters in Michigan,\" said Jonathan Simonds, an uncommitted delegate from Hawaii. \"We saw almost 800,000 uncommitted voters across the country in the primary, and those are Democrats. \"I think that some of them will vote for Harris either way, and wanted to make a statement. \"But I think that there's a certain proportion of those voters who will maybe not vote for Trump, but won't feel inspired enough to go to the polls for Harris.\" The phone call that angered uncommitted delegates The Uncommitted National Movement's main demand is for an arms embargo, and they point to a series of polls showing declining support among Democrats for American military aid to Israel. In a YouGov/Economist poll this month, 49 per cent of likely Harris voters were in favour of America reducing military aid to Israel, compared to 29 per cent who wanted it maintained, and 9 per cent who favoured an increase. The movement also requested a speaking spot at the convention for a Palestinian American. They provided the DNC with a shortlist of elected Democrats to choose from. \"The DNC kept telling us that they would get back to us, and they were working on it, and to be patient,\" Asma Mohammed, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota, told the ABC. \"And finally, [Wednesday] at 8pm they told us the answer was no.\" Some uncommitted delegates responded by staging a 24-hour sit-in next to the convention arena, sleeping on the concrete outside the stadium. One of the speakers on the shortlist was Georgia state Democrat Ruwa Romman, who prepared a speech about her family's Palestinian roots and their recent pain, but did not directly criticise the Biden administration. \"Let's commit to each other, to electing Vice-President Harris and defeating Donald Trump, who uses my identity as a Palestinian as a slur,\" she said in the speech, which she delivered at a press conference outside the stadium instead. A 'boneheaded mistake' When Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler was asked why the movement's request for a speaker was rejected, he did not directly answer. But he said: \"We're proud and glad they're here. We've worked to engage them throughout the convention. We're proud of the fact that we held panel conversations with members.\" James Zogby, the founder of the Arab America Institute and a former member of the Democratic National Committee's executive, said the decision \"was an unforced error, it was stupid, and it will cost support\". \"The idea of not having a Palestinian speaker was the most boneheaded mistake I've seen in politics in a long time,\" said Zogby, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights. \"There are many votes that they may lose because they didn't have one.\" But Harris faces the reverse pressure from inside the party, too. Some Democrats want to see more support for Israel from the party's leadership. \"They've handled it OK – not as strong as I would like,\" said Richard Levik, a volunteer at the convention who also attended a small pro-Israel rally outside. \"If [the October 7 attack] happened to us, we'd be doing more than what Israel has done. And we support them in fighting a war that Hamas started.\" Last month, Netanyahu told Congress that more American weapons could help end the war. \"Give us the tools faster, and we’ll finish the job faster,\" he said. The Israel-Gaza war is not a top priority issue for most American voters, polls have consistently shown. But experts say it could prove critical in Michigan, partly because of its large Arab American and Muslim population. And that state could in turn prove critical to the election result. \"The major element of a rapprochement between Harris-Walz and the Arab Americans in Michigan would be, at a minimum, to have a ceasefire,\" said Michael Traugott, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. \"That would probably affect two or three or four percentage points of the vote in Michigan, but that could make a difference in the actual outcome.\" What's next for the uncommitted? On the final night of the convention, the uncommitted delegates ended their sit-in and walked into the arena, with their arms locked, in time to hear Harris's speech. They did not expect to hear support for an arms embargo. But some in the movement were hoping, as a minimum, Harris would use her convention speech to commit to following American and international law regarding weapons provisions. Her remarks fell short of what they'd hoped for. \"I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organisation called Hamas caused on October 7,\" she said. As some shouts of \"free Palestine\" were heard in the crowd, Harris went on to describe the scale of suffering in Gaza as \"devastating\" and \"heartbreaking\". \"President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realise their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.\" The uncommitted movement is now demanding Harris meet with their leaders, and impacted Palestinian families, by September 15. They have not spelled out what they will do if she refuses. \"We're not going anywhere,\" said uncommitted delegate Jeremiah Ellison, who serves on the Minneapolis City Council. \"We're not going to accept rejection. We're long-time party activists. We're long-time community organisers. We know how to mobilise.\" — with Phoebe Hosier in Washington DC","summary":"While America's Democratic diehards enjoyed pep talks and pop music at their party-vibes convention this week, a smaller panel event on the sidelines was striking a very different tone. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-25/democratic-convention-uncommitted-movement-kamala-harris/104267026","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/64f3453efb435cc985e659142bbe52ad?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2384&cropW=4238&xPos=1&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:59:57","author":"Brad Ryan,Phoebe Hosier","authors":["Brad Ryan","Phoebe Hosier"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":254848628,"title":"Grocer turned House GOP member denounced Kamala Harris price control plan","text":"An Ohio grocer turned Congressman denounced Vice President Harris’ price control scheme — warning of catastrophic consequences for businesses and consumers alike should it be enacted. Freshman Rep. Michael Rulli, R-Ohio, owns Rulli Bros. grocery chain and said profit margins are notoriously thin already, and any additional regulations could spell doom for businesses like his, which was started by his father in 1917. “This will be a nail in the coffin of this industry that no one can imagine,” Rulli told Fox News. “The net profit in grocery stores is about one and a half [percent] — if you’re doing really good, one and three quarters. Just in layman’s terms, it’s about a $1.50 for every $100 that you go through the registers. And what we’ve seen in the last three to four years has been pretty horrific,” he continued. Price controls will mean shortages of even the most basic household items, he warned. “If the Harris administration tells Procter & Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, that this Tide right here that I’m selling today for $4.99 has to stay $4.99 for the next four years, what will happen is that Procter & Gamble will just simply choose not to make this product,” he continued. “And you will be living in Cuba or Venezuela.” During her term as Vice President, Kamala Harris oversaw a period of sharp inflation which has devastated consumers and businesses. Last week she unveiled a policy against “price gouging” that would limit how much stores could charge for certain foodstuffs. Critics blasted the plan as naked communism, or “Kamunism” as The Post page 1 headline described it. “Many of these smaller and independent grocery stores will go out of business. You’ve already seen it happening gradually over the last 20 or 30 years, but I would say just recently within the 80-mile circumference I’m sitting in right now, there’s been five grocery stores that have gone out of business in the last two years,” said Rulli, who came to Congress after a special election in June to replace retired GOP Rep. Bill Johnson. Harris defenders point out that large food manufacturers have seen record profits in recent years. Between 2019 and 2023 Hershey profits jumped 62% while General Mills and Kraft Heinz both saw 48% growth, according to The Wall Street Journal.","summary":"An Ohio grocer turned Congressman denounced Vice President Harris' price control scheme -- warning of catastrophic consequences for businesses and consumers alike should it be enacted.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/24/us-news/grocer-turned-house-gop-member-denounced-kamala-harris-price-control-plan/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/rep-michael-rulli-r-ohio-88245685.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:57:24","author":"Jon Levine","authors":["Jon Levine"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":254848302,"title":"Kamala Harris Sees Polling Boost During DNC","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has extended her lead over former President Donald Trump among registered voters, according to new polling data released during the Democratic National Convention (DNC).The Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit research organization, conducted a survey on August 19 to August 23 as the Democratic Party formally nominated Harris as its presidential candidate.The national poll reveals a growing generational and demographic divide in voter preferences. Harris holds a substantial lead among 18- to 34-year-olds, with 59 percent favoring Harris compared to 30 percent for Trump. This advantage is even more pronounced among Black voters, where Harris leads 67 percent to 16 percent, and Hispanic voters, where she maintains a 57 percent to 33 percent edge.However, Trump continues to perform well with older and white voters. The former president is the preferred choice for 49 percent of voters over 54, compared to 40 percent for Harris. Among white voters, Trump leads 51 percent to 39 percent.The Harris campaign's effective use of social media has contributed to what analysts describe as an \"extended honeymoon period\" for the candidate. Memes and viral content have helped generate enthusiasm, particularly among younger voters. Yet this strategy also presents a challenge: translating online engagement into actual votes in November.Newsweek contacted the Harris and Trump campaign via email on Saturday afternoon for comment.While youth voter turnout reached a record high in 2020, it still only surpassed 50 percent, significantly lower than the participation rates of older age groups.The Angus Reid survey also highlights potential hurdles facing Harris as she seeks to become the first woman elected to the presidency. A striking 74 percent of respondents believe it is more difficult for a woman to be elected to high political office, despite 59 percent saying there is \"no difference\" between genders in competently performing the job once in office.The poll also delved into voters' emotional responses to the candidates. Notably, 71 percent of Harris supporters say her potential victory makes them \"hopeful,\" while 63 percent of Trump supporters express the same sentiment about a possible second term for the former president.However, the prospect of the opposing candidate winning elicits worry and fear from both camps, with Trump supporters expressing slightly higher levels of concern (57 percent worry, 38 percent fear) compared to Harris backers (47 percent worry, 45 precent fear).When asked to describe the candidates, voters most frequently characterized Harris as \"dishonest\" (36 percent), \"strong\" (36 precent), \"corrupt\" (32 percent), \"inspiring\" (31 percent), and \"strategic\" (29 percent). Trump, on the other hand, was primarily described as \"arrogant\" (62 percent), a \"bully\" (48 percent), \"corrupt\" (45 percent), \"dishonest\" (45 precent), and \"strong\" (38 percent).The Angus Reid survey identified the cost of living as the top issue facing the United States, with 58 percent of voters citing it as their primary concern. This was followed by the economy more broadly (28 percent), border security (27 percent), healthcare (25 percent) and reproductive rights (23 precent).A newly released national poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU) and Braun Research finds Harris leading Trump by a 7-point margin. The poll of 801 registered voters conducted between August 17 and 20 shows 50 percent of voters support Harris while 43 percent support Trump. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.Broken down by party, 95 percent of surveyed Democrats, 38 percent of independents, and 2 percent of Republicans back Harris. A third of independents, 33 percent, back Trump, while 95 percent of Republicans and 3 percent of Democrats support him.Contrary to the FDU poll's findings, a Rasmussen Reports poll released Thursday found Trump leading Harris by 3 percentage points, 49 to 46 percent. The survey of 1,893 likely voters was conducted on August 15 and between August 18 and 21. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.Most national aggregate polls place Harris at the top of the race, with RealClearPolitics showing Harris up by 1.5 percentage points, 48.4 percent to Trump's 46.9 percent, and The New York Times aggregate showing Harris with a 2-percentage point lead, 49 to 47 percent. Other aggregates show larger margins, such as FiveThirtyEight, which finds Harris up by 3.6 percentage points, 47.2 to 43.6 percent. Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin also shows Harris leading, putting her at 48 percent and Trump at 43.7 percent.The race has been further complicated by the recent withdrawal of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had been drawing about 5 percent in national polls. Kennedy officially dropped out on Friday and endorsed Trump.As the campaign enters its post-convention phase, both candidates face significant challenges. For Harris, the task will be to maintain her momentum and translate her current polling advantage into Electoral College votes. Trump, meanwhile, must work to broaden his appeal beyond his base and address the concerns of swing voters who may be wary of a second Trump term.With just over two months until Election Day, the race remains highly competitive as the campaigns continue to narrow their focuses on the crucial swing states.While Harris appears to have received a convention bounce, the true test will come in the weeks ahead as voters begin to engage more deeply with the candidates and their policies. As always in American presidential politics, it's likely to be a hard-fought contest right up until November.","summary":"Harris extends lead over Trump in new polls during DNC, revealing generational and demographic divides as the election nears.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-polling-boost-dnc-donald-trump-1943966","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457453/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:51:04","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.305},{"id":254848416,"title":"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce soak up last weeks of summer before NFL season by shacking up at her $17M Rhode Island mansion","text":"EXCLUSIVETaylor Swift and Travis Kelce soak up last weeks of summer before NFL season by shacking up at her $17M Rhode Island mansion READ MORE: REVEALED: Travis Kelce's $31k gift to Taylor Swift as her tour ends By Karen Ruiz For Dailymail.com and Emma James In Westerly, Rhode Island For Dailymail.Com Published: 19:24 BST, 24 August 2024 | Updated: 20:52 BST, 24 August 2024 e-mail 86 shares 102 View comments With her European tour behind her and the NFL season approaching, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are making the most of their downtime with a much-needed romantic reunion - but only for a 'fortnight' - DailyMail.com can reveal.

Taylor and Travis were accompanied by Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany, enjoying the sunshine ahead of the season - with the quarterback and tight end enduring a difficult pre-season with three straight losses. Kylie and Jason joined the all-star Chiefs line up with their children, as the latter continues to enjoy his first offseason after retirement, and ahead of his new TV role with Amazon Prime, starting next month. The presence of Brittany comes at a potentially-difficult time, just hours after she liked a Donald Trump post on social media, sparking huge backlash. While Taylor has not publicly backed either Kamala Harris or Trump ahead of November's election, she previously endorsed President Joe Biden in 2020. Fans had speculated over whether Brittany's apparent Trump endorsement might cause a rift in their friendship, but her attendance at the Rhode Island festivities appears to signal that won't be the case. Taylor seems to be letting her hair down after missing out on her annual July 4 bash because she was on tour, with sold-out dates across Europe. The lovebirds, who began dating just about a year ago, have spent much of their time jetting off to see one another amid their busy schedules since the start of their romance. The $17million vacation home achieved celebrity status after it became the site of Taylor's legendary star-studded Independence Day parties Their turn next? Patrick, Taylor and Travis crowd around Sterling on the Rhode Island balcony The trio laughed as they chatted away during their vacation ahead of the new NFL season They have previously shacked up at each other's various pads across the country, but it is believed to be Travis's first time at his girlfriend's Watch Hill manse. As reported by DailyMail.com at the time, they spent a week together during the pop icon's last tour hiatus which coincided with the NFL off-season in March. The two enjoyed quality time together at her home base in Beverly Hills after a whirlwind few months of jet-setting and international rendezvous as a long distance couple. Swift was reported to have purchased the Colonial-style mansion, also known as High Watch, with cash back in 2013. Sitting on five acres with 11,000 square feet, eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, and its own private beach, the sprawling residence is the most expensive home in the state. With an expansive backyard and massive swimming pool overlooking the ocean, the pad makes for the perfect summer home. And Kelce wouldn't be the first boyfriend to visit the iconic residence. The Reputation hitmaker has been snapped over the years at the home canoodling with her former flames such as exes Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston.

Sources tell DailyMail.com Swift landed back in the US on Wednesday, while Kelce, who has been playing in pre-season games, arrived in Rhode Island on Friday. Kelce had been seen being every inch the supportive boyfriend throughout his girlfriend's European tour earlier this summer, making appearances in Dublin, Paris, London, and Amsterdam. He attended his last concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany where he was seen hugging the popstar at the end of her set in July before reporting to Chiefs training camp in Kansas City. He later kicked off the NFL pre-season on August 8, with the team playing the Chicago Bears on Thursday. He is set to return to the field on September 5 for the first official game of the NFL season.

And it is likely she will return the favor and support her man at his games during her hiatus. While he may have been busy training for another exciting run on the field, he still has time for romantic gestures. Earlier this week the football star was reported to have splashed out over $30,000 on flowers for Taylor to congratulate her on the end of the European leg of her Eras Tour. According to The Sun, Kelce ordered a huge 51 boxes of red roses that greeted his girlfriend when she returned to the US.

Swift now has no shows on her schedule until the Eras Tour, which has surpassed $1billion in revenue, returns to the United States in October and ends in Canada in December. A report emerged last week that said Kelce and Swift have found ways to 'prioritize' each other despite their hectic schedules and being in different countries for a lot of their relationship. 'Taylor and Travis always prioritize each other even when they are physically apart. They are still in constant communication texting and FaceTiming each other,' per ET. Swift and Kelce are 'very affectionate with each other even when they're apart,' added ET, with the Chief showing his affection for the 'Anti-Hero' singer through lavish gifts.

Appearing on The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, Haberman was played a clip of the former president calling into Fox News on Thursday after Harris’s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. As Trump criticized Harris, he appeared to be inadvertently pressing buttons on his phone. Blitzer noted that Trump also called into Fox News’s smaller rightwing challenger Newsmax, asking Haberman what the interviews said about Trump’s “mindset.” “He’s very reactive ... when he is not in command,” The New York Times journalist said. “And we have seen this over the course of the last nine years that he’s been in politics or in the political arena. He is clearly jarred by her. He has been trying to get back into the national conversation for several weeks now ever since President Biden announced he wasn’t running for re-election.” Former President Barack Obama mocked Trump’s obsession with crowd sizes during the DNC and former First Lady Michelle Obama also gave remarks in which she went straight at Trump. “Both of the Obamas’ speeches got under his skin,” Haberman said. “He is very reactive to both of them. We have seen that since 2011 when Trump spread the lie that President Obama was possibly born in Kenya and therefore illegitimate to be president. I think you’re going to see more of this.” During Trump’s call-in with Fox News, the former president appeared to get agitated at a question from host Martha MacCallum. “There’s been a huge appeal and momentum for women voters. [Harris] is trying to pull the youth vote, the Hispanic vote, the Black vote back in her direction. Polls show that she’s having some success in that at this point. What are you going to do? What’s your strategy to rebuild the momentum that you had with those voters?” she asked. “No, she’s not having success, I’m having success,” Trump said. He claimed to be doing well in polls with Hispanic and Black voters, adding that he was leading in the polls and in “almost every” key battleground state. “No, it’s only in your eyes that they have that, Martha,” Trump said.","summary":"Maggie Haberman says Trump is ‘clearly jarred’ by Harris and that the Obamas’ DNC speeches ‘got under his skin’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-2024-race-b2601403.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/24/20/2167290577.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KeSsZdTm-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:34:26","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":254848204,"title":"RNC versus DNC: How the conventions differed with Trump and Harris on top","text":"Similarly, last month’s Republican National Convention, which took place just after former President Donald Trump barely survived an assassination attempt, saw the GOP rally around Trump and show their enthusiasm for their fight against President Joe Biden. But Biden’s shocking decision to end his campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris upended the 2024 campaign, giving Democrats a much-needed reset before November. At the RNC, Trump appeared in his red VIP box, emblazoned with the phrase Make America Great Once Again, every night during the convention. 2024 ELECTION: LIVE UPDATES On the first night of the GOP convention, Trump even appeared onstage to an adoring crowd of supporters after the chaotic attack on his life. The former president attempted to unite the nation and move away from politically violent language in his acceptance speech on the final night of the RNC. But in the weeks afterward, he would revert back to attacking Democrats and trashing his opponents. Harris sat in a VIP box that did not have the throne-like adornment that Trump’s did, likely tying into the Democrat’s populist push, but she would also shock the crowd by appearing onstage on the first night of the DNC on Monday. However, unlike Trump, on the convention’s first day, the vice president delivered a few remarks to the attendees. “This is going to be a great week, and I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible President Joe Biden,” Harris said. “Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation, and for all you will continue to do. We are forever grateful to you. I thank you.” The next night, Harris would again appear at the convention, but this time, she and Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) were seen via video. The pair were campaigning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the Fiserv Forum, where the RNC had been held. Harris thanked party members after they had concluded the ceremonial roll call nominating Harris and Walz as the Democratic ticket. “We are so honored to be your nominees. This is a people-powered campaign, and together, we will chart a new way forward,” Harris said in brief remarks televised at the convention. The Democratic ceremonial roll vote upstaged the RNC’s version, according to commentators across both political parties. Members of all 57 delegations showcased their home-state pride during the roll-call vote, complete with several celebrity guest surprises as each state used snippets of popular music during their time. But it was Georgia that stole the show by bringing out rapper Lil Jon, who performed his hit single “Turn Down For What,” delighting the entire crowd. In contrast, at the RNC, the roll call vote was a more formal affair that did not include celebrity surprises or the use of popular music. “I’m sorry but this #DNC2024 roll call with DJ Cassidy, themed state music and party/club atmosphere is blowing the RNC’s roll call out of the water,” wrote Meghan McCain, the daughter of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, on X. “It looks like a giant party and celebration and everyone in that room looks like they’re having a blast.” The RNC was, in essence, a Trump coronation as his version of the GOP took forth. Former primary rivals, including Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, took to the stage to urge the GOP and independent voters to support Trump in November. “To me, the biggest difference between the Republican convention and the Democratic convention — at least thus far — is the DNC in Chicago is a real political party convention whereas the RNC in Milwaukee was a Trump convention,” Dennis Lennox, a GOP strategist, told the Washington Examiner. One key point in the difference between the RNC and DNC was that Democratic Party leaders all flocked to speak on Harris’s behalf, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as did former 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former first lady Michelle Obama. “You have pretty much every Democrat grandee there; many are speaking,” Lennox added. “In Milwaukee, you had major Republican players not invited, particularly to speak, because they’ve been declared persona non grata by the titular head of the party.” Craig Snyder, director of “Haley Voters for Harris,” echoed claims that Democrats were more united behind Harris than Republicans were united around Trump in an interview with the Washington Examiner during the DNC. “Go back and look at the Republican Convention in Milwaukee; there is a living former president of the United States who’s Republican; he wasn’t there,” Snyder said, referring to former President George W. Bush. “There are a couple of living former Republican vice presidents of the United States and nominees.” Former Vice President Mike Pence did not appear at the convention, nor did former Vice President Dick Cheney or former Vice President Dan Quayle. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, the 2012 GOP presidential and vice presidential nominees, also did not attend the RNC. “There are people who served in Donald Trump’s Cabinet at the highest levels, like dozens of them, who weren’t there,” Snyder added. “So this anti-Trump movement within the Republican Party is large, and it’s not the majority of base voters, not pretending it is, but it’s large, and it’s making its voice heard in this particular contest, in part by being here, in part by not being there.” At the RNC, there was a more concentrated push to appeal to traditional forms of masculinity, with Trump even walking onstage to the song “This is a Man’s World.” In one of the most memorable moments, the legendary wrestler Hulk Hogan tore off his shirt while speaking on the final night of the GOP convention, revealing a Trump-Vance T-shirt. The DNC attempted to appeal more to women, particularly single women who were galvanized by the loss of abortion rights or infuriated by comments from Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), Trump’s running mate, who, in 2021, referred to some women as “childless cat ladies.” “I think it’s important more than ever, especially with the threat that we’re seeing on the other side and our reproductive rights being, you know, in jeopardy more so than ever, that we’ve had to come together,” said Katherine Hennigan, a California delegate from Los Angeles.","summary":"CHICAGO — The conclusion of the Democratic National Convention left party members energized in the battle to keep control of the White House and Senate while attempting to flip the House away from GOP control.

The Hangover actor recently voiced his opinion about how Democrats involved in the current election campaign should approach their Hollywood supporters. \"As a small-town guy from North Carolina… I do wish the DNC would step back from the celebrities a little bit,” he told Variety this week at the premiere party for Only Murders in the Building season 4, in which he stars. \"It works to a point, but they have to win over rural America.\" Galifianakis' concern seems to stem from his fears that the non-famous American public views the entertainment industry as out-of-touch elitists. \"Hollywood thinks it's so important and that's a problem,\" he said. \"Actors are people too, and they're citizens too, but I'm more on the small-town side of that than I am on the Hollywood side of that. That's just me.\" Meanwhile, Kumail Nanjiani — who has joined the star-studded cast of Only Murders' fourth season alongside Galifianakis, Eva Longoria, Eugene Levy, Melissa McCarthy, and Molly Shannon — told the outlet that he plans to work with the Kamala Harris campaign in whatever capacity he can. \"I'm going to make videos to get people to register to vote,\" he said, adding, \"I might make some appearances later.\" \"It's really unbelievable how I was feeling a month and a half ago and how I’m feeling now. It's really inspiring,\" Nanjiani said, referring to the renewed passion Harris' candidacy has inspired in Democrat voters after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July. \"This has given me faith in humanity. I just feel lighter and happier. I am going to say I am fighting to stay hopeful and not get too optimistic or confident. There's still a lot of work to do.\" The 2024 Democratic National Convention featured appearances from a wide variety of celebrities, including Longoria, Oprah Winfrey, Stevie Wonder, Stephen Curry, Mindy Kaling, Kerry Washington, Kenan Thompson, John Legend, Lil Jon, Common, Maren Morris, Tony Goldwyn, and Jason Isbell. Galifianakis has questioned the connection between celebrity culture and politics in the past. \"America’s obsession with celebrity is a mental illness,\" the comedian declared in a 2022 appearance on Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend. \"It's how we ended up with a celebrity president,” he said, referring to former POTUS Donald Trump.

But presidents often are only as good as Congress allows them to be. That’s why California delegates at the Democratic National Convention got the same message — again and again: Harris’ success as a president rests in their hands. While the vice president is all but guaranteed to win California, the state has as many as six competitive U.S. House seats that could shift control of the chamber to Democrats — which would help a Democratic president enact their agenda. “On a championship team you have an MVP, you have a coach. But you don’t have a championship team unless you have some really damn good role players,” Jaime Harrison, chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, told the state’s delegates. “We, my friends, are the role players.” Lorena Gonzalez, president of the California Labor Federation, told delegates that while it was important to go to key battleground states to help Harris win in November, it’s also important to mobilize voters for the in-state congressional races. “For our next president, for Kamala Harris to be effective and to be able to get things done, she needs Congress, and we know that,” Gonzalez told CalMatters, describing the current Congress as unproductive.“Not being productive doesn’t help the American people and definitely doesn’t help workers. So for us, those congressional races are really important.” Harris and Home-State Delegates Harris didn’t make some of the usual appearances to a nominee’s home-state delegates. She didn’t attend any of the California delegation breakfasts at the convention, and she skipped the California Democratic Party’s bash Wednesday night at the House of Blues. But Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff did speak to the crowd, sharing conversations he has with Harris: Every time he praises Harris for her campaign, she stops him and says: “We haven’t won anything yet.” Gov. Gavin Newsom, who also missed the delegation breakfasts, attended the party, along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis. But Harris’ absence didn’t dampen many delegates’ enthusiasm for her. Shikha Hamilton, vice president of organizing at Brady: United Against Gun Violence, said she has been an ardent supporter of Harris’ since her time as San Francisco’s district attorney and has volunteered in every election Harris has run in since. Hamilton, who described herself as an original member of the K-Hive — the political equivalent of Swifties, but for Harris — hoped the vice president would come to the breakfast, but she wasn’t too disappointed. “As activists we understand she’s got a job to do,” Hamilton said. “Let her do her job.” Necola Adams, a 60-year old Merced resident, agreed: Knowing Harris was from California — “from our hood, our state” — was enough. “Being at the DNC at this moment in time, this historic moment in time is like any and everything you could wish for,” she said. “If you could have been with Dr. King at the March on Washington, or if you could have been with them in Selma, right? Or you could have been at any one of those other moments in time in history that impacted our country in such a significant way. This is one of those moments.” The California Factor Where Harris spends her time might be strategic, according to Christian Grose, politics professor at USC. “She needs to be spending time in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona delegations and similar,” he said. “The more she’s photographed with California Democrats, the less she’s engaging with the swing states.” In addition to balancing her time, Harris also must balance her California identity with a broader appeal — especially as former President Donald Trump and other Republicans try to paint her as a “San Francisco liberal.” No California Democrat has ever been elected president. Harris seems to have become more savvy on that balancing act, shifting some of her stances after dropping out of the 2019 presidential race because she failed to raise enough money. She no longer brands herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” for example, and backed away from support of a fracking ban or a single-payer health care system. “I think Harris needs to highlight her experience in California as a prosecutor and talk about her work that could come off as compassionate but tough,” Grose said. “She should celebrate California as it is one big part of our diverse country, but also needs to tip her hat to the idea that she’ll be driven by a national constituency.” Harris sought to walk that fine line in her acceptance speech — recalling her Oakland upbringing and charting her career, while vowing to unite the entire nation. “With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past — a chance to chart a New Way Forward, not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans,” she said. “I promise to be a president for all Americans.” The line-up of speakers during the programming each evening seemed to reflect that balance, with a broad swath from all over the country, along with some high-profile Californians in the mix, including Sen. Laphonza Butler, Rep. Maxine Waters, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr. Absent from that line-up: Newsom, though he did the honors of delivering California’s delegate tally and closing the ceremonial roll call Tuesday night. “California is playing an outsized role,” said Nathan Click, his spokesperson. “He’s been deployed by the Harris team for surrogate work on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and networks of local tv affiliates across the country — in addition to meeting and events with delegates.” CalMatters is a public interest journalism venture committed to explaining how California’s state Capitol works and why it matters.","summary":"Party leaders at the Democratic convention in Chicago send a clear message to California delegates: She needs a Democratic Congress to succeed if she’s elected president.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/uncategorized/2024/08/24/california-democrats-look-to-help-kamala-harris-by-flipping-the-house/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kamala-Harris-Convention.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:17:19","author":"Sameea Kamal • CalMatters","authors":["Sameea Kamal • CalMatters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":254849668,"title":"Sally Field Says She Returned to Social Media Because of Kamala Harris’ Presidential Bid: “Hope Is Here”","text":"Sally Field has returned to social media, thanks to Kamala Harris‘ presidential bid. The Oscar-winning actress posted two separate posts on her Instagram, sharing that she is back on the platform following Harris running for president alongside Tim Walz as her vice president nominee. “I’ve not been on social media. Not since it became public toilet paper for our former crook of a President. But ‘hope is making a comeback.’ So here I am,” she captioned a carousel of her with her dog, Dash, on Thursday. She posted a second photo on Friday of her in front of the TV playing the Democratic National Convention. “Hope is here. Right in the room with me and my 18-year-old newly registered to vote grandson,” she wrote. “I’m, screaming from the highest mountain top I can find.” Field pleaded with people to vote for their country, children, grandchildren, the earth, women and human rights, and democracy. “Vote for @kamalaharris and @timwalz,” she concluded. “Please dear God. (And I’ll be your best friend.)” This isn’t the first time the Steel Magnolias star has been vocal against Donald Trump. Following the 2016 election, she stopped by Chelsea Handler’s then-Netflix show and slammed the former president for his hypocrisy and lack of experience. “If you look at his past, if you look at his history, there is no evidence that he can do one single thing that he says he’s going to do,” Field said at the time. “He has shown to be everything that he accuses and has accused Hillary Clinton of being. It is now evident he is all of those things, every single thing that he accused her of.” Field has been nominated for three Oscars for her work on 1979’s Norma Rae, 1984’s Places in the Heart and 2012’s Lincoln. She won the best actress awards for the former two films.","summary":"Sally Field has returned to social media, thanks to Kamala Harris&#8217; presidential bid.

As the Democratic National Convention wrapped up, Greene took to X (formerly Twitter) to make a bold and misleading claim about Harris’s stance on abortion rights, asserting that Harris would make late-term abortion a central focus of her presidency. She wrote, “Kamala will make abortion up to the day of birth the law of the land as a major part of her presidency. Absolutely tragic.” As per HuffPost, Critics were quick to point out that Greene’s claim was not only inflammatory but patently false. The idea that Democrats, including Harris, support the termination of healthy pregnancies right up until birth is a common talking point among far-right conservatives, but it is a gross misrepresentation of their actual stance on reproductive rights. In reality, the large majority of Democrats support the right to choose, with late-term abortions being extremely rare and typically occurring only when the mother’s life is in danger or when the fetus is found to have severe abnormalities. As per The Independent, Greene’s attack on Harris is not an isolated incident. Greene has a long history of vocally opposing abortion rights and has consistently supported legislation aimed at restricting access to abortion. Her high-profile criticisms of organizations like Planned Parenthood have earned her an A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America group, solidifying her status as one of the most prominent anti-abortion voices in Congress. Adding fuel to the fire, Greene recently aimed at Planned Parenthood’s mobile health unit stationed near the DNC in Chicago, the unit that offers free vasectomies and medication abortions. Greene denounced this and wrote, “I thought this was fake but it’s not. Planned Parenthood is going to provide free vasectomies and abortions at the Democrat National Convention this upcoming week. It’s hard to even comprehend and it’s truly heartbreaking. Being a mother is the most precious gift, choose life.” Intriguingly, Planned Parenthood Great Rivers released a statement and said, “Having the mobile clinic at the DNC is another way Planned Parenthood constantly works to expand services for Illinois residents and to address the influx of patients to Illinois as surrounding states continue to enact severe restrictions on reproductive care, including extreme abortion bans.” Previously, she has also shared her stance and said, “Obviously, you can’t make things happen instantly, and we all are aware and understanding of that. So now the ball is in his court, and he’s supposed to be reaching out to us – hopefully soon.” Moreover, she also remarked, “In March 2022, pro-life activists tragically discovered the remains of 115 aborted babies being discarded from the Planned Parenthood in Washington, D.C. Five of these babies were second and third-trimester premature infants who appeared to have been born alive and then murdered. This is an image of some of the 110 first-trimester children killed. This Tuesday, I’m holding a Hearing on Investigating the Black Market of Baby Organ Harvesting.”","summary":"Greene made a bold and misleading claim on social media about Harris’s stance on abortion rights.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-kamala-harris-will-make-her-presidency-all-about-abortion-rights","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/712320/uploads/65c93f90-61fe-11ef-8cd8-e3f7b5196c07_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":254847236,"title":"Adam Kinzinger's Wife Scolds Fox News Host Laura Ingraham","text":"The wife of former Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger scolded Fox News host Laura Ingraham on social media on Friday for the \"hypocrisy\" of her complaining that MSNBC was not airing former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent speech.On Friday, Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, the GOP presidential nominee. Later that night, he joined Trump at a campaign rally in Glendale, Arizona.During his speech, Kennedy Jr. mentioned the issues that he and Trump agree on such as \"having safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic,\" ending the Russia-Ukraine war, free speech and rebuilding the middle class.\"Don't you want a President who's going to protect America's freedoms and protect us against totalitarianism? I want to ask you again: don't you want a safe environment for your children?\" Kennedy Jr. asked the crowd in Glendale.On Friday night, Ingraham wrote on X, formerly Twitter, \"MSNBC is not carrying the Trump speech in Arizona where RFK Jr is speaking. Instead they were talking about 'toxic masculinity.' RIP, journalism.\"Ingraham was referencing Friday night's episode of The ReidOut with Joy Reid, which aired at the same time as Kennedy Jr.'s speech. During the episode, Reid talked with D. L. Hughley, a comedian and supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, about men supporting Harris. The news ticker during their conversation read: \"Male Support of Kamala Harris At DNC [Democratic National Convention] A Tonic To RNC's [Republican National Convention] Toxic Masculinity.\"Sofia Kinzinger, the wife of Adam Kinzinger, who supports Harris and has been a fierce critic of Trump, replied to Ingraham on Saturday morning and wrote on X: \"Ha! The hypocrisy! And @FoxNews decided not to air @AdamKinzinger's speech on Thursday at the DNC because their republican audience didn't need to hear you can still be conservative and not identify with Trump. If you work for FOX you have no right to talk about journalism.\"Sofia Kinzinger previously worked as a communications staffer in the Trump White House. She was former Vice President Mike Pence's strategist communications director and the deputy assistant secretary for media operations under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), among other roles.She told Newsweek via email on Saturday afternoon, \"MAGA [Make America Great Again] folks can call Adam traitor or RINO [Republican in Name Only], but little do they know that he speaks out because he believes they deserve better.She continued: \"They've been fed lies, manipulated and abused by those they trust, and someone needs to speak truth to them whether they like it or not. Fox News deciding to not air Republicans at the DNC is yet another example of those echo chambers that keep the MAGA folks ignorant of the truth. The disservice is not toward someone like Adam, it's towards their own listeners that have placed their trust on them.\"Newsweek has reached out to Fox News via email and Adam Kinzinger's PAC, Country First, via social media direct message for comment on Saturday afternoon.When Adam Kinzinger was speaking at the DNC, Fox News was airing its regularly programmed show Gutfeld! with Greg Gutfeld.Meanwhile, Fox Business did air every DNC speech in full and Fox News published an op-ed by Adam Kinzinger, a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, earlier this month about the military service of Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz.\"I was a Republican for 12 years in Congress and I still hold onto the label. I never thought I'd be here, but listen, you never thought you'd see me here did you?\" the former Illinois congressman said in his DNC speech. \"But I've learned something about the Democratic Party. And I want to let my fellow Republicans in on the secret. The Democrats are as patriotic as us.\"He added: \"I was relieved to discover that because I've learned something about my party, too.

On that day, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. The riot erupted following claims from Trump that the election was stolen from him via widespread voter fraud. There is no evidence to support such claims.Kinzinger is now a senior political commentator for CNN.","summary":"The former congressman's wife, Sofia, criticized Fox News' election coverage on Saturday after Ingraham went after MSNBC's reporting.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/adam-kinzinger-wife-sofia-scolds-fox-news-laura-ingraham-1943940","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457420/laura-ingraham.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 19:13:57","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.016}]}
