The silence has drawn sharp comparisons to other major artists, like Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo, who immediately demanded their music be removed from similar content.This placed a spotlight on Swift, with observers noting why the pop superstar has not voiced opposition or taken action. The White House TikTok video featuring her 'The Fate of Ophelia' track remains online. This fact has renewed discussion about Swift's lack of reaction after the recent incident involving the Please Please Please hitmaker.What's the Excuse, Taylor Swift?TikTok creator Kahlen Barry is among those who have called out Taylor Swift for her silence. In a video, Barry contrasted Swift's lack of reaction with the immediate public statements from Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo after the White House used their songs in videos promoting ICE.'So if you're still defending Taylor Swift and the way that she's been moving with this current administration, I know something about you,' Barry began. The creator pointed out that Swift is a much bigger star than Carpenter and Rodrigo combined, yet she has remained silent.'So at this point, I'm sorry. What is the excuse?' Barry asked. 'What is the excuse for Taylor Swift, who is more powerful than both of them, honestly, combined?' Barry expressed disbelief at Swift's silence, particularly given her public battle for ownership of her music, only to be 'complicit when people are using her music to fuel a very disgusting and harmful agenda.'A Contrast in ResponsesWhen Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter discovered the White House was using their songs, they both issued swift and forceful public rebukes.'Don't ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,' Rodrigo reportedly wrote in a since-deleted comment on a video promoting self-deportation. Shortly after, the audio on the video was removed.Carpenter had a similar reaction after her song 'Juno' was used to promote ICE deportations. She called the video 'Evil and Disgusting' and stated, 'Do Not Involve Me in Your Inhumane Agenda.' The White House subsequently deleted that video.The TikTok video using Swift's song, 'The Fate of Ophelia,' remains accessible. The White House used a clip of the song, ending the video with the caption 'The fate of America.'History of Public FeudThe silence surprised many, given Swift's public feud with Donald Trump. In her 2020 documentary Miss Americana, her publicist warned her that Trump might come after her for speaking out politically, to which she replied, 'F**k that. I don't care.'Swift later endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 national election. In response, Trump reportedly took to social media and wrote, 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT.' This history led many to assume she would immediately demand that the White House remove her track, but no statement has been issued.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/complicit-taylor-swift-draws-criticism-not-joining-sabrina-carpenter-olivia-rodrigo-condemning-1760857","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1768611/taylor-swift.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=fd6aae5b79a6069c119df3d5eeb32e09","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 23:57:35","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":385723746,"title":"'United States of Amerigotit': Joe Biden Ridiculed After Botching the Word 'America' in Viral Fiery LGBTQ+ Conference Speech","text":"Former President Joe Biden delivered another viral verbal slip on Friday, December 5, when he appeared to fumble the word \"America\" during remarks at the International LGBTQ+ Leaders Conference, RadarOnline.com can report.\n\nThe 83-year-old, who was receiving an award for advancing LGBTQ+ rights during his presidency, used the speech to condemn what he called \"the many crises caused by this administration,\" but it was his own stumble that quickly drew attention.Biden's Blunder\"We are one of the only countries in the world that time and again has come out of every crisis stronger than we entered into that crisis,\" Biden said as he opened his remarks. \"We just have to get up. So long as we keep the faith, summon hope, we get back up and remember who in the hell we are.\"\n\nMoments later, Biden attempted to emphasize national resilience but tripped over the key phrase.\n\n\"We're the United States of Amerigotit,\" he said forcefully, before trying to quickly recover. \"That's who we are. We're the US.\"\n\nThe brief mispronunciation immediately went viral, adding to a growing list of Biden's high-profile verbal gaffes — an issue that has repeatedly fueled criticism from his political opponents. \n\nStill, Biden continued with his speech, turning his focus to LGBTQ+ issues and accusing President Donald Trump's administration of exploiting them for political gain.Biden vs. TrumpBiden argued that Trump and his allies had \"used gay and lesbian rights as a 'wedge to further divide the country'\" and urged Americans to unify in the current political climate. \n\nAs he concluded, the former president called for continued activism: \"Let's keep this fight going. Let's win it together. Now. Not tomorrow, now.\"\n\nHis difficulty pronouncing \"America\" is only the latest in a series of public missteps. His history of verbal blunders includes previously confusing his Vice President Kamala Harris with Trump and referring to Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III as \"that black man\".History of Speech MishapsAnother widely criticized incident occurred during a NATO summit, where Biden mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"President Putin\", prompting shocked reactions from attendees. He attempted to correct himself mid-speech, saying, \"No, we're going to beat Putin,\" attributing the error to being \"so focused\" on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nHours later, Biden again slipped during a separate event, calling Harris \"Vice President Trump\". He said: \"Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump (Harris) to be vice president did I think she was not qualified to be president. So, let's start there. Number one.\"\n\nBiden also mistakenly praised the \"Congressional Black Caucus\" while speaking to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, shortly after honoring Sister Norma Pimentel for her humanitarian work.\n\nAs Biden continues to appear at public events, these recurring slips remain a significant point of scrutiny, even as he maintains an active role in national political discussions.","summary":"Joe Biden fumbled and mispronounced the word 'America' during a recent speech before attempting to recover.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/united-states-amerigotit-joe-biden-ridiculed-botching-america-lgbtq-speech/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/vpK5GLsoL/0x0/united-states-amerigotit-joe-biden-ridiculed-botching-america-lgbtq-speech-1765054372044.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 22:20:00","author":"Joshua Wilburn","authors":["Joshua Wilburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.037},{"id":385713326,"title":"Newsom Pleads With Dems To Be More \"Culturally Normal\"","text":"California Governor Gavin Newsom is dishing out advice to his fellow Democrats: pretend to be normal while he plots a White House run.\n\nNewsom, who’s been eyeing a 2028 presidential bid after loser Kamala Harris’ electoral wipeout, took to the stage at The New York Times DealBook Summit in New York City, urging his party to ditch the judgmental elitism that’s alienated everyday Americans.\n\n“I think there’s a broader narrative that [Democrats] ought to address, that is, we have to be more culturally normal,” Newsom said, adding “We have to be a little less judgmental.”\n\nGavin Newsom: Democrats need to be more \"culturally normal.\"\nMaybe start by not sitting like that ever again. pic.twitter.com/sWVZtap94Q\n— Western Lensman (@WesternLensman) December 4, 2025\n\nThe only time I've ever seen a man's ankle bent that way is during a football game and they usually don't show the replay in a gruesome situation like that.\n— Scott Lame (@dimeday128) December 4, 2025\n\nHe went on to stress the need for Democrats to grasp “the importance and power of the border, substantively and politically,” acknowledging how open borders and lax enforcement have fueled voter backlash.\n\nIn the same breath, Newsom unleashed on Fox News, comparing it to Soviet-era propaganda, saying “You got Pravda, the primetime lineup at Fox, just going on and on [in defense of Trump].”\n\nHe then slammed Trump as a “man-child,” declaring that the the President “called someone the ‘R word’ or piggy, and somehow it’s just ‘Trump being Trump.’ Nothing normal about this… It’s unbecoming to the president of the United States.”\n\nNewsom then explained his own Trump-mimicking social media account antics were “approved” by him to “wake everybody up” to the “normalization of deviancy.” He accused Fox of criticizing his posts but never uttering a “damn word” about Trump’s rants.\n\nThe comments come as Newsom warns that Trump is “trying to wreck this country,” a claim that rings hollow given California’s ongoing crises under his watch, from rampant homelessness and crime to devastating wildfires that have scorched communities like the Pacific Palisades.\n\nA Berkeley poll earlier this year found 54% of registered voters believe Newsom prioritizes his presidential ambitions over fixing the state’s problems, with only 26% saying he’s focused on governance.\n\nX users mocked Newsom’s call for Democrats to feign “normalcy,” highlighting the irony of a governor whose policies have driven businesses and residents out of California in droves.\n\nHe doesn’t really believe it. He just wants certain voters to believe it.\n— Western Lensman (@WesternLensman) December 4, 2025\n\nNewsom lectures on being “culturally normal” while his policies wreck California’s economy and border security.

Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna recently blasted the governor for his online antics during an appearance on the PBD Podcast.\n\nHost Patrick Bet-David noted, “You’re either a great troll or you’re trying to be. Like Newsom is dying to be Trump, but he’s not. Newsom is trying to be Trump. Newsom’s not Trump, right? Nowhere near him. But everything he does, he’s trying to be — the Trump of the left.”\n\nLuna recounted a joke she made on a Comedy Central show: “I was on a show recently. I think it was on Comedy Central, it was like an evening talk show. And they’re talking about the ‘No Kings’ protests and I made a joke and I was like, ‘Well if you’re talking about Gavin Newsom it would be the ‘No Queens’ protest.’”\n\nWhen asked if it was homophobic, she replied, “No he [Newsom] just has feminine tendencies, and it’s totally true. I don’t know, like — he bitches on the internet all the time. It’s like what are you doing, Gavin? You know, you have fires in the Palisades — what’s going on?”\n\nBet-David agreed, calling Newsom’s vibe “metro.”\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, actress Halle Berry stunned the DealBook crowd earlier that day by slamming Newsom for vetoing a menopause care bill twice, questioning his fitness for higher office.\n\n“Back in my great state of California, my very own governor, Gavin Newsom, has vetoed our menopause bill, not one, but 2 years in a row! But that’s OK, because he’s not GOING to be governor forever!” Berry urged.\n\nShe continued, “With the way he’s overlooked women, half the population, by devaluing us in midlife, he probably should not be our next president either! Just saying!”\n\nBerry rallied the audience, stressing “I need every woman in this country to fight with me. But the truth is, the fight isn’t just for us women. We need men too. We need all of the leaders, every single one of you in this room. This fight needs you.”\n\n? HOLY CRAP! Actress Halle Berry went OFF on Gavin Newsom to the NYT crowd, the whole room was shocked\n\"With the way he's overlooked women, half the population, by devaluing us in midlife, he probably should not be our next president either! Just saying!\" ?\n\"My own Gov. Gavin… pic.twitter.com/SqJqDBjX8p\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) December 4, 2025\n\nThe Menopause Care Equity Act aimed to boost research and education on women’s health, but Newsom vetoed it citing potential cost hikes for working women. Berry’s raw callout drew gasps, underscoring how even Hollywood elites are turning on him amid whispers of his 2028 aspirations.\n\nNewsom’s “normalcy” sermon exposes the Democrats’ desperation after years of pushing radical agendas on gender ideology, unchecked immigration, and climate hysteria that have alienated the heartland. \n\nIf this is their comeback strategy—masking extremism while California burns—good luck selling that to voters who’ve had enough of the chaos. Trump’s policies are winning because they’re grounded in reality, not performative tweaks.\n\nYour support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

Eric Swalwell (D-CA-14) throwing his hat into the California governor's race has been bad news for former Congresswoman Katie Porter. According to the latest Emerson College poll, she is sinking like a stone.\n\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter is sinking in the polls as the race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom gets downright claustrophobic. Support for Porter, the former Orange County congresswoman who’s been labeled a tyrant by a former staffer and her ex-husband, has slipped to 11% of voters surveyed by Emerson College in a new poll released Thursday.The poll suggests splintering support for Porter and others in the crowded primary field after the entry of East Bay Rep. Eric Swalwell and Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist.\n\nSince October we have watched as the egregious Porter's campaign to become California's first female governor has had one oppo hit after another. Video drops of her behavior toward press and staffers show just how entitled and volatile she becomes when put on the spot, confronted with tough questions, or asked follow-up questions. \n\nRead More: Toxic Katie Porter Goes From Bad to Worse, Pathetically Tries to Explain Abusive Videos\n\nHer horrible treatment of her staffers and her ex-husband further show that she is not just a terrible candidate, but a pretty awful human. Porter is also not well-liked by her own party. California Democrat Party elders, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA-11), are definitely not Team Porter. \n\nThe Bay Area Cabal opposes Porter because she is not a team player. In 2023 Porter preempted the late Senator Dianne Feinstein, then 89 years old, announcing her senate campaign. Feinstein’s forced retirement offended Feinstein and the Democrat establishment that only whispered Feinstein’s health had been declining for a decade, when they first offered to Feinstein to again run for governor in 2010 and open her seat for Newsom. Her colleague, former Senator Barbara Boxer is also from the Bay, retired in 2016 and was succeeded by Harris.Porter’s additional offenses are enumerated by former Democrat Representative Harley Rouda in the Orange County Register. In addition to describing Porter as an abusive self-centered “bully with a white board,” Rouda criticized Porter for barely winning a seat redistricted for her, costing Democrats a congressional seat in Los Angeles (CA-27; Loss), and potentially two more in Orange County (CA-47; Hold and SD-37; Loss). As one of the most junior of the elderly California delegation, and a competitive district, Porter was supposed to “wait her turn.”Above all Porter does not follow orders. Speaker Emerita Pelosi is the party boss, was close to Feinstein, and selected then Representative Adam Schiff as Feinstein’s successor. Although a backbencher from Southern California, Schiff was senior, his seat safe, and gained prominence opposing the first Trump Administration. Porter eventually finished third for U.S. Senate with 15% of the vote and then broke silence against California’s “rigged” political machine that included Schiff promoting Republican Steve Garvey.\n\nIt is almost a surety that CA Dems greenlit all of the oppo hits against Porter. When that didn't tank her enough, Swalwell entered the race in order to be a spoiler, and he's doing a great job of curdling the milk. \n\nDespite Pelosi having the reins on party leadership, there is also an underlying misogyny that exists in the CA Democrat Party, especially among the donor class. Look at how they have treated their star: former Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris versus current CA Gov. Gavin Newsom. Both politicians have been absolute disasters, failed up in every position given them, and while both are progressive stalwarts, when it comes to persuading the general electorate that they care about things that actually matter to them, they are absolute disasters. Yet one person continues to be platformed and propped up as the 2028 Democrat nominee for president, while the other keeps getting pushed to the margins, despite refusing to go gently into that good night.\n\nI guess Swalwell can enjoy today, but folks know he slept with many of his interns while married, sexually harassed others while engaged, has a ton of weird texts late at night saved on former interns phones still, he gets he will have to answer for his later on during the campaign, right? Endorse at your own peril people. Yo [sic] have been fully warned, just doing my public service today.\n\nThe facts: Swalwell has zero chance of being the Democrat nominee for California governor, and even less chance of beating Republican Steve Hilton or Sheriff Chad Bianco. His alleged affair with Chinese spy Fang Fang notwithstanding, the man is more of a walking oppo dump than Porter. But the fact that this awkward, personality-devoid, pervy spy dupe has bypassed Porter in the polls is not only telling, but an indicator of the crisis that exists in the Democrat Party.\n\nIf things continue in this vein, California may just elect a Republican governor after all.\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives.\n\nHelp us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

but it's still bad news for Trump","text":"When Mark Green announced his retirement from politics, it seemed to his Republican colleagues that refilling the seat would be an easy feat.\n\nTennessee, and its newly vacant 7th congressional district, were firmly red strongholds.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump won the district by 22 points.\n\nThe last time Green went to an election, almost 60 per cent of voters cast their ballots for him.\n\nIndeed, a Democrat had not been elected to represent the 7th district in more than 40 years.\n\nSo when Matt Van Epps, a former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services, was chosen as the Republican candidate for the ensuing by-election, he seemed a shoo-in.\n\nThe race did not quite pan out that way.\n\nVan Epps did win when Tennessee went to the polls on Tuesday, but with a margin of just nine points, it did not come easy.\n\nA high-stakes election\n\nThe special election, as it is called in the US, was the first for federal office since Democrats stormed to numerous victories on November 4.\n\nSelf-described democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani had a blistering rise to New York mayor.\n\nIn Virginia and New Jersey's governorship races, the Democratic Party increased its winning margins from the presidential election a year prior.\n\nWith the 2026 midterm elections fast approaching, pundits were tipping the Republican Party's narrow majority in the House of Representatives was at risk.\n\nAll the while, Trump's net approval rating had been sliding downward.\n\nRepublicans saw Tennessee as an opportunity to change the storyline.\n\nEnter: Aftyn Behn\n\nIf the November elections had left Republicans uneasy, Democrats walked away hungry for more.\n\nThe party was eyeing even rusted-on red areas.\n\nTheir woman in the Tennessee race was Aftyn Behn: a 36-year-old member of the Tennessee House of Representatives who described herself as a \"pissed-off social worker\".\n\nTrump called her the \"AOC of Tennessee\".\n\nHe meant it as a sledge drawing parallels between Behn and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's democratic socialist brand of leftism.\n\nBehn, who supported democratic socialist Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential primary, focused on expanding Medicaid and lowering the cost of living through initiatives like eliminating a state tax on groceries.\n\nBut the similarities between her and AOC cut deeper.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is one of the left's most influential leaders, capable of mobilising young voters with a progressive platform — something Behn proved adept at, too.\n\n\"If you are upset about the cost of living and the chaos of Washington, we are your campaign.\"\n\nDemocratic political strategist Ian Russell said while a \"more moderate candidate\" might have performed better in a general election, Behn was the woman \"for the moment\".\n\n\"What Aftyn is able to put together is a coalition of the pissed off — people who are not happy with what they're getting out of Washington, frustrated with the direction that the country is going, frustrated primarily with what they're seeing every time they go to the grocery store or look at their health insurance premiums,\" he told political journalist Abby Livingston.\n\nPolling showed the cost of living would be a defining issue at the election and in that area, Behn was performing well.\n\nThe Republican Party was worried.\n\n'The whole world is watching'\n\nMid-term elections always draw a smaller crowd of voters, and the unique timing of this race (just after Thanksgiving) threatened both candidates' chances if they didn't rally their supporters effectively.\n\n\"I'm very concerned that we could be caught with our pants down,\" Republican representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee said during the campaign.\n\nAs election day — and polling margins — drew closer, both major parties fell into a tit-for-tat competition.\n\nRepublican super political action committees(PACs), which help fund political campaigns, tipped $US3.1 million ($4.68 million) into Van Epps's campaign.\n\nDemocratic-aligned PACs gave $US2.3 million to Behn's.\n\nFormer vice-president Kamala Harris appeared at one of Behn's get-out-the-vote rallies.\n\nTrump called in to several of Van Epps's.\n\n\"The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching the district,\" the president said on one call.\n\nBehn was acutely aware of the exceptional attention paid to Tennessee's 7th congressional district, too.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see national attention devoted to a race like this,\" she told the American Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nOne week out from election day, polling suggested Van Epps might have been in trouble.\n\nThe survey of 600 people by Emerson College Polling and The Hill found 48 per cent voter support for Van Epps. Behn was only two points behind.\n\nWith a 3.9 per cent margin of error, it appeared the election was truly a dead heat.\n\nBut those voting early broke for Behn 56 per cent to 42 per cent.\n\nRepublicans tend to prefer voting on election day itself, and Van Epps would need to rely on this turnout to cinch the win.\n\nCelebrating a loss\n\nWearing a cornflower blue western-style rhinestone shirt and pants, Behn took the stage at an event space in the heart of Nashville the night of election day.\n\nDolly Parton's 9 to 5 rang out from speakers beneath cheers from a raucous crowd.\n\nThe Democrat beamed and waved to her supporters.\n\n\"Oh, my goodness, thank you, thank you, thank you,\" she said.\n\nOne could have easily mistaken this for a victory party.\n\nIn the end, Republicans managed to hold onto the reliably conservative seat — a feat attributed to the late and aggressive burst of national spending to the tune of $US4 million and high-profile campaigning.\n\nBut the winning margin was less than half of Green's 21-point lead in 2024.\n\nIt was this point that Democrats celebrated.\n\n\"That Nashville turned out is a testament to not only my candidacy and the campaign we've built, but also Black voters and Nashville,\" she gushed as supporters danced to upbeat tunes behind her.\n\nVan Epps took the night to celebrate his win.\n\n\"We are grateful to the president for his unwavering support that charted this movement and catapulted us to victory,\" Van Epps said in his victory speech.\n\n\"President Trump was all-in with us. That made the difference. In Congress, I'll be all-in with him.\"\n\nBut that same night, some of his Republican colleagues had already begun a post-mortem.\n\n\"We could have lost this district,\" Senator Ted Cruz told Fox News after the race was called.\n\nThe outcome cast a gloomy outlook for Republicans going into the 2026 mid-terms.\n\nPundits say the party will need to defend more vulnerable seats than usual if they are to have any hope of keeping the House majority.\n\n\"The danger signs are there, and we shouldn't have had to spend that kind of money to hold that kind of seat,\" said Jason Roe, a national Republican strategist working on several of next year's battleground races.\n\nCruz said his party had to \"set out the alarm bells\" because next year was \"going to be a turnout election and the left will show up\".","summary":"A Republican claimed a win at a by-election in Tennessee this week, but his party colleagues are sounding alarm bells.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-07/tennessee-special-election-van-epps-behn/106106326","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b0b0c1add7e589ba960a0adc5ab6695d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=39&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 19:18:52","author":"Elissa Steedman","authors":["Elissa Steedman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":385683206,"title":"Taylor Swift Appears on Karoline Leavitt Spotify Wrapped After Attacks","text":"The White House press secretary’s 2025 Spotify Wrapped featured what many will consider to be an unlikely artist.\nOn Wednesday, December 3, Karoline Leavitt shared her Top 5 most-listened-to artists of the year, which included Taylor Swift — despite her boss President Donald Trump’s previous public attacks against the artist.\nSwift, 35, came in at No. 5 as Leavitt’s top artist of 2025, behind No. 1 Morgan Wallen and Christian artists Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake and Anne Wilson. Leavitt, 28, did not share any of her top songs or albums of the year, so it is unclear what Swift Era she has been jamming to all year long.\nHer apparent Swiftie status comes in the wake of numerous online attacks aimed toward Swift by the current commander in chief.\nAfter Swift endorsed the then-Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, Trump posted, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” on his social media platform, Truth Social.\nIn May 2025, Trump again took aim at Swift online in apparent attack on her looks.\n“Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,’ she’s no longer ‘HOT?’”\nIn August, however, after Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce announced their engagement via social media, Trump seemed to soften his tone and general attitude towards the pop star.\n“I wish them a lot of luck,” the president said during a Cabinet meeting at the time. “I think he’s a great player and a great guy, and I think she’s a terrific person, so I wish them a lot of luck.”\nAnd on November 2, the White House went so far as to use Swift’s song, “The Fate of Ophelia,” off her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in a clip shared via its official TikTok channel. The clip featured a photo of President Trump’s 2023 mugshot, in which she was indicted on charges related to efforts to overthrow the 2020 presidential election, as Swift sang,”Don’t care where the hell you been.”\n“OUR VIBES,” the White House captioned the post, which also featured a clip of the president hugging and kissing the American flag as Swift sang, “Cause now you’re mine.”\nSwift, who is notorious for being litigious when it comes to the unauthorized use of her music or likeness, has yet to publicly respond to the White House’s use of her music.\nOther artists, however, have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the Trump administration using their music without their explicit, authorized consent. Most recently, singer Sabrina Carpenter — who joined Swift on her history-making Eras tour — responded to the Trump administration using her song “Juno” in a 21-second video to promote the administration’s deportation efforts.\n“This video is evil and disgusting,” Carpenter, 26, wrote via X on Tuesday, December 2. “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit our inhumane agenda.” h\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson later defended the video and its content in a statement to US Weekly.\n“Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists and pedophiles from our country,” Jackson told Us on Tuesday. “Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”\n(According to the Cato Institute, 93 percent of individuals detained and booked in ICE detention centers have not been convicted of a violent crime, and nearly two-thirds have no criminal conviction at all.)\nThe administration has since removed the video from the platform.","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/taylor-swift-appears-on-karoline-leavitt-spotify-wrapped-after-attacks/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/taylor-swift-on-white-house-press-sec-spotify-wrapped-list.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=62&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 17:32:27","author":"Danielle Campoamor","authors":["Danielle Campoamor"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.207},{"id":385675776,"title":"Jane Fonda says Warner Bros. Discovery sale 'threatens' the First Amendment, warns Trump will take advantage","text":"Actress and activist Jane Fonda penned an op-ed in The Ankler on Thursday, warning that the potential sale of Warner Bros. Discovery \"threatens\" the First Amendment — especially considering how the Trump administration has \"used anticipated mergers as tools of political pressure and censorship\" in the past. Fonda's op-ed — published before Netflix confirmed its acquisition of Warner Bros. on Friday — contended that while it was not known at the time which company would end up buying the legendary film house, \"we don’t need to know the final outcome to understand the danger.\" \"The threat of this merger in any form is an alarming escalation in a consolidation crisis that threatens the entire entertainment industry, the public it serves, and — potentially — the First Amendment itself,\" she wrote. DARRELL ISSA OBJECTS TO POTENTIAL NETFLIX-WARNER BROS DISCOVERY DEAL, CITING ANTITRUST CONCERNS Fonda continued, \"Regardless of which company ends up acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery or its parts, the resulting impact is clear: Consolidation at this scale would be catastrophic for an industry built on free expression, for the creative workers who power it, and for consumers who depend on a free, independent media ecosystem to understand the world. It will mean fewer jobs, fewer opportunities to sell work, fewer creative risks, fewer news sources and far less diversity in the stories Americans get to hear.\" As noted in Netflix's Friday statement, the streaming giant has purchased only the studio side of the company, as well as HBO and HBO Max. The cable news side of Warner Bros. Discovery, including CNN, TNT and Discovery, will be separated into its own publicly traded company, Discovery Global. Continuing her criticisms, Fonda claimed that whichever company acquires Warner Bros. Discovery would \"gain the power to steamroll every guild — SAG-AFTRA, the WGA, the PGA, the DGA, IATSE, everyone — making it harder for workers to bargain, harder to stand up for themselves and harder to make a living at all.\" The actress cautioned that no matter how dangerous the \"economic fallout\" might be, that is not what frightens her most about the sale. JANE FONDA SLAMMED DEMOCRATIC LEADERS AS 'NOT GOOD ENOUGH' IN FIGHT AGAINST TRUMP \"What terrifies me — and should terrify anyone who cares about a free society — is how this administration has used anticipated mergers as tools of political pressure and censorship,\" she wrote. \"We’ve already seen this at work. During the Skydance-Paramount merger proceedings, the Chairman of the FCC launched an investigation into 60 Minutes over routine editing of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris — a move his own predecessor said was ‘fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment.’\" JIMMY KIMMEL'S WIFE CALLS IT A 'FRAGILE TIME FOR FREEDOM' AFTER HUSBAND'S BRIEF SUSPENSION Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment. The actress asserted that \"the First Amendment is not partisan and neither is standing up to defend it,\" claiming that even conservative leaders have warned that the Trump administration is \"operating outside legal and ethical bounds.\" Closing out her thoughts, Fonda called for an organized effort to oppose Trump, warning that \"if we don’t speak now, we may have no industry — and no democracy — left to defend.\" \"This is not a partisan fight. It is a fight for our creativity, our livelihoods and our most fundamental rights as Americans. I choose to stand up. I hope you will join me,\" she concluded. Warner Bros.

Now, he was very hurt when he saw [news of Kirk’s death], but, I mean, everybody was.”\n\nThe president has credited his son with connecting his 2024 campaign to various right-leaning podcasts and social media streams that may have helped tip the election in Trump's favor by attracting young male voters. \n\nBarron is living in the Executive Residence at the White House and attending classes at NYU’s Washington campus.\n\nThe president and the first lady are both Christians. \n\nChristians across denominations, and especially white evangelicals, were a core part of Trump’s 2024 coalition, with an estimated 81 percent of the latter group backing the Republican. \n\nMore broadly, Protestants made up a 54 percent majority of Trump voters, topping the 32 percent who went for Kamala Harris, according to the Pew Research Center.

Candidates in those races compete in the same primary, with the first- and second-place finishers, regardless of party affiliation, advancing to the general election. In California’s 2026 gubernatorial election, however, the presence of many Democrats with no clear frontrunner could possibly lead to the two well-known Republicans taking both spots on the general election ballot, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton, who both spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) about the race.\n\nAn Emerson College poll released Thursday found Bianco leading the all-party primary field with 13% of respondents’ support, while Hilton and Democratic California Rep. Eric Swalwell tied for second place with 12%. Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, the scandal-plagued former frontrunner in the race, came in fourth place with 11%, followed by former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5%, and billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer and former Biden-era Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Xavier Becerra each tied with 4% support. (RELATED: California Democrats Are Rallying Behind Swalwell And ‘The Whiteboard Warrior’ For Governor)\n\nThirty-one percent of voters polled identified as undecided while 7% supported other candidates in the race to succeed term-limited Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the Emerson College survey found.\n\n New Emerson College Poll shows possibility of top two lockout for Democrats in 2026 California Governor race >>> https://t.co/DQigSlxUBS pic.twitter.com/dAuKVYqD6m — Jacob Rubashkin (@JacobRubashkin) December 4, 2025 \n\nThere being two Republican candidates with name recognition in the race amid a muddled Democratic field amounts to a “perfect storm,” Bianco told the DCNF.\n\n“It just worked out that way,” the sheriff reflected to the outlet during an interview. “In the beginning of my campaign, when we were trying to decide if we were going to do this, we knew that there were already a dozen prominent Democrats in the race, so we knew that there was the possibility of a Democrat or two Republicans mathematically being in the top two. So, when I announced, there were no other Republican candidates, and then shortly after that, Steve [Hilton] announces.”\n\nHilton told the DCNF in a separate interview that, while “there is a theoretical possibility” he and Bianco will both advance to the general election, he does not think that will be the case as California Democrats “simply won’t allow that to happen.”\n\n“In political reality, the chances of that actually happening are zero. There is no way that the Democrats will allow their field to be so fractured that they will be shut out of the general election in the biggest state in America that they feel they have a right to run,” Hilton said. “There’s no way that the scenario that some people are talking about will come to pass. … There will be one Republican in the general election, and I’m very confident that that will be me.”\n\nBianco conversely argued that, “when you look at it legitimately, numbers-wise, mathematically,” an all-Republican 2026 general election matchup in deep blue California “can happen.”\n\n“What this really shows is the Democrat Party is in shambles. They have no leadership,” he told the DCNF, referring to the apparent lack of a Democratic frontrunner. “If you look back in history, there’s always a secession plan. There’s always someone else in line. That’s how Newsom got in there.”\n\nThe current California governor served as lieutenant governor under his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, from January 2011 to January 2019.\n\n“But the problem for them [Democrats] now is Newsom is the biggest narcissist, probably, in the world and, in his eyes, there is no one capable of filling his shoes,” Bianco added. “And it just shows that they’re [the Democrats are] struggling. They don’t have a viable leader. So right now, we still know that I’m going to still be number one, but now, the way it looks, it’s more and more possible that Steve ends up number two, and that would be great for California.”\n\nIn addition to Porter, Swalwell, Villaraigosa, Steyer, and Becerra, the Democratic candidates running for governor include former state assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, and former State Controller Betty Yee. California Attorney General Rob Bonta and billionaire businessman Rick Caruso are also reportedly considering entering the race as Democrats.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris announced July 30 she would not run for governor.\n\nHilton told the DCNF that, as of the time of the interview, the Democrat he thinks will advance to face him in the general election will be either Porter, Swalwell, Steyer, or Bonta — if he decides to run.\n\nA UC Berkeley Institute of Government Studies (IGS) poll conducted in late October 2025 also showed the two Republican candidates being within striking distance of making the general election — with no Democrat clearly leading the pack. The survey, conducted before Swalwell’s Nov. 20 entry into the race, also found Bianco leading with 13% support. Porter was in second place with 11%, and Becerra and Hilton both tied for third with 8% of support each. Forty-four percent of respondents polled identified as undecided.\n\nA Republican has not won a gubernatorial election in California since former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s landslide reelection in 2006.\n\nHilton also observed California “has gone further and further and further to the far left” in the years since the state switched to the top-two primary.\n\n“We’ve become, in California, the Wuhan lab of far-left extremism where they’ve been experimenting on the state with these ideological schemes that have ended in complete disaster, the worst results of any state in America: 50th out of 50 on affordability, 50th out of 50 on opportunity, highest unemployment rate, highest poverty rate, it is a complete disaster,” he added referencing findings of various studies. (RELATED: California Gov Hopefuls Throw Newsom Under The Bus After He Skips A City Where Kids Were Shot)\n\n“I think that the people who argued for it [the top-two primary] argued that it would promote more moderate policy outcomes as people would be trying to appeal to a broad cross section of the electorate, not to their party base. Well, how has that turned out?” Hilton continued. “So, far from delivering more moderate outcomes, it’s delivered the exact opposite, more extremism of the far-left variety, which is a catastrophe for our state and the country, because what happens in California influences the whole country.”\n\nCalifornia voters approved Proposition 14, the ballot measure which replaced traditional party-based primaries with contests rewarding the top-two candidates in June 2010, 54% to 46%. Schwarzenegger, then the state’s term-limited incumbent governor, prominently supported and raised money for the ballot initiative, viewed as the “brainchild” of his Republican lieutenant governor, Abel Maldonado, ABC News reported at the time.\n\nBoth Bianco and Hilton expressed willingness to reform California’s unconventional primary system.\n\nThe Riverside County Sheriff called the top-two primary “disastrous.”\n\n“That is absolutely disastrous in a true democratic republic, that’s not how government was supposed to be designed. We are supposed to have elections like everybody else has in the country; California has destroyed our election process,” Bianco told the DNCF. “I’ve already been saying that I will eliminate it [the top-two primary] the second I’m governor, and they know it’s going to happen.”\n\n“I strongly disagree with the top-two system, and would do anything in my power and ability to to get rid of it, but we’ve got to be practical and focus on winning within the system that we have,” Hilton told the outlet. “And therefore my entire focus is on making the case for change in California with positive, practical ideas that working class Californians who’ve been hurt the hardest by these 15 years of one party rule can see will deliver them a better life.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Leno-jawed hussy Olivia Nuzzi and Vanity Fair are not parting ways over a breach of journalistic ethics. She’s out for only one reason — the belief that her violation of journalistic ethics helped Donald Trump.\n\nYou gotta see The Matrix.\n\nWhat do you think—that suddenly a leftist outlet like Vanity Fair caught a case of journalistic integrity? This Vanity Fair? This one? THIS one? Please.\n\nHere’s the narrative currently being spun to pretend Vanity Fair is all about the journalisming…\n\nAfter hiring Olivia Nuzzi as its West Coast editor, Vanity Fair editor Mark Guiducci strapped on a shocked face to pretend he was aghast to learn that the hussy might have an ethical problem. You see, after she was hired for that prestigious role, Nuzzi’s former two-time cuck (I’ll explain this below) and fiancée, Ryan Lizza went the full-bitter cuck route and published a series of Substack essays exposing what everyone already knew years before Vanity Fair hired her: that Olivia Nuzzi is a hussy with zero ethics.\n\nTurns out she not only allegedly had an “intense personal relationship” with the left’s most hated apostate, current Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., she also allegedly banged a Republican, former South Carolina Governor Mark “I’ll Be Back In Two Weeks” Sanford.\n\nIn both cases, Cuck Lizza claims the hussy was assigned to cover her alleged bangees. In fact, the elite DC couple had book contracts to cover both alleged bangees.\n\nHilariously, Cuck Lizza stuck with Nuzzi after the Sanford incident, which, once you add in Bobby Jr., makes Lizza a two-time cuck.\n\nHere’s what Vanity Fair already knew about serial sidepiece Nuzzi when it bestowed upon her the title of West Coast Editor: 1) that New York Magazine had fired her over the Kennedy thing, 2) she once broke into Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski’s home, and 3) she’s a dreadful writer.\n\n“The wildfire is over my shoulder now, over the hill. The waxing gibbous moon is over my head. A thought bubble, it shines blankly,” she actually wrote in her just-released memoir American Canto.\n\nCan it get worse than a “gibbous moon?” Yes, yes it can…\n\nPeople ask me now about anger. About my lack of it. How? How could I not be enraged? I think this over. I scan the terrain of my body. My chest, my spine, behind my belly button. I look for pale pulses of idle fury, waiting for the alarm to sound at the trip wire of my veins. There is nothing there. There is nothing there because I loaded a gun. I loaded a gun and set it on my nightstand.\nYou cannot live in America without thinking about guns, without thinking that one day you might not live anymore in America, and the reason will be a gun. 46,728 lives ended in America in 2023 because of a gun. 27,300 suicides. 17,927 homicides. 604 police shootings. 463 accidents. 434 undetermined. On the 405, a billboard announces that gun injuries are the number one cause of death for American children. You think: A gun will protect me from guns. Then you recall the statistic, that a gun in your home doubles your chances of dying by homicide. Still I loaded a gun. I loaded a gun and set it on my nightstand.\n\nBut now, NOW, we’re supposed to believe Vanity Fair has suddenly caught a case of integrity over behavior it was well aware of before making her West Coast Editor?\n\nThe real reason she’s out is her interview with the far-left Bulwark, where she was shamed for not torpedoing Kennedy’s nomination as Health and Human Services Secretary.\n\n“He’s being nominated to HHS Secretary… You had information that you could have shared… and you didn’t share anything about him. Why? Did you still love him?” asked the Bulwark.\n\n“I don’t know how to responsibly handle this on camera,” the hussy responded.\n\n“ You admit in the book that you’d acted to help him over the course of the campaign. And so once you realized that he was screwing you over, you didn’t take any counteraction,” pressed the Bulwark.\n\nThen the hussy began to cry like a little girl.\n\nAs far as the Corporate Media Borg is concerned, she aided and abetted the Trump administration, and that is what cannot be allowed. It’s okay if she breaks into a Republican’s home. It’s okay if she makes everything she writes about her and puts forth prose so purple it would make Prince wince. That’s allowed. What she cannot be forgiven for is her betrayal of the leftist cause, and because her only answer for betraying the leftist cause is crying like a girl, she’s out, she’s gone, banished, 86’d, arrivederci’d, solongimetcha…\n\nAll she had to do to return to the good graces of the legacy media was to answer the Bulwark’s softball question with a brazen lie, something like how the Trump administration had threatened to kill her entire family if she came forward about Kennedy, and all the doors would remain open. But here’s the thing… Like most leftist women, Nuzzi is a dead-souled, narcissistic basket case.\n\nAllow me to put it this way… If you think Nuzzi is gone because the elite media believe in ethics, how many people were fired over this…?\n\nThe Hegseth ‘Kill Everybody’ Hoax\nTrump “Destroying” White House Hoax\nPhoto of Starving Gaza Baby Hoax\nIsraeli Troops Murdered Food-Seeking Palestinians Hoax\nTrump Tariffs Will Explode Prices Hoax\nMaryland Man Hoax\nBlack Newborns Much More Likely to Die If Doc’s White Hoax\nElon Musk Nazi Salute Hoax\nMass Hysterectomies Performed on Immigrants Hoax\nThe All-White Trump Party Hoax\nSpringfield Bomb Threat Hoax\nTrump Called for Liz Cheney to Be Executed Hoax\nViolent Crime Down Under Biden/Harris Hoax\nArlington Cemetery Hoax\nKamala Was Never America’s Border Czar Hoax\nRussia Collusion Hoax\nHands Up, Don’t Shoot Hoax\nJussie Smollett Hoax\nCovington KKKids Hoax\nVery Fine People Hoax\nSeven-Hour Gap Hoax\nRussian Bounties Hoax\nTrump Trashes Troops Hoax\nPolicemen Killed at Mostly Peaceful January 6 Protest Hoax\nRittenhouse Hoax\nEating While Black Hoax\nBorder Agents Whipping Illegals Hoax\nNASCAR Noose Hoax\nGeorgia Jim Crow 2.0 Hoax\nTrump Assaulted Secret Service Agents and Grabbed Steering Wheel of Beast Hoax\nMAGA Assaulted Paul Pelosi Hoax\nCOVID Lab Leak Theory Is Racist Hoax\nHunter Biden’s Laptop Is Russian Disinformation Hoax\nJoe Biden Will Never Ban Gas Stoves Hoax\nCOVID Deaths are Overcounted Is a Conspiracy Theory Hoax\nMass Graves of Native Children in Canada Hoax\nTrump Killed Japanese Koi Fish Hoax\nTrump Told People to Drink Bleach Hoax\nHamas Hospital Hoax\nIf Reelected, Trump Will Execute People Hoax\nThe 900,000 Kids Hospitalized with Coronavirus Hoax\nDozens of Environmental Hoaxes\nThe Alfa Bank Hoax\nLibs of TikTok Murdered Non-Binary Teen Hoax\nAaron Rodgers Sandy Hook-Truther Hoax\n‘Bloodbath’ Hoax\nBiden ‘Sharp-as-a-Tack’ Hoax\nIowa Poll Hoax\n\nAs long as it benefits the fascist, left-wing cause, lying, bias, protecting your own, withholding information, inventing sources, breaking and entering, and being an overall scumbag is not a sin in the corporate media.

The Duke of Sussex joined Colbert in New York City where he mocked Americans over their fascination with royalty and Christmas-themed films.“I genuinely thought this was the audition for the Gingerbread Prince saves Christmas in Nebraska,” Harry, being ginger, joked as he walked onto the stage. Harry said he had considered acting because he knew how “obsessed” Americans were with Christmas movies and royalty. Colbert challenged him, but Harry responded with a reference to Trump without naming him, according to the New York Post.“Really? I heard you elected a king,” Harry said as boos came from the audience. Colbert responded, “That’s a fair point, no, he’s got a point.”He continued the jibes at the US president while imagining how he would land a role in a movie. “I’ll record a self-tape, I’ll fly myself to an audition, settle a baseless lawsuit with the White House. All the things you people on TV do,” he said, referencing CBS’s $16 million settlement with Trump. CBS's settlement with Trump was over his claim that the network and “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election campaign.Colbert protested, “Hey, Harry, I didn’t do any of those things.” Harry replied, “Maybe that’s why you’re canceled.” The segment ended with Colbert and Harry in an awkward embrace as fake snow fell on the stage.The royal has been at odds with Trump over the past year. Earlier, Trump considered deporting Harry over immigration issues and later made jabs at him during a speech at Windsor Castle.

According to The Examination, the chemicals used in lithium-ion batteries that power EVs \"pose tricky environmental problems.\" Some of the companies behind those chemicals \"stand accused of misleading regulators, hiding information and contaminating communities while making similar, related products.\"\n\nThere's also the environmental damage done by mining the minerals needed for the batteries, as well as the child labor and abhorrent working conditions of some of those mining operations. I suppose the environmentalist Left has no qualms about cracking some eggs to make that green omelette.\n\nResearch also shows that 56 percent of EVs still lose money over the long run, and that EVs cause more pollution than their gas-powered counterparts. Proponents argue driving an EV will save you money in the long run, but research also shows the cost of operating an EV translates into gas prices of roughly $17.33 a gallon. That doesn't even take into account the cost of retrofitting a house to manage the electricity demands, and what about people who live in apartments? I live in a manufactured home, sans garage, and I am prohibited from putting an EV charger on the lot I rent.\n\nAs I write this, it's a balmy 16 degrees here in Wisconsin. Cold weather significantly reduces the battery life of an EV and limits driving range. When the battery dies, you have no way to heat your vehicle if you're, say, stuck in traffic in a blizzard. Of course, the lithium-ion battery could catch fire, and that would keep you warm for days, because they burn long and hot (and sometimes fire departments don't know how to manage them).\n\nWhat's the carbon footprint of a burning Tesla again?\n\nCNN also chimed in, claiming \"the rest of the world\" is moving towards EVs and \"efficient machines.\" \n\nCNN says Trump's fuel economy based on fossil fuel will set back Americans.\"You know humanity has always moved toward the most efficient machine available at the time. And the rest of the world is doing this.

Places like India and China — the world's biggest polluters — are doing no such thing. Europe is small enough that trains and short-hop flights make travel easy, and public transportation infrastructure is more practical. Not so in America, where the state of Texas is roughly the same size as the entire country of France.\n\nThe Biden administration used the full weight of the government to try to force people into costly, less reliable vehicles that they didn't want. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the transition to EVs was happening whether we wanted it or not (sure, Skippy). Kamala Harris envisioned a world where gas-powered cars were illegal and wanted a mandate that automakers only manufacture electric or hydrogen-powered cars by 2035. At the same time, despite spending billions, the Biden administration failed to install a single electric vehicle charger anywhere in the country.\n\nIt's almost like they don't want us to drive, well, anywhere. But I digress.\n\nPeople move towards the machines that work, that get them from Point A to Point B safely and affordably. If it happens to be the most efficient, that's great. But it has to work, first and foremost. Even the state of Maryland, hardly MAGA country, quietly pulled the plug on its EV mandate earlier this year, admitting it's unsustainable and unrealistic. Auto worker unions also opposed EVs, citing job losses and other economic concerns.\n\nI notice the NYT and CNN didn't whine about that.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/12/06/nyt-auto-regs-sat-n2667373","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/103/0d3f6153-44b6-4ba7-88dd-d8d60a4f3a75.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 14:00:00","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":385629434,"title":"BROADCAST BIAS: Networks blast Trump ‘tirade’ but not $1B Somali scam rocking Minnesota","text":"Many local stories that could be harmful to Democrat politicians don’t become national TV stories for an obvious reason. In the case of the massive welfare fraud committed by Somalis in Minnesota under Democrat Gov. Tim Walz, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 running mate, that is doubly obvious. The focus launched with conservatives on Nov. 19 with a City Journal article by Christopher Rufo and Ryan Thorpe with a rather unforgettable sentence: \"The largest funder of [al Qaeda-linked] al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.\" Fraudulent social-service payments were sent to Somalia, and ended up in a dangerous place. The New York Times arrived late to the story on Nov. 30. The online headline was \"How Fraud Swamped Minnesota’s Social Services System on Tim Walz’s Watch.\" The front page in the paper was notably softer: \"The Social Services Corruption That Preyed on Minnesota Nice.\" A better term would have been \"preyed on Minnesota Woke.\" On \"Meet the Press,\" host Kristen Welker began with the obvious method of broadcast-network introduction of a story — taking exception to something President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. He tagged Walz with the R-word, or as Welker put it, \"a slur widely regarded as derogatory towards people with intellectual disabilities.\" Walz then unloaded two minutes of denouncing Trump for \"meanness.\" WALZ 'HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE' IN COMBATING FRAUD, SAYS GOP GUBERNATORIAL CHALLENGER ROBBINS For her second question, Welker arrived at the billion dollars of fraud, and, showing she’d read the New York Times, cited that amount is \"more than Minnesota spends each year to run its Department of Corrections, so I want to give you a chance to respond to this. Do you take responsibility for failing to stop this fraud in your state?\" Walz dodged: \"Well, certainly, I take responsibility for putting people in jail.\" That’s fake news. Walz has put no one in jail. Federal agents and the United States attorney for the District of Minnesota investigated, exposed and prosecuted the fraudsters. Then her questions worsened again, as Welker asked Walz to explain how Trump’s suffering a major cognitive decline. On Dec. 1, the New York Post reported that almost 500 state employees tweeted, \"Tim Walz is 100% responsible for massive fraud in Minnesota. We let Tim Walz know of fraud early on, hoping for a partnership in stopping fraud but no, we got the opposite response.\" The broadcast networks passed on it. ICE OPERATION IN MINNEAPOLIS NABS A DOZEN 'WORST OF THE WORST' CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS, INCLUDING SOMALIS On Dec. 2, \"NBC Nightly News\" broke the silence in one sentence of a White House roundup by reporter Gabe Gutierrez: \"Federal prosecutors have charged dozens of people in Minnesota's Somali community for allegedly stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money meant for social service programs.\" ABC, CBS and PBS just shamelessly ran Trump’s angry response that night without any context of massive fraud: \"We're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren't people that work…. They complain and do nothing but bitch.\" The same context-free pattern on Trump’s \"presidential tirade\" continued on Wednesday morning shows on ABC and NBC, while \"CBS Mornings\" included a small mention by reporter Nancy Cordes, that Trump’s \"been talking about Somalis ever since the story broke last week about a fraud ring in Minnesota, which has the nation’s highest concentration of Somali Americans.\" EMMER SLAMS WALZ, DEMANDS ACCOUNTABILITY OVER ALLEGED RETALIATION TIED TO MINNESOTA FRAUD On Wednesday night, White House reporter Mary Bruce finally produced a snippet of context: \"The New York Times reports 59 people have been convicted in schemes involving more than $1 billion in stolen taxpayer money that was supposed to go to children and other social services. President Trump seizing on this story as he widens his immigration crackdown.\" Trump \"seized\" on the scandal, while ABC whiffed. Bruce then let the Democrats respond. \"But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey defending the Somali community.\" Frey said \"He’s wrong and we want them here.\" Wait. He’s wrong about the billion dollars in fraud? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION On \"Meet the Press,\" host Kristen Welker began with the obvious method of broadcast-network introduction of a story — taking exception to something President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. One reason Trump might have been called Minnesota Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar \"garbage\" is her connections to the fraudsters in the Somali community. The New York Post reported on Thursday that Omar and her staffers defended the fraudulent charity called \"Feeding Our Future.\" Guhaad Hashi Said, who worked on Omar’s 2018 and 2020 campaign as an \"enforcer\" who oversaw Somali voter mobilization, pleaded guilty in August to running a fake food site called Advance Youth Athletic Development, where he falsely claimed to serve 5,000 meals a day and pocketed $3.2 million out of the food program. The worst broadcast interview on the topic this week happened with Omar on National Public Radio’s \"Morning Edition.\" Co-host Michel Martin did the spoon-feeding of Omar: \"I just wondered what went through your mind when he said things like they contribute nothing and should go back to where they came from and so on.\" Omar replied: \"His vile rant really wasn't a surprise to me. He has trafficked in racism, in xenophobia, in bigotry and Islamophobia for as long as he has held office.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP On the fourth question, Martin finally laid out that fraud occurred, and then just asked \"do you have any reaction to that information?\" Omar said she was happy there was accountability. Martin followed up with another puffball: \"Are you concerned that an entire community is being scapegoated because of the actions of this group of people?\" Never allow leftist broadcast media operatives to step onto a soap box and say they’re all about \"holding government accountable.\" Scandals like this underline that every scandal somehow ends up as a Trump scandal. He said something uncouth about a Somali-organized fraud. Omar isn’t described as unleashing a \"tirade\" when she calls Trump a racist bigot and an Islamophobe. They agree with it, so it’s just righteous speech. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM GRAHAM","summary":"Gov.

It sat there for four years, collecting dust. No one did anything to solve this,” declared Attorney General Pam Bondi on “Fox and Friends” Friday morning. “Old evidence, new people, great police work, that’s all it is. Good old-fashioned police work.”\n\n“All we can go off at this point is what the FBI has said and that is they put a fresh set of eyes on evidence the FBI has had for almost five years,” added a House Republican aide involved in an investigation into the pipe bomb. “It’s either incompetence or gross negligence.”\n\nRelatives, neighbors and sources familiar with the investigation into Brian Cole Jr. who spoke with The Post have also painted a picture of a “naïve” young man — likely on the autism spectrum — who wouldn’t have thrown up red flags while trotting out a pet chihuahua for walks near his family’s home in Woodbridge, Va.\n\n“He’s almost autistic-like because he doesn’t understand a lot of stuff,” Cole’s grandmother Loretta said when reached by phone Wednesday for comment. “He’s not a terrorist. … He’s very naïve. He would not hurt a fly. He’s just not that kind of person.”\n\nThe affidavit filed Thursday highlighted how video surveillance cameras of the suspect, cell phone data and a purchasing history that matched the component materials for the bomb are the only publicly available evidence tying Cole to the act of potential political violence.\n\nFederal campaign finance records and voter data hasn’t pointed to Cole having strong political views either, with some sources indicating he believed that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump — but he also made conflicting statements during a four-hour interview with investigators Thursday when he copped to the crime.\n\nA national Republican operative also insisted to The Post on Friday there was “zero indication” that Cole was a Trump voter.\n\nCole did not appear to have registered with either party in Virginia and did not vote in primary races — but did cast ballots in general elections in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2024. His father’s party identity is unknown but he was once defended by high-profile civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who repped George Floyd’s family.\n\nA “Brian Cole” of Lorton, Va., which sits next to Woodbridge, donated a total $50 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. The same individual, who lists themself as “not employed,” donated another $50 on the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue in December 2024, per FEC filings.\n\nAnother “Brian Cole,” of Fairfax, Va., who listed his employment as “bail bondsman” for “Mr Bail Inc.,” which doesn’t match the name of the accused bomber’s father’s business, contributed $104.10 on the Republican fundraising platform WinRed in March 2024, other FEC filings show.\n\nBut the accused bomber evaded being collared by the authorities for nearly five years while living with his parents and siblings just 30 miles southwest of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee HQs that he later targeted.\n\nAs of July 2023, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, who served under both Trump and Biden, testified to Congress that the bureau had seemingly exhausted its leads for the case, even as the attack potentially threatened Vice President Kamala Harris, who was at the Democratic National Committee when the explosives were found.\n\n“We have done thousands of interviews, reviewed something like 40,000 video files … 500 something tips,” Wray told Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) in a House Judiciary Committee hearing that same month.\n\n“We have conducted all logical investigative steps and interviewed all logical individuals at this point,” the FBI boss added in the July 12, 2023, public hearing.\n\nA senior FBI special agent informed the Judiciary panel the year before that the suspect’s “motive and ideology remain unknown” and urged other agents at the Washington Field Office to “include sources reporting on all [types of] threats,” which Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) wrote “raises questions about the progress and extent of the FBI’s investigation given its tardiness.\n\nFormer FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge Steven D’Antuono, who ran the investigation for its first two years, maintained in an interview with ABC News in July 2023 that the probe was “still a priority for us” even after so many cold leads.\n\nThe month before, D’Antuono had revealed in a congressional interview that the bureau still knew nearly nothing about the pipe bomb suspect other than a physical appearance captured on video surveillance cameras.\n\n“We don’t know. We don’t even know the gender at this point,” he said in a separate exchange with Massie about how the explosives were supposed to detonate.\n\n“Do you think it was technically possible for a kitchen timer,” Massie began in the June 7, 2023, transcribed in the June 7, 2023, interview before the House Judiciary Committee, that has one-hour duration to detonate a bomb 17 hours later?”\n\n“No, I don’t. And I saw the same kitchen timer as you. I agree. I don’t know when they were supposed to go off,” D’Antuono responded, emphasizing the FBI’s forensics lab in Quantico, Va., found the explosives were “viable.”\n\nMassie has since expressed doubt that Cole is even the bomber, joining other people who have leveled alternative explanations as well as conspiracy theories about the suspect’s motivations.\n\nA separate inquiry by the House’s Select Subcommittee on January 6 put out a report in January 2025 showing why so many of those leads — when compared with a federal affidavit identifying Cole that was filed in DC federal court — didn’t identify him as the suspect.\n\nAt least seven people purchased the same kitchen timer found on the pipe bomb between Dec. 1, 2020 and Jan. 5, 2021, but the affidavit on Cole reveals he bought his timer on June 3, 2020.\n\nAt least 186 “phone numbers of interest” were flagged based on cell phone tower connections in the vicinity of Capitol Hill and the FBI claimed at some points that the data had been “corrupted,” but Cole’s affidavit made no mention of that latter fact.\n\nIn fact, few leads the FBI told the House select subcommittee about would have included Cole as a “person of interest” when compared with the affidavit, except one “who owned a pair of Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers and who worked ‘in the area of the crime.’”\n\nBrian Cole Sr. owns and runs the company Brian Cole Bail Bonds, which was raided by the FBI this week amid his son’s arrest. Cole Jr. works at his father’s bail bonds business.\n\nOne of those other persons searched for “pipe bomb DC” online before the explosives were placed; another took photos of the RNC on the morning of Jan. 5, 2021; another drove a car by the RNC after the bombs were placed with a passenger matching the suspect’s description and five more had similar cell tower data.\n\nThe subcommittee’s Jan. 2, 2025, report faulted law enforcement for associated “security failures” with responding to the pipe bombs discovery on the afternoon of the Capitol riot and suggested that the DOJ and FBI under Biden appeared to prioritize Jan. 6 riot cases over the pipe bomb investigation.\n\nChairman Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said in a statement after Cole’s arrest that his investigation was “ongoing” but thanked the FBI “for their diligence and continued partnership” with his select subcommittee.\n\n“The FBI’s arrest of the alleged January 6 pipe bomber is a tremendous breakthrough in a mystery that has haunted the country for nearly five years,” Loudermilk added.\n\nPatel claimed at a Thursday press conference that Biden’s FBI “sat on the evidence for four years. There wasn’t any production of new evidence from five years ago.”\n\n“We looked at three million lines of evidence,” he went on. “We went back and looked at the cell phone tower data dumps. We went back and looked at the providers and what information they provided pursuant to search warrants at the time and asked questions, such as ‘Why weren’t all the phone numbers scrubbed?’ and ‘Why weren’t they connected?’ and ‘Why wasn’t there any geolocational data done?’\n\n“Now that is either sheer incompetence or complete intentional negligence, neither of which is acceptable for this FBI. So, we changed that in the prior eight months, not on just this case, but everyone. And what that did was allow us to narrow the search down,” he explained.\n\nDC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro added that Cole from all external signs was also “quiet individual that you would never imagine could put a pipe bomb [and] put it together.”\n\nCole faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted for transporting an explosive device across state lines with the intent to kill, injure and damage property to attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials.\n\nThe FBI, DOJ, RNC and DNC did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Post reached out to D’Antuono for comment Friday. Wray could not be reached for comment.","summary":"\"It’s either incompetence or gross negligence,\" one House Republican aide quipped of the probe stalled for nearly five years.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/06/us-news/how-30-year-old-chihuahua-walking-autistic-like-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-jr-stumped-bidens-fbi-for-years/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116815704.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wx0dAH7j-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-06 11:01:21","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":385634246,"title":"Resurgence of a slur: Local parents, intellectual disability advocates condemn Trump&#8217;s use of the &#8216;R-word&#8217;","text":"The sight of the slur shocked and alarmed the mother of a young boy with special needs. \n\nKimberly Steffes of Joliet never imagined a sitting president would use the “R-word,” a derogatory term long reviled by the intellectual disability community and its advocates. \n\nYet in a Thanksgiving message on Truth Social, President Donald Trump lobbed the anachronistic insult at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, calling the former Democratic nominee for vice president “seriously retarded.” \n\nA few days later, amid a firestorm over the remark, Trump stood by his use of the word when questioned about it by reporters on Air Force One. \n\n“If you have a problem with it, you know what, I think there’s something wrong with him,” Trump responded, referring to Walz. \n\nBut to Steffes, the president’s casual use of the slur directly harms her 8-year-old son Trevor, who has Down syndrome. It threatens his very acceptance in society that she and others have been working so hard over the years to forge. “]\n\nLanguage, she argues, is inextricably linked to real-world barriers, outcomes and opportunities for her child and others with intellectual disabilities. \n\n“For those that think it’s OK to use the R-word … it’s not,” the mother posted on Facebook shortly after Trump’s use of the term. “You don’t have to hurl your insult at a person with a disability for it to be wrong. Your words matter. If they didn’t matter I wouldn’t be fighting for my son’s place in school. I wouldn’t be fighting for my son’s medical treatment. I wouldn’t be fighting for people to presume competence when it comes to my son.” \n\nOnce a common schoolyard insult, the word had largely vanished from mainstream speech until recently, primarily due to the concerted efforts of disability advocates. \n\nThe Special Olympics declared the term a form of “hate speech” and in 2009 launched a campaign against the slur dubbed “Spread the Word to the End the Word.” \n\nIn 2010, then-President Barack Obama signed Rosa’s Law, which required the federal government to use “intellectual disability” in lieu of the increasingly problematic and outdated word. The legislation with bipartisan support was named for a 9-year-old girl with Down syndrome who, with her family, had championed the nationwide change in rhetoric. \n\nAt the time, Obama had invoked the words of her then 11-year-old brother, Nick. \n\n“Now this may seem to some people like a minor change, but I think Rosa’s brother Nick put it best. …He said, ‘What you call people is how you treat them. If we change the words, maybe it will be the start of a new attitude towards people with disabilities.’ That’s a lot of wisdom from Nick,” the president said, as the children’s parents teared up in the crowd. \n\nYet the slur appears to be creeping back into everyday vernacular, as a handful of politicians and celebrities — from billionaire Elon Musk to Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to popular podcast host Joe Rogan — have recently used the term. \n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump had also reportedly used the word to describe opponent Vice President Kamala Harris during a dinner with donors. Trump was also accused calling actor and Morton Grove native Marlee Matlin, who is deaf, the R-word when she was a contestant on the reality television show “The Celebrity Apprentice.” Matlin responded by saying that “the term is abhorrent and should never be used.” \n\nWhen high-profile figures amplify the word in this fashion, its general use on social media skyrockets immediately after, suggesting its broader renormalization, according to recent research. \n\nExperts who have studied the slur also found that the label and its negative connotations have a tangible impact on how folks with intellectual disabilities are perceived and accepted by others, adding greater consequence to the recent shift in rhetoric. \n\nThe term’s “resurgence online and in public discourse is deeply troubling,” the National Down Syndrome Society said in a statement.\n\n“As the language used by our political leaders carries significant weight in shaping actions and societal attitudes toward individuals with disabilities, we are dismayed and disheartened that President Trump used this harmful term in a recent social media post,” the statement added. “The R-word perpetuates harmful stereotypes and barriers people with Down syndrome and other disabilities face.” \n\nNorthwest Indiana Republican State Sen. Michael Bohacek, whose daughter has Down syndrome, also rebuked the president’s language, threatening to vote against a Trump-supported congressional redistricting plan after his use of the slur. \n\nThe legislator from LaPorte County, which is about an hour from downtown Chicago, added in a recent Facebook post that the president’s “choices of words have consequences.”\n\nAs for Steffes, she remembers when the R-word was a common taunt in the 1980s. \n\nBut language and policy advanced over the decades, slowly becoming more inclusive and empathetic to those with intellectual disabilities like her son, a young boy with Down syndrome who loves Illini basketball, animals and cracking jokes. \n\nNow the mom fears the nation is “going backwards, when a president is willing to say our kids are less than.” \n\n“Not using the word is progress — it’s progress in having the world see our kids as capable and competent and to have a worth in society,” she said during a Tribune interview. “It’s about just being human.” \n\nRenormalization, ramifications\n\nWhen high-profile voices use R-word, researchers have found that its use by the general public dramatically rises, essentially renormalizing the slur.\n\nIn January, Elon Musk used the slur on his social media site X, targeting a Finnish graduate student who’d accused him of “rapidly becoming the largest spreader of disinformation in human history.” \n\nAfterward, use of the word exploded on the site, spiking more than 200% over the next two-day period following Musk’s post, according to a study by professors Bond Benton and Daniela Peterka-Benton at Montclair State University in New Jersey. \n\n“He used the term and we instantly saw a significantly larger number of people using the term,” Bond Benton said, noting that use of the word on X in the months since then has continued to remain higher than it had been before. “We can see that it is becoming a more frequently used term on the platform overall and in a pretty dramatic fashion.” \nThe researchers used the same method to track the R-word on X after it was used by Trump and found usage of the slur roughly doubled, rising from 40,000 posts beforehand to about 80,000 in the hours after the president’s Thanksgiving message. \n\nThe mass proliferation of the term has troubling ramifications, the professors said. \n\n“To me, it also shows how fragile society is,” said Daniela Peterka-Benton. “For years the disability community has worked really, really hard to stamp out the use of the word because of the implications it had. And how quickly all of that can go out the window.” \n\nThis resurgence of the word also “sends the message that there is a group of people who are less than,” a sentiment that can leak into policymaking decisions and funding for programs for vulnerable groups, she said.\n\n“Then it has … real implications,” she added. “Because we see these people as less, we don’t want to give them the supports to help them with some of the issues they face.” \n\nDisability rights groups and education organizations nationwide have decried sweeping layoffs in the U.S. Department of Education’s special education offices in October, though officials have said jobs might be restored now that the federal shutdown has ended. \n\nThe cuts coincided around the 50th anniversary of the landmark Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The legislation, signed by President Gerald Ford in 1975, promised all children with disabilities “a free, appropriate public education.” \n\nBut many advocates fear these gains will be rolled back by the Trump administration. \n\n“These layoffs circumvent the will of Congress and dismantle 50 years of precedent upholding rights for students with disabilities,” said an October letter signed by hundreds of disability rights and education groups in opposition to the recent job cuts.\n\n‘Horribly hurtful’\n\nThe Republican legislator from northwest Indiana made international headlines for lambasting Trump’s Thanksgiving post and threatening to vote against an effort to redraw state congressional district lines in favor of Republicans. \n\n“This is not the first time our president has used these insulting and derogatory references and his choices of words have consequences,” state Sen. Michael Bohacek wrote on Facebook the next day. “I will be voting NO on redistricting, perhaps he can use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority.” \n\nThe father of a 24-year-old daughter with Down syndrome called the president’s use of the R-word “horribly hurtful.”\n\n“This is not the first time he’s used this language … it’s becoming almost mainstream,” Bohacek added during a recent interview with the Tribune.\n\nHe’s faced intense backlash for his stance. The day he criticized the president on Facebook, his family received a bomb threat at their home, the lawmaker said.\n\nRight-wing commentator Ann Coulter has also chastised Bohacek’s position on social media. \n\n“BRILLIANT! In order to honor his daughter with Down’s Syndrome, State Sen. Michael Bohacek will FIGHT to hand a majority to the political party that wants to abort Down’s kids,” she posted on X. \n\nIn 2012, Coulter came under fire for calling then-President Barack Obama the R-word on the same social media site, known then as Twitter. \n\nCoulter responded to criticism of her use of the slur saying, “oh, screw you,” adding that the term had been used colloquially to mean “loser” for decades.\n\n“But no, no, these aggressive victims have to come out and tell you what words to use,” she added during the interview with Fox News radio network.\n\nSpecial Olympics athlete Frank Stephens, who has Down syndrome, wrote an open letter reproaching Coulter’s use of the slur.\n\n“You assumed that people would understand and accept that being linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you could get away with it and still appear on TV,” the letter said. “I have to wonder if you considered other hateful words but recoiled from the backlash. Well, Ms. Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honor.”\n\nPresidential example\n\nIn an April episode of the top-ranked podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” its namesake host used the R-word, calling its comeback “one of the great culture victories.” \n\nBut research has revealed that the slur can have concrete impacts on the way folks with intellectual disabilities are perceived, often with damaging repercussions. \n\nA 2020 study from the Ohio State University found that the perceptions and attitudes of roughly 250 undergraduate students who participated in a survey changed drastically when they encountered the R-word versus the phrase intellectual disability. \n\nAlthough the surveys were otherwise identical, researchers discovered that the two different labels produced extremely different results. \n\nThose who encountered the slur “were more likely to have negative beliefs and… negative connotations,” said researcher Darcy Haag Granello, professor of counselor education. \n\n“People who received a survey that used the R-word were significantly more likely to believe that people…with intellectual disabilities should be excluded from society, that they should be sheltered and tucked away from everybody else,” she said.\n\nThey were also significantly less likely to believe that people with intellectual disabilities should be empowered to make their own decisions in life, Granello said.\n\n“And I think the one that is maybe more insidious — less likely to believe they were human beings who had the same rights and privileges and basic humanity as themselves,” she added.\n\nDeborah Bruns, a recently retired professor in the Special Education Program in the School of Education at Southern Illinois University, was dismayed but not surprised by Trump’s use of the slur on Thanksgiving. \n\nShe recalled how Trump, as a candidate, mocked a New York Times reporter with a disability in 2015. \n\n“I was done. Right then and there, I didn’t think he should have continued the next day,” Bruns said in a Tribune interview. “I thought people would be upset and make noise and say this is not someone that should even be considered to be a candidate to lead the country.” \n\nYet it’s even more egregious — and damaging — that Trump used the slur as the nation’s leader, she added. \n\n“And he is unrepentant about it, which makes it 100x more awful as it comes from the person who should be setting an example for our country and beyond,” Bruns said in a recent post on Facebook. “All in the disability community have worked so long and hard to stop the use of the ‘R-word.’ There is no ‘right’ use for it when used to bully and ridicule.”","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/06/donald-trump-r-word-slur/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-trump-disabilities-slur-3.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 11:00:19","author":"Angie Leventis Lourgos","authors":["Angie Leventis Lourgos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":385604466,"title":"At War With Cartels","text":"I am very willing to criticize President Donald Trump. From tariffs to some of his pardons to his behavior, I am not willing to serve as an apologist or yes-man. He is surrounded by those who will not truly challenge him. We all know the difference between superficial pretenses of pushback and genuine pushback. I suspect he doesn’t actually like pushback once he has embraced a bad idea like tariffs.\n\nWhile I am willing to criticize the president, and such criticisms have cost me jobs and opportunities over the years, there are also many things he has done that I agree with. As an aside, the poor man zone of punditry on the Left and Right is being the person willing to praise and criticize from inside the tent. Going all in and all against is what sells. Nuance does not. But let me now make a nuanced case for the president.\n\nThe legally meritorious argument is simply stated. Narcotics trafficking is a federal crime. Drug traffickers have been running drugs into the United States for decades and it has all along been treated as a crime. Recently, the Trump administration quietly took into custody 55 senior Mexican cartel members, who are now being housed in supermax prisons. Therefore, because Congress has designated narcotics trafficking across borders as a crime, the president lacks the power to change a crime into an act of war. As a result, blowing up the boats of narcotics traffickers is not a legal act and redesigning them as “narcoterrorists’ does not get around legal definitions that make the act a crime, not an act of war.\n\nI must dissent.\n\nOver the past several years, we have reliable and credible information that the Chinese communists have funneled the chemicals and materials into Central and South America to make drugs much more potent and lethal. The drug traffickers are entering the United States and both addicting and killing Americans with the drugs. Additionally, over the past decade, as the United States focused more on the Middle East than the Western Hemisphere, the drug cartels in Central and South America have increasingly intermingled with various governmental regimes, which are complicit in the trafficking of drugs and the killing of American citizens.\n\nThe drug traffickers as a stand-alone enterprise, may be criminal narcotics traffickers, but in collaboration with the Chinese communists and nation-state regimes south of our border, they have become narcoterrorists. Kill them. The president is reasserting American dominance of the Western Hemisphere and that must mean breaking up the ties between the drug cartels and nation-states.\n\nDuring the Joe Biden administration, though they have attempted to revise history, Biden named Kamala Harris as his border czar. She went to Central America to explore the “root causes” of the mass illegal migration stream headed into the United States. Cartel and gang violence dominated the discussions, but the Biden administration treated Nayib Bukele as a pariah for solving his nation’s crime and violence problem. Bukele transformed El Salvador from one of the most violent to one of the safest nations in Central America. He showed that yes, contrary to what Democrats claim, we can incarcerate out of the crime and violence problem.\n\nNot only did the Biden administration treat Bukele as a pariah, but they lied about the wave of mass illegal immigration into the United States, insisting the borders were secure, and did little to stem the tide of fentanyl and other drugs flowing into the United States. Trump has closed the border, embraced Bukele, and gone to war against the cartels that were already at war with us.\n\nJust because they speak Spanish, not Arabic, and do not blow themselves and us up, makes them no less terrorist enterprises than Al Qaeda or ISIS, but unlike those Islamic organizations, the cartels also control nation-states through proxies. Trump is right to wage war on them. But it is also why he should not have pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was one of the drug cartel ring leaders. The president’s policies are right, but he keeps sending the wrong and mixed messages.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Should we tinker with our environment, while exacerbating climate change?","text":"Last April, the Trump administration effectively canceled funding for the National Climate Assessment Report, firing hundreds of scientists working on it. That assessment is vital to provide authoritative, comprehensive scientific information on climate change impacts, risks and adaptation strategies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the 2015 Paris Agreement, the landmark treaty signed by almost all countries to limit global warming. And last month, two major international climate conferences took place in Brazil. The U.S. failed to participate.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency plans to stop requiring polluters to report their greenhouse gas emissions and might cancel the “endangerment finding,” the basis for the EPA to limit emissions from cars and power plants.\n\nThe EPA also plans to relax restrictions on super pollutants, such as hydrofluorocarbons, repeal dozens of regulations that curb carbon dioxide, mercury and other pollutants from coal plants, and allow for more pollution from power plants. EPA head Lee Zeldin bragged about “driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.”\n\nLast month, the administration announced a proposal to strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, compromising drinking water for millions of Americans. Would you want to drink polluted water?\n\nWhat about invading pristine areas essential as wildlife habitats? A couple months ago, the administration announced it would open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling, and last month it announced that drilling would also be allowed in remote Alaskan areas of tundra and wetlands. Meanwhile, the Interior Department is opening up more than 13 million acres of federal land for coal mining.\n\nTrump is stopping renewable energy projects, cutting nearly $8 billion from such projects in states that backed Kamala Harris, and is phasing out tax credits for new wind and solar development.\n\nAs a consequence of all this, we will increase rather than decrease America’s pollution of the environment, and the Earth will continue heating up to dangerous levels.\n\nIs geoengineering the solution? No, because it does not deal with climate dangers, such as ocean acidification and environmental damage from extracting and burning fossil fuels. But it is a last-ditch option to save our planet, because of insufficient progress in reducing planet-warming emissions. Even though geoengineering presents some risks, those risks are worth taking, say advocates.\n\nSo, what is geoengineering, also known as “climate intervention” and “climate-altering technologies?”\n\nIt’s a combination of strategies to beam sunlight away from our planet in an effort to reduce global warming, such as injecting reflective molecules into the stratosphere (“stratospheric aerosol scattering”) and even setting up sun shields in space.\n\nHere is how stratospheric aerosol scattering would work: More than 10 miles above the ground, where there is less wind, airplanes would spray massive amounts of sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere. The sulfates, which absorb and reflect sunlight, would linger in the atmosphere for long periods.\n\nOther approaches include injecting ice crystals into cirrus clouds to make them thinner and reduce their warming effect as well as spraying saltwater into ocean stratocumulus clouds, making them brighter and more reflective.\n\nHowever, geoengineering might result in unintended consequences such as negatively impacting precipitation patterns and atmospheric ozone concentrations. And if geoengineering is put into effect on a large scale and then abandoned, global temperatures would likely skyrocket.\n\nAlso, high doses of certain particles could damage the protective ozone layer, alter global precipitation patterns and reduce crop growth in certain areas. And the cost? It is estimated that, for each degree Celsius of reduced global warming, $18 billion would need to be invested each year.\n\nIf we reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, we would have less energy for solar power, a valuable source for clean energy production. As a related matter, geoengineering could undermine mitigation of emissions.\n\nSo far, geoengineering is based on computer modeling rather than real-world experiments, so, as of now, it’s a hypothetical concept. This modeling predicts how it could actually work, what types of particles should be used and what environmental side effects might result. But simulations can only reveal so much. Limited outdoor experiments are required before geoengineering can become a reality.\n\nHistorically, the U.S. has released more pollutants into the atmosphere than any other country, although today China is the number-one polluter. The Earth is getting ever warmer, causing more extreme weather, rising sea levels, and threats to human health and ecosystems. Trump administration policies are only exacerbating climate change.\n\nGeoengineering is not a panacea, and it’s risky. But it might be our last resort before it’s too late.","summary":"Geoenginnering is not a panacea, and it’s risky.

They were key for him,” Mr Enten said.\n\nToday's News in 90 - Saturday December 6 \n\nIn the aftermath of the president’s victory last year, much of the credit was given to his youngest son, Barron Trump, for steering him towards spots on right-wing podcasts like those hosted by Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Logan Paul and others to secure the votes of the disaffected young men making up the “manosphere”.

I can’t.”\n\n “The paradigm has completely changed in news, and we have so much opinion that the truth doesn't hold value anymore,” she said. “What we end up doing is trying to — we as consumers — trying to find the truth.

Chung said she doesn’t believe Weiss “could possibly restore” the network.\n\n “When I worked at CBS, it was owned by William Paley, and he actually made it a point of allowing the news division to be autonomous and not have to worry about the bottom line,” Chung recalled. “He had a president by the name of Frank Stanton, who went before Congress time and time again to defend the fourth estate.

To paraphrase Monty Python, the climate parrot may still be nailed to its perch at the recent COP summit in Belém, Brazil — or at Harvard and on CNN — but elsewhere it’s dead. It’s gone to meet its maker, kicked the bucket, shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. By failing to pledge a cut in fossil fuels, COP achieved less than nothing, the venue caught fire, the air-conditioning malfunctioned — and delegates were told on arrival not to flush toilet paper. Bill Gates’s recent apologia, in which he conceded that global warming “will not lead to humanity’s demise,” after he closed the policy and advocacy office of his climate philanthropy group is just the latest nail in the coffin.\n\nIn October, the Net Zero Banking Alliance shut down after JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs led a stampede of other banks out the door. Shell and BP have returned to being oil companies, to the delight of their shareholders. Ford is about to cease production of electric pickups that nobody wants. Hundreds of other companies are dropping their climate targets. Australia has backed out of hosting next year’s climate conference.\n\nAccording to analysis by the Washington Post, it is not just Republicans who have given up on climate change: the Democratic party has stopped talking about it, hardly mentioning it during Kamala Harris’s campaign for president last year. The topic has dropped to the bottom half of a table of 23 concerns among Swedish youths. Even the European Parliament has voted to exempt many companies from reporting rules that require them to state how they are helping fight climate change.\n\nIt has been a long, lucrative ride. Predicting the eco-apocalypse has always been a profitable business, spawning subsidies, salaries, consulting fees, air miles, best-sellers and research grants. Different themes took turns as the scare du jour: overpopulation, oil spills, pollution, desertification, mass extinction, acid rain, the ozone layer, nuclear winter, falling sperm counts. Each faded as the evidence became more equivocal, the public grew bored or, in some cases, the problem was resolved by a change in the law or practice.\n\nBut no scare grew as big or lasted as long as global warming. I first wrote a doom-laden article for the Economist about carbon dioxide emissions trapping heat in the air in 1987, nearly 40 years ago. I soon realized the effect was real but the alarm was overdone, that feedback effects were exaggerated in the models. The greenhouse effect was likely to be a moderate inconvenience rather than an existential threat. For this blasphemy I was abused, canceled, blacklisted, called a “denier” and generally deemed evil. In 2010, in the pages of the Wall Street Journal I debated Gates, who poured scorn on my argument that global warming was not likely to be a catastrophe — so it is welcome to see him come round to my view.\n\nGreta has moved on\n\nThe activists who took over the climate debate, often with minimal understanding of climate science, competed for attention by painting ever more catastrophic pictures of future global warming. They changed the name to “climate change” so they could blame it for blizzards as well as heat waves. Then they inflated the language to “climate emergency” and “climate crisis,” even as projections of future warming came down.\n\n“I’m talking about the slaughter, death and starvation of six billion people this century. That’s what the science predicts,” said Roger Hallam, founder of Extinction Rebellion in 2019, though the science says no such thing. “A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years,” tweeted Greta Thunberg in 2018. Five years later she deleted her tweet and shortly after that decided that Palestine was a more promising way of staying in the limelight.\n\nScientists knew pronouncements like this were nonsense but they turned a blind eye because the alarm kept the grant money coming. Journalists always love exaggeration. Capitalists were happy to cash in. Politicians welcomed the chance to blame others: if a wildfire or a flood devastates your town, point the finger at the changing climate rather than your own failure to prepare. Almost nobody had an incentive to downplay the alarm.\n\nUnlike previous scares, climate fear has the valuable feature that it can always be presented in the future tense. No matter how mild the change in the weather proves to be today, you can always promise Armageddon tomorrow. So it was that for four long decades, climate-change alarm went on a long march through the institutions, capturing newsrooms, schoolrooms and boardrooms. By 2020 no meeting, even of a town council or a sports team, was complete without a hand-wringing discussion of carbon footprints. The other factor that kept the climate scare alive was that reducing emissions proved impossibly difficult. This was a feature, not a bug: if it had been easy, the green gravy train would have ground to a halt. Reducing sulfur emissions to stop acid rain proved fairly easy, as did banning chlorofluorocarbons to protect the ozone layer. But decade after decade, carbon dioxide emissions just kept on rising, no matter how much money and research was thrown at the problem. Cheers!\n\nSwitching to renewable energy made no difference, literally. Here’s the data: the world added 9,000 terawatt-hours per year of energy consumption from wind and solar in the past decade, but 13,000 from fossil fuels. Not that wind and solar save much carbon dioxide anyway, their machinery being made with coal and their intermittency being backed up by fossil fuels.\n\nDwindling donations\n\nDespite trillions of dollars in subsidies, these two “unreliables” still provide just 6 percent of the world’s energy. Their low-density, high-cost, intermittent power output is of no use to data centers or electric grids, let alone transport and heating, and it effectively poisons the economics of building and running new nuclear and gas generation sites by preventing continuous operation. Quite why it became mandatory among those concerned about climate change to support these unreliables so obsessively is hard to fathom. Subsidy addiction has a lot to do with it, combined with a general ignorance of thermodynamics.\n\nNow the climate scare is fading, a scramble for the exits is beginning among the big environmental groups. Donations are drying up. Some will switch seamlessly to trying to panic us about artificial intelligence; others will follow Gates and insist that they never said it was the end of the world, just a problem to be solved; a few will even try declaring victory, claiming unconvincingly that promises made at the Paris climate-change conference a decade ago have slowed emissions enough to save the planet.\n\nOf course, Al Gore, the former vice president who did more than anybody else to alarm the world about climate change and made a $300 million fortune from it, has been at the recent conference in the Brazilian jungle — the one where they felled a forest to build the access road. As he railed against Gates last week for abandoning the cause and accused him of being bullied by President Trump, he sounded like one of those Japanese soldiers emerging from the jungle who did not know World War Two was over.\n\nPerhaps Gore might now regret his exaggerated preachings of hellfire and damnation. In his 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, for which he jointly won a Nobel Prize, he predicted a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet “in the near future” — out by around 19 feet and nine inches. In 2009, he said there was a 75 percent chance all the ice in the Arctic Ocean would disappear by 2014. In that year there was 5 million square kilometers of the stuff at its lowest point — about the same as in 2009; this year there was 4.7 million square kilometers. At the film’s showing at the Sundance Festival, Gore said that unless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases were taken within 10 years, the world would reach a point of no return. Yet here we are, 19 years later.\n\nWears down voters\n\nGore is correct that fear of retribution from the Trump administration drives some of the corporate retreats. President Trump has already canceled $300 billion of green infrastructure funding and purged government websites of climate rhetoric. But even if the Republicans lose the White House in 2028, it will be hard to reinflate the climate balloon. The proportion of Americans greatly worried about climate change is dropping. If Trump takes America out of the 1992 treaty that set up the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change it would require an unlikely two-thirds vote of the Senate to rejoin.\n\nBjørn Lomborg, the Danish economist who is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and has fought a lonely battle against climate exaggeration for decades, recently explained the shift in public opinion: “The shrillness of climate doom also wears down voters. While climate is a real and man-made problem, constant end-of-the-world proclamations from media and campaigners massively overstate the situation.”\n\nA key figure in the collapse of the climatocracy is Chris Wright, the pioneer of extracting shale gas by hydraulic fracturing who was appointed by Trump as Energy Secretary this year. Wright commissioned a review of climate science by five distinguished academics who set out just how non-frightening the facts of climate change are: slowly rising temperatures, mainly at night in winter and in the north, correspondingly less in daytime in summer and in the tropics where most people live, accompanied by a very slow rise in sea level showing no definite acceleration, minimal if any measurable change in the average frequency and ferocity of storms, droughts and floods — and record low levels of deaths from such causes. Plus a general increase in green vegetation, caused by the extra carbon dioxide.\n\nMelissa, the category-5 hurricane that devastated Jamaica last month, killed around 50 people. In the past — before global warming — hurricanes like that killed tens if not hundreds of thousands. In total, weather events killed just 2,200 people globally in the first half of this year, a record low, whereas indoor air pollution caused by poor people cooking over wood fires because they lack access to gas and electricity kills three million a year. So yes, Gates, influenced by Lomborg and Wright, is correct to say that getting cheap, reliable, clean energy to the poor is by far the more urgent priority.\n\nSources tell me that Wright is treated like a rock star at international conferences: his fellow ministers, especially those from Africa and Asia, are thrilled to talk about the need to get energy to people instead of being hectored about emissions. Only a few western European ministers sneer, but even some of them (the British being an exception) quietly admit that they need to find a way to climb down off their green high horses.\n\nFortunately, they now have convenient cover for doing so: artificial intelligence. We would love to go on subsidizing wind and solar, say the Germans privately, but if we are to have data centers, we need lots more reliable and affordable power so we will now build gas — and maybe even some nuclear — turbines.\n\nLikewise, throughout the tech world of the American west coast, emoting about climate suddenly seems like a luxury belief compared with the need to sign contracts with firm power suppliers, mostly burning natural gas — or get left behind in the AI race. The world’s gas glut is impossible to overstate: thanks to fracking, we have centuries’ worth of cheap gas. The tech bros are piling into nuclear, too, but that won’t address the needs for extra power until well into the next decade — and the need is now.\n\nThe climatastrophe has been a terrible mistake. It diverted attention from real environmental problems, cost a fortune, impoverished consumers, perpetuated poverty, frightened young people into infertility, wasted years of our time, undermined democracy and corrupted science. Time to bury the parrot.\n\nMatt Ridley is a science journalist whose latest book is “Birds, Sex and Beauty.” Originally published in The Spectator.","summary":"Finally, thankfully, the global warming craze is dying out.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/opinion/climate-change-doom-and-gloomers-are-finally-bowing-out-showing-that-common-sense-prevailed/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-podp7xsba-1764984665564.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1764966737&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-06 01:51:44","author":"Matt Ridley","authors":["Matt Ridley"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":385483206,"title":"Hochul beefs up campaign staff with battleground political veterans in sign of looming GOP threat","text":"ALBANY – Gov. Kathy Hochul is filling the upper echelons of her re-election team with alumni of campaigns in battleground states and other recent high-stakes political fights – a signal she may be expecting a tough race even in deep-blue New York.\n\nThe governor has taken former staffers from high-profile statewide races in battlegrounds such as Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin, as well as some advisers from her gubernatorial run atop the ticket in 2022.\n\nHochul’s campaign manager, Preston Elliott, ran Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s 2022 re-election campaign and had a recent stint at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, or DSCC, the Democrats’ campaign arm managing independent spending in Senate races.\n\nElliott’s deputy, as reported by POLITICO Friday, will be Lexie Kelly, previously finance director on Minnesota Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s campaign.\n\nHochul’s comms team is headed by Sarafina Chitika, who worked on Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock’s (D-Ga.) campaign before Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential bid. \n\nRyan Radulovacki, just off incoming New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s race, will be the Hochul campaign’s press secretary.\n\n“Democrats have made New York one of the most unaffordable states in America, and everyone knows that,” said Bill O’Reilly, a GOP consultant told The Post. “It’s an axiom. No wonder the governor is beginning to freak out about the race.”\n\nJack O’Donnell, a Democratic consultant whose raised money for Hochul, said, “You can see from this battle-tested team that she’s ready for a fight, and I suspect when her campaign files their fundraising numbers next month, you will see she’s quite well-prepared for the fight, too.”\n\nHochul’s campaign is retaining some older hands from her rocky 2022 bid, too, including Stacey Lynch, a progressive ex-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio aide who left her position in Hochul’s government office as chief of staff to join her campaign this summer as a senior adviser.\n\nThe gov is also keeping on Abigail Erwin, the architect of her highly effective fundraising apparatus, as a senior adviser, according to POLITICO.\n\nNorth Country Rep. Elise Stefanik, Hochul’s main GOP foe at this point, said the governor’s record means more than her staff picks.\n\n“The Worst Governor in America Kathy Hochul is clearly in campaign free fall as New Yorkers know she has driven our state off a cliff as the most unaffordable state in the nation and the most unsafe,” Stefanik wrote in a statement to The Post.","summary":"The governor has taken former staffers from high-profile statewide races in battlegrounds such as Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin, as well as some advisers from her gubernatorial run atop the ticket in 2022.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/us-news/hochul-beefs-up-campaign-staff-in-sign-of-looming-gop-threat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116812700.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rFFaNCOA-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-05 23:42:26","author":"Vaughn Golden","authors":["Vaughn Golden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":385483214,"title":"Trump’s new national-security plan beats Biden’s but muddles our biggest threats","text":"The White House’s just-released National Security Strategy wisely jettisons the Biden administration’s misguided emphasis on sexual identity and climate change as security priorities, but what emerges in its replacement is a mixed bag.\n\nIts combination of muddled rhetoric and limited ambition, for starters, will keep America’s allies jittery about our plans, as rivals like Beijing and Moscow probe for weaknesses.\n\nThe best National Security Strategies accurately describe the world as it is, align finite national resources to potentially unlimited aims and, most important, inform decision-making in a crisis.\n\nThe Trump 1.0 strategy largely accomplished all three of these objectives, declaring in no uncertain terms that China and Russia were overt challengers to American power and influence. The Trump 2.0 strategy is less clear.\n\nInstead of decisive language and a bold recognition of immediate dangers from China, Russia or the clerical regime in Iran, the new strategy buries Trump’s priorities under layers of befuddling rhetoric.\n\nWhat does it mean that America’s foreign policy is “pragmatic without being ‘pragmatist,’” or “realistic without being ‘realist’?”\n\nLanguage like this reads more like Kamala Harris’ word salads than Trump’s signature plain talk. Worse, these vagaries will not be useful when the chips are down.\n\nIf a terrorist hijacked an American airliner, is it pragmatic or pragmatist to shoot it down? If Russian special forces make a limited incursion into the Baltic States, is it realistic or realist to defend our allies?\n\nAnd what does it all mean in operational terms? Emergencies will require immediate answers the NSS doesn’t provide.\n\nOne area where the new strategy shines is its honest recognition of America’s finite resources and the nearly unlimited international problems the administration is asked to address.\n\nPrevious strategies ignored this fact. They opted instead for laundry lists of wishes or desired end states.\n\nA useful strategy should set clear priorities, as the new plan itself notes upfront.\n\nWhat, then, should be at the top of Trump 2.0’s list?\n\nRight now, China is flexing its military muscle in the Pacific, ramming ships and wargaming threats to Taiwan.\n\nNATO generals warn that Russia could be ready to attack Europe in under five years.\n\nThe clerics in Tehran are still in power and overtly antagonistic to America and its friends.\n\nAlas, the Trump 2.0 strategy gives these issues lower priority, focusing more on Western Hemisphere affairs, fair trade deals and grievances about current account deficits.\n\nThese are all important, but not nearly as much as the enormous, overt dangers from nuclear-armed opponents.\n\nThe United States cannot win a high-stakes rivalry with serious players like Beijing or Moscow if we don’t adequately confront the severity of our competition and the complexity of the threats they present.\n\nTake Taiwan: The new strategy rightly asserts that “deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority.”\n\nIt adds that “American military cannot, and should not have to, do this alone.” The same could be said for our military posture in the European theater.\n\nHowever, the speed at which the Trump 2.0 strategy seeks to shift the burden onto the shoulders of allies could be too fast for them to keep up.\n\nGaps in our deterrent power will be the predictable result if we don’t account for the real-world limitations of our allies to mobilize their defense production, recruit soldiers and pick up the slack.\n\nInjecting a healthy spirit of patriotism into American foreign policy, rejecting the expansive aims of unrestrained globalism and recognizing the limits of US resource constraints are all welcomed and needed additions by the new NSS.\n\nThe danger, however, is that the new strategy provides an excuse not to act decisively and with a clear purpose when opponents test our limits or allies call on us to honor our covenants and treaties.\n\nEnsuring our freedom in the world and the prosperity that Americans have come to expect will require both.\n\nPresident Trump has said: “My priority is to end conflicts, not to start them, but I will never hesitate to wield American power, if it’s necessary, to defend the United States of America or our partners.”\n\nLet’s hope the president’s national-security team remembers this when the next crisis breaks.\n\nIt could be more useful than their unwieldly NSS.\n\nPeter Doran is an adjunct senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonpartisan research institute focused on national security and foreign policy.","summary":"The White House’s just-released National Security Strategy wisely jettisons the Biden administration’s misguided emphasis on sexual identity and climate change as security priorities, but what emerges in its replacement is a mixed bag.

Tim Walz. The illegal alien, Abdul Dahir Ibrahim, from Somalia, has had a deportation order against him since 2004 and courts have rejected all of his appeals. Ibrahim has a criminal history that includes convictions in Canada for asylum and welfare fraud before he entered the United States, according to a Department of Justice document reviewed by Fox News Digital. On January 23, 2002, Ibrahim was also convicted in the Dakota County District Court for providing false information to police and driving without a valid license. He was fined and sentenced to one year's probation. Ibrahim has also received 12 traffic or parking citations in the U.S. Ibrahim is unmarried but at one point claimed that his sister was his wife and her children were theirs, which was later found to be fictitious, according to the document. ICE OPERATION IN MINNEAPOLIS NABS A DOZEN 'WORST OF THE WORST' CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS, INCLUDING SOMALIS Per ICE, Ibrahim entered the United States in 1995, in New York, following deportation from Canada. On April 3, 2004, an immigration judge ordered Ibrahim removed. In the decision, the judge highlighted the significant amount of fraud associated with him. His appeals were denied, and in 2006, a circuit court upheld the immigration court’s decision. Despite this, Ibrahim was granted Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for approximately 10 years. He has a pending TPS application that has still not been adjudicated since 2023. Ibrahim has been photographed with several high-profile politicians in Minnesota, including Walz, Squad member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Minneapolis Democratic City Council Member Jamal Osman and state Sen. Omar Fateh, who was unsuccessful in his recent Minneapolis mayoral race. He has been photographed with Walz on at least two different occasions. Osman and Fateh both wrote letters of recommendation on behalf of Ibrahim during his immigration proceedings. DOJ LAWSUIT CLAIMS MINNESOTA SANCTUARY POLICIES ALLOW 'DANGEROUS CRIMINALS' TO AVOID REMOVAL President Donald Trump has recently announced a flurry of new actions to crack down and investigate fraud schemes in Minnesota, which he has assailed as a \"hub of money laundering activity,\" and cited as the basis of his decision to terminate deportation protections for hundreds of Somali migrants. Senior Trump administration officials announced fresh investigations this week, including a new Treasury Department probe into how taxpayer dollars were allegedly diverted to the terrorist organization al-Shabaab, according to Secretary Scott Bessent. Last month, Trump cited the fraud as a driver of his decision to terminate the Temporary Protected Status designation for thousands of Somali migrants living in Minnesota, saying in a Truth Social post that they should \"go back to where they came from.\" FEDERAL PROBE TARGETS ALLEGED MINNESOTA SOMALI FRAUD ‘NETWORK’ AS COVID-AID CRIME RINGS PERSIST Meanwhile, city officials in Minneapolis are bracing for an influx of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents after the agency announced plans for a new operation in the state. Walz, who ran against Trump in 2024 as former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, has criticized Trump’s rhetoric regarding the Somali community in Minnesota, saying that \"Donald Trump’s hateful words don’t stand in Minnesota\" and \"demonizing an entire group of people just by their race and their ethnicity … is something I was hoping we’d never have to see.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP He called the Somali community in Minnesota a \"group of people who contribute to the vitality, economic culture of this state.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Walz, Omar, Fateh and Osman for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"ICE arrested a Somali illegal immigrant convicted of fraud and connected to several high-profile Minnesota politicians, including former Dem vice presidential nominee Gov.

Gavin Newsom kept a low profile as he swung through the nation's capital this week, holding meetings with a handful of lawmakers Friday on Capitol Hill as he renewed calls for billions in federal recovery aid following the Los Angeles fires. For a governor who has spent recent weeks in the spotlight — trailed by cameras at the U.N. climate summit in Brazil last month and featured at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Wednesday — the muted Washington stop stood out. As he moved between offices on Friday, the halls were quiet, with many lawmakers already en route home for the weekend. The governor's office disclosed little before his trip about Newsom's schedule in Washington, saying afterward that he met with five lawmakers, including three who serve on the Senate and House committees on Appropriations, as well as Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Newsom told The Times that the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied his request for a meeting, a setback that underscored the political friction with the Trump administration surrounding California’s $33.9-billion appeal for long-term disaster funding nearly a year after the devastating Los Angeles fires ignited. The governor said his visit was meant to make \"the universal case for support for recovery,\" not just for California, but for other states that were hit with disasters, such as Texas and North Carolina. \"We're getting to the point where we need to see action, and so that's why we're stepping up our efforts,\" Newsom said as he left a meeting with Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), a tenured member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Newsom noted that the funding is vital for fire victims. \"They should not be revictimized through politics, or by politics or politicians,\" Newsom said. \"There's nothing more American than being there for people in need. That's foundational.\" Newsom did not say whether he attempted to request a meeting with the White House when asked by a reporter. The White House did not respond to a request seeking comment. When asked if he thought his discussions with lawmakers had been successful, Newsom said he was glad to have been able to meet with \"folks on the other side of the aisle,\" and he characterized the meetings as an example of \"remarkable graciousness.\" Newsom's office said the governor also met with Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York). Newsom is urging the Trump administration to send Congress a formal request for $33.9 billion in recovery aid needed to rebuild homes, schools, utilities and other critical infrastructure destroyed or damaged when the fires tore through neighborhoods beginning Jan. 7. The governor said there is bipartisan support in Congress for long-term aid. But, he said, the Trump administration has not advanced any recovery proposal since his initial request was filed in February. That request was for nearly $40 billion, but has since been decreased by what has already been paid out, according to a letter Newsom sent to Congressional leaders Wednesday. “Back in January, the President looked me in the eye on the tarmac at LAX and promised me, and the people of LA, that he’d 'take care of it' as we rebuild and recover,\" Newsom said in a statement Thursday. \"That commitment isn’t being met, and instead he’s leaving survivors behind. It’s time for Trump to wake up and do his job.” The fires burned thousands of structures across Los Angeles, displacing families and uprooting businesses. In the first six months after the fires, California received reimbursement for direct response costs and more than $3 billion in individual assistance and small-business loans. The governor's visit to Washington comes as Republicans in the House and Senate have launched two congressional inquiries into California officials' response to the Palisades fire and how organizations have distributed disaster relief funds to victims. As part of the congressional inquiries, lawmakers have requested a trove of records from dozens of agencies at the local, state and federal level. Newsom has welcomed the congressional scrutiny, saying his administration has \"embraced transparency because Californians deserve nothing else.\" Newsom has kept a low profile since news broke that his former chief of staff Dana Williamson was arrested on federal corruption charges. Newsom has not spoken publicly about the indictment, besides an interview with the Sacramento Bee, where he described his reaction to the indictment as \"real surprise and shock.\" The governor told the Bee how Williamson was placed on leave last November when she informed his office of the federal investigation. He said he \"wasn't privy to the details\" and that his hope was that \"it would be worked out.\" Asked by The Times on Friday during a three-minute interview whether he knew anything about the ongoing investigation, Newsom said, \"I really don't.\" Newsom also said he has not been interviewed by the Department of Justice regarding the investigation. Newsom has not been accused of wrongdoing. Williamson’s attorney McGregor Scott, a former U.S. attorney in Sacramento, told The Times in November that federal authorities had approached Williamson more than a year ago seeking help with some kind of investigation of the governor himself. Newsom was a featured speaker Wednesday at the New York Times' DealBook Summit, where he dodged questions about whether he will run for president in 2028, but was not asked about the indictment that has reverberated through Sacramento political circles. Asked during the DealBook event about where the Democrats went wrong in the last presidential election, Newsom reiterated harsh criticism of his party. \"The party's knitting itself back together,\" Newsom said at the event. \"We got shellacked in the last election, and there's been a lot of forensic analysis, perhaps not enough, about what happened. Donald Trump crushed us in the last election.\" Newsom added that the issues with the Democratic party go beyond what went wrong with the passing of the baton between Biden and Kamala Harris. \"We have to be more culturally normal,\" Newsom said. \"We have to be a little less judgmental. We have a party that, I think, needs to design and develop a compelling economic vision for the future where people feel included, to reconcile the fact that if we don't democratize our economy, we're not going to save democracy.\"","summary":"Gov.

Consider this: suspect Brian Cole, Jr., is alive and probably talking, unlike, say, Jeffrey Epstein and Thomas Matthew Crooks in other matters of public interest. Let’s hope he is under FBI protection in custody, lest something. . . say. . . happen to him.\n\nDressed for government work?\n\nAs of early this morning, the country knows next to nothing else about Cole and what he was up to the night of Jan. 5, 2021.\n\nThe FBI has not even said how he is employed. But his photo shows a young man dressed for office work. . . he lives in a nice house in the DC suburbs of Virginia. . .and you might infer that he is, possibly, a federal government worker. Oh, and the FBI was unable to catch him through the whole four years of “Joe Biden?”\n\nYou can suppose at this point that the story of that four-year botched investigation will be a way bigger thing than the pipe bomber’s little prank itself.\n\nIt probably leads to the story of wholesale corruption in Christopher Wray’s FBI, and even more consequentially, to the realization that the so-called J6, 2021 “insurrection” was a government op from top to bottom, aimed at eradicating Trump and Trumpism.\n\nFirst, what was supposed to happen in a joint session of Congress that day?\n\nAnswer: certification of electoral college votes in the 2020 election. What else was liable to happen that day? Answer: under the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (3 U.S.C. §§ 5–6, 15–18) — as amended, and by the rules laid out in the U.S. Constitution (Article II and the 12th Amendment) — objections to several states’ slates of electors were expected to be entertained, triggering debate and possible rejection of those states’ electors on the basis that the votes were not “lawfully certified” (under 3 U.S.C. § 6), or not “regularly given” (meaning the vote was marred by fraud, corruption, or violence). Any state’s electoral votes could be rejected if both the House and Senate voted by simple majority, after up to two hours of separate debate.\n\nAt mid-day, objections meeting the written requirement (one House member + one Senator) were filed for Arizona and Pennsylvania. The objection to the Arizona vote (Rep. Paul Gosar + Sen. Ted Cruz) was the first scheduled to be debated shortly after 1:00 p.m. It was not allowed to happen. Instead, Congress evacuated the chamber. When Congress returned at 8:00 p.m., votes objecting to Arizona and Pennsylvania slates failed and no others were taken up. Senators who previously had committed to debating the votes of several other swing states demurred, citing the breach of demonstrators into the Capitol. The full tally concluded at 3:44 in the morning, Jan 7, “Joe Biden” and Kamala Harris were certified as winners of the 2020 election.\n\nHere are some things to know about the pipe bomb subplot in the J-6 story.\n\nKamala Harris, vice president-elect, still a sitting Senator (CA), was not in the chamber for the certification process. She arrived at the DNC headquarters some blocks away from the Capitol by motorcade at 11:30 a.m. and stayed until she was evacuated from the DNC at 1:14 p.m. Couple of questions about that? 1) did she not want to be present in the chamber at the momentous instant that her election as veep was certified? 2) Did she not have a duty to be present for voting on any of the procedure? Weird, a little bit. She has never explained what she was doing at the DNC that day.\n\nKamala Harris was in the DNC building when the pipe bomb was discovered there, around 1:07 p.m. The pipe bomb at the RNC had been discovered some 20 minutes prior, and it was the discovery of that bomb, at 12:44 p.m. that prompted the evacuation of the joint House / Senate session in Congress, not any breach of the Capitol building, which did not occur until 2:13, p.m., more than an hour later.\n\nNow, to the FBI response to all this. \n\nThey quickly collected tons of closed-circuit video of a suspect planting these pipe bombs. The footage they released showed the suspect at a one-frame-per-second recording rate which, as Mike Benz points out, is a hundred times slower than any common gas station closed circuit camera nowadays. The FBI also doctored the recordings, specifically blurring out the section of the suspect’s face at one angle captured by a CC camera about eight meters away. The rectangular blur patch over his eyes can be clearly seen. How’d that happen?\n\nThe FBI also managed to botch every other aspect of the investigation into the act that actually triggered the evacuation of Congress that day — which was (repeat) not the breach of the Capitol building but the pipe bombs. In the months afterward, FBI Director Wray took agents off the case. He had in place as chief of the FBI’s Washington office an assistant director named Steven D’Antuono who had been in charge previously, as Detroit field chief, of the Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping case in which at least 12 confidential informants and three FBI agents were involved in what looked like an entrapment scheme. D’Antuono had demonstrated considerable skill in constructing skeezy FBI ops when he was put in charge of the DC office. The agency managed to lose the chain-of-custody for much of the evidence in the case, including originals of the videos, cell phone records, communications records between Capitol police, DC metropolitan police, Secret Service, and the FBI, and more.\n\nSo, the pipe bomber has been a cold case lo these many years. And now we’re informed as of yesterday’s FBI / DOJ press conference, that the FBI under Director Patel cracked the case using only information and evidence already in the FBI files. So, get this: there must be a record of exactly which agents were on the pipe bomber case those four years under Christopher Wray. There must be a record of who, by name, was in charge of chains-of-custody for all that evidence. And there must be a record of the senior agents and deputy directors who oversaw all their activities, all the way up to Director Wray. Why would they not be subject to charges of obstruction of justice?\n\nAll of this is just the pipe bomber subplot of the J6 story. There remains the weird business with then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her failure to request national guard protection at the US Capitol that day. And there remains the question of how many agents, assets, and confidential informants the FBI had in-place at the Capitol on J6, 2021, including Antifa members, and which actions, including the breach inside the building, they instigated. Then there is the question of the House J6 committee, how it was constructed with the help of lawfare ninja Norm Eisen, and how it deliberately destroyed all the evidence it collected over the months of its existence.\n\nBe prepared to learn how the J6 “insurrection” was a government-sponsored seditious conspiracy and then ponder who, by name, will be held responsible for it. That’s the tapestry that Brian Cole, Jr.’s little thread leads to.\n\nShout out to Mike Benz for his nearly four-hour discussion about the pipe bomber case on “X”.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/was-j6-insurrection-government-sponsored-seditious-conspiracy","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-12/httpssubstack-post-media.s3.amaz%20%287%29.jpg?h=ad60de56&amp;itok=q4QUnNu6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 21:20:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":385460302,"title":"These voters backed Trump in 2024 and Democrats in 2025. What will they do in 2026?","text":"Voters who backed Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia this year after voting for President Donald Trump in 2024 have a message for both parties: reject your party’s extremes and run campaigns about more than just Trump. In new focus groups, 14 swing voters from New Jersey and Virginia revealed sharply negative views of both parties — and of politicians broadly. They explained that they were drawn in last month's elections in their states to Govs.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, who cast themselves as moderates and transcended the damaged Democratic Party brand. And while 10 of these voters disapproved of Trump’s job performance so far and voiced concerns about high prices, a majority said they did not view their votes for governor as a protest vote against Trump. An anti-Trump message alone may not be enough to sway them and voters like them next year in the midterm elections. Instead, their consistent refrain serves as an important message to Republicans and Democrats as they look to sway swing voters in key races across the country next year: Candidate quality matters, ranging from positions on issues to personality to professional background. “I mean, look, I’m a Republican, but let me tell you, if somebody is checking all the boxes for me, if they’re a Democrat, I’m going to go with my gut and what I feel,” Cynthia G., a 52-year-old from New Jersey, said of Sherrill, who served in Congress before she won the governorship. “And Mikie is just proven to me. Naval officer, formal federal prosecutor, mother of four. She’s tough, but she’s like the quiet storm. She’ll get things done,” said Cynthia, who participated in the recent focus groups, which were produced by Syracuse University and the research firms Engagious and Sago and observed by NBC News as part of the 2025 “Deciders” series. Exit polling from the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races show Sherrill and Spanberger, another former House member, both had some crossover appeal as they sailed to double-digit victories, each winning 7% of voters who cast ballots for Trump in 2024. Unlike a poll, which uses statistical methods to demonstrate the views of a larger population, focus groups dig deeper into how individual panelists view key questions facing the country and make decisions. These focus groups shed light on why some voters backed Democrats despite sharply negative views of the Democratic Party and illustrated nuanced views of Trump and how he now factors into their political thinking. “The most important lesson for both parties in 2026 is to not run flawed candidates,\" said Rich Thau, president of Engagious. \"While affordability, political moderation, and President Trump’s job performance all mattered in Virginia’s and New Jersey’s gubernatorial races, what mattered most to swing voters was candidate quality.\" Candidates matter These voters — including 12 self-described independents, one Republican and one Democrat — said they supported Trump in 2024 because they were optimistic he could better handle the economy. They also viewed then-Vice President Kamala Harris as unqualified and out of touch. And while these voters view both parties negatively, they were especially critical of the Democratic Party, describing Democrats when asked to offer a brief assessment as “dishonest,” “weak,” “unfocused,” “self-serving,” “wishy-washy, and “ineffective.” But Sherrill and Spanberger, a former CIA officer, were still able to win them over by casting themselves as pragmatic moderates and stressing their national security backgrounds. Spanberger “was the closest thing to what you can call a moderate nowadays. She worked across the aisle. She wasn’t an extremist,” said Bruce L., 40, of Richmond, who noted that her congressional office also helped resolve issues for him and his family. Michael C., 60, of Brick, N.J., said he backed Sherrill “because of her veteran status. Because being in the military, when you have a job that needs to get done, you get it done, you make sure you find a way to do it.” Other voters described Sherrill and Spanberger as “sensible,” “pragmatic” and “down-to-earth.” None said they backed the Democrats solely because they would oppose Trump’s policies. “It’s easy to see these Democratic wins in Virginia and New Jersey as a referendum on President Trump, but what these swing voters told us is not quite that simple,\" said Margaret Talev, director of Syracuse University’s Institute for Democracy, Journalism & Citizenship. \"Moderation, competency and personal appeal is the combination they crave.\" Some voters were turned off by the GOP candidates’ embrace of Trump, even though these voters supported him last year. The president endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a former state legislator, against Sherrill in New Jersey. And while Trump did not back Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, she broadly embraced his policies. “Winsome Earle-Sears just seemed to be an extremist who actually just kept defining herself in comparison to others than rather what she stood for, and would propagate the worst of the Trump policies,” said Robert L., a 54-year-old from Springfield, Virginia. Christian G., 25, of Clifton, New Jersey, described Ciattarelli as a “phony” who was “piggybacking off of Trump a lot, or just utilizing Trump’s name in general.” All but one of the New Jersey voters said their state has been going in the “wrong direction,” but they still voted for a Democrat after two terms of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Some saw Ciattarelli as part of the same “good old boys’ network” as Murphy. They viewed Sherrill as the candidate more likely to bring a change and were drawn to her proposals to lower the state’s rising utility bills. Meanwhile, nine of the 14 focus group participants said their votes for Sherrill and Spanberger were not about protesting Trump. But the five voters who did view their votes as a protest against Trump voiced a wide range of concerns with his administration so far. “Trump made a lot of promises, but most of them could not be delivered,” said Rebecca H., 52, of Falls Church, Virginia. “For me, it’s kind of a testament to how I guess trust was lost over the year,” said Christian, the Clifton, New Jersey, resident. “Whereas I voted for him back in ‘24, now, a year later I’m feeling let down.” Down on Trump The former Trump voters have some significant disagreements with the president — including over health care, his immigration policies, the Defense Department’s attacks on suspected drug boats from South America, and the handling of documents related to the federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. But the economy loomed especially large. Some, like Cynthia G., the 52-year-old New Jersey Republican, believe that the economy is moving “in the right direction, to a degree.” She’s been heartened by seeing prices for goods like eggs going down, even though most of the groups said they’ve seen significant price increases broadly. Others who feel the country is now more stable economically cited their view of Trump as a businessman with a plan or the strength of the stock market. And some see Trump’s aggressive tariff policy as an important way to eventually bring jobs back from overseas. “I agree with the tariffs. I think, honestly, I wish it would force all manufacturing to come back to the United States,” said Ashley E., a 40-year-old Virginia independent. But other participants were fiercely critical of Trump’s handling of the economy, particularly tariffs. “People tried warning him before the elections that the foreign companies don’t pay them [tariffs], it’s reflected in the price. And he said, 'Oh, that’s not true,'” said Robert L., a 54-year-old Virginia independent. “If he’s such a great dealmaker, he should have used them [tariffs] as a potential stick,” Robert continued. “Instead, he’s a bull in a china shop and greatly impacted the economy and inflation. Presidents can affect inflation and the economy for the worse much more easily than for the better. And he’s done it for the worse.” Some grounded their frustration with Trump’s policies in what they saw as a general abdication of his campaign promise to lift up everyday Americans. “It’s a bait and switch with him where he said he was for the average person but he actually favors big business, and then just does whatever he wants and there’s no consequences,” said Justin K., a 39-year-old independent from Arlington, Virginia, who added that he thinks the “big tech companies” have Trump’s “ear.” In total, the group was largely down on Trump’s actions on immigration, with just two of the 14 respondents saying they approved, on the whole, of the administration’s policies. Some who had positive things to say about the administration clamping down on illegal border crossings were still deeply critical of its mass deportation policies and the widespread arrests being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “He’s tightening the border control — I approve of that and I approve of restricting the refugees. But I don’t like how ICE is kidnapping people,” said Rebecca H., a 52-year-old independent from Virginia. On the U.S. military strikes ordered by Trump on alleged drug boats from Venezuela, or Trump accusing Democrats of “seditious behavior” for making a video calling on members of the military to refuse illegal orders, those who had heard about the episodes largely disagreed with the president. Only one participant backed using the military to strike suspected drug traffickers overseas, arguing America has a “right to defend ourselves from any country, or any person, who’s trying to bring in illicit substances that kill people.” The others criticized the administration for exceeding its authority. Meanwhile, fewer had heard about Trump’s clash with Democratic lawmakers over their social media video about illegal military orders. Some were skeptical about the Democrats' move in the first place. One voter called it a “great political stunt,” another said it was “insulting” to troops who already knew the rules, and another hesitated because “it’s going to make people start to question everything that’s going on.” But there was near unanimity in their belief that Trump’s response — posting social media messages labeling the lawmakers’ actions as “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” — was not appropriate. “The last comment, punishable by death — I don’t think you should even go there, calling them traitors and everything like that,” Cynthia G., the 52-year-old New Jersey Republican, said. “He just has to word things a bit better.”","summary":"Voters who backed Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia this year after voting for President Donald Trump in 2024 have a message for both parties: reject your party’s extremes and run campaigns about more than just Trump","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/voters-backed-trump-2024-democrats-2025-will-2026-rcna246847","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251202-mikie-sherrill-donald-trump-abigail-spanberger-vl-417p-e6e408.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 21:00:42","author":"Ben Kamisar,Bridget Bowman","authors":["Ben Kamisar","Bridget Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.152},{"id":385458438,"title":"Connie Chung blasts ‘greedy’ CBS News owners, Bari Weiss as she claims network’s crashing ‘into crumbles’","text":"Veteran news anchor Connie Chung blasted CBS News and its new editor in chief Bari Weiss – saying she can’t even watch the network anymore as it undergoes a “crash into crumbles.”\n\nChung – who made waves at CBS News as the first Asian American and one of the first women to co-anchor a major network’s nightly newscast – took aim at Shari Redstone, who sold parent company Paramount to Skydance Media in an $8.4 billion deal in August.\n\n“CBS is a whole different organization than I had worked for,” Chung told Pablo Torre on an episode of his podcast, “Pablo Torre Finds Out.” “CBS has now been taken over, thanks to greedy owners, Shari Redstone partnering with David Ellison, Larry Ellison’s son.”\n\n“Their greed has caused the venerable CBS to actually disassemble, to crash into crumbles, and they’ve hired this – I don’t know what to call Bari Weiss,” Chung said, pausing to laugh. \n\nIn an attempt to bring balance to the network, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison hired the pro-Israel, anti-woke Weiss in October. \n\nThe company also shelled out about $150 million to buy The Free Press, her buzzy, contrarian news site.\n\nWhen Torre asked Chung and her husband, Maury Povich, former host of the tabloid talk show “Maury,” what it’s like to watch CBS News today, she quickly replied: “We don’t.”\n\n“I mean, I can’t. The paradigm has completely changed in news and we have so much opinion that the truth doesn’t hold value anymore,” Chung continued.\n\n“What we end up doing is trying to – we, as consumers – is trying to find the truth.

And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you,” the Republican commander-in-chief told O’Donnell.\n\nWhile the comments were not included in the original broadcast, O’Donnell mentioned the suit at the start of the episode and noted that CBS did not apologize as part of the settlement.","summary":"Chung – who made waves at CBS News as the first Asian American and one of the first women to co-anchor a major network’s nightly newscast – said she can't watch the network anymore.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/media/connie-chung-blasts-greedy-cbs-news-owners-bari-weiss-as-she-claims-network-has-undergone-crash/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116797430.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tdTZFJQq-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-05 20:42:43","author":"Taylor Herzlich","authors":["Taylor Herzlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":385732808,"title":"Dan Bongino On Past Pipe Bomb Conspiracy Theories: ‘I Was Paid For My Opinions’","text":"WASHINGTON – Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, admitted Thursday his past support for a Jan. 6 conspiracy theory was motivated by money. \n\nIn recent years, Bongino repeatedly said on his podcast that the pipe bombs discovered near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, which did not explode, were some sort of “inside job,” the work of a government official out to get President Donald Trump and his supporters. \n\nOf the pipe bomber, Bongino said just this January: “This was an inside job. And it is the biggest scandal in FBI history.”\n\nIn an interview on Fox News this week, host Sean Hannity confronted Bongino about his past statements in light of Bongino’s FBI having finally identified a suspect in the case, a 30-year-old Virginia man with apparently no connection to the government. \n\n“Listen, I was paid in the past, Sean, for my opinions, that’s clear, and one day, I’ll be back in that space,” Bongino said. “But that’s not what I’m paid for now. I’m paid to be your deputy director, and we base investigations on facts.”\n\nIt was a stunning admission from a prominent voice in the right-wing media ecosystem — someone who held himself out as unafraid to tell truths the mainstream media and the government wanted to hide — that he wasn’t bothering to base any of it in fact. \n\nIt’s not the first time this year that Bongino and other prominent MAGA voices have walked back statements they made before becoming part of the second Trump administration. Earlier this year, the Justice Department announced that contrary to claims made by Bongino, FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi in their pre-government roles, the government isn’t hiding a list of sex predator Jeffrey Epstein’s pedophile clients. But Bongino is the first one to come out and say he was just getting paid. \n\nBongino had claimed the pipe bomber wanted to help Democrats by disrupting Republican objections to the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. The plan went awry, Bongino said, after a violent mob of Trump supporters disrupted the proceedings. But it was still the biggest scandal in history, he said, because the FBI knew the bomber’s identity and was protecting him.\n\n“It is a Democrat insider or an anti-Trump lunatic who was trying to stop on Jan. 6, four years ago, the Republicans from objecting to the election,” Bongino said on his podcast. “So they figured if they planted a bomb there that they could rush into the Capitol and go, ‘Stop the objections! Kamala Harris was almost killed by you!’”\n\nThe FBI now alleges the pipe bombs were left outside Democratic and Republican national committee headquarters buildings by Brian J. Cole Jr., a 30-year-old who reportedly told investigators he believed the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. If that’s true, it’s possible he had the same motives as hundreds of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol that day: to stop the certification of a rigged election. \n\nThe Blaze, a right-wing media site, retracted a November story that named a former Capitol Police officer as the pipe bomber based on “gait analysis.”\n\nOther proponents of pipe bomb conspiracy theories quickly adjusted to the news without admitting any error. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who has said multiple federal agencies are implicated in the planting of the bombs, suggested the FBI’s failure to find Cole for five years is suspicious and that it would be “very suspect” if authorities claim Cole had no accomplices. The right-wing commentator Julie Kelly, a frequent guest on Bongino’s podcast, said it’s possible the FBI previously held off on arresting Cole because he’s Black. \n\nOn Friday morning, Bongino cheered himself by posting a quote from former President Theodore Roosevelt dismissing those criticizing from the sidelines. \n\n“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,” the quote goes, concluding that “if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dan-bongino-pipe-bomb-opinion-hannity_n_69332fe9e4b03cea5ab42fdd?origin=home-zone-c-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69333029190000086f7f365e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 20:04:15","author":"Arthur Delaney","authors":["Arthur Delaney"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.592},{"id":385499924,"title":"Dan Bongino On Past Pipe Bomb Conspiracy Theories: ‘I Was Paid For My Opinions’","text":"WASHINGTON – Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, admitted Thursday his past support for a Jan. 6 conspiracy theory was motivated by money. \n\nIn recent years, Bongino repeatedly said on his podcast that the pipe bombs discovered near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, which did not explode, were some sort of “inside job,” the work of a government official out to get President Donald Trump and his supporters. \n\nOf the pipe bomber, Bongino said just this January: “This was an inside job.

AI chatbots that already display a consistent leftist bias could play a key role in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nMIT Technology Review reports that a recent collaborative study conducted by researchers from multiple universities has revealed that AI chatbots possess a remarkable ability to sway voters’ political views, even surpassing the impact of conventional political advertisements. The findings, published in the prestigious journals Nature and Science, shed light on the potential of generative AI to reshape the landscape of elections in the near future.\n\nThe study involved over 2,300 participants who engaged in conversations with chatbots two months prior to the 2024 US presidential election. The AI models were trained to advocate for either of the top two candidates and demonstrated a surprising level of persuasiveness, particularly when discussing candidates’ policy platforms on crucial issues such as the economy and healthcare.\n\nThe results were striking: Donald Trump supporters who interacted with an AI model favoring Kamala Harris shifted 3.9 points toward supporting Harris on a 100-point scale, a shift approximately four times greater than the measured effect of political ads during the 2016 and 2020 elections. Similarly, the AI model championing Trump moved Harris supporters 2.3 points in his direction.\n\nExperiments conducted in the lead-up to the 2025 Canadian federal election and the 2025 Polish presidential election yielded even more pronounced effects, with chatbots shifting opposition voters’ attitudes by around 10 points.\n\nBreitbart News reported in 2024 on an academic study of the 24 most popular LLMs that demonstrated essentially of them showed leftist political views when tasked with taking political orientation tests:\n\nResults from the study revealed that all tested LLMs consistently produced answers that aligned with progressive, democratic, and environmentally conscious ideologies. The AI models frequently expressed values associated with equality, global perspectives, and “progress.”\nTo further investigate the phenomenon, Rozado conducted an additional experiment by fine-tuning GPT-3.5. He created two versions: LeftWingGPT, trained on content from left-leaning publications like the Atlantic and the New Yorker, and RightWingGPT, which was fine-tuned using material from right-leaning sources such as National Review and the American Conservative. The experiment demonstrated that RightWingGPT gravitated towards right-leaning regions in the political tests, suggesting that the political leanings of AI models can be influenced by the data used in their training.\n\nA separate study published in Science delved deeper into the factors contributing to the chatbots’ persuasiveness. Researchers deployed 19 large language models (LLMs) to interact with nearly 77,000 UK participants on over 700 political issues. They discovered that the most effective way to enhance the models’ persuasiveness was to instruct them to include facts and evidence in their arguments and provide additional training using examples of persuasive conversations. The most persuasive model shifted participants who initially disagreed with a political statement by an impressive 26.1 points toward agreeing.\n\nHowever, as the models became more persuasive, they increasingly provided misleading or false information, raising concerns about the potential consequences for democracy. Political campaigns employing AI chatbots could shape public opinion in ways that compromise voters’ ability to make independent political judgments.\n\nBreitbart News Social Media Director Wynton Hall, author of the upcoming book Code Red: The Left, the Right, China, and the Race to Control AI, underscores the importance of understanding how AI will be used to influence elections in the United States:\n\nWe’ve long known that LLMs are not neutral and overwhelmingly exhibit a left-leaning political bias. What this study confirms is that AI chatbots are also uniquely adept as political persuasion machines, and are willing to hallucinate misinformation if that’s what it takes to sway human minds. When you combine bias, AI hallucinations, and Ciceronian-style persuasiveness, that is clearly a wakeup call for conservatives heading into the midterm and presidential elections.\n\nRead more at MIT Technology Review here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.","summary":"According to a recent study, researchers have discovered that AI chatbots can be more effective than traditional political advertisements in influencing voters' opinions and preferences.

The on-again, off-again MAGA media lynch mobs gunning for Patel to be ousted from the key Cabinet post over his perceived mishandling of several high-profile investigations and unmet demands for transparency have crested and fallen too many times to count during his tumultuous nine months in office.\n\nBut on Thursday, Patel instantly regained any lost footing after announcing the arrest of the alleged Jan. 6, 2021, pipe-bombing suspect.\n\nIn a major breakthrough in one of the FBI’s most high-profile unsolved cases, the FBI Thursday morning arrested Brian Cole Jr., 30, in his family’s Woodbridge, Va., home and accused him of placing pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters in Washington, D.C., the day of the U.S. Capitol riot. Cole has been charged with transporting an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction using explosive materials, according to court documents. The bombs never detonated, and there’s a lingering question about whether they were capable of doing so.\n\nRegardless of the level of danger, the pipe bombs have fueled a flood of conspiracy theories over who planted them and why no law enforcement officers found the device placed at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, even though the Secret Service had swept the site before then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’s visit that day.\n\nAs video footage of FBI agents surrounding Cole’s house played on several cable TV stations, Patel, surrounded by Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, and a phalanx of top federal law enforcement officials gathered under the klieg lights at the Justice Department press room for a victory lap on the arrest. The Trump administration investigators had pinpointed Cole not because of any new tip, but just old-fashioned police work, Patel said. Meanwhile, the Biden administration’s FBI let the case gather dust for years, Trump officials argued.\n\n“This cold case languished for four years until Kash and Bongino came to the FBI,” Bondi told reporters Thursday.\n\nAn affidavit signed by an FBI agent who worked on the case and released to the public showed that the FBI tracked Cole’s bomb-making equipment to purchases at Home Depot and Walmart. It also said Cole’s cell phone pinged in the area of the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, when video showed a shadowy individual in a hoodie planting the bombs. His car, according to the affidavit, was also a half mile from the bombs on the same night.\n\nThe suspect’s motives remain a mystery, but reports surfaced Thursday afternoon that the alleged bomber had anarchist leanings.\n\nWhile critics, including former FBI agent and podcaster Kyle Seraphin, cast doubt that the evidence against Cole Jr. was anywhere near conclusive, Bondi and others, including U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, heralded the arrest as a bombshell achieved through diligence and constant coordination between law enforcement agencies.\n\n“This execution was flawless in terms of teamwork, resilience, and just a good, old-fashioned way of police getting the job done,” Patel told reporters, noting it was Bongino who led the months-long investigation. “When you let good cops be cops, this is what happens. I’m eternally grateful to the team behind me, to the leadership at the FBI who made this possible.”\n\nBongino praised Trump for setting the tone and giving them marching orders to “go after the bad guys and stop focusing on other extraneous things not related to law enforcement.”\n\nIndeed, for many critics, especially those on the right, the FBI that Kash and Bongino inherited had become politically weaponized against Trump and conservatives to the point it public trust in the agency was at historic lows. Under Biden, the FBI had produced internal directives to investigate parents who criticized local school boards, including Catholics and pro-life individuals, and had spent an inordinate amount of time and resources interrogating and arresting individuals who entered the Capitol during the January 6, 2021, riots, even those who played no role in the violence.\n\nWhen Patel and Bongino arrived at the FBI, MAGA world cheered, but expected instant reforms and transparency on some of the most controversial law enforcement matters, including the Jeffrey Epstein underage sex trafficking scandal. Transparency on the Epstein case proved much harder to achieve, as rumors for months have swirled that a number of prominent politicians on both sides of the aisle, including former President Bill Clinton and even Trump himself, could be exposed for involvement.\n\nBondi followed her promise to release the Epstein files with an embarrassing White House scene in February in which the attorney general handed out binders of what she inaccurately cast as newly declassified Epstein information to pro-Trump influencers who would later complain that they contained previously released files.\n\nBongino was so unhappy about the “Bondi binders” and the public backlash over them that he considered leaving his job in July after a heated confrontation with the attorney general, followed by a threat to quit unless Trump fired Bondi. The ultimatum, which leaked to the press, fueled speculation over who would survive the next few weeks, Bondi or Bongino.\n\nThe ugly spat subsided, and both Bondi and Bongino survived. But dissent from the left and the right against Patel and Bongino had ebbed and flowed during his nine months on the job with reports as recent as last week that Patel was on thin ice and set for removal. The rumors of Patel’s imminent departure reached a crescendo heading into and over the Thanksgiving weekend until the White House poured cold water on the reports that Trump was poised to fire Patel.\n\nLast weekend, The Telegraph, a British newspaper, citing anonymous sources, claimed that the “mood is miserable” inside Patel’s “chaotic” FBI. Rank-and-file FBI agents were reportedly angered by several perceived blunders, including that Patel had prematurely announced that the FBI had thwarted a potential terrorist attack in Michigan on Halloween, in what critics said allowed suspects to flee. Back in September, during the furious manhunt for Charlie Kirk’s assassin, he claimed a killer was in custody when he wasn’t.\n\nDemocrats have always taken a dim view of Patel’s leadership at the FBI. Buoyed by reports that the White House was losing patience with the director, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker reminded Patel during a September hearing that a capricious boss might bring his career to an end.\n\n“I don’t think you’re fit to head the bureau, but here’s the thing, Mr. Patel, I think you’re not going to be around long,” Booker said.” I think this might be your last oversight hearing.”\n\nPatel fired back that the senator was “an embarrassment.”\n\nOver the last month, prominent conservative voices have started to pile on.\n\nIn mid-October, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson published a bombshell report showing that Trump shooter Thomas Crooks had a much larger and far more anti-Trump digital footprint than the Biden-era FBI had portrayed.\n\nThe New York Post’s Miranda Devine advanced Carlson’s reporting by releasing even more of Crooks’ social media activity – including his visits to DeviantHub, a well-known gender-bending website frequented by furries. Even though the FBI declined to comment for the Devine’s report, a few days later Patel unsuccessfully tried to poke holes in the reporting in interviews with other reporters.\n\nJust last week, Patel also announced a “full force” “coast-to-coast” manhunt for the National Guard attacker when the murderer was already in custody. Patel subsequently clarified that the comments were related to a broader investigation into potential accomplices or a wider plot, and not the announcement of a new manhunt for the already apprehended primary attacker.\n\nThen on Dec. 1, Devine published a report from “an alliance” of anonymous active-duty and retired FBI agents and analysts claiming that the agency was a “rudderless ship” under Patel and Bongino, who were more concerned with building “personal resumes” and engaging on social media than reforming the agency.\n\nThe alliance’s report also included an embarrassing tale about Patel refusing to disembark from a plane in Utah the day after Charlie Kirk’s assassination until he was given an FBI raid jacket and then ended up wearing a woman’s jacket. Patel has denied parts of the story, arguing that he needed a rain jacket because he had no time to pack before heading to Utah after Kirk’s killing.\n\nThe alliance planned to send its 115-page report to Congress later that week. The same group had previously issued damning reports on the Biden-era FBI warning about crippling DEI and the political weaponization of the agency.\n\nBongino fired back at the report, arguing that it was the work of disgruntled “deep-state” FBI agents who were angry over the reforms he and Patel had instituted.\n\nPatel then touted several major reforms during his short tenure and a long list of accomplishments, which included the arrests of 25,000 violent criminals, a 100% increase from last year, and the location and identification of 6,000 victims of child trafficking. Patel also argued that espionage arrests are up 35% under his watch, while fentanyl seizures have increased by 31%.\n\nStill, as of Wednesday, the future of Patel’s and Bongino’s tenure felt rocky at best – until the big announcement that the pair, with the help of key senior FBI agents, had cracked the J6 bomber case.\n\nA source close to the White House and familiar with the president’s thinking described Patel as “a guy with nine lives because anytime you think you have him, he comes back around and does incredible work.”\n\nThe administration has repeatedly and strongly dismissed reports that Trump was considering moving on from his FBI director. To quell the rumors last month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo of Trump and Patel giving the thumbs-up in the Oval Office.\n\nAfter the arrest of the suspected J6 pipe bomber, the same source suggested that another beleaguered Cabinet member look to the FBI director as an example for managing presidential expectations – that “maybe Pete Hegseth needs to start taking pages from Kash Patel’s book.”\n\nWhy keep Patel around? It’s simple, the source said. He puts more points on the board for the administration than he takes off with controversies.\n\n“If there’s talk about whether or not they’re going to drop you, but you keep on winning, even by a small margin, a win is still a win,” the source added, “and the GM is not going to fire you.”\n\nAnother source close to White House and familiar with Trump’s thinking argued that Patel, Bongino, Bondi, and even U.S. Attorney for D.C.

He's also charged with malicious destruction or attempt of malicious destruction, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, CNN reported.\n\nCole allegedly placed pipe bombs outside the RNC and DNC headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5, 2021 -- one day before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The bombs did not detonate, and there were no injuries. But they did divert police away from the Capitol during the riots.\n\nCole lives with his mother and other family members and works for a bail bondsman, the charging affidavit said.\n\nFederal officials said they found Cole using evidence that was already in the file, not a new tip. They used cell phone data and purchasing records to find him.\n\n\"That evidence has been sitting there collecting dust,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday.\n\nAuthorities have not said what Cole's motive was, but the New York Times reported that he was sympathetic to President Donald Trump's claim that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nAccording to his credit card and checking account records, Cole bought multiple items from Oct. 19 through late 2020 that are consistent with components of the pipe bombs, the charging document said.\n\nSome items he bought were galvanized pipe, end caps, electrical wire, battery clips and kitchen timers, the document said. He bought them from Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart and Micro Center.\n\nCole was seen on grainy surveillance video, but it was difficult to make out any characteristics, prolonging the investigation. The pipe bombs were made of 1-inch galvanized pipes, 8 inches long with end caps, homemade black powder, wires, metal clips and a kitchen timer. The FBI has said that the bombs were viable and could have seriously hurt people nearby if they had exploded. It offered a $500,000 reward for information on the suspect. The bombs sat for 15 hours before being discovered, and Vice President Kamala Harris came very close to one of the bombs.","summary":"The man arrested in the attempted bombing on Jan. 6, 2021, made his first appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., Friday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/12/05/accused-dc-pipe-bomber-appears/8231764961479/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8231764961479/2025/1/e83b64721ad4a22c5d99e014606abafc/v1.5/Accused-DC-pipe-bomber-appears-in-court.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-05 19:18:38","author":"Lisa Hornung","authors":["Lisa Hornung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":385650886,"title":"‘Funding woes’: Climate groups falter, Bill Gates recalibrates, but Al Gore soldiers on","text":"This article was originally published at The Empowerment Alliance and is re-published here with permission. \n\nIt’s been an interesting few weeks on the climate hysteria front. Organizations associated with climate alarmism have recently found themselves engulfed in turmoil. Bill Gates has recanted earlier predictions of gloom and doom. But the Father of Climate Panic, former Vice President Al Gore, remains steadfast, if increasingly marginalized.\n\nLet’s start with probably the best-known environmental organization in the world, the Sierra Club. According to a recent New York Times report, the club thrived when it seemed laser-focused on the environment. But then, during Donald Trump’s first term, “its leaders sought to expand far beyond environmentalism, embracing other progressive causes. Those included racial justice, labor rights, gay rights, immigrant rights and more.”\n\nAs a result of the effort to morph into a catch-all for a myriad of social justice causes, the Times noted that by 2022 the Sierra Club “had exhausted its finances and splintered its coalition.” By August, according to the Times, the number of Sierra Club “champions” – “a group that included dues-paying members as well as supporters who had donated, signed petitions or participated in events” – was “down about 60 percent from its high in 2019.”\n\nDespite the upheaval, few lessons seem learned. The Times noted that “in recent weeks, supporters who clicked on the group’s website for ‘current campaigns’ were presented with 131 petitions, some out of date, like calls to support clean-energy funding that Mr. Trump has already gutted, or to support a voting-rights bill that died in 2023.”\n\nAsked whether he had any regrets, the club’s current board president, Patrick Murphy, summoned the spirit of Kamala “not a thing comes to mind” Harris and replied, “I have a hard time pinpointing how I believe we should have made different choices.” Alrighty then.\n\nAlso falling on hard times is 350.org, which first gained notoriety for its successful efforts to block the Keystone XL oil pipeline during the Obama administration. As Politico reported this month, the group “will ‘temporarily suspend programming’ in the U.S. and other countries amid funding woes.”\n\nExecutive Director Anne Jellema said 350.org “had suffered a 25 percent drop in income for its 2025 and 2026 fiscal years, compelling it to halt operations,” and would subsequently reduce its global staff by about 30 percent.\n\n“The group had endured economic hardship over the years, including problems of financial management and several rounds of layoffs that eroded its influence,” Politico reported. Jellema said the organization was facing its challenges “with our ambition intact.” But apparently not much else.\n\nAn implosion of a different kind is from the world of “green banking.” NBA star Kawhi Leonard’s endorsement contract with the pro-environment group Aspiration is alleged to have been a vehicle for Leonard and the Los Angelas Clippers to skirt NBA salary cap rules.\n\nAs reported by ESPN, Aspiration Partners was a company founded in 2013 to provide “socially-conscious and sustainable banking services and investment products.” Their slogan was, “Do Well. Do Good.” Catchy. Operating like an environmentally conscious digital bank, Aspiration promised to “never fund fossil fuel projects like pipelines, oil rigs and coalmines.” The company’s products included “an option to plant a tree with every purchase roundup.”\n\nAccording to ESPN, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer invested $50 million in Aspiration. The subsequent allegation is that Leonard signed a $28 million endorsement deal with Aspiration “as a way to circumvent the league’s salary cap.” Ballmer has denied any knowledge of the deal, according to the report. Leonard has also denied any wrongdoing.\n\nESPN reported that Aspiration filed for bankruptcy in March, and co-founder Joe Sanberg pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud after “federal prosecutors said Sanberg defrauded investors and lenders out of $248 million by fraudulently obtaining loans, falsifying bank and brokerage statements and concealing that he was the source of some revenue booked by the company.”\n\nThe NBA is investigating. How many trees Aspiration planted is unknown.\n\nTo add insult to injury comes what appears to be an about-face from no less a dedicated environmentalist than Bill Gates. For decades, Gates has been a leader in the movement to reduce carbon emissions. But last month he caused a stir when he declared that climate change “will not lead to humanity’s demise.”\n\nIt’s heartening when others finally catch on. Earlier this year, the climate group funded by Gates, Breakthrough Energy, laid off dozens of employees in the U.S. and Europe “as it pulls back from public policy advocacy work that was a cornerstone of its mission,” as the industry site Energy Connects reported.\n\nSadly, such admirable retrospection will likely never occur to Al Gore, arguably history’s leading figure in propagating climate hysteria and someone who has reportedly made a fortune from his climate alarmism. Gore’s reaction to Gates’ newfound enlightenment was a predictable temper tantrum during which he speculated that Gates had succumbed to “bullying” by President Trump.\n\nTakes one to know one – Gore has often been accused of bullying those not on board with his climate crusade.\n\nIn an increasingly splintered movement that once marched in lockstep, it may be that someday only Al Gore will remain – the last true believer of a story he largely authored, perched atop his high horse at his solar-powered compound.\n\nGary Abernathy is a longtime newspaper editor, reporter and columnist.
