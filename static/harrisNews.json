Matthew Jury, the lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC they are “absolutely bewildered why the Trump administration has decided to interfere in this way.”\n\nTate is a self-described misogynist who sells instructional videos instructing men how to pick up women and has advised men to physically assault women who cheat and to force them into sex. He is one of the most prominent figures in the right-wing “manosphere” of content producers popular among conservative audiences.\n\nHe is also a Trump supporter. After the 2024 election, Tate praised Trump as a “hero” who “single handedly kept two evil war mongering she witches out of office,” referring to Sec. Hillary Clinton and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Tate has become a right-wing cause célèbre. Donald Trump Jr. has described Romania’s legal action against Tate as “absolute insanity,” while Trump financier Elon Musk has praised Tate for his long-shot campaign to run for British prime minister.\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign, Trump pandered to the misogynist manosphere with multiple interviews and appearances on the podcasts and other streaming shows that make up that world. Those appearances were seen as key to Trump’s improved performance with young men in the election compared to the results in 2016 and 2020.\n\nTrump and figures in his administration like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have also extolled the virtues of misogynist, right-wing faux masculinity for years—a sentiment embodied by Tate.\n\nAdvocating for Tate, even with the distasteful rhetoric the influencer has used and the seriousness of the charges against him, are a pathway for Trump to show the manosphere and its audience that he is on their side and advocating for them. Many of these men share the world view that decades of fights for sexual equality are suppressing their rights and are yearning for a return to a misogynist system where women’s views and roles are minimized.\n\nFurthermore, Trump himself is an admitted serial assaulter of women. He has bragged about groping women, been accused of sexual assault, and has surrounded himself with other men that have been the subject of similar accusations.\n\nIn Trump’s view, Tate is a fellow traveler. Advocating for the misogynist also feeds into the false narratives promoted by Trump, Musk, and other conservative figures that international governments are in on a conspiracy to suppress “traditional” (misogynist) values. \n\nWhen Trump rails against “woke” mindsets and pushes to purge it from the U.S. government by rolling back civil rights protections, that also applies to global governments. In their distorted view, Romania’s government is being too “woke” by restricting the movement of an accused sex trafficker.\n\nTrump is not tough on crime, as the freed perpetrators of Jan. 6 can attest to. But now that also applies to alleged crime in other countries, as long as the cause of fake masculinity can be advanced.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nDespite his repeated claims that he is in favor of “law and order,” Donald Trump’s administration is pressuring the Romanian government to roll back travel restrictions on right-wing influencer Andrew Tate, who has been accused of rape and human trafficking.\n\n\n\nTate is currently under house arrest following his 2023 arrest.

If Republicans hold their majority through the 2026 midterms, Trump could enjoy four years of a Republican-led Congress supporting his agenda, along with a conservative-majority Supreme Court.What To Know Trump opened his speech in Maryland on Saturday by touting his staff, naming allies, and reflecting on his high polling numbers. Part way through his speech, he said, \"With the help of so many incredible supporters here today, we are going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.\"CPAC is an annual gathering of leading conservative voices and Make America Great Again (MAGA) activists. This year's four-day event featured Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, Argentina's President Javier Milei, among others.The president then predicted that the party is going to \"do fantastically well in the midterms.\"\"We're at a level—I don't think we have been at this level maybe ever, as a Republican Party. We are a bigger, better, stronger party than ever before. More people in our party than ever before,\" he said.Newsweek has reached out to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for comment via email on Saturday.In last year's election, Trump won both the popular vote and the Electoral College, securing over 77 million votes and beating out then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The Republican president won all seven swing states, and more than 89 percent of counties shifted redder, according to The New York Times.Several high-stakes Senate races are already set for November 2026, including in Michigan following Democratic Senator Gary Peters' decision not to seek reelection, Georgia, North Carolina, and Maine.In order for Democrats to regain control of the House, they would need a net gain of three seats, and a net gain of four in the Senate. Voter turnout in midterm elections is significantly lower than general elections.Previous Midterm Election ResultsIn the most recent midterm elections in 2022, held during Democratic President Joe Biden's term, Republicans won control of the House, while Democrats retained a slim majority in the Senate. The election saw relatively high voter turnout, with Democrats outperforming initial forecasts.During Trump's first term, the 2018 midterm elections resulted in significant political shifts. Democrats gained 40 seats in the House, flipping control of the chamber, and captured seven governorships. Meanwhile, Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate.While typically the party in the White House doesn't fare as well during midterms, that was not the case in the 2002 midterms. Republican President George W. Bush saw his party make notable gains a year after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, gaining eight seats in the House and two in the Senate.What People Are SayingLakshya Jain of Split Ticket, an election analysis and forecasting organization, wrote in an X, formerly Twitter, post in January: \"One side effect here is because these voters mostly don't vote in midterms, Dems could very plausibly change ~nothing and still win the national vote comfortably in 2026 while flipping the House and the Maine/North Carolina senate seats, before running into similar issues in 2028.\"Blake Allen, an attorney with 19,500 followers on X, wrote in a February 13 post: \"It's cold comfort for Democrats, but if Republicans move forward with the mix of: cutting Medicaid, cutting SNAP, cutting the taxes of corporations & rich Americans all the while raising taxes on the poor/middle class through tariffs the 2026 midterms are going to be wild.\"Red Eagle Politics, a political commentary account with over 105,000 followers on X, wrote in a January post: \"Both insane electoral hubris and total defeatism are bad for 2026. We're not guaranteed an asterisk midterm (party in power gains) just because Trump won, and an asterisk midterm is still possible if we put in the work.\"What Happens Next?Although the midterm elections are not until November 3, 2026, campaigning and fundraising for key races are expected to ramp up soon.","summary":"The president predicted on Saturday that his party will do well in the 2026 midterm elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicts-republicans-defy-history-cpac-speech-2034907","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2593645/donald-trump-cpac.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 23:21:54","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.101},{"id":293338570,"title":"Trump promises extensive reduction in federal jobs, saying this is unprecedented","text":"OXON HILL, Md. — President Donald Trump said Saturday that “nobody has ever seen anything” like his administration’s sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government, congratulating himself for “dominating” Washington and sending bureaucrats “packing.”\n\nAddressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, Trump promised, “We’re going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come.”\n\nThe president has spent the opening weeks of his administration arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration.\n\nTrump clicked easily back into campaign mode during a speech that lasted more than an hour, predicting that the GOP will continue to win and defy history, which has shown that a president’s party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. He insisted of Republicans, “I don’t think we’ve been at this level, maybe ever.”\n\n“Nobody’s ever seen anything like this, and nobody’s ever seen four weeks like we had,” Trump said, likening his new administration’s opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth.\n\nTrump has empowered Elon Musk to help carry out the firings, and the billionaire vowed Saturday more may be coming.\n\n“Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”\n\nConsistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week.Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22, 2025\n\nOfficials received an email with the subject line “What did you do last week?” and a message reading “Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager. Please do not send any classified information, links, or attachments. Deadline is this Monday at 11:59pmEST.” \n\nTrump also repeatedly said Saturday that he’d carry out harder-line immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed by his administration’s mass federal firings. He announced that one agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\n“The agency’s name has been removed from its former building,” he said.\n\nThe president also repeated his previous promises that his administration will scrutinize the country’s gold depository at Fort Knox.\n\n“Would anybody like to join us,” he said to cheers from the crowd. “We want to see if the gold is still there.”\n\nBut Trump also devoted large chunks of his address reliving last year’s presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris — his Election Day opponent — gleefully proclaiming, “I haven’t said that name in a while.”\n\nHe even mentioned Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who ran for president in 2020.\n\nThe president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him angry. “I couldn’t stand it,” Trump said, before cautioning himself, “Donald, don’t get angry.” He went on to use an expletive to describe how he thinks of Biden’s handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language.\n\nTrump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying “I happen to like” him, while adding, “we’ve been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries.”\n\nOn the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia’s war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and Argentine President Javier Milei, who himself separately addressed the conference.\n\nTrump called Duda “a fantastic man and a great friend of mine” and said “you must be doing something right, hanging out with Trump.” He noted that Milei was “a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.”\n\nDuda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThose meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is meeting on Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nTrump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a “dictator” while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor.\n\nTrump said during his speech, “I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy. I’m dealing with President Putin” and added of fighting in Ukraine, “It affects Europe. It doesn’t really affect us.”\n\nZelenskyy has said Trump is living in a Russian-made “disinformation space.”\n\nFor much of the time since Russia invaded in February 2022, the United States, under Biden, pledged that Ukraine would play in any major effort to end the fighting, vowing “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” Trump’s administration has dispensed with that notion, as the Republican president has accelerated his push to find an endgame to the war.\n\n“I think we’re pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal,” Trump said Saturday of ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nLater, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in Washington.\n\nWeissert reported from Washington.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFederal employees must report their weekly &#8216;accomplishments&#8217; or resign, Musk says.

Everybody had a good time. Everybody had a wet dream. Everybody saw the sunshine.”\n\n The 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference held this week just outside of Washington, D.C., was exactly like that, if you’re someone who orgasms whenever they have nightmares filled with sounds of fascist shrieking. \n\n Between Wednesday and Saturday, the American Conservative Union held its annual CPAC at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, a marquee gathering of conservative diehards and voters, Republican activists and operatives, and high-ranking GOP elected officials and appointees. Since 2017, the annual summit has grown thoroughly MAGAfied and run as a multi-day, boozy adulation-fest of Donald Trump and his nativist personality cult. \n\n But CPAC 2025 is the first one held since Trump retook power in the 2024 presidential election — as a twice-impeached, repeatedly indicted, convicted felon, who won on a policy platform that was somehow more openly authoritarian than in his previous campaigns. It’sthe first CPAC since the failed assassination attempts on the 45th and now 47th president of the United States. It is the first one since Trump scored not just a swing-state victory against Vice President Kamala Harris, but beat her in the popular vote, sending the Democratic Party back into the bitter cold as a humiliated opposition.\n\n When Trump hit the stage, there was willful triumph, and there were also hints of several of the bleakest horrors likely to come.\n\n “Somethin’s wrong,” the president told the CPAC audience — including the pardoned Jan. 6 Capitol attack defendants who hung out near the press area, cheering on Trump — on Saturday.\n\n The president was talking about the rate of babies being diagnosed with autism. He assured the attendees that his Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., would get to the bottom of it. “Bobby’s gonna find it,” Trump said. (Some of RFK Jr.’s policy views — on autism, vaccines, and other health issues — have long been so extreme and dangerous that Trump’s own former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb has publicly warned that if RFK Jr. gets his way, it will get Americans killed.)\n\n The rest of Trump’s speech was largely garden-variety rambling and boasting. But to offer you a taste: Trump knocked the “stuttering” and “mentally screwed-up” media personalities on MSNBC, which he trollishly labeled a “threat to democracy,” a term that is accurately leveled at him, including by hosts and journalists on the liberal cable news network. “I should go against her in the ratings,” he said of MSNBC star Rachel Maddow. Trump later pivoted to mocking his vanquished predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as a “sleepy, crooked guy,” saying that “every single thing he touched turned to shit.” That naughtier line led to a cascade of whistles, cheers, claps, and some “WE LOVE YOU” shouts from the gathering.\n\n The president added that Biden was such a historically lousy president that former President Jimmy Carter died a “happy man” — apparently suggesting that Carter could pass away knowing that Biden was worse than he was. (Carter said last summer he was hoping to survive long enough “to vote for Kamala Harris,” and got his wish.)\n\n Trump received perhaps his greatest standing ovation and round of applause of the day when he bragged about pardoning all of those “political prisoners” — meaning, the violent rioters and others he inspired to attack the U.S. Capitol in Washington four years ago, when Trump spent months trying to steal an election he had lost.\n\n Love it or loathe it, the MAGA movement — and Kennedy’s MAHA movement — won. Boy, did they really, really win. Right now, the country is theirs. At this year’s CPAC, they had a lot to brag about, many footballs to spike, and Gulf Of Mexico-sized oceans of liberal tears in which to gleefully doggy-paddle.\n\n And yet, the 2025 CPAC possessed a palpable undercurrent of the old saying: “There are only two tragedies in life — one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.”\n\n It wasn’t just this “biased” Rolling Stone reporter — who has been going to these increasingly godless, blood-spitting summits since “Steve Stockman’s Awesome Hot Tub Party” was a horrifying thing that was permitted to occur — feeling this way. Numerous Republican perennial attendees, right-wing media figures, longtime conservative operatives, and even some of the CPAC 2025 speakers conceded to Rolling Stone on Friday and Saturday that the conference just wasn’t as much fun as it used to be. The booze still flowed this week, but the nightlife wasn’t as vast or as memorably decadent as it once was, particularly in the glory days when their Great Satan (President Barack Obama) was in office.\n\n But life goes on. MAGA celebs and donors still threw on their suits and tuxedos for the annual Ronald Reagan Dinner, and attendees and Trump allies still flooded the Gaylord National lobby bar after-hours, to carouse and network against the background noise of a portable stereo cranking out “Like a Virgin,” “Party in the U.S.A.,” and — mother of Christ — Trump’s theme song since the 2020 campaign, “Y.M.C.A.”\n\n Yes, several MAGA fans were observed spontaneously doing their own versions of Trump’s hand-jerk shimmy-dance to the famous Village People anthem, mid-bar. This is how we live now.\n\n But something to keep in mind about CPAC is that more than anything else, it is an annual mass-assembly of the hysterical stereotype of the upper-middle-class, Fox News and Newsmax TV-binging elderly aunt and uncle, with hundreds of these aunts and uncles all gathered in the same ballroom. In between the main-stage Q&A’s and star speakers — senior Trump aide Stephen Miller was on to rail against “illegal aliens” again! Our nation’s prime minister, Elon Musk, is playing with a chainsaw prop! Trump’s “Border Czar” Tom Homan is here to talk about his immigration crackdown, and doesn’t care if he offends anyone!( President Trump finally showed up! Former Fox News personality Megyn Kelly is up there unloading on Blake Lively for some reason! — the CPAC organizers play an awful lot of filler on the Gaylord hotel ballroom’s big screens.\n\n These videos typically feature footage from Fox News and other Trump-friendly media outlets, advertisements for this or that reactionary entity or product, promotions of Christian-right causes, denunciations of Trump’s nemeses, and exuberant celebrations of The Donald himself. (This is, of course, when CPAC staff aren’t pumping intermission music, such as “Hot Stuff” by Donna Summer, into the venue.)\n\n To attend or cover CPAC as somebody who isn’t squarely in the tank for Trumpism is akin to spending several days sitting in the collective living room of the most comfortable, frantically aggrieved parts of Trump’s base, trapped watching and listening to them yell and howl in unison at a large television set.\n\n The annual ritual straddles the thin line between laughable and perverse, and it only feels harder to laugh off when it is performed during a time when Trump, Musk (the richest person on the planet), and their lieutenants are doing everything they can to birth a new era of constitutional crisis, clampdowns, rampant bigotry, mindless chaos, oligarchic corruption, lawlessness, international embarrassment, and democratic backsliding.\n\n There used to be moments of dark humor in events like these. There was nothing funny about watching Trump’s “border czar” whip the room into a giddy frenzy at the thought of loading planes with migrants and flying them to Gitmo — an actual second Trump administration policy that a few years ago would have sounded like a lazy parody or caricature of Trumpist depravity.\n\n But running parallel to the weekend’s banal terror was the pulsating, ever-present bonanza of cultural grievance, aimed by an entire political party and movement not just at the poor and vulnerable, but at the lamest targets imaginable.\n\n During the entire span of CPAC 2025, Trump’s speech wasn’t even the most accurate summation of the petty, petulant heart of the MAGA elite. \n\n It was Megyn Kelly’s.\n\n Around 4 p.m. ET on Friday, Kelly embarked on an extended riff on actress Blake Lively.\n\n “Poor Blake Lively,” Kelly said, in a wah-wah-wah voice of mockery.\n\n This part of the speech went on seemingly forever. This was not a tangent or fleeting gripe. The former Fox News marquee-name went long on what amounted to a gratuitously nasty Wikipedia edit of the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni controversy.\n\n Kelly characterized Lively as a “brat” and a “bully” who was picking on the “very effeminate”-looking Baldoni. She told the CPACers that she believes the reason some “conservatives are so interested in this” Hollywood saga and legal dispute is because they see her as an “avatar for leftist overreach.” She claimed that the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump and Musk have been throttling and terrorizing, is playing the “victim,” which she argued was “just like Blake Lively.”\n\n This went on for a while, and it was unclear if most of her audience knew what she was talking about.\n\n But in essence, this is exactly what the MAGA political phenomenon is about: Trump and his fellow elites vomiting their own grievances and celebrity obsessions onto a crowd, hoping they lap it up in a highly destructive, apocalyptic form of group-therapy.\n\n On Saturday, not even Mr. Trump could top that.","summary":"The annual MAGA gathering felt like watching the most comfortable, frantically aggrieved parts of Trump’s base yell at the TV","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/cpac-2025-trump-conservative-elites-celebrate-1235276778/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/TrumpCPAC2025-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 22:13:28","author":"Althea Legaspi,Asawin Suebsaeng","authors":["Althea Legaspi","Asawin Suebsaeng"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":293335776,"title":"Trump revels in mass firings and jeers at Biden before adoring conference crowd","text":"The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the US-Mexico border and to extend tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration.\n\nMr Trump clicked easily back into campaign mode during a speech that lasted more than an hour, predicting that the Republican Party will continue to win and defy history, which has shown that a president’s party typically struggles during mid-term congressional elections.\n\nNobody's ever seen anything like this, and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we had\n\nHe insisted of Republicans, “I don’t think we’ve been at this level, maybe ever”.\n\n“Nobody’s ever seen anything like this, and nobody’s ever seen four weeks like we had,” Mr Trump said, likening his new administration’s opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth.\n\nMr Trump has empowered Elon Musk to help carry out the firings, and the billionaire vowed on Saturday that more might be coming.\n\n“Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Mr Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”\n\nMr Trump also repeatedly said on Saturday that he would carry out harder-line immigration policies.

He insisted of Republicans, “I don’t think we’ve been at this level, maybe ever.”\n\n“Nobody’s ever seen anything like this, and nobody’s ever seen four weeks like we had,” Trump said, likening his new administration’s opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth.\n\nTrump has empowered Elon Musk to help carry out the firings, and the billionaire vowed Saturday that more might be coming.\n\n“Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”\n\nTrump also repeatedly said Saturday that he’d carry out harder-line immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed by his administration’s mass federal firings. He announced that one agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials.\n\n“The agency’s name has been removed from its former building,” he said.\n\nThe president also repeated his previous promises that his administration will scrutinize the country’s gold depository at Fort Knox.\n\n“Would anybody like to join us,” he said to cheers from the crowd. “We want to see if the gold is still there.”\n\nBut Trump also devoted large chunks of his address reliving last year’s presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris — his Election Day opponent — gleefully proclaiming, “I haven’t said that name in a while.”\n\nHe even mentioned Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who ran for president in 2020.\n\nThe president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him angry. “I couldn’t stand it,” Trump said, before cautioning himself, “Donald, don’t get angry.” He went on to use an expletive to describe how he thinks of Biden’s handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language.\n\nTrump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying “I happen to like” him, while adding, “we’ve been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries.”\n\nOn the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia’s war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and Argentine President Javier Milei, who himself separately addressed the conference.\n\nTrump called Duda “a fantastic man and a great friend of mine” and said “you must be doing something right, hanging out with Trump.” He noted that Milei was “a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.”\n\nDuda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThose meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is meeting on Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nTrump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a “dictator” while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor.\n\nTrump said during Saturday’s speech, “I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy.

In his words, if you gave Democrats a dollar bill and told them they could sell it off for 50 cents, the process would be chaotic.\n\n'They would hire 50 people to decide how to do it,' he said. 'And then would not know how to sell a dollar bill for 50 cents.'\n\nOn the other hand, Cuban explained, Donald Trump could easily figure out a way to sell the same dollar for two dollars - ending with a profit.\n\n'He'd tell you that two dollar bill is huge, it'll get you gold tennis shoes, it'll get you a Trump meme coin,' he said. 'That's the problem and that's what I learned.'\n\n'I got to a point at the first event I went to, I said to the Harris people, you're not allowed to say a word to me, I don't care what you think,' he added. 'I'm just going to do what I think is right, and that's what I tried to go out there and do.'\n\nDuring the Principles First summit, which is described as one that offers 'the nation's leading voices in defense of classical liberalism', the 66-year-old businessman criticized Joe Biden's leadership style while in the Oval Office.\n\nCalling Biden's handling of immigration at the southern border as 'awful,' the television personality had an explanation for November's losses: a simple lack of salesmanship.\n\nCuban didn't stray away from critiquing Trump as well, though he admitted that despite all else, the 47th US president could brilliantly sell a winning message.\n\nIn August of last year, the wealthy 'shark' made it clear that his support had shifted from Trump to Harris after 'he got to know him,' according to Business Insider.\n\n'I actually started off supporting Donald, and then I got to know him better,' Cuban told Vivek Ramaswamy, a former Republican presidential candidate, during an interview last year.\n\n'I was like, he's great - he's not a typical Stepford candidate. I thought that was a positive,' he added. 'But then I got to know him.'\n\nDuring the interview, which was released on X, Cuban had explained that Trump had previously appealed to him because he saw him as a political underdog that could disrupt the US political scene as a whole.\n\n'I didn't think he had a chance, and so I just wanted to kind of, you know, screw things up in traditional politics that I'm not a fan of,' he added. \n\nYet once he was made aware of Trump's business and political records, his perspective completely changed.\n\n'He was unethical then, and he's still unethical,' Cuban said of the president.\n\nBack in March, he told Axios in an email that he would vote for the Biden/Harris administration any day, simply because he didn't want to vote for a 'snake oil salesperson as president.' \n\nDuring Saturday's summit, Cuban immediately slammed down Mayo asking if he was ready to be the next presidential candidate, despite teasing a presidential run as an independent in the past.\n\n'Hell no,' he replied. 'No. No. No, it's not going to happen.'\n\n'No, I don't want to be president. I'd rather f*** up health care,' he quickly added, which appeared to be a nod to the Cost Plus drug company he recently launched.\n\nCuban made it clear that he doesn't believe Trump will successfully deliver on a slew of his campaign promises while simultaneously discussing how Democrats are 'too reflexive' to the president's whims.\n\n'Donald Trump puts PR over policy,' Cuban said. 'He doesn't want to govern. He wants to sell.' \n\nLast weekend's event isn't the first time that the minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks has used colorful language.\n\nEarlier this month, Cuban told angry fans to 'shut the f*** up and sit the f*** down' before the men were ejected from the American Airlines Center during a wild night in Dallas.\n\nIrate over the controversial trade that sent franchise cornerstone Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers, fans held up large signs reading ‘FIRE NICO’ – a reference to Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who made the deal.\n\nESPN had viewed the footage of Cuban yelling at the fans. The team’s former majority owner has also corroborated their version of events, albeit with some added details. \n\nAs Cuban told ESPN, he did curse at the fans, but only after they began yelling at him. He explained that the only reason he was speaking to them in the first place was because they were chanting ‘fire Nico’ while the Mavs were shooting free throws.","summary":"Billionaire Mark Cuban candidly revealed his biggest takeaway from supporting Kamala Harris in the wake of the 2024 election last year in a scathing critique about Democrats.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14425067/Billionaire-Mark-Cuban-reveals-scathing-revelation-Democrats.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/22/21/95481289-0-image-m-136_1740258863860.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 21:51:29","author":"Editor,Kelly Garino","authors":["Editor","Kelly Garino"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.376},{"id":293330674,"title":"Trump brags of ‘liberating’ America in meandering CPAC speech","text":"President Donald Trump on Saturday described the chaotic first month of his new administration as nothing short of liberating the United States from the tyranny of a Democratic-led government that had pushed too far to empower minorities and encourage immigration as he spoke to an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the fourth and final day of the annual event in Maryland, Trump bragged about the narrow election victory in last year’s election, which he called “too big to rig” and said his win over Vice President Kamala Harris had “achieved the great liberation of America.”\n\n“We're liberating our country right now. We're doing all these things that you're reading about. We're liberating our country,” he said. \n\nTrump recalled how he’d first spoken at CPAC 14 years earlier, when after spending his life as a prominent Democratic donor he began courting celebrity in Republican political circles by spreading a racist lie about the citizenship of then-president Barack Obama, the first and thus far only non-white person to serve as President of the United States. \n\nHe noted that he’d won that year’s CPAC straw poll of potential presidential candidates and suggested that was how he’d decided to run for president in the first place. \n\n“I didn't know anything about a straw poll. They took this big straw poll, and I won by like 27 points. And I figured, you know, that's good. Maybe I should keep doing it. And I did and I became president,” he said.\n\nTrump’s grip on the party has only grown. Before he took the stage, Jim McLaughlin, Trump’s campaign pollster, showed the results of the straw poll, which revealed that Trump had a 99 percent approval rating. \n\nHis remarks, delivered just one month and two days after he was sworn in for the first non-consecutive served by an American president in more than a century, were largely self-congratulatory and denigrating of his predecessor, Joe Biden, of whom he unfavorably compared to the late 39th president Jimmy Carter, who died last year at age 100.\n\nThe president surmised that Carter must have “passed away a happy man” because Biden was “the worst,” leaving a mess that he is now charged with “cleaning up.”\n\n“Every single thing he touched turned to s**t, okay? Everything. It’s true,” Trump said. \n\nAs he continued, Trump singled out for praise a succession of far-right leaders who’d flocked to the annual confab as a result of American Conservative Union boss Matt Schlapp’s efforts to build an international alliance of authoritarian, anti-liberal parties under the CPAC banner. \n\nAmong the international figures he name-checked were Argentinian president Javier Milei, Spanish Vox party leader Santiago Abascal, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Polish President Andrzej Duda, the latter of whom Trump sat down with for a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the conference. \n\nThroughout the four-day conference, young conservative men decked out in black “Make America Great Again” hats. Defendants whom Trump pardoned for their actions during the January 6 riot four years ago took selfies with fans. A handful of them stood in the ballroom chanting “J6” and thanked Trump for giving them back their freedom. \n\nEnrique Tarrio, the former head of the Proud Boys, took selfies with people outside the ballroom.\n\nThroughout his address, people chanted “U.S.A.” in the packed ballroom at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center. People remained on their feet from the beginning of the sound system playing Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the U.S.A.”\n\nFor the CPAC leadership, it was a vindication. American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp and his wife Mercedes introduced Trump, saying they had chosen to stick with him and not pave the way for another Republican to take the mantle in the years following his defeat at the hands of Joe Biden in the 2020 election. \n\n“We knew in our hearts, we knew in our souls that there was only one man ordained to do this most impossible job,” he said.\n\nDemocrats have criticized Trump’s hiring of Elon Musk to run the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. But during his speech, Trump praised the X and SpaceX executive’s slashing of federal spending, rattling off programs Musk has halted. \n\nThe president, who frequently spends days at a time working from his Florida home in between leisurely games of golf, echoed a line frequently used by the world’s wealthiest man when he claimed the remote work policies implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic had been “a scam” and baselessly claimed that federal workers, who are legally barred from outside employment, were taking advantage of remote work policies to hold second jobs.\n\nHe said the 75,000 workers who’d accepted a dubious buyout offer from Musk’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” had done so to avoid having to disclose their illicit outside employment. \n\n“One of the reasons they're leaving is because they don't want to have to show that. And we're demanding to see that information. How many jobs have you had? Who paid you while you were working for the government?” he said.\n\n“We've escorted the radical left bureaucrats out of the building and locked the doors behind them. We've gotten rid of thousands.”\n\nTurning to the matter of the three-year-old Russian war on Ukraine, Trump said his goal in negotiating an end to the war through negotiations that have thus far excluded Ukraine’s western-aligned government is to “get the money back” that America had contributed to Kyiv’s defense in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade. \n\nHe claimed that European nations had contributed far less to Ukraine than the U.S. because the U.S. had “a stupid, incompetent president and administration” under Biden, and said he wants Ukraine to “give us something for all of the money that we put up.”\n\nThe “something” Trump alluded to is likely access to over 50 percent of Ukraine’s mineral wealth under the terms of a deal that has thus far been rejected by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nTrump has repeatedly attacked Zelensky in recent days, calling the democratically-elected leader a “dictator” and threatening to pull U.S. support for his country’s defense. \n\n“We're going to get our money back because it's not it's not fair. It's just not fair, and we will see,” he said.","summary":"Trump has been a constant presence at the right-wing conference since he burst onto the Republican political scene by attacking the country’s first Black president","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-cpac-speech-liberating-america-b2702942.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/22/20/22/2025-02-22T203919Z_1164523371_RC2VZCA1EDIC_RTRMADP_3_USA-POLITICS-CPAC.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9soUw5q3-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-22 21:50:56","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":293334502,"title":"Trump slams MSNBC as ‘threat to democracy’ in wake of NBCUniversal’s lawsuit settlement","text":"President Donald Trump took to Truth Social early Saturday morning to blast MSNBC as a “threat to our democracy.”\n\n“MSNBC, COMMONLY KNOWN AS MSDNC, IS A THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY.

SUCH LYING AND MISREPRESENTATION. BAD PEOPLE AT THE TOP,\" Trump wrote. Trump railed against MSNBC last month as well, questioning whether the news outlet should \"even have a right to broadcast\". MSNBC’S PRIMETIME LINEUP HAS WORST JANUARY EVER AMONG DEMOGRAPHIC COVETED BY ADVERTISERS \"MSDNC is even worse than CNN. They shouldn’t even have a right to broadcast — Only in America!,\" Trump posted to Truth Social, responding to a report from Mediaite about CNN facing layoffs. These comments from Trump come amidst battles between the president and multiple other news outlets. The Associated Press was barred from White House Events after the outlet ignored Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America in its reporting. The White House's barring of the news outlet was listed as the primary reason the outlet is now suing the White House. Trump is also involved in another lawsuit against CBS, in which he is seeking damages for what he claims to be deceptive editing of the now notorious \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AGAINST CBS EXPANDS AFTER RELEASE OF '60 MINUTES' TRANSCRIPT, ADDS PARAMOUNT AS DEFENDANT MSNBC's parent company, NBCUniversal, recently settled a lawsuit against them after the outlet claimed Georgia gynecologist Dr. Mahendra Amin performed unnecessary hysterectomies at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center. The \"uterus collector\" lawsuit saw Rachel Maddow, Nicolle Wallace, and Chris Hayes’ programs make \"verifiably false\" statements against the Georgia gynecologist. The parties have agreed to, and signed, a term sheet to settle the lawsuit, according to a joint notice of settlement obtained by Fox News Digital. The parties are working to finalize the language of the settlement agreement and are expected to effectuate the settlement within the next several weeks. The settlement comes weeks after a Florida jury found that CNN committed defamation against U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young and was responsible for punitive damages. The six-person jury ruled Young was awarded $4 million in lost earnings, $1 million in personal damages such as pain and suffering and said that punitive damages are warranted against CNN. As the jury was gearing up to determine punitive damages, 14th Judicial Circuit Court Judge William S. Henry announced that Young and CNN reached a settlement for the amount that would be awarded to the Navy veteran.

Smith fires back at Carville after being told to \"stick to sports\"","text":"ESPN broadcaster Stephen A. Smith has no time for James Carville’s dated trash talk about his political prospects.\n\n\"Sir, do you have to be so rude?” Smith said on his podcast Friday, after the Bill Clinton strategist went on a long-winded rant about the sportscaster on his own podcast. “Dropping F-bombs and going off like that. I know that’s your nature...But let’s just say two can do that. I mean, if you really wanted to get raw, ain’t nobody hiding from that.\n\n\"I could be that way, but my mom told me to respect my elders,\" Smith continued. \"And you are 80 years of age if I remember correctly.\"\n\nThe brash octagenarian Democratic Party lifer – who lately can be found trashing Kamala Harris’s campaign ad nauseam – took to his “Politics War Room” podcast earlier this week to claim that, “when it comes to politics, he [Smith] doesn’t know his ass from a hole in the ground.”\n\n“He’s on there running his damn mouth about how he may have to run as a Democrat because there's nothing left of the Democratic Party, there’s no talent,” Carville said. “Before you start running f**king your mouth off about politics, a topic of which you really don't know anything about, you ought to sit back and think about it. Call some people and run it by them.”\n\nBack on his own podcast, Smith went on to question the true source of Carville’s fury, suggesting that his loss of a podium was more to blame.\n\n“You sound like one of those old curmudgeons that want things to stay the or be the way that they used to be. You're resentful, harboring an abundance of animosity because you're not being heard,” Smith said. “That's not Stephen A.

You sure? Are you sure? You might want to think about that.”\n\nSmith’s potential run earned a write-up from the New Yorker last weekend, weeks after a poll showed the “First Take” commentator capturing a shocking slice of Democratic voters in a hypothetical 2028 race.

But now, I’m amazed by the Trump cabinet (many of whom I would have picked). I love his message to the Ukrainian warmongers, and along with his DOGE initiative shows I was wrong to withhold my endorsement. So today, admittedly a little tardy, I give Donald Trump my enthusiastic endorsement! (Too little too late some will say, but, you know, it is sincere, there is that.) Don’t expect this endorsement to be fawning. I still think tariffs are a terrible idea, but Dios Mio, what courage, what tenacity. Go @realDonaldTrump Go!\n\nOther Republicans were silent about Trump’s king declaration, which would have been the lead story for days on right-wing cable if a Democratic president had said the same thing.\n\nAs for the Trump and co-President Elon Musk’s sloppy effort to gut the federal workforce—which accidentally led to the ouster of essential workers who are maintaining the country’s nuclear arsenal, trying to stop the bird flu from becoming the next pandemic, and managing a fund that pays for treatment for 9/11 survivors and first responders—Republicans threw up their arms and said there’s nothing they can do.\n\n“Congress can’t do anything except complain about it,” Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa told reporters in Iowa, according to Radio Free Iowa, “but I think we have to have sympathy and\n\nunderstanding for people that are laid off.”\n\nIn fact, most Republicans said they are fine with slashing the federal workforce, and have had only tepid criticism of the Trump administration’s poor execution of those cuts. \n\n“I think we all know that the administration—the new administration—is giving a very careful scrub to the government, to all the agencies of the government, to figure out how we can do things more efficiently and save money for the American taxpayer,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said at a news conference. “It’s important, in doing that, that you don’t undermine important services. In many cases, as you point out, there are some that affect my state. There are some that affect all of my colleagues’ states around the country, and we will work with the administration as they move forward to ensure that important services that have to do with health and safety, for example, are protected and preserved.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Trump and Musk, who is helping push the cuts to the federal workforce, need to slow down because “they're making mistakes.”\n\n“This latest example of individuals who were studying bird flu being fired from the Department of Agriculture is a perfect example. Another is that they mistakenly put in charge of the FBI, a person that they didn't intend to be in charge temporarily of the FBI, that's what happens when you move too fast and you don't take the time to do a careful evaluation,” Collins told HuffPost’s Igor Bobic.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said Trump and Musk have their hearts in the right place but that their execution has been off. \n\n“I share the administration’s goal of reducing the size of the federal government, but this approach is bringing confusion, anxiety, and now trauma to our civil servants—some of whom moved their families and packed up their whole lives to come here,” Murkowski said in a post on X. “Indiscriminate workforce cuts aren’t efficient and won’t fix the federal budget, but they will hurt good people who have answered the call to public service to do important work for our nation.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who occupies a district that Democrat Kamala Harris won in the 2024 presidential election, echoed similar sentiments.\n\n\"Before making cuts rashly, the Administration should be studying and staffing to see what the consequences are. Measure twice before cutting. They have had to backtrack multiple times,\" Bacon said. \n\nBut the dumbest comment came from Sen. Tommy Tuberville, the Alabama Republican who is excited that Trump and Musk are going to make cuts at the Department of Defense next.\n\n“I wouldn't be against them taking it from a Pentagon to a Trigon. Cut a couple sides off of it,” Tuberville said, apparently not aware that a shape with three sides is called a triangle.\n\nMeanwhile, even when Republicans disagreed with what the Trump administration was doing, they refused to say Trump was responsible, speaking in circles to try to avoid angering Dear Leader Don.\n\nA number of Republicans criticized Russian dictator Vladimir Putin’s efforts to force an election in Ukraine, but did not criticize Trump for siding with Putin in that effort.\n\n“Putin is now asking for a new election in Ukraine, conducted in a specific manner that he can influence, so that he can install his puppet and accomplish that which he couldn’t militarily. Nice try, Vladimir. Try holding a free and fair election in your own country first without imprisoning your opponents. You have zero credibility and the United States and Europe will not cave to your ridiculous demands,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican, of Pennsylvania, said in a post on X, even though Trump is also pushing for Ukraine to hold an election.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York wrote a similarly tough post on X about Putin—but never once said Trump was wrong for embracing him.\n\n“Vladimir Putin is a vile dictator and thug, who has worked in a concerted effort with China and Iran to undermine and destabilize the United States, Europe, Israel, and the free world. He is not our friend, nor our ally,” Lawler wrote.\n\nTrump aired an opposing sentiment on Wednesday, when he falsely described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a dictator. And when Thune was asked if he also views the Zelenskyy that way, Thune responded, “The president speaks for himself.”\n\nMurkowski played dumb when asked for her response to Trump’s Zelenskyy comment.\n\n“I would like to see that in context, because I would certainly never refer to President Zelenskyy as a dictator,” Murkowski said. \n\nAnd Sen. Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, said he was going to ask the White House for “clarification” about what Trump meant when he called Zelenskyy a dictator—as if Trump’s comment didn’t speak for itself.\n\nAs Trump once said, he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not lose any voters. The same, apparently, goes for Republican members of Congress.","summary":"If you thought this would be the week Republicans grew a spine and stood up to President Donald Trump’s lawlessness, embrace of murderous dictators over American allies, infliction of suffering through thoughtless cuts to the federal workforce, and even declaration that he is a “king,” well … you’d be wrong.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have overwhelmingly held their tongues, refusing to criticize Trump for his destructive behavior and acting as if they are powerless to stop his rampage through the federal government.\n\n\n\nRepublican Sen.

Bannon was accused of giving a Nazi salute after he extended his right arm out with palm facing out after his address, though he has denied the claim.Newsweek has contacted CPAC and Jordan Bardella, via the National Rally, using their respective online inquiry forms.Why It MattersOn January 20 Elon Musk was accused of delivering a fascist salute during an inauguration day event in Washington, D.C. The tech billionaire raised his right arm out from his chest after saying his \"heart goes out to you,\" though he insisted the gesture was innocent and accused critics of \"dirty tricks\" on his X social media platform.Later the Anglican Catholic Church revoked the license of Calvin Robinson, a Michigan priest originally from the U.K., after he repeated the gesture during the National Pro-Life Summit in Washington, D.C., on January 25.During the 2024 presidential election Democratic candidate Kamala Harris said she believed Trump was a fascist during a CNN town hall, after John Kelly, his former White House chief of staff, described the Republican as someone who \"certainly falls into the general definition of fascists.\" In response Trump insisted he was \"the opposite of a Nazi\" and accused Harris of being a fascist in turn.What To KnowDuring his address to CPAC on Thursday Bannon said: \"We're not going to retreat, we're not going to surrender. Fight, fight, fight.\" He then raised his right arm out in what critics said was a Nazi or fascist salute, though he rejected the claim.National Rally leader Bardella, who had been due to speak at CPAC on Friday, pulled out of the event citing what he called a \"gesture referring to Nazi ideology.\" Bardella, 29, is a member of the European Parliament and has been discussed as a potential future National Rally presidential contender.Bannon insisted his gesture had been a \"wave\" and said it was the \"exact same wave\" he had performed previously while addressing a National Rally conference.Speaking to French magazine Le Point about Bardella's speech cancellation he said: \"If he canceled over what the mainstream media said about the speech, he didn't listen to the speech. If that's true, he's unworthy to lead France. He's a boy, not a man.\"In a separate interview with French network BFM TV, which was shared on X by the \"Cerfia\" media network, Bannon said: \"Jordan Bardella is a little girl and a coward. He will never lead France. He is worse than [President] Macron. I curse him. It was a salute to the crowd.\"The past two French presidential elections saw Emmanuel Macron beat Marine Le Pen, candidate of the National Front that she renamed National Rally, in the runoff.A number of other foreign politicians spoke at CPAC including former British Prime Minister Liz Truss, Argentine President Javier Milei and Reform U.K. leader Nigel Farage. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is scheduled to speak on Saturday before President Trump.What People Are SayingDuring his CPAC address Bannon suggested Trump could run for a third term in 2028, which would require the U.S. constitution to be amended.He said: \"The future of America is MAGA, OK? And the future of MAGA is Donald J. Trump. We want Trump in '28. That's what they can't stand. A man like Trump comes along only once or twice in a country's history, right?\"Following Bannon's address political commentator Brian Krassenstein said: \"Steve Bannon does a NAZI salute at the end of his CPAC speech. Someone try and convince me that he didn't.\"Speaking on his podcast far-right pundit Nick Fuentes said: \"Elon threw up a Roman salute. And then the other thing at CPAC…Bannon gets up there and says, 'I think Trump's gonna run in '28.' He goes, 'We want Trump,' and then he throws up a straight-up Roman salute. It's getting a little uncomfortable, even for me. Even I'm starting to feel like that guy in the picture that wouldn't hail Hitler.\"What Happens NextNational Rally is hoping to win the 2027 French presidential election and is thus desperate to avoid anything that could be seen as Nazi imagery.Trump has made a number of recent comments that suggest he is at least interested in running for a third term, though this would require a constitutional amendment that would be near impossible to pass given the Republicans slim majorities in the House and Senate.","summary":"Bannon was accused of making a \"gesture referring to Nazi ideology\" by a French nationalist leader.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-attacks-far-right-leader-after-nazi-salute-accusation-2034798","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2593545/steve-bannon.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 17:17:25","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":293281140,"title":"What Time Do NAACP Image Awards Begin?

The former vice president has signed with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) for her post-White House endeavors. That move brings her to the line with the same talent agency that previously represented Joe Biden and currently manages Michelle and Barack Obama. \n\nAccording to Variety, CAA will work closely with Harris to develop strategic opportunities that “expand her platform in support of the issues she has championed throughout her decades-long career in public service.” Biden first signed with CAA in 2017, where he used the agency to promote his No.1 New York Times bestseller Promise Me, Dad. He returned to the agency in February 2025 to be through his post-presidency phase. \n\nKamala Harris has signed with the talent agency CAA. pic.twitter.com/Kffftgv5V5\n— Pop Base (@PopBase) February 19, 2025\n\n “President Biden is one of America’s most respected and influential voices in national and global affairs,” said CAA co-chairman Richard Lovett in a statement. “His lifelong commitment to public service is one of unity, optimism, dignity, and possibility. We are profoundly honored to partner with him again.” Meanwhile, the Obamas joined hands with CAA in 2022 for their film company, Higher Ground. \n\nThe internet wasted no time roasting Harris over her new career move. X users quickly gathered in and started questioning what exactly Harris had to offer in the entertainment world. “Kamala Harris has signed with the talent agency CAA,” posted Pop Base on X, which triggered a flood of sarcastic responses. “Her talent is losing elections,” one user mocked. “What talent does Kamala Harris have??” was another question. “For what talent exactly?” a third comment read. “But I thought you needed to have talent,” another added. \n\nDespite the online backlash, Harris is strong in her ground. After her defeat in the 2024 presidential election, she focused on her commitment to keep up the fight for progress. “This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves,” Harris declared. “This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together,” she added. \n\nWhether her new deal with CAA is a political rebrand or a step toward media ventures is yet to be seen. But for now, netizens are making one thing clear—they don’t see the talent.","summary":"Kamala Harris Joins Hollywood’s Elite—But Netizens Are Asking, ‘What Talent?’","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kamala-harris-signs-with-caa-netizens-ask-for-what-talent-exactly","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Former-Vice-President-Kamala-Harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 16:54:42","author":"Mayukh B","authors":["Mayukh B"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.089},{"id":293257908,"title":"World Briefing: February 22, 2025","text":"US has signalled that it could leave an international effort to prosecute Russia for invading Ukraine, The Telegraph can reveal. US envoys refused to label Russia as an “aggressor” at a meeting of a “core group” of countries preparing a Nuremberg-style tribunal to try Vladimir Putin for his war crimes, according to Western officials. European officials fear Mr Trump’s flattery of Putin could lead to the Russian despot being let off the hook for his invasion as part of any peace settlement. This stance has put preparations for the final meeting of the “core group” next month in doubt. The group is leading a 40-nation coalition to form a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, modelled on the response to Nazi war crimes after the Second World War. It would involve the US and other countries joining Ukraine to grant jurisdiction to a dedicated criminal tribunal to investigate both the perpetrators of the crime of aggression and those complicit in that crime. The crime of aggression cannot be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. “Unless they acknowledge it’s an aggression, they can’t participate,” an official said of US opposition to the labelling of Russia as an aggressor. Losing Washington’ s backing for the tribunal will be a major blow to the project’s international reputation and standing. “This is quite a drastic shift,” a European diplomat told The Telegraph. “Rewriting history and pretending that Russia wasn’t the one who started this war is something that we simply cannot and will not agree to.” - Telegraph\n\nDonald Trump says France’s Emmanuel Macron and UK PM Keir Starmer “haven’t done anything” to end the war in Ukraine, ahead of visits from both leaders to the White House next week. Speaking to Fox News, the US president also says Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky has “no cards” in peace negotiations, adding: “I don’t think he’s very important to be in meetings.” Meanwhile, UK cabinet minister Pat McFadden says Britain is in a “potentially good position” with Trump, as he urges colleagues to focus on “what will actually happen” as well as what’s said - BBC\n\nSix Israeli captives are being released in Gaza today in exchange for 602 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The family of deceased Israeli captive Shiri Bibas confirmed that her remains have been identified after a body returned from Gaza on Thursday was discovered to belong to another person.\n\nGermany’s Interior Ministry has warned of a Russian disinformation operation seeking to influence voters and help the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD). Ministry spokesperson Maximilian Kall said security officials had reason to suspect the Kremlin-linked “Storm-1516” network was behind some of the online campaigns. Disinformation researchers say the network has previously produced fake videos to discredit the US election campaign of Kamala Harris, who was defeated by Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election. “The goal of these influence operations is to destroy confidence in democracy, to question the integrity of the electoral process,” Kall said at a Berlin press conference. The campaigns were believed to be “quite targeted at the parliamentary elections” but did not have a “wide reach,” according to Kall. One of the campaigns suggested the AfD — which is sympathetic to Russia — was being treated unfairly and involved videos falsely claiming ballots in the eastern city of Leipzig had been sent out without listing the AfD or its candidates. Kall said other false videos purported to be from the northern German city of Hamburg show what appear to be ballots for the AfD thrown in a shredder.\n\nThe South Korean government will accept any North Korean soldier captured by Ukraine upon their request of asylum, a position that has already been communicated to the Ukrainian government, Seoul’s Foreign Ministry announced. It followed a North Korean prisoner of war in Ukraine expressing his desire to settle in South Korea in an interview with the Chosun Ilbo newspaper released earlier in the day. The North Korean soldier, at the same time, raised questions about whether the South Korean government would grant him asylum if he applied. “The government, based on the basic principle of accepting all of them (prisoners of war) when they request to come to South Korea and according to relevant laws, will provide necessary protection and support,” a Foreign Ministry official said on condition of anonymity in a statement in response to a media inquiry on Seoul’s stance on North Korean prisoners of war.“We have already conveyed this position of our government to the Ukrainian side, and will continue necessary consultations.” - Korea Herald\n\nThe leaders of seven Arab countries have held talks in Saudi Arabia in an attempt to hash out a plan for the future of Gaza. The gathering on Friday in Riyadh was meant to respond to a plan raised by US President Donald Trump for the US to “take over” Gaza, permanently forcibly displace its residents and turn the Palestinian enclave into the “Riviera” of the Middle East. Arab leaders have roundly rejected Trump’s proposal, saying it throws out decades of work towards Palestinian self-determination, treads on the rights of residents of Gaza and will perpetuate a regional cycle of violence. They hope to present an alternative plan with unified support at a March 4 Arab League meeting in Cairo, Egypt. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had called the Riyadh meeting, which was attended by Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad Al Sabah and Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. No official account of the meeting had been released Friday by any of the countries involved, and it was not immediately clear if any details of a plan had been agreed to - Al Jazeera\n\nThe European Union is set to lift some sanctions on Syria related to energy, financial transactions and transport next week, a draft document viewed by The National shows. The legal text is to be consolidated and is expected to be adopted by the bloc’s 27 foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels on Monday. Exemptions for reconstructions efforts, estimated at $250 billion, are to be included in the move, The National understands. “This is an important step that we highly welcome,” one EU diplomat said. The document, which is not public, stated that the EU Council has decided to suspend a number of restrictive measures on Syria in view of the situation in the country, a reference to the toppling in December by rebel groups of the Assad regime after more than five decades in power. The document was adopted on Wednesday and is expected to be reviewed on Friday before it is submitted to the foreign ministers on Monday. The move aims to “facilitate engagement with the country, its people and businesses in areas of energy, transport and reconstruction, as well as to facilitate the associated financial and banking transactions,” the document reads. “The EU stands with the Syrian people in this moment of transition.” - The National\n\nThe Associated Press sued three Trump administration officials Friday over access to presidential events, citing freedom of speech in asking a federal judge to stop the 10-day blocking of its journalists. The lawsuit was filed Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The AP says its case is about an unconstitutional effort by the White House to control speech — in this case refusing to change its style from the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America,” as President Donald Trump did last month with an executive order. “The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,” the AP said in its lawsuit, which names White House Chief of Staff Susan Wiles, Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. “This targeted attack on the AP’s editorial independence and ability to gather and report the news strikes at the very core of the First Amendment,” the news agency said. “This court should remedy it immediately.” - AP\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) condemned the White House decision to block The Associated Press (AP) from covering official events after AP’s decision to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by its internationally known name, calling the action the latest in an alarming pattern of retaliation against a free press in the first weeks of Donald Trump’s administration. “Retaliating against AP – one of the world’s leading providers of fact-based news – for its content undermines the U.S. president’s stated commitment to free speech and prevents its audience in the U.S. and abroad from getting the news,” said CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg. “These actions follow a pattern of smearing and penalizing the press from the current administration and are unacceptable. This decision is the latest in an alarming pattern of retaliation against a free press in the first weeks of Donald Trump’s administration which include retaliatory lawsuits, punitive action by the Federal Communications Commission, the suspension of U.S. Agency for International Development funding, as well as targeted attacks against journalists and news organizations.\n\nSouth African businesses are grappling with uncertainty around the government’s economic plans after the unprecedented postponement of the budget. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana on Wednesday delayed his budget speech until Mar. 12 after the Democratic Alliance, a main coalition partner with the African National Congress, opposed plans to increase value-added tax to 17%, from 15%. The government wants to spark growth in Africa’s most advanced economy without increasing borrowing — public debt is now 75% of GDP, compared to 27% in 2008 — but VAT has become a major sticking point. The row marks the biggest policy disagreement since the ANC was forced into a coalition last year after losing its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of apartheid in 1994. With South Africa’s tax year set to start on Mar. 1, businesses lack finality around the government’s tax plans. “Uncertainty is something we can ill afford,” said Khulekani Mathe, CEO of the Business Unity South Africa organization, an employers’ group. He added that the delay casts doubt on the coalition’s “ability to collaborate effectively for the country’s benefit.” - Semafor\n\nBad news for Americans who love a meal with a side of cleavage—Hooters is going bankrupt. The popular restaurant chain, largely known for its servers’ skimpy outfits, is $300 million in debt. Almost 300 locations are scattered nationwide, historically enticing casual diners and drinkers with cheap beers and American comfort food. It isn’t the only chain prepping for its downfall—Red Lobster also filed for bankruptcy last summer. Both have blamed rising rent and food prices. Plus, they say, people are eating out less and ordering in more. The owl-themed spot first opened in Clearwater, Florida in 1983. For over four decades, it has greeted millions of Americans. But its loyal fans just aren’t cutting it anymore. Hooters is readying itself to restructure through Chapter 11—a policy which allows them to negotiate leases and loans in order to reorganize. Hooter-holics shouldn’t lose hope yet. Chapter 11 worked for Red Lobster, which emerged triumphant after closing 100 restaurants and ending their debts. The private equity-owned restaurant already shut down 40 of its “underperforming” locations in June to try and stay above water. Nationwide, dozens of chains are facing the same fate: from big players like Applebee’s and TGI Fridays to small, locally-owned businesses - Daily Beast\n\nThis Briefing is reprinted with the author’s permission.

We’re in the middle of a warm spell–so much so that the world-famous Iditarod, which was scheduled to kick off here next week, has been moved to Fairbanks. It promises to be less temperate in the villages–the “real feel” at our first stop in my week of volunteer tax preparation in Alaska is forecast to be -1 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIt’s been an incredible adventure so far. I didn’t, however, leave the news behind. Even as I was on my way (fun fact: it’s over 4,300 miles from Philadelphia to Alaska), there were several developments impacting taxpayers and tax professionals. Let’s jump right in.\n\nThis week, thousands of IRS employees were fired as part of widespread efforts by DOGE to reduce the federal workforce. You’ll find more information–including some historic numbers–in the stats section below.\n\nAlso making news? A court in the Eastern District of Texas ruled (☆) that beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting requirements under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) are back in effect. And, as the government promised, companies have been granted a little extra time to file.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, the Department of Justice filed an appeal in Smith v. U.S., one of two CTA cases winding through the court system in Texas. In its appeal, the government sought to stay an earlier preliminary injunction that would prohibit FinCEN from enforcing the CTA. On February 17, Judge Kernodle issued his ruling noting, \"In light of the Supreme Court's order in McHenry v. Texas Top Cop Shop, Inc….the Court has determined that the motion should be, and hereby is, GRANTED. The Court's January 7, 2025 order granting preliminary relief is STAYED pending the disposition of the appeal.\"\n\nThat means there are currently no legal roadblocks in the way of the reporting requirements and companies are once again required to file. In response, FinCEN noted on its website that \"[b]eneficial ownership reporting requirements are back in effect, with a new deadline of March 21, 2025 for most companies.\"\n\nFinCEN also gave a nod to making some changes to the existing rules, writing, \"FinCEN will assess its options for further modifying deadlines.\" It’s not immediately clear what that might look like–but we’ll be watching closely and will share as soon as we have more information.\n\nThe budget was also in the news this week as the House and the Senate appeared to make some headway, though their positions aren’t exactly aligned. House Republicans still hopes to pass “one big beautiful bill” (as President Trump calls it) that includes boosting border and defense spending, extending the 2017 tax cuts, cutting certain domestic programs (like Medicaid) to partially pay for the tax cuts and increasing the debt ceiling. The Senate, in contrast, is moving ahead with a two-pronged approach, focusing first on the areas where Trump wants to spend more.\n\nThe first round of the Senate blueprint includes roughly $340 billion in funding for immigration–that money includes funding for deportation and building a wall at the Mexican border (an item on Trump’s wishlist from his first term) and $150 billion in additional defense spending.\n\nThe House’s budget resolution includes $4.5 trillion for tax cuts–not enough to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts (contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA). House leadership has suggested a shorter workaround, but that’s not likely to win support in the Senate.\n\nThe failure to agree could mean a slow walk on tax cut extensions which largely expire at the end of 2025. That would be a mistake, according to Steve Forbes. Referring to what happened in 2017, Forbes writes, “A tax bill passed in December, as happened in 2017, loses a full year of economic impact. Markets and businesses make their plans well in advance. Republicans need to stop floundering over procedural details and pass significant tax cuts by April or May to affect the 2025 economy.”\n\nWhatever happens, one focus of the tax-policy debate surrounding its extension will certainly be the future of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT cap under the 2017 law, which limits the deduction, is especially unpopular in states with high income and property taxes, such as California, New Jersey, and New York. For any action on extending or making permanent the TCJA, some modification must be made in the SALT deduction to get the full vote support needed from all Republican members of the House. Trump has suggested eliminating the SALT deduction cap, but removing it would cost $1.2 trillion in federal revenue over the next decade.\n\nIf the House and the Senate can’t agree on spending by March, we could be facing another government shutdown. Spending for the federal government in our current fiscal year is only legally authorized until March 14. Congress failed to pass regular annual spending appropriations, instead resorting to a short-term continuing resolution.\n\nOne way to address spending is through cuts–and those have been in the news this week. In addition to paring back federal employment rosters (more on that below), Trump has ordered Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to seek ways to eliminate wasteful spending. One target: The IRS.\n\nDOGE has also been seeking permission to access individual tax return information. DOGE staffers already accessed filers’ tax refund information through the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Fiscal Service database–that includes the bank account information of every filer who received an electronic tax refund. (A federal judge has since temporarily curbed DOGE’s access to the Fiscal Service data.)\n\nBut DOGE wants to tap into the IRS’ Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS). Anyone with this access could enter a taxpayer’s name and Social Security number and learn their income, address, banking and brokerage account numbers, marital status, whether they had significant medical expenses, and the name of their employer and tax preparer. They could find out if a taxpayer has been audited. Former National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson, says the IDRS is “the motherlode. It contains everything.” Olson’s current organization, the Center for Taxpayer Rights, has joined a lawsuit to block DOGE access to the IDRS.\n\nWhy can’t DOGE just walk into the IRS and access that information? There are strict protections in place to safeguard taxpayer data. (☆) The protections date back more than 50 years and many have been in response to abuses during the Nixon administration.\n\nPresident Nixon told his staff he was looking for a particular type of IRS Commissioner. In a recorded call (remember, Nixon famously taped his calls), he said, \"I want to be sure he is a ruthless son of a bitch, that he will do what he's told, that every income tax return I want to see I see, that he will go after our enemies and not go after our friends. Now it's as simple as that. If he isn't, he doesn't get the job.\" The job eventually went to Johnnie Walters, who became IRS Commissioner on August 6, 1971. There’s no indication that Walters went along with Nixon’s plans (and Walters was eventually replaced) but concerns that those in government could access data and direct audits at taxpayers resulted in widespread changes to the law. Today, it’s a crime to access or share taxpayer data without authorization.\n\nThat’s a lot of news to digest, and I hope it tides you over. While I’m in the villages in Alaska, I won’t have access to the internet.

Be sure to let the Social Security Administration know.\n\nThis week, a reader asked:\n\nI was wondering how someone would do their taxes if they got married and never changed their last name?\n\nChanging your name after marriage (or divorce) can be cumbersome because there can be a lot of forms to fill out–including with the Social Security Administration. (I joke with my husband that the next time I get married, I will not change my name.)\n\nFirst things first: You don’t have to change your name when you get married to file your taxes. You can file as married without changing your name with the Social Security Administration (SSA). The key is to make sure that the name shown on your Social Security card matches the name you use on your tax return. If you’ve already changed your name with SSA following a marriage or divorce, simply use the name that’s now on file (it should match your new card).\n\nIf you’re using your married name in practice, but haven’t changed your name with the SSA, file using your former name on the tax return instead of your married name.\n\nThe same is true following a divorce. You’ll want to use the name that appears on your Social Security card.\n\nTo change your name on file with the Social Security Administration, click over to the SSA name change page and follow the instructions.\n\nDo you have a tax question or matter that you think we should cover in the next newsletter?

It's unclear how the cuts could impact the tax filing season, which kicked off on January 27, 2025. The cuts follow on the heels of other reductions to IRS personnel and the IRS budget.\n\nAccording to an official email viewed by Forbes, at least 3,500 IRS employees in the Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE) division of the IRS alone were expected to lose their jobs. The SB/SE division, currently headed up by Lia Colbert, serves more than 57 million small business owners and self-employed taxpayers—those with less than $10 million of assets. SB/SE employees may include those in the exam (audit) and collections departments and workers in operations support and fraud enforcement.\n\nOther reports suggest the total number of IRS employees expected to lose their jobs will be about 7,000—or 7% of the IRS’ workforce.\n\nThose employees who are most at risk to be cut are probationary employees. While probationary employees are often recent hires (meaning within the last one to two years), they don't have to be—those who have been serving for years but were recently moved or promoted into a new position also qualify as probationary.\n\nThose cuts follow on the heels of a Trump executive order freezing hiring for most federal agencies. The freeze is intended to be temporary—except for the IRS (the freeze is indefinite for the tax agency).\n\nAnd Trump subsequently suggested he might fire IRS employees—or send them to the border.\n\n(Last week, the Department of Homeland Security followed up (☆) by asking Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to deputize IRS agents to help with efforts to crack down on immigration.)\n\nThe IRS workforce has been subject to scrutiny in recent months. Hiring had been up, thanks to funding in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The extra money was intended to help the IRS hire 87,000 new workers—including customer service and IT workers—over the next decade. In addition to the cuts, Republicans have clawed back roughly half—$40 billion out of the $80 billion authorized IRA funding.\n\nFormer IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel had previously estimated that factoring in attrition, the IRS is approaching 90,000 full-time employees. That may look high compared to 2022, but it's the same as roughly a decade ago and far below staffing numbers in the 1990s.\n\nIRS personnel has decreased over the past 20 years—that only changed recently.\nKelly Phillips Erb\n\nWhile some on social media chose to echo talking points suggesting that the IRS was hiring–or had already hired–tens of thousands of armed agents since 2022, that isn’t the case. And the numbers aren’t a big secret: In addition to routine press conferences over the past two years touting new hires, the IRS publishes the most recent hiring numbers in an annual data book.\n\nA Deeper Dive\n\nTip credits only apply to food and beverage businesses.\n\nThe “no tax on tips” proposal that first made news during the election (promoted by both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris) is still a talking point, though it doesn’t appear to be picking up much in the way of Congressional support.\n\nCurrently, tips are taxable to tipped workers for income tax purposes—they are also subject to payroll taxes. Until 1966, tips weren’t subject to payroll taxes at all. That year, with the creation of Medicare, Congress changed the law to impose FICA taxes on tips, but just on the employee’s side. It added some employer FICA taxes on tips in 1977 and in 1987 required employers to kick in FICA taxes on all tips.\n\nToday, most employers aren’t big fans of payroll taxes on tips. That’s because employers must pay the employer-side portion of the payroll tax on tips even though the funds never hit their wallets (they belong to the tipped employees). Enter the FICA tip credit. The FICA tip credit benefits certain employers by offsetting the FICA taxes paid on tips that employees earn beyond the federal minimum wage.\n\nThe credit only applies to tips above the federal minimum wage level. A few states, such as California and Washington, require that tipped employees receive a minimum wage before higher tips. In these states, the credit will apply to all tips received. Most states do not need the minimum cash wages to be higher than the federal minimum wage. Businesses in these states must carefully track and differentiate between tips meeting minimum wage requirements and those exceeding them.\n\nInterestingly, only food and beverage businesses benefit from the FICA tip credit. Other service providers, like hair, salons do not qualify. (☆) Why not? Restaurants and bars started a lobbying push and won a partial FICA tip credit in 1993–but only for their industry. What’s known as the 45B credit has since been expanded to rebate the entire employer side of FICA taxes on tips, but only for employers involved in “providing, delivering, or serving food or beverages for consumption.”\n\nThe tax problem—and the disparity with restaurants—has been around for decades. But the issue has become more important for the salon owners due to the lingering impact of the pandemic and the fintech-enabled shift from cash to credit cards and payment apps (electronic payments make it trickier for salons or workers to under report tips).\n\nMany in the salon and spa industry would like to change that. The Professional Beauty Association has been lobbying for House and Senate bills that would extend the full 45B credit to salons and spas. Versions of the bill are currently sitting in committee despite bipartisan support.\n\nTax Filings And Deadlines\n\n📅 April 15, 2025.

The statement indicated, in part, “Americans deserve a fully functioning agency that can be respected by taxpayers and their preparers, thereby allowing them to comply with their tax obligations.”\n\nMcCarter & English announced the expansion of its Miami office with the additions of its new partner, Peter Lagonowicz, and special counsel, Janine Kucaba. Lagonowicz will oversee the firm’s International Tax and Latin America-related work, counseling clients on cross-border transactions, while Kucaba brings experience in domestic trusts and estates law.\n\nMiller & Chevalier Chartered announced that Michael Desmond has joined the firm as a Member. Desmond, who will co-lead the firm's Tax Controversy and Litigation practice, served as the 48th Chief Counsel of the IRS from 2019 to 2021.\n\nIn response to recent IRS job losses, the National Association of Tax Professionals (NATP) is offering a dedicated job resource to help affected tax professionals find new opportunities in the industry. The ‘Looking for Positions’ section on natptax.com is a free platform for job seekers to post listings and for firms to connect with experienced candidates.\n\nThe Indiana Department of Revenue determined that a video game publishing company’s sales from add-ons are not subject to sales tax. In the case, the company offered optional services, including a monthly online subscription to play the game in an online, multi-player setting; in-game items for purchase like costumes or weapons; and virtual currency you could use to acquire in-game items or pay the subscription. According to the Department of Revenue, these items are not tangible personal property nor specific digital goods and are therefore not taxable.\n\nStarting March 3, active-duty service members can enroll in health care flexible spending accounts, or FSAs. An FSA lets you set aside pre-tax money to pay for healthcare costs—withdrawals are tax-free if you use them for qualified medical expenses. FSAs have been available for years for many federal agencies and private companies, but the benefit wasn’t available to military families until this year—the enrollment period will run through March 31. A dependent care flexible spending account benefit became available to service members in 2024.\n\nIf you have tax and accounting career or industry news, submit it for consideration here or email me directly.\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nHere's what readers clicked through most often last week:\n\nHow To Survive The 2025 Tax Filing Season\n\nTrump’s Hiring Freeze And The IRS\n\nYou can find the entire newsletter here.\n\nTrivia Answer\n\nThe answer is (A) your birthdate.\n\nYour birthdate doesn't show up on your Form 1040.\n\nThere’s a lot of personal information about you that shows up on the first two pages of your tax return, but interestingly, your birth date isn’t one of them (though you do check a box if you or your spouse for the extra standard deduction for seniors–this year, it applies if you were born before January 2, 1960).\n\nYour occupation appears next to the signature line on page two, while your Social Security number appears at the top of page one.

Ms Harris, as Vice President, stumbled from one disaster to the next one. People have clearly seen her mismanagement of the border crisis and awkward public appearances. She’s further seen being unable to inspire confidence among Democrats, which reminded her fellow citizens why she eventually dropped out of the Presidential candidate in 2020. She dropped out before Iowa and, by President Biden’s admission, was only selected as his running mate due to her immutable characteristics.\n\nOn the other hand, Mrs Hochul’s rise doesn’t seem unfamiliar to Kamal Harris’s stumbled ness. Governor Andrew Cuomo selected her to be his running mate because she was very unlikely to upstage him. Eventually, the only thing that brought him down and her up was the scandal. She did win the reelection fairly, but as everyone pointed out, it was the worst-ever performance by a statewide Democratic candidate in a generation. And just like Kamala Harris, Mrs Hochul has bounced back from multiple crises. \n\nTo mention a few, she failed to handle New York’s migrant crisis, which allowed the spiral to go so out of control that the Trump Justice Department has now brought suit. Besides, her administration is weak, too, particularly against rising crimes, which is being further reinforced by her failure to stand up to Albany’s pro-criminal bail laws, which has eventually left the NYC citizens feeling unsafe.

Instead of merely running a company logo before its programming, PBS let corporate underwriters place messages that looked more like standard commercials.\n\nThat process helped sustain such programs as “Nova,” “Masterpiece” and Ken Burns' acclaimed documentaries. But it’s now under scrutiny from Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, who says the spots “cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.”\n\nIn a Jan. 30 letter to PBS and NPR, which also airs corporate sponsorship messages, Carr stated his support for ending federal funding of public broadcasting.\n\n“For my own part, I do not see a reason why Congress should continue sending taxpayer dollars to NPR and PBS,” he wrote, citing the array of media choices available to consumers.\n\nConservative politicians have long argued for cutting support of PBS and NPR, which they accuse of promoting liberal policies. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has proposed a bill calling for ending federal funding of the outlets, calling his legislation the Defund Government-Sponsored Propaganda Act.\n\nRepublican administrations have tried to cut off government funding since the days of the Nixon White House. But in the age of DOGE, where Elon Musk is given free rein by Trump to slice and dice the federal budget, Carr’s focus feels more urgent.\n\n“Carr bringing this up so early in his chairmanship shows that this is something that he’s really interested in dealing with,” said Jeff McCall, a professor of communications at DePauw University. “That’s what makes it feel different.”\n\nPBS and NPR are just the latest targets of Carr, who has been aggressive in attacking the owners of broadcast channels licensed by the government. His actions have dovetailed with Trump’s animus toward mainstream media outlets that cover him critically.\n\nSince taking over as chairman, Carr has revived bias complaints against CBS, ABC and NBC over their 2024 presidential campaign coverage after the Biden administration dismissed them. He has taken public comments in an inquiry of a news distortion complaint against CBS over the way “60 Minutes” edited an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris before the election.\n\nThe complaints against CBS, ABC and NBC were filed by the Center for American Rights, a conservative nonprofit law firm.\n\nCarr’s Jan. 30 letter raised no specific examples that showed PBS or NPR violating the rules for public broadcasters.\n\n“We’ve always envisioned a small amount of government funding matched by philanthropy and then matched by corporate support,” said PBS President Paula Kerger in an interview. “We have worked with the FCC to make sure that we’re complying in the spirit of what they believe we should be doing.”\n\nKatherine Maher, president and chief executive of “Morning Edition” and “All Things Considered” home NPR, also said in a statement that the service has adhered to the FCC guidelines on underwriting messages.\n\nAs far as the fate of federal funding for PBS is concerned, Kerger is used to playing defense when a new administration takes over the White House.\n\n“I never make the assumption that our government funding is just going to continue in the way that it has,” Kerger said. “I think it’s up to us, frankly, every year to make the case of why public media is important.”\n\nKerger noted that most of the government funding goes directly to PBS member TV stations that are locally owned and managed. The $595 million requested for the next appropriation for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes government funds to public stations, is more vital for outlets in rural areas which were more likely to have voted for Trump.\n\n“The budgets of those stations are smaller, and proportionately, the amount of government funding that goes to them is usually quite significant,” Kerger said. “Sometimes as much as 40 to 50% comes out of the federal appropriation. And so we argue for this money specifically because those stations clearly would not exist.”\n\nDuring her tenure, Kerger has paid close attention to stations in smaller towns such as Cookeville, Tennessee, that provide free over-the-air PBS programming to residents who can’t afford pay TV subscriptions or adequate broadband for streaming. The stations also provide a backup for the wireless emergency alert system used to send weather warnings and Amber alerts.\n\n“The needs of Cookeville are different than New York City,” Kerger said. “And in the case of a state like Florida, our television stations actually run a really robust network of information for people, not only as a storm is approaching, but throughout the storm.”\n\nNonprofit organizations that run public radio and TV stations are urging their donors and listeners to call on their representatives in Congress to resist cuts. Public media funding has survived thanks to bipartisan support.\n\nPBS SoCal and others are promoting Protect My Public Media Day on March 6 to rally support.\n\nStations are using the data from a recent YouGov poll commissioned by PBS that shows Trump voters are in favor of government funding for the service, with 65% of them saying the current levels are “about right or too little.”\n\nWhile public media has fended off proposed cuts in the past, McCall believes PBS and NPR need to buckle up with a determined Carr in charge.\n\n“Even when you had Republican presidents, I don’t think those (FCC) chairmen ever really had the stomach to deal with this kind of thing,” he said.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Thanks to the internet and the rise of apps like Hinge and Tinder, those looking for love no longer need to confined to the circles of their friends or the borders of their hometown.And yet, Gen Z faces the biggest romantic conundrum of all: They don't want to date each other.Amid a new Trump era and much-discussed corresponding cultural \"vibe shift,\" young men and young women are finding it harder than ever to date—the gender divide evident in November's election having seeped into the social fabric.More than half of all single women across age groups in the U.S. say they would be less likely to date some who is a Trump supporter, while nearly 4 in 10 single men say they would be less likely to date someone who identified as a feminist, according to a January poll conducted by the American Enterprise Institute.\"People now generally believe that someone's political views reflect their character, and that has a lot to do with Donald Trump,\" Daniel Cox, the director of AEI's Survey Center on American Life, told Newsweek on Thursday.\"It's not entirely attributable to him, but I think people view it as important information when they're thinking about the kind of person that they want to date.\"As one of the single women who Cox surveyed said, \"It is no longer a political difference; it is a difference in morals.\"Cox said while the sample wasn't large enough to categorize results by age, \"The majority of people who are single and have ever been married are younger,\" adding that the respondents \"skew[ed] much younger than the rest of the population.\"Gen Z women draw a line on dating Trump supportersJessica Calarco, an award-winning sociology researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Newsweek the sentiment among young women reflects the demographic breakdown of the election.Trump picked up a larger proportion of young voters than any Republican presidential candidate since 2008, but those gains were largely among men under 30. Gen Z men voted decisively for Trump by a whopping 13-point margin, while young women backed Vice President Kamala Harris by an 18-point margin.Rachel Janfaza, a researcher who regularly conducts sessions with Gen Z voters, told Newsweek that a lot of the young women she spoke with — many of whom said their top issue was abortion and access to reproductive healthcare — conveyed that a vote for Trump represented far more than an opinion on who should be in the White House.\"It oftentimes felt like a direct attack on their rights and on their bodies,\" Janfaza, who is also the founder of Up and Up Strategies, said in a Thursday interview.Young men, however, did not see if that way.\"We saw so many young men who—even though they said they're pro-choice—still voted for Trump. And while they may have been able to justify that, young women were less likely to,\" Janfaza said. \"[They] felt betrayed, in some circumstances, by the young men in their lives who they felt didn't have their best interests in mind.\"Over the last eight years, politically-mixed romantic relationships have become increasingly rare, with Americans less willing to date someone with different political views. Six in 10 Americans saw it as a romantic dealbreaker, according to a September poll from Innerbody Research.Indeed, politics has never been more personal. And for many young women, who view support for Trump as a material attack against their own freedoms, compromising on their ideological beliefs has become extremely difficult to do, Calarco said.\"It's one thing to have a partner who you disagree with on how much money we should spend on foreign policy, it's a very different thing to have a partner who disagrees with you on whether women deserve bodily autonomy, or whether women should be able to work for pay, or whether we should have universal paid family leave or universal child care,\" she added.Calarco, who is also the author of Holding It Together: How Women Became America's Safety Net, said women are becoming increasingly aware that even when liberal men express egalitarian beliefs, many of them are willing to abandon them when push comes to shove.\"Men are often willing to put those ideals aside when they actually have to make decisions about whose career to prioritize or where to move if their partners get jobs in different cities or are going to school in different cities, or if one parent has to stay home or take a step back work wise,\" she said.\"Even if men are saying, 'I support these ideas.' I think women are now more wary, particularly if men are also willing to vote for someone [like Trump],\" she added.What do the men think?Political views of romantic prospects appears less important to young men (only 36 percent said they would be less likely to date a Trump supporter), but other dating concerns persist.While young women see a young man's political beliefs as being representative of his character and his views on their fundamental rights, young men seem to understand a young women's political beliefs as being how she would treat them in a romantic setting.\"The reasons did vary, but I think for a lot of men, what it comes down to is that they didn't think a feminist would treat them well,\" said Cox, who conducted the AEI poll. \"That [feminists] harbored some resentment or negative views of men overall and that they couldn't possibly treat them well as men, even if they're in a relationship.\"Janfaza said many young men she talked to confided that they were scared to date today out of fears that women would blame them for society's ills, having been alienated by movements like #MeToo that, some argued, cast all men as predators and all women as victims. They also told her that women were less likely to go on a second date or rule them out if they knew they were Trump supporters.\"I've had men tell me things like, 'It's not my fault that there's patriarchy. I shouldn't have to be blamed for the fact that I was born a man,' Janfaza said. \"They're saying that as young men, they haven't had the chance to enable patriarchy in the same way that generations of men prior have. And yet they feel that they definitely take the blame for that in a dating situation or even a social situation.\"Trump and Vice President JD Vance have tapped directly into those anxieties.While addressing the crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) on Thursday, Vance appealed directly to young men, telling them, \"Don't allow this broken culture to send you a message that you're a bad person because you're a man, because you like to tell a joke, because you like to have a beer with your friends or because you're competitive.\"\"Our culture sends a message to young men that you should suppress every masculine urge, you should you should try to cast aside your family, you should try to suppress what makes you a young man in the first place,\" the vice president said.Calarco said Vance's remarks \"really encapsulates the kind of 'manosphere' messaging that has been targeted at young men and boys.\"\"It's the kind of messaging that paints feminists in particular, and often just liberals more generally, as the oppressors, as the ones who are attacking men,\" she said.\"The truth is yes, men's status in our society is precarious,\" she continued. \"But it's not because feminists or liberals are oppressing them. It's because billionaires and big corporations and their cronies have forced us all into this highly precarious [do-it-yourself] society model, where we're expected to take care of ourselves without a decent social safety net, without long-term financial stability and security, without health care that we need, without retirement pensions and union protections.\"A growing baby bustThe U.S., much like the rest of the world, is facing a decline in fertility rates.Between 2007 and 2022, the nationwide birth rate fell by nearly 23 percent, according to data from the Centers of Diseases and Control Prevention (CDC). In 2023, it dropped another 3 percent. These days, American women are having around 1.6 children, a number well below the \"replacement rate\" of 2.1 children that is needed for a population to replace itself from one generation to the next.If young men and women have increasingly high standards for what they're looking for in a mate, could the baby bust get bigger?Gen Z doesn't seem that concerned. Overall, a majority of unmarried Americans, 56 percent, are more worried about ending up with the wrong partner than not finding someone at all, the AEI survey found.Half of single people also expressed the same sentiment. Women were slightly more likely to do so than men, with 55 percent of single women saying they were more concerned with being in the wrong partnership than being alone and 47 percent of single men saying the same.\"There's not an imperative to get married at all costs,\" Cox said. \"Very few Americans who are single say they experience much of any social pressure to get married. There's a much greater comfort to see how things play out, to focus on other things that they often have more control over, such as their education, their career or their friendships, and so that a lot of their energies are being poured into these activities and ambitions.\"Cox has also observed that it's now young, single men who want to be parents more than young, single women.\"Young women express far more trepidation about becoming parents, and ultimately that comes down to fear about how that experience might impact impact them personally, their physical, mental and emotional health,\" he said.\"College-educated women—who have invested a lot of energy to get to college, then to graduate—they have professional goals that they want to see realized and having kids may derail that, particularly if they have a partner who's not supportive enough,\" Cox said.There's also something of an educational split. Single, college-educated women were significantly more likely to date a Trump supporter, with 73 percent agreeing with the statement, compared to 44 percent of single women without a college degree, according to Cox's survey.\"Women appear to be more comfortable with the idea of being on their own, and even potentially raising a child on their own, than men are,\" Calarco said. \"That stems from the fact that we socialize girls to think about care for others and to focus on relationships from the time that they're old enough to hold a baby doll.\"She said that by the time many girls reach adulthood, they not only have more experience than boys in cultivating deep and emotionally-supportive friendships, they also feel very competent as caregivers in a way that many young men are not expected to.\"These boys are kind of underprepared to live independently. So, it's not surprising to me that young men want a partner because they need someone to take care of them because they've never been taught, in many cases to take care of themselves,\" Calarco said.Can we just not talk about it?In the final days of the election cycle, Harris' campaign sparked outrage among conservatives after releasing a political ad narrated by the queen of the romantic comedy herself. In a 30-second clip, Julia Roberts reminded women that they could vote for Harris without telling their husbands.\"In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose,\" Roberts said, alluding to the fight over reproductive health. \"You can vote any way you want and no one will ever know.\"\"Remember what happens in the booth, stays in the booth,\" the voiceover concludes.But while the ad seemed to earn some praise for being a witty way to appeal to suburban women whose husbands wanted Trump to win the election, it doesn't seem it would have worked to sway young Americans, who are clear in their beliefs that politics should not be kept secret.Janfaza said that for a young people, political affiliation has become \"a barrier to entry for a relationship.\"\"A lot of that is due to President Trump,\" Janfaza said. \"The fact that he is such a polarizing figure. So many people love him and so many people really dislike him. When you're looking at young people, there are people with really strong views of him and that definitely comes up in a dating context.\"She believes that the \"nationalization of politics\" means that for young people who are dating, it's common for the news to be playing on the TVs of a bar or for a news alert to come though their phones. Even if you want to focus just on the other person, it isn't so easy. She also used the example of the assassination attempts on Trump, which were all over social media feeds and would likely elicit stark responses from young people no matter how they felt about him.The way that young people consume news may also be furthering this gender divide since social media algorithms are feeding young men and young women entirely different feeds and since the two groups typically listen to and watch completely different influencers and content creators.\"They're consuming different streams of information and so their perception of reality is going to look very different,\" Janfaza said.\"Women are being funneled in one direction, and men are being funneled in an entirely different one,\" Cox agreed. \"There's not a lot of shared space online. There's this sort of segregation in social media spaces. Even if they're using the same platform, they're not getting exposed to the same kind of information.\"","summary":"Young men and young women are growing further apart romantically, and fewer of them worry about being alone these days.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gen-zs-dating-conundrum-2033924","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2592289/gen-z-dating-conundrum.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 12:00:01","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":293252072,"title":"Trump’s First Month: Victory at Home, Danger Abroad","text":"Ignore the Beltway Sturm und Drang: One month into his second term, Donald Trump has advanced his coalition’s priorities of changing Washington, tackling inflation, and sealing the border. Yet these gains could vanish if Trump succumbs to the perennial second-term temptation of foreign policy overreach.\n\nFor now, Trump’s position is secure because he’s delivered. His job approval rating remains above water, 49 percent to 47 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Congress’s approval rating has spiked as Republicans confirm Trump’s cabinet and pursue his agenda. The GOP also maintains its edge in voter identification.\n\nAs I write, Trump has issued 108 executive actions. They are aligned with the electorate’s aims as revealed in last year’s exit polling. What did the electorate want? A point-by-point refutation of the Biden years. Which is what we’re getting.\n\nThe political class can’t — or won’t — grasp the extent of public dissatisfaction with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Seventy percent of voters in 2024 said the country was headed in the wrong direction, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis. Eighty-three percent of voters said they would like to see substantial change or complete and total upheaval (my italics) in how the country is run. Fifty-two percent of voters said Trump would bring positive change, whereas 48 percent of voters said Harris would do so.\n\nThe CNN exit poll asked voters which candidate qualities mattered most. The top two responses were the ability to lead and the capacity to bring needed change. Trump trounced Harris on both qualities: 66 percent to 33 percent on leadership and a staggering 74 percent to 24 percent on disruption. The message wasn’t subtle.\n\nElon Musk’s DOGE may be acting fast and breaking things, as befits its Silicon Valley parentage, but its mission is consistent with the public desire to stop Washington’s slide into stagnation and decline. And Trump’s notable executive orders on affirmative action, DEI, gender ideology, and paper straws fit into the MAGA coalition paradigm of uprooting politically correct, net-zero nostrums that Biden and Harris embedded in government.\n\nThe most important issue facing the country in 2024, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis, was the economy and jobs. Trump beat Harris on the issue by 24 points. Two-thirds of voters said the economy was not so good or poor, and they voted overwhelmingly for Trump. Seventy-five percent of voters in the CNN exit poll said inflation caused their families severe or moderate hardship in the past year. These voters also went for Trump. The fate of the Trump majority depends on stable prices.\n\nLast month’s inflation spike exposed the continuing threat. The executive branch can help reduce inflation by lowering regulatory burdens, increasing domestic energy, and cutting spending. Trump has signed presidential directives to accomplish these tasks. Meanwhile, the legislative branch can carry out a similar mission while also pursuing wage growth through tax reform.\n\nWhich is why Trump’s support for one “big, beautiful” House bill is significant. The president understands that his legacy rests on improving living standards for working- and middle-class Americans. He understands that his economic program hinges on a 218–215 House majority that could crumble before the next Congress. He understands that the House proposal isn’t mere legislation. It’s survival.\n\nThe 2024 electorate’s second-most important issue was immigration. Here, too, Trump demolished Harris. Public opinion on immigration shifted because of Biden’s open border, giving Trump leeway to build the wall, deport illegal immigrants, and fight narcos and human traffickers. The most recent data show that illegal border crossings have declined by 90 percent since Trump returned to the Oval Office. He’s been so successful in deterring illegal immigration that the media rarely bring up the subject.\n\nFor Trump to succeed, he needs to enact his domestic agenda in 2025 and hold the GOP House in 2026. (The map makes a Democratic Senate takeover unlikely next year.) The greatest danger to these objectives is a foreign policy that ends in trade wars, military conflict, and wasted political capital.\n\nSo far, Trump’s tariff threats are more abstract than real. Let’s hope they stay that way. A low-tax, low-reg, cheap-energy economy can endure mild protectionism. But beggar-thy-neighbor tariffs and a scrambled supply chain make no one wealthier. They just make government more powerful.\n\nVoters chose Trump to improve the economy and close the southern border. Acquiring Greenland — as much as this columnist loves the idea — wasn’t on the menu. Nor was making Canada the 51st state, retaking the Panama Canal, or owning the Riviera of the Middle East on the Gaza Strip. Just 22 percent of voters in a recent Quinnipiac poll support Trump’s plan for Gaza.\n\nAnd while it’s true that Trump campaigned on ending the Ukraine war, he risks losing popularity and support if an agreement with Russia makes America look weak. Eighty-one percent of voters in the Quinnipiac poll said the United States shouldn’t trust Vladimir Putin. The voters are right.\n\nSecond-term presidents often pay a price for foreign policy hubris.

It felt weird to be that late in life and adopt, let alone publicize, a new identity. My husband didn’t care one way or another, so I saved myself from the painstaking paperwork of changing my last name.\n\nWhat I didn’t realize was that I might have also saved myself from being disenfranchised.\n\nSAVE Act threatens to disenfranchise married women\n\nCongressional Republicans are fast-tracking the SAVE Act, a bill that requires Americans to provide a birth certificate, passport or some other gold-tier citizenship document every time they register to vote – all under the guise of ensuring that only U.S. citizens are voting.\n\nIf you’re thinking, “Wait, isn’t it already illegal for noncitizens to vote?” – yes, yes it is. And if you’re wondering how often this actually happens, it’s about as common as flamingos in Wisconsin. It happened once, but definitely not a trend.\n\nPer the Brennan Center for Justice, a retrospective of the 2016 election found improper noncitizen votes accounted for 0.0001% of the 23.5 million votes cast across the 42 jurisdictions they surveyed. But sure, let’s make it harder for actual citizens to vote.\n\nOpinion: Donald Trump is dismantling election safeguards while musing about a third term\n\nThis legislation is intended to make it more difficult for most eligible American citizens to register and cast a ballot. And as you’d expect, voting and civil rights activists are sounding alarms.\n\nBut who does this bill hurt the most?\n\nThe 8 in 10 married women who changed their surname after marriage. Because the bill fixates on birth certificates matching voter registrations but doesn’t consider marriage certificates as proof of identity.\n\nAccording to the Center for American Progress, this could exclude upwards of 69 million married American women whose legal name does not match that of her birth certificate.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nFor the millions of married women who don’t have a passport, they would need to hunt down their birth certificate, marriage license and ID, then show up in person just to update their voter registration. I don’t even know where my birth certificate is. Do you?\n\nAnd guess which states have the fewest passports and the most married name-changers? Deep red states. So yes, this could disproportionately disenfranchise Republican women. But I don’t want any woman disenfranchised, because women’s suffrage is a slippery slope.\n\nConservatives who believe women shouldn't have the right to vote\n\nYes, the slope of a woman's right to vote.\n\nThe bill's author, Rep. Chip Roy R-Texas, might have made a statement characterizing these concerns as \"absurd armchair speculation,\" but the lack of nuance in this bill feels like a nod to the folks who would like to see the 19th Amendment repealed. This isn’t just some conspiracy theory. Plenty of conservatives have openly said that they don’t think women should vote:\n\nPastor Joel Webbon claims that the 19th Amendment stole half his vote but graciously allows his wife to vote so he can get it back.Trump’s former aide John McEntee joked, “When we said we wanted mail-only voting. We meant male m-a-l-e.”Conservative commentator Ann Coulter has repeatedly said that women shouldn’t vote.Anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson wants “household voting.”MAGA social media lost its mind over a pro-Kamala Harris ad where two women dared to vote without their husbands' approval.\n\nRemember when people told us we were crazy for saying Roe v. Wade could be overturned? That it would never happen? That we were being hysterical?\n\nNow we have a bill that – whether by incompetence or design – could make voting much harder for millions of women. But sure, let’s pretend the rollbacks stop here. It’s not like an entire political faction in our body politic is openly nostalgic for the days before women could vote.\n\nOpinion: Musk is the little devil on Trump's shoulder daring him to break the law\n\nEvery time I hear someone say, “Oh, that could never happen here,” I think about that photo – the one of Afghan women in the ‘70s wearing miniskirts and studying medicine. Before religious fundamentalists took over and erased their rights.\n\nLosing rights doesn’t happen in one big, dramatic moment. It happens in a slow drip of bad policies, restrictive laws and people not taking the threat seriously until it’s too late.\n\nIf you don’t know where your birth certificate is, you might want to find it. Because apparently, that – not your decades of tax returns, Social Security number or literal existence as a person – is what the SAVE Act says proves you're an American.\n\nAnd if this passes, I hope you really love your last name.

Now, one month into Mr. Trump’s second term, his war on the press seems to be entering a new phase, with the president and his allies taking more aggressive actions – and notching clear wins.\n\nMr. Trump has sued several media outlets in the past year, winning a settlement against ABC News that shocked many industry observers. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has been gleefully canceling government subscriptions to news publications. The new chair of the Federal Communications Commission has opened an investigation into whether taxpayer dollars should continue to go to NPR and PBS, and the Pentagon has booted legacy media outlets from their permanent workspaces in the building to make room for more Trump-friendly outlets.\n\nPerhaps most controversially, the White House has gotten into a tense standoff in recent weeks with The Associated Press over Mr. Trump’s executive order renaming the “Gulf of Mexico” the “Gulf of America.” After the AP announced it would continue using the “Gulf of Mexico,” while acknowledging that President Trump has renamed it the “Gulf of America,” the administration barred AP reporters from attending Oval Office and some other events and flying on Air Force One. The Monitor, which follows the AP Stylebook with some exceptions, will be using similar language.\n\nBoth the AP and the White House Correspondents’ Association say the Trump administration’s actions are a violation of the First Amendment, and the AP filed a lawsuit on those grounds Friday against three administration officials. The administration has countered that there is a big difference between giving an outlet access to limited spaces and preventing it from publishing the news as it sees fit. So far, most of the leverage seems to be on the president’s side, against a press corps that’s weaker than it has been in decades, with fragmented audiences and shrinking subscriptions. And whether or not the administration is overstepping its authority in this case, observers see larger reasons to be concerned about the freedom of the press, a critical component of a healthy democracy.\n\n“In the past, traditions and norms would have made [the AP ban] very politically divisive for any president to do. But Donald Trump has been a master of weakening institutions, and certainly among them is the press,” says Jason Shepard, a communications law professor at California State University, Fullerton. “There are so many fewer resources available for news organizations and journalists to fight back.”\n\nA battle over a name – and over press freedom\n\nMany other newsrooms are also still using the “Gulf of Mexico” in their reporting. But the AP has been the focus of the president’s ire, in part because of its widely adopted stylebook, which has been the authoritative guide on grammar and terminology for scores of newsrooms since the 1950s.\n\nTrump allies, among others, have complained that the AP Stylebook has employed increasingly ideological phrasing in recent years – such as using the term “gender-affirming care” when describing medical treatments for transgender people, and capitalizing “Black” but not “white.” The Gulf drama isn’t just about the Gulf, White House officials told Axios this week; it’s another example of the AP using language “to push a partisan worldview.”\n\nIt’s fine for the administration to offer that kind of criticism, experts say. But when officials take actions to pressure an outlet to produce a certain type of coverage, it becomes more problematic.\n\n“The AP gets to decide its own style,” says Kevin Goldberg of the Freedom Forum, a nonprofit that advocates for the First Amendment. “If [the White House] doesn’t like the AP style, they are free to say that. ... But they can’t compel the AP to say particular words. That’s First Amendment 101.”\n\nThe dispute is further complicated in this case because it involves the press pool – a group of 13 reporters across print, TV, radio, and photography that was created to serve as “the eyes and ears” of the entire press corps. The pool (which the Monitor is part of) follows the president at home and abroad, sharing notes, photos, and video feeds, as well as travel costs. While the designated print pooler rotates among several dozen outlets, reporters from three wire services – the AP, Reuters, and Bloomberg – are typically always included.\n\nFor now, many constitutional law experts say the administration isn’t violating the First Amendment, though it may be edging closer to that line.\n\n“As much as I oppose the [AP] exclusion personally, I am skeptical that it is unconstitutional,” says Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “This is something we say as law professors all the time: ‘The fact that something is a bad idea doesn’t mean it’s unconstitutional.’”\n\nIf the Trump administration goes beyond barring AP journalists from “invitation-type events” and starts revoking their White House credentials or barring them from big public events, that’s where the First Amendment conversation “really gets elevated,” says Mr. Goldberg.\n\nWhen the first Trump administration revoked a CNN journalist’s credentials in 2018 after a contentious press conference exchange, a Trump-appointed judge sided with the cable news organization. But that judge made clear he was ruling on Fifth Amendment grounds – saying the administration had not provided the journalist, Jim Acosta, with due process – and was not making a judgment about First Amendment claims.\n\nA tough time for the news industry\n\nMr. Trump is not the first president to attack or take action against the press. President Abraham Lincoln shut down anti-war newspapers, and he ordered the arrest of some editors over false reports published during the Civil War. President Theodore Roosevelt habitually banished journalists who upset him. Various administrations in recent years have threatened to move the press briefing room out of the West Wing.\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s media attacks may serve as a “double whammy,” says historian Harold Holzer, author of “The Presidents vs. the Press,” coming at a time of particular weakness for the press. The AP likely has “a lot fewer subscribers” than it did 20 years ago, says Mr. Holzer.\n\nSome of those subscriptions have shrunk just in the past few weeks. After discovering that the federal government was paying millions of dollars for its employees to subscribe to publications like Politico Pro and The New York Times, Mr. Trump’s self-created Department of Government Efficiency announced it would cancel them all – a significant loss of revenue for some news organizations. Politico, for example, whose granular legislative tracking service Politico Pro is relied upon by many governmental employees, took in $8 million in 2024 from federal subscriptions. The State Department recently asked U.S. embassies and consulates to cancel all “non-mission critical” media subscriptions.\n\nMr. Trump may have been emboldened to take stronger action against the press in his first month in office in part because of recent wins in the courtroom. In December, ABC News opted to settle Mr. Trump’s defamation lawsuit over George Stephanopoulos’ on-air statement that the president had been found liable for rape in the E. Jean Carroll case. The jury had found Mr. Trump liable for sexual abuse, not rape. The president is engaged in another suit against CBS News over an interview it aired with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which Mr. Trump contends was deceptively edited. There has been speculation that Paramount, CBS’ parent company, may be moving toward a settlement as well. Mr. Trump is also suing the Des Moines Register and its recently departed pollster, Ann Selzer, over a preelection survey that showed Ms. Harris with a lead in Iowa (Mr. Trump won the state by 14 points).\n\nThe president’s true victory in the ABC case may not have been the $15 million “charitable contribution” made toward his future presidential library, but the fact that “it shows the media is scared,” says David Enrich, a New York Times reporter. Mr. Enrich is the author of a forthcoming book about the 1964 Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan, which established the principle that public officials must prove “actual malice” by news organizations in order to win defamation lawsuits.\n\nOverturning that case has become “one of the leading goals of the conservative legal movement” as well as a key goal of Mr. Trump’s, says Mr. Enrich. Without that court precedent, media organizations would face a far greater threat of lawsuits. And while that could in theory lead to more careful, nonpartisan coverage, it could also have a widespread chilling effect if legal action is used to intimidate media organizations and drain their already limited resources.\n\n“Threatening news organizations with lawsuits is a good way to consume their time and money and remind them of the leverage that the federal government has over them,” says Mr. Enrich.","summary":"A White House rebuff to The Associated Press – over the name “Gulf of America” – comes on top of Trump lawsuits against major TV news networks.

Hegseth’s blunt remarks reinforced what had already been evident for years—Washington’s strategic priorities were shifting, and Europe could no longer rely on the U.S. to guarantee its security as it had during the Cold War and its aftermath. This shift, however, is not an abrupt departure but rather the culmination of a long-term recalibration of U.S. foreign policy that has been years in the making.\n\nThe realignment of U.S. strategic interests has been influenced by the rise of new threats, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Over the past two decades, China has emerged as a dominant global power, rapidly expanding its economic influence and military capabilities. Beijing’s assertiveness in the South China Sea, its modernization of the People’s Liberation Army, and its growing technological advancements have compelled the United States to refocus its military and diplomatic resources on countering China’s rise. This shift was first formally articulated during the Obama administration’s “Pivot to Asia” policy, which sought to strengthen U.S. alliances in the Indo-Pacific while reducing the overreliance on American military commitments in Europe. The Trump administration further accelerated this trend by questioning NATO’s value and advocating for a redistribution of responsibilities among allies. The Biden administration, despite its commitment to transatlantic ties, continued pressing European nations to increase their defence spending. Now, with Trump’s return to office in 2025, the de-prioritization of Europe appears to be taking full effect.\n\nEurope’s military capacity has long been a point of contention. While the European Union collectively possesses substantial economic resources, its ability to independently secure the continent remains questionable. Despite NATO’s continued presence, European nations have underinvested in their own defence for decades, relying instead on American military power. Even though European NATO allies and EU member states outspend Russia by a factor of four on defence, the continent remains highly dependent on the United States for logistics, intelligence, and nuclear deterrence.\n\nThe European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), established in the late 1990s, aimed to provide the EU with autonomous military capabilities, but its effectiveness has been limited. Europe lacks a unified command structure, and individual nations often have conflicting strategic priorities. France and the United Kingdom, the two most militarily capable European nations, have led calls for a stronger continental defence posture, but progress has been slow. The reluctance of many European countries to meet NATO’s defence spending target of 2% of GDP has only reinforced Washington’s perception that Europe is not taking its security responsibilities seriously.\n\nIn light of these realities, Hegseth’s remarks in Brussels did not emerge in a vacuum. The belief that Europe is “freeloading” on American security commitments has been a persistent theme in the U.S. foreign policy discourse. The post-Cold War era saw NATO shifting from a collective defence organization to a collective security entity, engaging in conflicts outside Europe, such as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Libya. However, as America’s strategic focus turned toward the Indo-Pacific, maintaining extensive military commitments in Europe became increasingly difficult to justify. With China’s rise demanding greater attention and resources, the U.S. military presence in Europe has gradually diminished. The closure of American military bases across the continent and the withdrawal of troops underscored this shift, signalling that Europe must now take primary responsibility for its own security.\n\nDomestic political and economic considerations within the United States have also played a significant role in this transformation. American public opinion has grown increasingly sceptical of the country’s role as the world’s security guarantor. The prolonged military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with mounting national debt, have led to a reassessment of foreign policy priorities. Successive administrations have faced growing pressure to prioritize domestic concerns over international commitments. Budgetary constraints have further driven the push to redistribute the burden of security among allies. With U.S. voters demanding a focus on economic stability, infrastructure, and social programs at home, policymakers have found it politically expedient to reduce defence expenditures abroad, particularly in regions where allies are perceived as capable of sharing the burden.\n\nThe Trump administration was instrumental in accelerating this shift. Trump’s “America First” doctrine questioned the foundational assumptions of U.S. alliances, arguing that NATO was an outdated and costly arrangement that unfairly benefited European nations. His administration repeatedly pressured NATO members to increase their contributions, warning that the United States could reconsider its commitments if European allies failed to meet their obligations. Trump’s rhetoric often strained relations with European leaders, who were deeply concerned about the potential unravelling of the transatlantic alliance. In the 2024 U.S. presidential election, many European Union leaders openly supported Kamala Harris, hoping to prevent Trump’s return to power. However, with his re-election in 2024, Trump is now poised to take a more confrontational approach toward the EU, reinforcing his stance that Europe must assume greater responsibility for its security.\n\nAs the United States pivots away from Europe, the implications for transatlantic security are profound. European nations now face an urgent need to reassess their defence strategies and invest in autonomous security structures. The concept of European strategic autonomy, long championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, is gaining renewed momentum. Efforts to enhance Europe’s defence capabilities are underway, with discussions about a more integrated EU defence framework gaining traction. Recent reports indicate that Britain and France have been engaging in clandestine talks about deploying troops to Ukraine for post-war security, highlighting a growing recognition of Europe’s need to act independently of U.S. support.\n\nDespite these developments, significant challenges remain. Europe’s fragmented defence landscape, political divisions, and the continued reliance on NATO’s infrastructure make the prospect of full strategic autonomy difficult to achieve in the short term. Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding U.S. policy shifts with each administration complicates long-term planning for European security. While some nations, such as Poland and the Baltic states, advocate for stronger NATO commitments, others, like France and Germany, push for a more independent European defence identity. This divergence in strategic outlooks could hinder the continent’s ability to develop a cohesive security framework.\n\nThe slow but steady recalibration of U.S. foreign policy underscores a fundamental reality: the era of unquestioned American commitment to European security is over. While NATO is unlikely to dissolve overnight, its role will inevitably evolve as Europe assumes greater responsibility for its defence. The United States, now preoccupied with countering China and addressing domestic challenges, has made it clear that it expects its allies to step up. The transatlantic alliance must adapt to these new realities, forging a partnership based on shared responsibilities and mutual interests. As Europe navigates this transition, its ability to rise to the challenge will shape the future of global security in the years to come.

More than two-thirds of voters believed the economy, battered by inflation, was in “not good” or “poor” shape. Among voters who said their top issue was the economy, Trump won by a massive 81% to 18% margin. \n\nThere was a fear among Democrats that Trump, a billionaire businessman who presided over an economy most voters liked until the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020, could quickly turn around this negative economic sentiment. Former President Joe Biden repeatedly struggled to convince voters that high employment and robust job creation meant the economy was good even if prices remained high. They worried that Trump, a more natural salesman than the 82-year-old, would be able to persuade voters that they were actually living in the golden age that Trump had repeatedly promised.\n\nA month into his presidency, however, the economy is not a clear strength for Trump. Five polls released over the past two days ― from CNN, Quinnipiac, the Washington Post, Reuters and Gallup ― show signs of simmering discontent. All five surveys indicate that Trump is underwater in his handling of the economy, which is the core of his political strength.\n\nAt the root of the problem is a belief that Trump is doing little to lower prices, which many Americans believe are simply too high. In CNN’s survey, 62% of Americans say Trump has not done enough to lower prices. In a Reuters poll, just 32% approved of Trump’s handling of inflation. In the Post’s poll, only 7% of Americans said grocery prices were “excellent” or “good,” while an incredible 92% said they were “not so good” or “poor.”\n\nTrump and his administration’s allies have tried to lower expectations about when prices will go down after repeatedly promising nearly instant relief on the campaign trail. Democrats, however, are eager to flip the script.\n\nTrump’s long-time love of tariffs adds to his problems. In the Post’s poll, roughly three-fifths of voters oppose his proposals to add 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, though a slim majority supports his move to add 10% tariffs on imports from China. However, 69% of voters think the tariffs would raise prices in the United States. \n\nTrump is far from doomed. His public standing on his signature issue, stopping illegal immigration, is in a better position. His overall approval rating is in the mid-40s, far above the political dead zone, even if it is lower than any of his predecessors at this point. However, discontent with Trump’s economy should be a major warning sign for Republicans.\n\nThe raft of polls held some other early clues about how voters interpret the first weeks of Trump’s second presidency. \n\nElon Musk Is Wearing Out His Welcome\n\nIn theory, Elon Musk’s status as a special government employee means he has to leave government service on May 30. Whether the world’s richest man leaves Trump’s side or sees his influence fade is up in the air, but it’s pretty clear the American public is ready to say goodbye.\n\nIn Quinnipiac’s survey, 54% of voters disapprove of Musk’s role in the Trump administration. The Post’s survey shows that 63% of voters are concerned about Musk’s access to federal government databases “that have Americans’ personal Social Security, Medicare and tax information.” Only 28% of Americans thought that Trump giving Musk a prominent role in his administration was a good thing in CNN’s poll, while 54% thought it was a bad thing.\n\nMusk has led his “Department of Government Efficiency” to implement massive layoffs ― potentially of hundreds of thousands of federal employees ― and attempt to shut down whole government agencies with little respect for the law or people’s livelihoods.\n\nTrump’s Authoritarian Ambitions Have Minimal Support\n\nThe Trump administration has shown a relentless desire to increase the power of the presidency, taking over everything from the Kennedy Center to the US Postal Service. At their boldest, they are openly embracing anti-American and authoritarian ideals, suggesting they will ignore courts and treat the president’s word as law.\n\nTo put it lightly, this push is unpopular with the public: 57% of voters in the Post survey said Trump had gone beyond his authority as president, with just 40% saying he has acted within his authority.\n\nAnd, matching other surveys, a massive majority of American voters think Trump should follow court orders: 84% say Trump should follow a court order if they rule he did something illegal, while just 11% say he should defy the courts.\n\nDemocrats Have A Base Problem\n\nCongressional Democrats’ approval in Quinnipiac’s survey was dismal: Just 21% of voters approve, while 68% disapprove. What’s driving that? Democrats are very down on their own party, with 49% of Democrats saying they disapprove of the performance of their party leaders. \n\nSimilarly, CNN’s poll found a whopping 73% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents thought Democrats in Congress weren’t doing enough to oppose Trump. \n\nIt’s far from clear how this anger from their own base will impact Democrats’ strategy in the coming months, including over a potential government shutdown in March. It’s even less clear how it could impact congressional primaries next year.\n\nA Trump Pollster Warns Congressional Republicans\n\nSeparate from the media polls released in the past few days, a key member of Trump’s team provided some not-so-subtle advice to congressional Republicans.\n\nBuilding America’s Future, a Republican Party nonprofit group funded at least in part by Musk, released a poll conducted by Tony Fabrizio, Trump’s longtime pollster. The main takeaway? Republicans should really, really extend health care subsidies set to expire later this year. \n\nThe survey, conducted in 18 swing congressional districts, found that the most popular thing Republicans could do as part of their big reconciliation package this year wasn’t extending the Trump tax cuts from 2017 but continuing a tax credit for health care premiums Democrats passed during Biden’s presidency. It also found that reducing the corporate tax rate, a stated priority for Trump and other Republicans, was notably unpopular.\n\nIf Republicans take the survey to heart, it could spare them withering Democratic attacks both in the near term and ahead of the 2026 midterms. But it’s also likely to divide the party, with hardline fiscal conservatives ― many of whom already believe the party isn’t doing enough to cut spending ― almost certainly to oppose any attempt to extend the subsidies.","summary":"Trump’s handling of the economy has long been a political strength for the president.

For Republicans, it represented further evidence of a dynamic, active president at play.\n\nDemocrats could take consolation from the thought that if he was on the golf course, then at least he couldn’t be signing executive orders. But then, who would have been truly surprised to find some semblance of the Resolute Desk sitting on the 18th green, a stack of black-booked orders waiting for the presidential signature and trademark flourish?\n\nOn Air Force One on Wednesday, the president stood in the door way to conduct a chat with the travelling White House press corps. He seemed in agreeable mood. “We’re gonna go into Fort Knox, did you know that?” he told them. In reply, he was asked if there was a plan to eliminate further national security positions. “We’ll see what happens,” he said before reverting to his preferred theme. “We’re gonna go to Fort Knox - the fabled Fort Knox - and make sure the gold is there.”\n\nThen came a question, from an unseen reporter, that hauntingly caught the mood of the opening month of the 47th administration: utter mystification and bafflement.\n\n“Where would the gold have gone?”\n\n“If the gold isn’t there, we’re gonna be very upset,” Trump said and let that hang, at 30,000ft, for the code-crackers to decipher.\n\nThe exchange felt like a perfect example of the sense of uncertainty as to where the United States is headed. Through its alarm, the commentariat must couch its warnings in ifs and buts. The first month has been such a firestorm of activity and change and increasingly alarmed global headlines - the most recent caused by the president’s public dressing-down of Volodymyr Zelenskiy - that there has scarcely been any time for considered response.\n\nFor many among the slender majority of US voters who voted for Trump, the spectacular and expertly choreographed programme of sweeping, provocative change – the bureaucracy ransacked; the DEI culture obliterated; the mass lay-offs of federal workers; the threatened acquisition of Greenland and the casual insults and tariff threats towards Canada - are signs that the new golden age of American prosperity and strength is upon them.\n\nBut for the 49 per cent who believe Trump to be a ruinous chapter in the grand history of the White House, the abiding feelings range from disbelief to fear to resignation to a worry that American democracy is reaching an end point.\n\nWhat both sides share is a lack of certainty as to where all of this is going to leave the US. An odd moment happened during the Air Force One exchange. The big jet went through a spot of turbulence. The president grimaced and grabbed hold of the doorway. “That was a nasty bump,” he said, ever alert to his image in front of the camera. But it was a glimpse of ordinary human vulnerability; a flicker of a reminder Trump will turn 79 this summer.\n\nHe has never been more powerful. But his time is finite.\n\nEven those Democrats who made peace with November’s result and decided to lean into the potential for positive change brought about by the abrasive New Yorker could not reconcile their stance with the facts of the first month, from Elon Musk’s unlimited access to the federal houses to the unprovoked threats and verbal assaults on Greenland, on Canada and most recently on the people of Ukraine, to the teasing declaration − in one of Trump’s social media posts − of “LONG LIVE THE KING!”.\n\nBut the party lacks a leading voice and its followers are entitled to ask where are all the famous faces and names - Kamala Harris and Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey - who delivered that short-lived moment of “joy” to the Democrats in Chicago last August? Where are they now in the party’s hour of need?\n\nAnd the engines of the Trump administration are only beginning to rev up. RFK jnr is just starting to announce his plans to overhaul the department of health. On Thursday, Kash Patel was confirmed as head of the FBI. He has already vowed to scatter its operations across the country, closing J Edgar Hoover building so it can be reopened as “a museum of the deep state”.\n\n“What’s the mood like?” people ask. In many ways, the same as ever. Life goes on. The talkshows, the ball games, work, family, laughter ... the American public has to get on with the day-to-day business of living. Europe’s cold reckoning does not register as strongly here. Chamberlain’s old refrain - “a quarrel in a faraway country” – still holds true for many. It’s early days but there is just a low-fi sense that the US is about to enter a new, entirely unfamiliar chapter.\n\nMarch 4th is slated as the date for Trump’s state of the union address. The invitation was extended on January 31st by the House of Representatives speaker, Mike Johnson.\n\nThe weight of the union might be a more apt title.","summary":"Some Americans see a golden age dawning under Donald Trump, others fear their democracy is dying","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2025/02/22/trump-has-flown-the-us-into-turbulence-and-americans-arent-sure-where-theyre-going-to-land/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/24ON2763M433YGCGN4XYRE6VKI.jpg?auth=98e356c65b4eeaa45f7a2148c17457b51b761dcac732b31f8d4b649a18a5d8e1&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 05:00:00","author":"Keith Duggan","authors":["Keith Duggan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":293112510,"title":"\"Can't Take Our Country\": Trudeau Jabs Trump As Canada Beats US In Hockey","text":"Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken a dig at US President Donald Trump after Canada defeated arch-rival United States in the Four Nations Face-Off final on Thursday.\"You can't take our country -- and you can't take our game,\" Trudeau posted on X shortly after Canada won 3-2 in the ice hockey match in Boston.You can't take our country — and you can't take our game.— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 21, 2025His post came hours after Trump repeated his desire for Canada to become the US's \"51st state\" and urged the US hockey team to prevail in the match.\"I'll be calling our GREAT American Hockey Team this morning to spur them on towards victory tonight against Canada, which with FAR LOWER TAXES AND MUCH STRONGER SECURITY, will someday, maybe soon, become our cherished, and very important, Fifty First State,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\"I will be speaking before the Governors tonight in D.C., and will sadly, therefore, be unable to attend.

That is not going to happen. It will be defeated by millions of Americans in Nebraska, in Iowa, in Vermont,’ Sanders said.\n\nHe said they need to come together at the grassroots level ‘in a movement which says no to oligarchy, no to authoritarianism, no to kleptocracy, no to massive cuts in programs that the working class desperately needs.’\n\nSanders spoke before a packed room in downtown Omaha with more fans waiting in the overflow outside.\n\nHis base is fired up about the whirlwind first month of President Trump’s second term and activities of Musk, as the world’s wealthiest man and his DOGE team slash the U.S. government.\n\nSanders supporters were outraged by what is happening in Washington and had no problems voicing their frustrations. They screamed their support at times and even teared up at other moments as they nodded along to his remarks.\n\nWhile Trump was a target of much of the wrath receiving boos and one person even yelling ‘fascist,’ there were also were shouts of ‘fire Elon,’ ‘Tesla sucks’ and ‘Elon’s a Nazi.’\n\n‘This country today under Trump faces a series of crises unprecedented in our modern history, and what we do now will impact not only our lives, but the lives of our kids, grandchildren, future generations and whether the planet itself survives,’ Sanders said.\n\nThe senator will hold a second event in Iowa City, Iowa on Saturday as he hits the road to discuss how Americans can fight back against Trump and Musk. \n\nHe vowed to take his message to every corner of the country.\n\n‘We are rapidly moving toward an oligarchy form of society in which a handful of multi-billionaires not only have extraordinary, extraordinary wealth but unprecedented economic, media and political power,’ Sanders said as the crowd booed.\n\nThe senator spoke of Trump’s inauguration and how the three wealthiest people in the country, Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, were sitting right behind the president as he was sworn in. He also noted Trump’s billionaire Cabinet nominees in the third row.\n\nSanders has long raged against billionaires, but with his latest tour, he now has an image to point to of the richest men sitting behind the president in Washington as the senator talks about the struggles of the working class.\n\n‘Democracy is not about billionaires buying elections. It’s about one person, one vote,’ Sanders said, referencing that Musk spent $270 million to help get Trump elected.\n\n‘When we are taking on Trumpism, we are taking on oligarchy,’ he declared.\n\nThe progressive senator invoked moments throughout history where people have risen up to enact change from the American Revolution, the fight for Universal suffrage to the Civil Rights Movement and ending segregation and more.\n\n‘We can defeat them. I know how much money they have. I know their ownership of the people. I know they can buy and sell politicians. I know all of that,’ Sanders said.\n\n‘But this I also know, that when we stand together and not let them divide us up… we can defeat them, and we must defeat them,’ he declared.\n\nThe senator urged people to call their lawmakers and directed people to his website to get their numbers. \n\nSanders claimed that lawmakers are influenced by their donors but said people need to force them to pay attention to their constituents who won’t send them back to Washington unless they do. \n\nHe specifically name dropped GOP Congressman Don Bacon who represents Omaha.\n\nThe Vermont senator and former presidential candidate is targeting working class districts won by President Biden in 2020 and Republican House members in 2024 with the tour.\n\nNebraska’s Second Congressional District, which includes Omaha and its suburbs, voted for Biden by nearly six points in 2020. Kamala Harris also won the district in 2024 but by a narrower margin.\n\nHowever, it has been represented by Bacon since 2017, who recently won reelection in 2024 by less than two points.\n\nThe race for the seat is considered one of the biggest toss-ups in next year’s midterms and could help decide the fate of the House as Republicans currently cling to a razor-thin majority in Congress.\n\nAt one point, Sanders quoted President Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. As he quoted about a government for the people, by the people, his supporters also chimed in to recite the famous lines.\n\nThe Vermont senator blasted Trump’s recent social media post where he wrote he who saves his country does not violate any law.\n\nSanders argued that the president believes ‘he can do anything he wants to do. The law does not apply to him.’\n\n‘That is how he has been behaving, in violation of the Constitution and federal laws,’ he said as his supporters groaned.\n\nHe also slammed the president for attacking the First Amendment for his criticism of the media and blasted Trump’s recently calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a ‘dictator.’\n\n‘Everybody in the world knows that Putin started the war except Donald Trump,’ Sanders said. \n\nSanders has had a huge grassroots following ever since he ran for president in 2016. The crowd remained engaged throughout the speech as some people sported Sanders gear from his first presidential bid. \n\nOthers held up blue dots as Omaha is a known blue dot in an otherwise red state. \n\nAt one point someone accidentally hit a light switch, momentarily plunging the room into darkness, but Sanders laughed it off and kept going.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBernie Sanders may have found his perfect supervillain in billionaire Elon Musk&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Bernie Sanders starts &#8216;battling against the wealthy&#8217; journey by condemning Elon Musk and Trump with a serious message. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/bernie-sanders-starts-battling-against-the-wealthy-journey-by-condemning-elon-musk-and-trump-with-a-serious-message/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/22/02/95467427-0-image-m-10_1740192782521.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 03:34:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":293103084,"title":"Who could secure NAACP Image Awards' most coveted wins?","text":"Who could secure NAACP Image Awards' most coveted wins?\n Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé and Doechii are among several artists who have already won big in the NAACP Image Awards ahead of the main event airing this Saturday on Paramount+ and BET.

Germany’s snap election is set for February 23, under the shadow of a surging far-right – its march less a creep than a charge.\n\nThe Alternative für Deutschland is no longer a spectre on the margins. It is here – shaping the conversation, forcing hands, shifting lines once thought uncrossable.\n\nIn the university cafeteria, I met Frederik, 23, a philosophy student at Leipzig University. I asked him about the debate. “I think Scholz did well,” he said, “but his party is moving too close to far-right rhetoric on migration. Scholz is proud of the deportations his government has carried out. That is the kind of statement we expect from the CDU or AfD, with their talk of ‘remigration’. He’s helped make migration the issue of this election – even though, in reality, it isn’t.”\n\nDuring the debate, Merz had seized Scholz’s record on migration and torn it apart with the blunt force of certainty.\n\nFrederik’s friend Jessi, a law student, nodded. “Apparently, they talked about climate for one minute,” she said. “And that’s considered a long time.”\n\nPriorities have shifted, not by accident but by design. Over his three-year term, Scholz has steadily hardened his stance on migration. He does not hesitate to remind the nation of his government’s success in deportations.\n\n“The Chancellor is proud,” Frederik repeated, bitterness in his voice. “Proud of deportations.”\n\nSome of Scholz’s policies have tested the limits of the Schengen Agreement and challenged the European Union’s very foundation of free movement. His pivot came after the far right’s decisive gains in regional elections: 33% in Thuringia, 31% in Saxony. These are fault lines. This is how the far-right governs even without governing.\n\nFirewall that was never built\n\nFor a long time, Germany had something the rest of Europe seemed to lack: die Brandmauer – a firewall against the far right. Not a law, not a constitutional clause, just a clear consensus among major parties that the far right AfD was beyond the pale. No cooperation. No validation. No seat at the table for extremism.\n\nThat the lessons of German’s Nazi past still meant something. That understanding is now a relic. The wall has cracked.\n\nFriedrich Merz, a right winger businessman who has spent his political career circling the chancellorship like a wolf outside a warm house, made the first crack. He put forward a proposal for stricter migration policies – so strict they bordered on violating the European Union law. In an act of casual betrayal, he sought AfD’s support to push them through the the German parliament, the Bundestag.\n\n“Yes, it may be that the AfD will for the first time make it possible for a necessary law to be passed,” Merz reasoned, “But ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with the choice of continuing to watch helplessly as people in our country are threatened, injured and murdered or to stand up and do what is indisputably necessary in this matter.”\n\nIt was a justification – a sentence fit for history books, a neat little turn of phrase, something you could put on a plaque.\n\nOne that might appear decades later, footnoted in a chapter titled: How It Began. Again.\n\nBut AfD did not need a plaque. They needed an opening. And their candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, did not miss her cue.\n\n“Die Brandmauer ist gefallen!” she tweeted on X. The firewall has fallen.\n\nA visitor, a speech, a pattern\n\nThen, in an act of coincidence, or perfect timing, Elon Musk arrived. A billionaire born in apartheid-era South Africa, with no stake in German history but plenty in its future.\n\nOn January 25, he appeared on a mammoth screen before an AfD audience of 4,500 gathered in Halle, a city 30 km from Leipzig, once part of the former German Democratic Republic.\n\n“It’s good to be proud to be a German,” he said. “And not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything.”\n\nMulticulturalism. That was the enemy.\n\nHe went on: “There is too much focus on past guilt. We need to move beyond that.”\n\nThe crowd cheered. The line had landed exactly as it was meant to.\n\nTwo days later, European leaders gathered at Auschwitz to mark 80 years since the liberation of the Nazi death camp. They stood in front of cameras. They spoke of remembrance and vigilance, of ensuring the past would not repeat itself. There was silence. There were bowed heads. A reverence that was appropriate.\n\nBack in Germany, however, the irony of it all was not lost on those paying attention.\n\nA reminder, an omen and a choice\n\nGermany, so far Europe’s last stronghold against far-right institutional power, is slipping.\n\nFrance, under President Macron, had already moved right, hoping to siphon off votes from Marine Le Pen’s National Rally. After losing to the far right in the European Union elections of June 2024, Macron called snap elections, believing he could outmanoeuvre her.\n\nIt did not work – she surged in the polls anyway.\n\nIn Austria, the Freedom Party, founded by former Nazis in 1950s, is poised to take power, set to install its own chancellor for the first time since World War II. The political establishment’s promise to keep the far-right at bay did not hold. It never does.\n\nIn the United States, Kamala Harris, anxious about being seen as weak on the border, decided to sound tough on immigration. She repeatedly boasted about being a proud gun owner, failing to recognise that this strategy has never actually stopped the right from gaining ground.\n\nIt’s the same pattern, over and over.\n\nA centrist government thinks it can outmanoeuvre the far-right by borrowing its rhetoric. It talks about tough but fair policies, about protecting borders, about security. It does this to reassure voters who might otherwise drift further right. It assumes that by making small concessions, it can hold the centre.\n\nThis has never worked.\n\nWhat happens instead is that the far-right gains legitimacy. Their language, once unspeakable, becomes acceptable. Then it becomes mainstream. Then it becomes law.\n\nScholz, standing across from Merz in that debate, had a choice. He could have made the case for something else – for solidarity, for rejecting this entire framework. Instead, he talked about deportations.\n\nEvery election cycle in Europe, the warnings come: for the first time since World War II...But the phrase is losing its weight. The cycle is repeating, and the distance between then and now is shrinking.\n\nThe price of ceding ground\n\nIn another time, in another version of this moment, people might have seen the pattern more clearly. They might have looked at the archives, at the footage from the 1930s, at the way a country does not wake up one morning and decide to go numb – it happens in increments, in policy shifts, in small changes that seem unimportant until suddenly they are irreversible.\n\nBut it is 2025, and the numbers in the East German states – Saxony and Thuringia suggest that the voters are already doing that math for themselves.\n\nSo, people do what they always do: they argue over the technicalities. They discuss polling numbers, coalition-building and the strategies for the next election cycle. They talk about “stopping the AfD” in the same breath as adopting its policies. They repeat, again and again, that the firewall still holds. Because it is easier to say that than to admit it never did.\n\nThe media, the political parties, the citizens who believe in liberal democracy must resist the pull toward far-right rhetoric. The illusion of short-term electoral gain is just that: an illusion. They will not win by co-opting these ideas; they will only make it easier for those who believe in them to claim victory. The question, therefore, is not whether history will repeat itself. The question is: will we let it?\n\nThe choices are not difficult. The consequences, however, are immeasurable.\n\nPius Fozan is a photojournalist and public policy graduate from the Willy Brandt School and Central European University.","summary":"As the country goes to the polls on February 23, the Alternative für Deutschland party  is shaping the debate.","url":"https://scroll.in/article/1079376/germanys-firewall-against-the-far-right-has-crumbled-the-consequences-are-immeasurable","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/205896-glgbbqzwmy-1739963010.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 03:30:01","author":"Pius Fozan","authors":["Pius Fozan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.148},{"id":293176404,"title":"'Fatally flawed': Legendary Iowa pollster smacks down Trump’s 'outlandish' lawsuit","text":"Even though he had already won the 2024 election, President Donald Trump sued the Des Moines Register and celebrated political pollster J.

The stories aired in September 2020 on MSNBC shows hosted by stars Nicole Wallace, Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lisa Godbey Wood ruled in June that \"the undisputed evidence establishes that multiple NBC statements are false.\"\n\nShe found \"there were no mass hysterectomies or high numbers of hysterectomies at the facility,\" contrary to the allegations from a whistleblower; that Dr. Mahendra Amin, the plaintiff in the case, had performed only two hysterectomies on female detainees; and that he was not a \"uterus collector,\" in the whistleblower's memorable phrase.\n\nJudge Wood noted that the network was not protected by the fact that MSNBC's journalists were relaying what the judge called \"verifiably false\" statements by others rather than asserting them on their own authority. The whistleblower's complaint had been filed by a coalition of progressive advocacy groups.\n\nNews of a settlement, reflected in court documents filed Thursday, was first reported by The Washington Post's Jeremy Barr. NBC declined to comment through a spokesperson. Dr. Amin's attorneys did not reply to a request for comment. In the court filings, the two sides said they are \"diligently working to finalize the language of the settlement agreement.\" Amin had sued for $10 million in compensatory damages and $20 million in punitive damages.\n\nMore settle, rather than fight, defamation complaints\n\nSeveral media and social media companies have sought recently to settle to resolve thorny litigation, especially over defamation matters. The Walt Disney Co. recently settled a case filed by President Trump to resolve his lawsuit over incorrect statements by ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. The company paid $15 million toward a future presidential library plus $1 million in legal fees.\n\nSimilarly, Warner Bros. Discovery settled a case after a Florida jury awarded $5 million in compensatory damages to a security consultant portrayed in a CNN story as charging exorbitant prices to evacuate Afghans from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban in 2021. The jury had not yet decided on punitive damages when the settlement was reached.\n\nMeta and X, formerly Twitter, paid Trump $25 million and $10 million respectively to resolve his suits seeking damages for being bumped off the sites after the January 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol. (Trump said he gave a \"big discount\" to X owner Elon Musk, now overseeing Trump's effort to slash costs throughout the federal government.)\n\nBy contrast, longtime Iowa pollster Ann Selzer and the Des Moines Register, owned by Gannett Co., just filed a motion to dismiss Trump's lawsuit alleging fraud over its inaccurate polling showing that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris had a lead in Iowa just days before Election Day.\n\nA doctor contests a whistleblower's charged allegations\n\nMSNBC's reporting was sparked by a whistleblower's complaint. She claimed women held at the ICE facility had received traumatizing care or different procedures than they expected at Amin's hands. The complaint was filed with the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, and the Irwin County Detention Center.\n\nIn a MSNBC segment that aired on Sept. 15, 2020, Jacob Soboroff, a correspondent who covers immigration, interviewed the whistleblower, Dawn Wooten, a nurse at the facility.\n\n\"You're quoted in the complaint as saying, 'That's his specialty, he's the uterus collector,'\" Soboroff asks Wooten. \"Is that how the people refer to this doctor?\"\n\n\"That's how the detainees referred to this physician,\" replied Wooten. \"They referred to him — I had a detainee that asked me, she said, 'Well, what is he doing, miss? Is he collecting all of our uteruses?'\"\n\nIn introducing a related segment, Maddow quoted a detainee's account in the complaint: \"When I met all these women who had the surgeries I thought this was, like, an experimental concentration camp[,] it was like they're experimenting with our bodies.\"\n\nNBC had argued that its segments focused on the accusations that Amin had performed \"unnecessary and unconsented-to medical procedures on detainees at ICDC, including large numbers of hysterectomies,\" according to the legal filings.\n\nJudge Wood said the actual focus was on \"mass hysterectomies,\" citing the amount of time spent on the question, and the network's headlines, including \"WHISTLEBLOWER: HIGH NUMBER OF HYSTERECTOMIES AT ICE DETENTION CTR.\" and \"COMPLAINT: MASS HYSTERECTOMIES PERFORMED ON WOMEN AT ICE FACILITY.\"\n\nAmin received death threats and bomb threats, lost patients, lost the ability to provide medical service to the ICE facility as a result of MSNBC's broadcasts, his lawyers say. They also say he's withdrawn from social and community activities he previously enjoyed.\n\nNo details were given about the proposed terms of the settlement.","summary":"MSNBC had aired stories falsely claiming the doctor performed mass hysterectomies on female detainees at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Georgia.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5305268/nbc-settles-lawsuit-ice-doctor-msnbc-maddow-georgia-detainee","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5953x4271+0+0/resize/5953x4271!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F35%2F00%2F562ef4d44e70adf8d95246b6712a%2Fap17212651461736.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 01:25:33","author":"David Folkenflik","authors":["David Folkenflik"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":293082096,"title":"The MAGA resurrection of Russell Brand: The sexual assault allegations against him haven't gone away. But that hasn't stopped the born-again Christian quitting Berkshire for Florida where he's now one of Trump's inner circle","text":"On Sunday, Russell Brand was honoured with a 'Global Defender of Freedom' award at a black-tie gala ceremony in the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump's palatial home in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe event was hosted by rabid Christian nationalist General Mike Flynn, who was briefly Trump's security adviser and now runs America's Future, a charity which fights to promote 'American values and traditions'.\n\nBrand, an Essex-born comedian and actor turned podcaster, who's been accused of multiple sexual assaults, which he has consistently and vehemently denied, certainly wasn't the only controversial figure in the room. Far from it. In fact, he fitted right in.\n\nThere, too, was boxer Mike Tyson, convicted rapist now marijuana farmer, and guitarist Ted Nugent, whose forthright views on transgender people (he doesn't think they exist) and pro-gun lobby stance (he says it's wrong to blame them for mass shootings in schools) has seen him effectively cancelled by the music industry.\n\nOrganiser Flynn, meanwhile, is best known for advocating the suspension of the American constitution and holding an election under military authority after Trump lost to Joe Biden in 2020. \n\nHe also believes that the pandemic was a ruse to cover up for stealing the election, and that the media is run by a cabal of paedophiles.\n\nBefore he arrived at Mar-a-Lago, Brand spent some time 'hanging out' with another new close friend: Robert Kennedy Jr, nephew of late President JFK, who is very much part of the gang, and, like Brand, a former heroin addict.\n\nThe pair have such a rapport that Brand backed RFK Jr in his abortive bid for the White House last year. And, at the weekend, they were pictured hanging out together, along with a shirtless Dr Mehmet Oz, a former TV doctor who Trump has appointed to oversee Medicare, the US federal health insurance programme for older people. The three men grin while holding – inexplicably – a northern curly tailed lizard.\n\nIt's a truly bizarre image to make any liberal choke on their matcha latte and one that, a few years ago, no one ever could have foreseen happening.\n\nFor Brand, once a louche, effete comedian in guyliner, and the darling of Britain's Left (he even wrote for The Guardian), has reinvented himself utterly as the new pet of the American ultra-Right.\n\nHe has become the darling of the powerful set – a cabal of vaccine deniers, conspiracy theorists and controversy-courters, just like him. Indeed, it seems that Brand – who has not faced any criminal charges over alleged historic sexual abuse of four women – has become as much of a red-cap-wearing MAGA as any of them.\n\nNobody seems to turn a hair about his past in his new world. It's said he even attended Trump's inauguration.\n\nGod has duly been found: Brand declared himself a born-again Christian on Instagram last year, after he was baptised in the Thames by his friend, the TV survivalist Bear Grylls.\n\n'My life has changed. Praise Jesus,' he wrote.\n\nHe's also in the habit of baptising others in the Christian faith. On September 27 last year he shared on Facebook pictures of him baptising a convert in a river and wrote: 'It may seem a bit soon to be baptising people but the Apostles did it on day one, so here we are.'\n\nWhile the convert wears a wetsuit, Brand – ever the showman – wears bright white Y-fronts and a man bun.\n\nHe has since prayed with US Right-wing commentator and conspiracy theorist Tucker Carlson. Another close 'mate' is Jordan Peterson, a loud, Right-wing voice who was kicked off Twitter for a time due to his views on gender identity. It all feels a very long way from home – and indeed it is.\n\nBrand now lives in a $1 million rented bungalow in the picture-perfect town of Seaside on Santa Rosa Beach, in Florida, where he moved late last year with his wife, Laura Gallacher, and their three young children, just before the presidential election.\n\nAnnouncing the move, Brand said: 'I don't live in the United Kingdom any more because I personally have experienced how the media, government and judiciary – if you suddenly become an inconvenience – will find ways to attack and shut you down.'\n\nLaura, 37, sister of TV presenter Kirsty, whom he married in 2017, is said to share her husband's new religious fervour. Brand recently revealed how the pair take daily communion together, which he described as 'pretty beautiful and pretty good for our marriage'.\n\nIt's said Laura picked out this part of Florida as her father, the former professional golfer Bernard Gallacher, used to compete in the area when she was growing up, and the family would rent holiday homes during tournaments.\n\nWhile his visa arrangements are not clear, Florida is surely the perfect place for Brand as it's Maga central. Trump garnered 79 per cent of the votes in the county in which Seaside sits, compared to Kamala Harris's 21 per cent in last November's election.\n\nAnd his surroundings couldn't be any prettier, either. Known as the Emerald Coast thanks to the lush gardens which tumble right down to the perfect beaches (dotted with million-dollar homes), Seaside was the setting for the 1998 Jim Carey film The Truman Show.\n\nAs for the locals, they seem delighted with the eccentric, bearded, English newcomer.\n\n'Americans and especially Christians love a good redemption story,' one told the Mail this week.\n\n'Not only is this area heavily Christian, it is heavily MAGA. Trump is worshipped here,' added the resident. 'Russell fits in well and people love him.'\n\nAnother said: 'He's sighted everywhere. I have family and friends that see him at churches, weekend farmer's markets or near the beach or town square in Seaside. People come up to him and ask for his autograph and take pictures with him, he is approachable.'\n\nA cashier at the Modica market added: 'He comes in here a lot, often with his wife and kids in tow. People come up and he talks to them. From what I have seen he has been nothing but nice. He comes in, buys candies for his kids and other sundries and leaves. No security, no entourage.'\n\nAt the farmers market, a vendor said he was in on Saturday and was chatty 'just generally being nice and asking me how my day was'.\n\nHe reportedly attended the wedding of a couple at The Chapel at Seaside on December 6 last year, after meeting the groomsmen on the beach that morning and getting an invitation.\n\nHe regularly dines in one of the local restaurants in town, and was there on Wednesday night. 'He does not like to be sat in a corner away from everyone,' said one of the staff. 'He's so friendly and he will talk to anyone in the place when he is here.\n\n'One time he brought a group of 15 people in to eat. The restaurant had a back private room where he could dine in private with his friends, but he refused. Instead, he opted to dine at a table nearer to the front of the restaurant.'\n\nHe hasn't given up the yoga either and attends classes 15 miles from his stateside home in nearby Miramar Beach. (His devotion to veganism, however, fell by the wayside last November and he has since espoused the joys of a juicy steak on his social media musings.) He is also a regular attendee at the Good News Church in Santa Rosa Beach, where he aspires to be 'more like Jesus'.\n\nOnce known for his sordid sexual adventures – and for making a career out of talking about them in public – Brand's main business nowadays is putting out videos on the social media platform Rumble, including an interview series called 'Breaking Bread' and another called 'Awakened Wonders'.\n\nIn the UK, these used to be produced in a former pub in Berkshire, but now he has a new team in the US dedicated to the venture.\n\nAlong with his Christianity, and conspiracy-heavy views, what the shows have amassed for Brand is influence. He has 11.3 million followers on X and more than two million subscribers on Rumble, some of whom pay £7.75 a month for exclusive content. On Wednesday he shared a video 'Live from Mar-a-Lago'.\n\nAnd it seems to be paying dividends: accounts newly submitted to Companies House show his business assets grew by £3.2 million in the 12 months to December 2023.\n\nHis company, Pablo Diablo's Legitimate Business Firm Limited, is now sitting on assets of more than £8 million.\n\nThe period of the accounts covers the time when Channel 4's Despatches and The Sunday Times aired a string of serious allegations about his past sexual conduct. He has been interviewed under caution three times since the bombshell investigation was broadcast in September 2023, in which four women made allegations of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse.\n\nThe allegations spanned 2006 to 2013, when Brand was at the height of his fame and working as a presenter at BBC Radio 2 and for Channel 4, and then as an actor in Hollywood. Brand has denied any wrongdoing, saying his sexual relationships were 'absolutely always consensual'.\n\nHis former employers, including the BBC, have since started inquiries into his conduct.\n\nLast month, in a damning report, the BBC apologised for its handling of complaints, found 'specific management failings' because of Brand's perceived close relationship with Lesley Douglas, then controller of Radio 2, and said of Brand's on-air conduct: 'It is striking how often the compliance forms for the pre-recorded shows simply recorded behaviour which should have been addressed.'\n\nIn November, Metropolitan Police detectives passed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service, who have not said whether he will be charged.\n\nOf course with Brand now happily ensconced in Florida, with the President of the United States a close friend, it could mean long extradition proceedings if he ever does get charged.\n\nAnd Brand seems quite happy to wait it out there. In a recent video, against a backdrop of the azure ocean, he spoke lovingly of his new home: 'It's like being in Disneyland, it's extraordinary. It's over-stimulating,' he said, before adding: 'There are secret service everywhere, for obvious reasons...'\n\nOf Florida's most famous resident, he says: 'At the moment I hear he's out playing golf... You can't deny that this is a fascinating man at a fascinating time.'\n\nHe then switches to a soliloquy about 'big pharma' conspiracies, Trump's efforts to broker peace in Ukraine, and vaccines.\n\nAt a recent gala dinner for America's Future, he was at Mar-a-Lago and seated next to Mel Gibson, one of Trump's 'Special Ambassadors' to Hollywood, who told Brand in a stage whisper about his house burning down in the LA fires. Brand seemed giddy with the access to Hollywood royalty and gushed about the event on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nIt's all rather ironic. He never quite made it as an actor: while his 2008 rom-com Forgetting Sarah Marshall was a hit, subsequent ventures never hit the spot, as there wasn't much appetite for his posturing and nasal whinny.\n\nBut now Brand is embedded with Trump's new ruling elite in Florida, it turns out he's found his way onto the A-list at last.\n\nAdditional reporting: Alan Butterfield in Florida.","summary":"For Brand, once a louche, effete comedian in guyliner, and the darling of Britain's Left (he even wrote for The Guardian), has reinvented himself utterly as the new pet of the American ultra-Right.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14422855/Russell-Brand-assault-Florida-Trump-rfk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/21/22/95462817-0-image-m-89_1740176263917.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/04/29/8793305189954568268/1024x576_MP4_8793305189954568268.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-22 01:04:33","author":"Alison Boshoff,Editor","authors":["Alison Boshoff","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":293191586,"title":"Trump administration cuts duration of deportation protections for 521,000 Haitians - Reuters Canada","text":"WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday cut the duration of deportation protections and work permits for 521,000 Haitians covered by a temporary program so that they will expire in August, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said.\n\nThe decision reverses a Biden administration move last year to extend the protections through February 2026, the spokesperson said, saying the extension was unjustified.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nPresident Donald Trump, a Republican, tried to end most enrollment in the Temporary Protected Status program during his 2017-2021 presidency but was blocked by federal courts.\n\nNoem has already revoked a Biden-era TPS extension for some 600,000 Venezuelans and terminated the status for around half of them, whose protections and access to work permits expire in April.\n\nTrump falsely said during a September 2024 debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, sparking fear of retaliation among Haitians in the city.

But We Need a New Nominee.\"In a recent interview for the Broadway adaptation of his hit film, Good Night and Good Luck, Clooney, 63, addressed what lead him to writing the controversial op-ed less than four months before the historic election. \n\nClooney revealed the moment his support for Biden shifted took place at the fundraiser he attended shortly before the piece was released, when he noticed the former president \"was less sharp\" and watched him be led off stage by ex-President Barack Obama.He noted how he had spoken with Biden for hours at a Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. a year prior, but while speaking with the then-81-year-old at the event in Hollywood, he realized \"saw someone much less sharp.\" \n\nClooney additionally placed blame on the press, saying: \"The media, in many ways, dropped the ball.\" \n\nWhile he reiterated, \"I've always liked Joe Biden and I like him still,\" he doubled-down on how he the incapacities he saw made it difficult for him to continue defending his record and publicly supporting his campaign.The Oscar-winner continued: \"The Biden administration was terrible at explaining that we're a world economy, where we were actually doing better than all the other G7 countries. \n\n\"They were bad at telling the story because their messenger was not working at his best, to say the least.\" \n\nLater in the interview, Clooney addressed meeting Trump earlier in his career – and compared him to Ebenezer Scrooge. \n\nHe said: \"He was a New York guy. He'd be at a restaurant and he'd be like, 'What's the name of that cocktail waitress?'\"Clooney also said he hopes Trump will experience a \"Scrooge\" moment and change course on his policies.\n\nHe said: \"We've got to hope that he can have that Scrooge night where he wakes up and there are some ghosts of Christmas there that say, 'There's some good things you can do for people.'\"\n\nThis was not the first time Clooney has issued a message for Trump in recent weeks. During an appearance on Stephen Colbert's late night show, the movie star spoke openly about his political beliefs and Kamala Harris losing the presidential election.While discussing his feelings on Trump seizing power again, he referenced the January 6 insurrection as he joked: \"Well I don't know, what am I supposed to do? Storm the f------ Capitol?\"\n\nHe then sent other message to Trump, saying: \"Good for you. I hope you do well because our country needs it, and we will meet you in 3.5 years and see where we go next.\"","summary":"George Clooney recalled seeing 'someone much less sharp' when speaking with now former president Joe Biden at a fundraiser.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/george-clooney-joe-biden-reveals-moment-support-shifted-donald-trump/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/0qRAP2ZBO/0x0/hollywood-turns-back-george-clooney-joe-biden-op-ed-pp-1721077738387.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:45:00","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":293084304,"title":"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner refused to sign memo saying Trump was not antisemitic, book says","text":"Donald Trump’s Jewish daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, refused to sign a statement saying Trump was not antisemitic, according to a new book by the veteran Trump tell-all author Michael Wolff.\n\n“As he kept seeming to be incapable of offering absolute support for Israel in the wake of October 7,” Wolff writes, referring to the deadly 2023 attacks by Hamas, “Trump, not for the first time, turned to Jared for Jewish cover, explicitly asking him and Ivanka for a public endorsement.\n\n“As Trump had continued to waffle, the Washington Post, the campaign understood, was working on a piece that would recycle all the language Trump had variously used over the years, which, on its face, might certainly sound antisemitic. Kushner kept dodging on the formal endorsement of his father-in-law. The campaign then tried to settle for merely a statement from him that his father-in-law was not antisemitic.”\n\nAccording to Wolff, Kushner finally said: “No, Ivanka and I aren’t going to do that. We’re not going to go and put our names on something and get in the middle of things. That’s just not what we’re going to do this time.”\n\nKushner and Ivanka Trump were senior advisers to Trump during his first presidency, from 2017 to 2021. But they kept their distance after his attempt to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat to Joe Biden culminated in his supporters’ January 6 attack on Congress. The couple have not taken up roles in his second administration after he won back the presidency in November at the expense of former vice-president Kamala Harris, though Kushner has been linked to Trump’s controversial plans to depopulate and redevelop the Gaza strip after Israel’s relentless assault in response to 7 October.\n\nWolff’s book, All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America, is his fourth on the president. The new volume was formally confirmed this week, shortly ahead of its US publication on Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nWolff’s first Trump book, Fire and Fury, was released in 2018 and sold millions as Trump tried to block it, kicking off a lucrative rush of Trump-focused books that has shown new signs of life since he won re-election.\n\nWolff followed Fire and Fury with Siege and Landslide. Excerpts from All or Nothing have been published in Vanity Fair and the Daily Beast, the latter detailing what Wolff claims is Melania Trump’s “hatred” for her husband.\n\nAnnouncing All or Nothing, publisher Crown said: “Wolff’s thesis in his 18 months of covering the campaign was that the establishment would destroy Trump, or Trump would destroy the establishment. All or Nothing is Wolff’s panoramic and intimate picture of that battle … from indictments, to trials, to assassination attempts, to the humiliation and defenestration of a sitting president, to Trump’s staggering victory.”\n\nLast November, as Wolff wrote the book, a group of Trump aides including his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, said: “A number of us have received inquiries from the disgraced author Michael Wolff, whose previous work can only be described as fiction. He is a known peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened. As a group, we have decided not to respond to his bad faith inquiries, and we encourage others to completely disregard whatever nonsense he eventually publishes. Consider this our blanket response to whatever he writes.”\n\nOn Friday, the Trump White House’s communications director, Steven Cheung, told the Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of shit and has been proven to be a fraud.\n\n“He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nAmong other moments in All or Nothing sure to be widely discussed, Wolff reports that Trump demanded to know “what the fuck is wrong with” Elon Musk, the world’s richest person who became a key campaign backer, and called JD Vance, the vice-presidential pick over whom Wolff says Trump had grave doubts, “shifty, very shifty”.\n\nDescribing a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in October, where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July, Wolff writes: “And Elon is here, waiting when [Trump’s team] arrive[s], which is cause for a moment of consternation … Elon! Next only to Trump, there is Elon.”\n\nSaying aides viewed Musk as “a new, overwhelming, and discordant presence in the campaign”, generating “an ever-rising tide of bewildering, if not opaque, requests, orders, and recommendations”, Wolff said aides thought Musk had “elevated the Trump campaign in his own mind to a personal mission and religious cause”, while “the Trump circle” was “already anticipating the earth shaking when he and Trump invariably f[e]ll out.\n\n“When they arrive, Elon – wandering about by himself, with only a thin layer of assistants or security – is hungry. This causes a kerfuffle and results in uncertainty over how to attend to him. Someone produces a bag of pretzel sticks.\n\n“The suggestion is made that JD is here and would love to speak to him. Musk, sitting down and eating his pretzel sticks, politely declines: ‘I’ve really no interest in speaking to a vice-president.’\n\n“Later, called onstage, with no one having any idea what he might say, Musk bounds up and, suddenly – in Mick Jagger style, prancing and jumping – becomes the headline, his T-shirt rising far above his midriff.\n\n“What the fuck is wrong with this guy?” says a bewildered Trump. “And why doesn’t his shirt fit?”\n\nElsewhere, Wolff describes Trump’s extensive second thoughts about Vance, in one instance reportedly described in a phone conversation with an unnamed confidant.\n\n“Yeah. What the fuck is with that name-change stuff?” Trump is depicted as saying. “How many name changes has he had? That’s shifty, that’s very shifty. That’s my staff fucking up. They know what I think about people changing their names. I think it’s shifty. And they didn’t tell me.”\n\nVance was born James Donald Bowman. After his parents split up he was adopted by his new stepfather and renamed James David Hamel. Long known as “J.D.”, he later changed to his surname to Vance, after the beloved grandmother of whom he writes in Hillbilly Elegy, his bestselling book from 2016. He eventually dropped the periods, to become “JD”.","summary":"Pair declined to give public endorsement of Trump in wake of 7 October attacks, All or Nothing by Michael Wolff reveals\n\nDonald Trump’s Jewish daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, refused to sign a statement saying Trump was not antisemitic, according to a new book by the veteran Trump tell-all author Michael Wolff.\n\n“As he kept seeming to be incapable of offering absolute support for Israel in the wake of October 7,” Wolff writes, referring to the deadly 2023 attacks by Hamas, “Trump, not for the first time, turned to Jared for Jewish cover, explicitly asking him and Ivanka for a public endorsement.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/21/donald-trump-ivanka-jared-kushner-michael-wolff-all-or-nothing","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21003783cb827c3f1d6364058b9703d5168b7927/0_67_2960_1776/master/2960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:34:14","author":"Martin Pengelly","authors":["Martin Pengelly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":293075186,"title":"National anthem enthusiasm and the speed of wokeness","text":"Part of this was catharsis: For a while, one would be hard pressed to find a crowd singing along in full to the U.S. National Anthem five years ago. Such a move was socially unacceptable. Kneeling, too, was a prominent reaction. \n\nAfter all, 2020 was not all that long ago:\n\nWith real patriotism on the rise, it feels like a different world. Five years prior, the country’s most prominent concerns were Black Lives Matter riots and efforts to impeach President Donald Trump. COVID-19, of course, colored every impression of everything, and usual left-wing sexuality interests dominated the societal landscape.\n\nDemocrats moved dizzyingly fast into all this, and now, we can be a little bit grateful for it.\n\nSure, gay and transgender items have been in steady incline over many decades. But the LGBT movement is distinct from its actual effects, in that each advance has confused society’s relationship with the concept more and more. “Marriage” rights once catapulted from non-existent to undeniable. The year 2016 is when most people can remember the beginning of transgender advocacy, at which point in-group and out-group dynamics placed instant pressure on conformists. It has only become crazier, as we well know in the present.\n\nThe transformation was quick, but its quickness was able to stay somewhat under the surface. Not so with racial matters: It erupted, literally, with George Floyd’s death in May of 2020 after building since Trayvon Martin’s death in 2012. The violence was one aspect of the riots, and deep shame followed. White liberals reacted instantly with shows of anti-racist intent, almost as instantly as black liberals called out the perceived injustice.\n\nWe are in the process of undoing a left-wing normal these days. It highlights just how recent were the events of 2020, how ever-changing it all is — and much of that has to do with how open to transformation the Left was in the first place.\n\nCANADA WASN’T READY FOR TRUMP\n\nOf course, the same applies to the Right: We are snapping back, currently on an election high. That is just how political reactions work. Yet for some reason, Democrats are clinging to what helped them lose. As former Vice President Kamala Harris polls best among Democratic frontrunners for the next election, it seems that her party of progress wants no leftward slow-down. \n\nSuch speed landed them in a disaster most recently, and conservatives can be glad it all went by pretty quickly. Hopefully, the same result will occur, and keep occurring, until it is safe to calm things down.","summary":"Even if most people had not heard of the 4 Nations hockey tournament that concluded this week, they were thrilled by the national anthem faceoff that accompanied the matches.

He then quickly flashed his stiff arm out in an angular fashion with his palm down before ending his speech with an “amen.” \n\nNick Fuentes, an influential neo-Nazi activist whose followers call themselves “Groypers,” reacted to Bannon’s speech by calling it “crazy” that suddenly the fascist gesture was “in now” among conservatives.\n\n“Elon threw up a Roman salute, and then the other thing at CPAC – Bannon gets up there – this was some sick s***,” Fuentes said on his Thursday night podcast. “Bannon gets up there and says, ‘Trump’s gonna run in ‘28!’ He goes, ‘We want Trump!’ Then he throws up a straight-up Roman salute! It's getting a little uncomfortable even for a guy like me! Even I’m starting to feel like that guy in that picture who wouldn't Heil Hitler!”\n\nFuentes went on to note how ironic it was for him to say how “uncomfortable” he was getting with the increased number of salutes occurring at conservative events, pointing out that he was the one who’d written “policy for Supreme Leader Kanye West” based on Adolf Hitler’s ideology.\n\n“It’s getting even a little excessive for me,” he added. “I don’t know. It’s getting a little too real. I was just kidding, for the most part. I was kidding, largely.”\n\nRichard Spencer, a notorious white supremacist who infamously shouted “Hail Trump” and threw up a Nazi salute following Trump’s 2016 election, also took issue with Bannon’s gesture and felt he was just trying to get a reaction.\n\n“Steve Bannon is a Roman Catholic Irishman ... a nationalist and populist ... a self-described Christian-Zionist ... a man who denounces racism and demands greater representation of African-Americans at tech companies ... and a man who lazily initiates a ‘Hitler Gruß’ just before saying ‘Amen,’” Spencer tweeted on Friday afternoon.\n\n“The Manson Family had a more coherent ideology than MAGA. And the liberal criticism that American \"fascism\" is merely a personality cult around Trump seems justified,” he added. “At least Elon—an atheist eugenicist obsessed with rockets—seems to have really meant it!”\n\nSpencer, perhaps best known for helping lead the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, has since claimed that his views have moderated. He even surprisingly endorsed Kamala Harris in the last election.\n\nFollowing Bannon’s speech, Jordan Bardella – the president of France’s far-right National Rally – pulled out of his planned CPAC appearance because “one of the speakers provocatively made a gesture referring to Nazi ideology.” \n\nAsked by the New York Times to react to Bardella’s remarks, Bannon denied making a Nazi salute, claiming he merely “waved to the MAGA movement as I always do in my motivational speeches.” He also lashed out at Bardella, calling him “too weak to govern France” and asserting that “the leaders of this worldwide revolution gathered @ CPAC consider him a coward.”\n\nMeanwhile, another CPAC speaker – Sound of Freedom producer Eduardo Verástegui – also replicated the gesture on Friday morning, saying his “heart goes out to all of you” while drawing applause as he held his right arm out in the familiar position. Other copycat incidents have occurred in recent weeks at right-wing conferences, prompting outcry and repercussions for the speakers.","summary":"‘The Manson Family had a more coherent ideology than MAGA.

To his face. Imagine that, GOP lawmakers. Imagine that.\n\nIn a meeting with governors on Friday at the White House, President Donald Trump was bragging about how he made everyone back down with his executive order banning transgender athletes from women’s sports.\n\n“Every state [has complied],” Trump said. “The NCAA has complied immediately, by the way. That’s good. But I understand Maine ... is Maine here, the governor of Maine?”\n\n“Yeah,” Gov. Janet Mills answered from the side of the room. “I’m here.”\n\n“Are you not going to comply?” Trump asked.\n\n“I’m complying with the state and federal laws,” she said defiantly.\n\nTrump insisted, “We are the federal law” and added, “You better do it,” or he would withhold funding from her state. \n\nHe said that even though her state was liberal, he did “very well” there during the presidential election (he lost to Kamala Harris, 52%-45%), and insisted that most people in her state didn’t want transgender female athletes — those who were male at birth — competing in women’s sports. \n\n“You better comply, you better comply,” Trump said, “because otherwise you’re not getting any federal funding.”\n\n“See you in court,” she fired back.\n\n“Good,” he said. “I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one.” \n\nOf course, Trump is losing more often than he’s been winning in court over immigration, citizenship and other issues.\n\nTrump paused and added, “And enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.”\n\nWhich, of course, is curious coming from a lame-duck president.\n\nThe standoff between the administration and Maine’s leaders continued to escalate Friday. Shortly after Mills’s exchange with Trump, the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter to the state’s education commissioner, Pender Makin, notifying her that it was initiating a “directed investigation” of Maine’s Education Department. The letter singled out one school in particular, citing reports that it had allowed “at least one male student to complete in girls’ categories.”\n\nHawaii’s Democratic governor, Josh Green, was at the meeting at the White House, too. “Several of the governors I talked to were a little bit distressed by that back and forth,” he said afterward, “because it seemed it was a little bit harsh — and it wasn’t yelling, but it was unnecessary conflict.”\n\nIt was just “a moment,” he added, “but she stood firm against him.”","summary":"Presidents doesn't take it well","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/02/fearless-governor-tells-trump-to-stick-it-to-his-face-he-doesnt-take-it-well.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/BPKUZJEIJRDJLDT3PWCKISDZXA.jpg?auth=e9526bb7c3aa1fbe0903e0cad6e890e9833ce6d545decb41eede0a7600eea947&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 22:42:21","author":"Kevin Manahan","authors":["Kevin Manahan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":293050942,"title":"Ric Grenell Says He Will Run for Governor of California on Only One Condition","text":"OXON HILL, Md.—Ric Grenell, former ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence in the first Trump administration, said he might run for governor of California, but only under one condition.\n\nDasha Burns, the White House bureau chief for Politico, interviewed Grenell on the main stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. \n\n“While we’re on California, since you have so many ideas for the state, are we going to see Richard Grenell run for governor of California?” Burns asked.\n\nGrenell, who now serves as president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, said he likely won’t run.\n\n“Honestly, it’s not in my plan unless Kamala Harris runs for governor,” he replied.\n\n“I mean, here’s the thing: We already know who she is,” Grenell explained. “We’ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars to define who Kamala Harris is. If she thinks that she’s going to run for governor of California, a Republican is going to win, and I might not be able to resist trying to run against her.”\n\nGrenell, who became the first openly gay Cabinet-level official when he became acting director of national intelligence, had previously been floated as a California gubernatorial candidate. He expressed interest in running in the 2021 recall election against Gov. Gavin Newsom, but he announced he would not do so on July 15 that year.\n\nCalifornia has many conservatives, but it is typically considered a deep blue state. Newsom, a Democrat, won reelection in 2022 with 59.2% of the vote, beating his Republican opponent by nearly 20 points.\n\nCelebrating Jesus’ Birth\n\nGrenell now leads the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C.’s arts center. He announced that the Kennedy Center will celebrate Jesus’ birth at Christmastime, and the crowd applauded loudly.\n\n“We are doing a big huge celebration of the birth of Christ at Christmas,” he announced. “How crazy is it to think that we’re going to celebrate Christ at Christmas with a big traditional production to celebrate what we are all celebrating in the world during Christmastime?”\n\nTrump Meeting With Putin\n\nBurns asked Grenell about President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Grenell emphasized that while Trump left the world safer as he exited office, former President Joe Biden left his successor a more dangerous world, and Trump has to deal with the world as it is.\n\n“Remember that we handed Joe Biden total peace in the Middle East and total peace in Europe,” he said. “He handed us a war in the Middle East and a war in Europe, and we can never forget that. So, I do get a little bit frustrated with reporters when they say, ‘Your decision now isn’t perfect,’ and I’m like, ‘Yeah, we were put in a hole, we were put in a terrible situation.’”\n\nHe also insisted that Trump has met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his team up to 10 times. “I never once heard from the media an outrage that the Russians weren’t invited to those talks,” he said. “However, the one time that the Trump team reaches out to say, ‘How about we talk to the Russians?’ there’s this hue and cry from the Europeans and everybody to say, ‘Why aren’t the Ukrainians involved?’”","summary":"OXON HILL, Md.—Ric Grenell, former ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence in the first Trump administration, said he might run for governor...
