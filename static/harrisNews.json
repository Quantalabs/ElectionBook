Mikie Sherrill won New Jersey's Democrat gubernatorial primary on Tuesday night. The Associated Press projects that Sherrill has won the primary, which tees up a competitive race against three-time gubernatorial candidate and former GOP state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli to replace Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy, who is term-limited this year. Sherill swept a crowded field of Democrat candidates, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, New Jersey Education Association President Sean Spiller, former New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney and fellow U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer. Democrat and Republican candidates often mentioned President Donald Trump's name on the New Jersey campaign trail as Democrats positioned themselves as the most anti-Trump and Republicans vied to be the most pro-Trump candidate. It was Ciattarelli who landed the Trump endorsement as Democrats worked to contrast the president's vision with their own. TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT, BUT PRESIDENT FRONT AND CENTER IN NEW JERSEY'S PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR New Jersey is one of just two governor's races in 2025, along with Virginia. Both will be used by politicians and pundits to gauge how Americans are responding to Trump's second term ahead of the midterm elections next year. TRUMP FRONT-AND-CENTER IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR AS EARLY VOTING KICKS OFF As they campaigned for the coveted nomination, Democrat candidates walked a fine line between building on Murphy's legacy and promising to change the status quo in Trenton. Like Murphy, Democrat candidates have rejected Trump's executive orders, his crackdown on illegal immigration and the Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts. Acting as the last line of defense to a sweeping Republican agenda, Democrat governors have often rejected Trump's executive actions during his second term. By suing the Trump administration to unlock federal funds or refusing to comply with ICE deportations, Democrat governors, including many rumored to harbor 2028 presidential ambitions, are often leading the party's resistance to Trump. Trump once again took center stage on Tuesday as Sherrill and Gottheimer were peppered with questions by the press about the protests and riots unfolding in Los Angeles. When asked how she would handle the ongoing situation in Los Angeles differently from Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sherrill touted her military and law enforcement background and told Fox News Digital she would stand up \"strongly in favor of keeping people here in the state safe,\" return safety to the streets and continue \"speaking out against a president who is trying to create violence in the country.\" Sherrill is a Navy veteran and served in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey as an outreach and re-entry coordinator, which she described as prosecuting federal cases and advising law enforcement on investigations. \"Governor Newsom surged law enforcement in, and what Trump seems to be doing is trying to add fuel to the fire and really make the situation violent and bad,\" Sherrill told reporters after casting her ballot in Montclair on Tuesday morning. \"That's completely unacceptable.\" Gottheimer said it was \"outrageous\" for Trump to send the National Guard to California without Newsom's request. \"The fact that the president, for the first time since 1965, sent troops in from the National Guard without a request from the governor is outrageous. It's just more chaos that we're used to having in this administration. It's not how I would approach this,\" Gottheimer told Fox News Digital after voting in Tenafly. Democrat candidates threw their support behind Baraka last month after he was arrested for trespassing at an ICE facility in Newark. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) called it a \"beyond bizarre political stunt,\" but Baraka has maintained that he did nothing wrong. Last week, Baraka filed a lawsuit against Alina Habba, U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, and DHS Agent Ricky Patel \"for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and defamation.\" Trump outperformed in the Garden State in 2024, according to Fox News Voter Analysis. While former Vice President Kamala Harris won New Jersey in 2024 as expected, Trump saw a nearly five-point improvement from his 2020 vote share, and Harris' support dropped by about five points. He gained across New Jersey, with his largest swings in the northeast corner of the state; Hudson and Passaic counties led the pack.

Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed into law an expansion of New Hampshire’s school voucher program, removing the income eligibility restrictions that had defined the program during its first four years. \"Giving parents the freedom to choose the education setting that best fits their child’s needs will help every student in our state reach their full potential,\" Ayotte said. \"I’m proud to sign this into law today along with the Parental Bill of Rights, which ensures parents are the central voice in their children’s education. I thank the House and Senate for working to get these across the finish line.\" PRESIDENT OF LARGEST TEACHERS UNION IN US DEFENDS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DURING ANTI-ICE PROTEST IN LA The Granite State’s school voucher program allows any family to receive at least $4,265 per child next school year to spend on educational expenses, including private school tuition or tutoring. The program provides families of children with additional needs of up to a maximum of $9,676 per year in taxpayer funds. Prior to the bill being signed by Ayotte, less than half of students in the northeastern state were eligible for the school voucher program. Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at the American Culture Project, told Fox News Digital that \"the teachers unions really stepped in it by fighting to keep schools closed during the COVID era.\" TRUMP ADMIN TO PROBE ILLINOIS SCHOOL OVER ALLEGATIONS GIRLS WERE FORCED TO CHANGE IN FRONT OF TRANS STUDENT \"New Hampshire is the 17th state to pass universal school choice in the past four years. The wind is at our backs and the momentum for education freedom is unstoppable. We have a state that went for Kamala Harris in November now going all-in on school choice. Putting parents in the driver's seat should be a nonpartisan issue – kids don't belong to the government – but the Democrat Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the teachers unions,\" DeAngelis said. New Hampshire is the latest state to pass universal school choice, joining a trend of states with Republican trifectas expanding education options for children. New Hampshire is the first state that passed the legislation that went for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024. Arizona became the first state to offer universal school choice for all families in 2022, launching an $800 million program that gives parents $7,000 to put toward their children's tuition.

Jean Carroll. \n\nA New York court had found Trump guilty of sexual assault — not rape, a key legal difference — in the civil case. \n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in that case.\n\n“All they should’ve said was, ‘George misspoke. The president, that paragon of virtue, was only found guilty of sexual assault, not rape. So we stand corrected,’” Costas said of the decision to settle. “They didn’t have to pay a $15 million ransom.”\n\nThe Post had previously reported that Stephanopoulos had been told repeatedly by producers to not use the word “rape” but he ignored the warnings.\n\nCostas then turned to CBS parent Paramount Global, which is controlled by Shari Redstone, over its attempts to settle another Trump suit over the alleged biased editing of a “60 Minutes” sit-down with then-vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nParamount is currently looking to close an $8 billion merger with Skydance Media in a move that would require the greenlight from Trump’s Federal Communications Commission. \n\nThe network has denied it deceptively edited the “60 Minutes” interview to make Harris sound more cogent.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump’s lawsuit and higher-ups at Paramount, longtime “60 Minutes” boss Bill Owens exited the company, citing waning editorial dependence. \n\n“And did Shari Redstone, because she wants to affect a merger that Trump’s FCC can stand in the way of, did she have to besmirch and undercut the gold standard in our lifetime of broadcast journalism, ’60 Minutes?'” Costas said. \n\n“Paying $20 million in ransom to Trump is just the cost of doing business when there’s billions of dollars at stake. These are ongoing assaults on the basic idea of a free press.”\n\nCostas also took a jab at CNN, which he claimed has “valorized” Trump “in the name of being balanced,” dubbing such work as “MAGA media.” CNN brass has pushed for anchors to try to remain objective when covering the Trump administration.\n\n“But if the answer to that is MAGA media, if the answer to that is Donald Trump’s view of the world, which is only through a prism of what benefits him, there are no higher ideals. There are no principles at work other than what benefits him,” he said. “I’ll stay with where we are without correction if the correction is what Donald Trump represents.”\n\n“If someone says – and the idea that you have to find somebody who will not just defend Donald Trump, but valorize it, even on CNN or wherever else, just in the name of being balanced– look, if someone is contending that the Earth is flat, in order to appear objective, you are not required to say, ‘Well, maybe it might be oblong.’ No, it’s not,” Costas said. “Certainly things are just true.”\n\nHe concluded: “And regrettably, something that’s true in America right now is that the President of the United States has absolutely no regard, and in fact has contempt, for basic American principles and basic common decency.”\n\nMediaite first reported on Costas’ comments.","summary":"The legendary broadcaster singled out ABC News and CBS News for rolling over after Trump sued both networks.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/10/media/bob-costas-rips-mainstream-media-for-doing-maga-media-there-really-isnt-two-sides/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/106259537.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 23:19:48","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.484},{"id":330112334,"title":"Fetterman emerges as Dems’ ‘voice of reason’ as LA burns, conservatives say","text":"Pennsylvania Democratic Sen.

Fetterman issued a strong message on X Monday evening denouncing the riots in Los Angeles and included a now-infamous photo showing a rioter standing on a car while waving the Mexican flag surrounded by raging flames. \"I unapologetically stand for free speech, peaceful demonstrations, and immigration—but this is not that,\" Fetterman posted. \"This is anarchy and true chaos. My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement.\" FETTERMAN CALLS OUT 'ANARCHY' IN LA, NOTING THAT DEMS FORFEIT 'MORAL HIGH GROUND' BY FAILING TO DECRY VIOLENCE The message received strong support among conservatives who have balked at Democrats attempting to portray the riots as peaceful and only turning violent and chaotic when President Donald Trump activated the National Guard over the weekend.

This is far from the first time Fetterman has found himself being praised by conservatives and typical critics of the Democratic Party. Fetterman was among a handful of Democrats to denounce anti-Israel protests that took over college campuses after war broke out in Israel in 2023. He praised Trump for ending the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran and re-imposing sanctions against the nation in 2018. KNIVES OUT FOR FETTERMAN: MAVERICK SENATOR JOINS LONG LINE OF DEMS PUNISHED FOR BREAKING FROM LEFT FETTERMAN CALLS OUT 'ABSOLUTELY ABSURD' PANDERING TO FAR-LEFT DEMOCRATS Fetterman was vocal about Democratic missteps during the 2024 presidential election, remarking in the lead-up to Election Day that Trump support in the Keystone State was \"astonishing\" and condemning Democrats who slammed Trump as a \"fascist\" after the election. Conservatives are praising Fetterman as the Democrats navigate their future after a disastrous 2024 election cycle that saw Joe Biden exiting the race with just over 100 days left in the cycle and Kamala Harris launching a truncated presidential campaign that failed to rally support against Trump's bid.

Alex Cooper Accuses College Soccer Coach of Sexual HarassmentThe most shocking reveal came at the end of Part One, where Cooper accused her former Boston University soccer coach, Nancy Feldman, of sexually harassing her.\"My sophomore year everything really shifted. I started to notice her really starting to fixate on me way more than any other teammate of mine. And it was confusing because the focus wasn't on 'You're doing so well, let's get you on the field, you're going to be a starter.'\"It was all based in her wanting to know who I was dating, her making comments about my body, and her always wanting to be alone with me.\"Cooper then revealed that she would have private meetings with Feldman where she would stare at her, sit next to her on the couch, and put her hand on Cooper's thigh.Cooper then revealed that her coach's questions eventually became about her sex life, and if she didn't speak about them, \"there would be consequences.\"\"It was this psychotic game of 'You want to play, tell me about your sex life,'\" Cooper said. \"'I have to drive you to your night class. Get in the car with me, alone.'\"Cooper later shared more details about her experience on the \"Call Her Daddy\" YouTube account, as well as how much revisiting her college campus had an effect on her.4.

However, she didn't expect the anger that welled inside her.More Entertainment: 'Wicked: For Good' is Coming in November: Watch the Official Trailer\"The minute I stepped back on that field, I felt so small,\" Cooper later said during a Q&A, per Marie Claire. \"I just felt like I was 18 years old again and I was in a situation with someone in a position of power who abused that power.\"I felt like I wasn't the 'Call Her Daddy' girl.

Cooper's Parents Supported Her, Although Her Family and Community Did NotWhile Cooper didn't really speak to her breakup with \"Call Her Daddy\" co-creator and former co-host Sofia Franklyn, she and her family went into detail about how the sexually explicit nature of the show – like the infamous \"Gluck Gluck 9000,\" – had an effect on her extended family and community.\"You know, if I can be a little bold about my daughter, our town, it was turning things upside down,\" Cooper's mother said. \"People were talking about it, like, 'How could she do this?

Tim Walz is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Thursday, and he’s sure to be grilled on “sanctuary city” policies in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. \n\nThe Daily Signal spoke with Walz’s fellow Minnesotan, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who spared few words in criticizing a governor he views as a “jet puff,” a “liar,” and a “challenged human being.”\n\nWalz, who was the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate last year on the presidential ticket of former Vice President Kamala Harris, will testify alongside Democrat Govs. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Kathy Hochul of New York.\n\nEmmer says that Walz’s administration has heavily discouraged detaining illegal immigrants.\n\nWalz “and his henchman, the attorney general, have literally threatened every law enforcement agency in the state, that if they try to do their jobs when they pick up an illegal alien—these criminals, the murderers, the terrorists, which we have in Minneapolis—that if you detain them, you’re going to get sued,” said Emmer. \n\nMinnesota state Attorney General Keith Ellison issued an opinion in February stating that holding people in custody on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers is “unconstitutional.”\n\n“Minnesota law prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from holding someonebased on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be released from custody,” Ellison’s opinion states.\n\nEmmer says that that policy has placed a heavy burden on local law enforcement.\n\n“They’ve really made it difficult for these guys to keep their communities safe and keep these bad guys out. Because Tim Walz actually thinks … he represents the murderers, rapists, terrorists, the illegals, at the expense of the citizens who are paying his salary.”\n\nWalz will be in difficult position on Thursday. On the one hand, he likely will want to project toughness, as he has recently called on Democrats to “bully the s–t out of” President Donald Trump. \n\nOn the other hand, he must be careful not to pick a fight that would lead to Minnesota losing federal funding—something the White House has threatened against sanctuary states.\n\nEmmer scoffed at Walz’s talk of bullying Republicans.\n\n“Now he’s saying he wants to be bullying people, he says he’s the whisperer to white men. This guy is challenged to say the least,” the Minnesota Republican congressman said.\n\n “He is a challenged human being who has just completely gone off the rails … and, clearly, he continues to show us through the sanctuary state policy that he’s concerned more about illegals … than he is about Minnesota citizens.”\n\nEmmer expects Walz to do his best to deflect throughout the hearing.\n\n“I think he’s going to do the same thing he always does. He always tries to deflect. He tries to talk about hate and racism and ‘everyone’s welcome here.’ There is absolutely no substance to this jet puff,” said Emmer. Jet-Puffed is a brand of marshmallows. \n\n“He is all sweetness on the outside and nothing on the inside, so I expect him to try to do that again. But hopefully, members of the committee will try to hold him to account for what he has caused and what he has done.”\n\nThe committee’s discussion of the sanctuary state issue likely will be further electrified by Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to help control the rioting there against immigration-enforcement raids.\n\nEmmer thinks that’s a winning issue for Republicans.\n\n“I think Tim Walz and the guy from Illinois and the ‘excuse’ from New York are probably going to come in and try to suggest that Trump caused that. It’s not going to play with the American people. The American people are smarter than that. They showed you that last November,” he said.\n\nEmmer clearly has a low opinion of his fellow Minnesotan. \n\nAsked whether he thought Walz might try to project an image of caring about border security as the Harris campaign did in 2024, Emmer spoke about what he views as a history of dishonesty from Walz.\n\n“He’s pathological with his lying. You saw it on full display on national TV when he lied about something as dumb as when he was at Tiananmen Square,” said Emmer, referring to Walz’s past erroneous claims to have been in Hong Kong at the time of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.\n\n“His excuse was when he was caught in a bald-faced lie on national TV, ‘Well, I grew up in a small town and I’m a bit of a knucklehead.’ Hey, Tim, you’re a liar. That is not just not being truthful … . So, when Kamala was saying that [she cared about border security], and when he was saying it, they didn’t mean it … . This is why Donald Trump was elected.”\n\nRepresentatives for Walz could not immediately be reached for comment.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

Biden repeatedly stared at Trump and made halting statements where he appeared to lose his train of thought.

I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.\"This is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.\"","summary":"House Republicans have requested for the former officials to testify in June or July.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/fourt-senior-biden-officials-testify-probe-health-report-2083685","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2660549/joe-biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 21:22:12","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":330093452,"title":"NYC’s destructive Democratic candidates: Letters  to the Editor — June 11, 2025","text":"The Issue: The nine Democratic candidates in New York City’s mayoral race.\n\nThe recent New York City mayoral debate underscores the putrefied state of the Democratic Party (“Mayoral Race to the Bottom,” Editorial, June 8).\n\nWhile correctly targeting ex-Gov.

In the documentary, Cooper reflects on the pivotal experiences she had before and during her rise to fame. \n\nCooper and her former roommate, Sofia Franklyn, originally started the podcast in 2018, when it was owned by Barstool Sports. \n\nHowever, Franklyn left the show following contract disputes with Barstool owner Dave Portnoy in 2020. Cooper carried on the podcast by herself for another year before securing a multi-million-dollar deal with Spotify.\n\nCooper’s candid discussions on taboo topics resonated with millions, making her podcast one of the most popular on the platform.\n\nCall Her Daddy has only expanded further since then, with nearly five million downloads per episode. Every week, Cooper shares her interviews with major A-listers, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, model Hailey Bieber, singer Demi Lovato, and more.\n\nCooper is now at the height of her career after signing an even bigger contract with Sirius XM in 2024.\n\nHere’s everything we know about Cooper's success, from how much she’s made through her podcast to what she’s said about her finances.\n\nWhen Cooper left Barstool Sports in 2021, she signed a three-year agreement with Spotify, bringing Call Her Daddy to the music streaming service. According to Variety, that deal was worth $60 million — Spotify’s biggest deal for a woman-led podcast at the time. \n\nIn 2022, the Los Angeles Times reported that Cooper was the highest-paid female podcaster on the platform, with an annual salary of $20 million. \n\nIn August 2024, she signed a $125 million, three-year deal with SiriusXM to replace Spotify as her distribution and advertising partner. The deal also included rights to every existing and future show in Cooper’s Unwell Network, which she owns with her husband Matt Kaplan, such as Hot Mess, Pretty Lonesome, Boyfriend Material, and upcoming titles.\n\nIn October 2024, Forbes ranked Cooper as No. 8 on its Top Creators list, noting that she brought in $22 million from her endeavors.\n\nAccording to the finance magazine, Cooper also sold $800,000 worth of Call Her Daddy merchandise within three days of its release in November 2020.\n\nSince her rise to fame as a podcast host, Cooper has signed some major partnerships with brands like Jimmy Choo and Kim Kardashian’s shapewear company, Skims. \n\nLast year, she partnered with Peacock and hosted a watch party for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. Her series was titled Watch with Alex Cooper, with special guests at the games offering their commentary and insight. \n\nIn March, Cooper’s network, Unwell, announced its collaboration with the National Women’s Soccer League. The collaboration made Drink Unwell, the network’s beverage line, the official partner of the professional soccer league.\n\n“This felt like the perfect fit for Unwell as we remain committed to not only supporting our community but celebrating women who are doing incredible things,” Cooper said in a press release at the time.\n\nDuring an April 2025 appearance on reality star Harry Jowsey's Boyfriend Material podcast, Cooper claimed she once turned down $8 million for a brand deal because she didn’t “stand by it.”\n\n“I just like didn’t believe in putting my face next to it,” she said. “I think it’s important to say no to s***, because then you just lose your f***ing credibility.”\n\nCooper bought her Los Angeles estate for $10.7 million in 2022, according to Architectural Digest. The property, located in Studio City, consists of two separate houses on two separate parcels. \n\nThe largest of the two houses is 5,300 square feet, while the smaller guesthouse is about 1,600 square feet. In total, the two homes have six bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms. \n\nMonths after announcing her SiriusXM deal, Cooper revealed that she also bought a home for her mother and father in Los Angeles, since they were moving out of her childhood home in Pennsylvania. \n\n“​​To be able to go to my parents… and be like, 'I want to buy you guys a house and I want to do this for you. And I’m so excited to be able to do this for you, and I want nothing in return. I just want your happiness and I want you guys to enjoy it and thrive and maybe babysit sometimes if I have kids. It’s such a cool feeling,” she said during a December episode of Call Her Daddy.\n\nCooper has spoken openly about her SiriusXM deal and her financial success. During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in October, she said that while the money from the network was a big deal, it wasn’t the only reason she agreed to work with them. \n\n“Don’t get me wrong, it is life-changing. You want to make money off the product that you’re spending so much time on. But I started making content when I was five years old. I wasn’t hoping for a paycheck. I just wanted my friends to feel something from the videos I was showing them,” she said.\n\n“So I think it’s incredible that the money has come, but I chose Sirius because there is a lot of opportunity to go to different places and grow Call Her Daddy into something bigger,” she added.","summary":"Cooper first started the ‘Call Her Daddy’ podcast in 2018","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/alex-cooper-call-her-daddy-net-worth-b2767472.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/10/18/40/alex-cooper.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/m7FcP6zm-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-10 20:05:09","author":"Amber Raiken","authors":["Amber Raiken"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.535},{"id":330097972,"title":"Pritzker se prepara para audiencia en Washington sobre ley santuario con ayuda de abogada de Biden","text":"El gobernador JB Pritzker ha contratado a un poderoso bufete de abogados de Washington, D.C., para ayudarle a navegar las complicadas aguas políticas antes de una aparición muy publicitada ante el Comité de Supervisión y Reforma del Gobierno (DOGE) de la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos que se realizará el jueves.\n\nEl gobernador multimillonario está pagando de su propio bolsillo los servicios del bufete Covington & Burling. Dana Remus, exconsejera de la Casa Blanca para el presidente Joe Biden, se encuentra entre quienes están ayudando a Pritzker a prepararse para la audiencia del comité, liderada por republicanos, sobre políticas de inmigración. Algunos abogados republicanos del bufete también están brindando asesoría, según una fuente con conocimiento directo de sus preparativos.\n\nRemus también lideró el proceso de selección de Pritzker como potencial candidato a la vicepresidencia durante la campaña presidencial de Kamala Harris el año pasado. Remus también se desempeñó como abogada general de la campaña presidencial de Biden en 2020.\n\n“El Estado contrató a un abogado externo para proporcionar experiencia y capacidad adicional para responder a las solicitudes del comité y asegurar que la Oficina del Gobernador pueda seguir enfocada en atender a la gente de Illinois”, dijo Matt Hill, portavoz de Pritzker, en un comunicado al Sun-Times. “Mientras los republicanos en el Congreso desperdician los dólares de los contribuyentes solo para descubrir que Illinois siempre ha seguido la ley, el gobernador Pritzker está ahorrando a los contribuyentes de Illinois al pagar personalmente los costos de la investigación del comité”.\n\nLa oficina del gobernador no reveló cuánto se le está pagando al bufete. Pero la Municiplidad de Denver recientemente contrató a Covington & Burling, y a Remus, mientras el alcalde de Denver, Mike Johnston, se preparaba para la audiencia del comité del 5 de marzo, junto al alcalde Brandon Johnson. El Concejo Municipal de Denver aprobó el contrato, con tarifas establecidas entre $595 y $1,000 por hora para los abogados del bufete y con un tope de $2 millones durante un período de un año, según los registros del Concejo Municipal de Denver.\n\nCovington & Burling es uno de los bufetes de abogados que están siendo señalados por la administración de Trump. En un memorando de febrero, Trump dijo que estaba suspendiendo las autorizaciones de quienes asesoraron al exconsejero especial Jack Smith, que presentó dos casos federales contra Trump.\n\nAunque los demócratas ven el comité como una forma de teatro político, el equipo de Pritzker está plenamente consciente de que cualquier paso en falso podría provocar una investigación criminal, una acusación de falso testimonio o una búsqueda infructuosa de documentos que podría llevar mucho tiempo.\n\nPritzker se ha estado preparando para el testimonio desde la semana pasada, incluyendo una buena cantidad de memorandos y sesiones informativas. También ha pasado tiempo revisando la presentación de Johnson y ha hablado con el exalcalde Rahm Emanuel sobre el comité, según Emanuel.\n\nEl gobernador, que es en gran medida visto como un potencial candidato presidencial para 2028, no puede permitirse cometer ni un error. Es conocido por sus comentarios políticos en algunos de sus discursos gubernamentales, incluyendo en el discurso sobre el Estado del Estado y el presupuesto de este año, en el que comparó el enfoque del presidente Trump con el ascenso de la Alemania nazi.\n\nPero ese tipo de retórica política probablemente provenga de incendiarios conservadores en el comité, incluidos los representantes Marjorie Taylor Greene, republicana de Georgia.; Lauren Boebert, republicana de Colorado; Nancy Mace, republicana de Carolina del Sur; y Jim Jordan, republicano de Ohio.\n\nPritzker ha dicho que está preparado para el show político.\n\n“Ciertamente, no estoy allí para darles lecciones. Estoy allí para responder a sus preguntas y darles respuestas. Presumiblemente, la teoría es que están teniendo esta audiencia porque les gustaría saber más sobre lo que estamos haciendo en el estado”, dijo Pritzker a los reporteros la semana pasada.\n\n“Creo que puede haber miembros en ese comité que están simplemente allí para un espectáculo y que solo quieren lucirse frente a las cámaras. Espero que no. Eso es inapropiado, y voy allí con seriedad para darles mi opinión sobre cómo estamos manejando una situación que ha sido creada para el estado por el gobierno federal”.\n\nLos miembros del equipo de Pritzker comenzaron a llegar el domingo a Washington. El gobernador planeaba llegar este lunes para continuar preparándose para la audiencia del jueves.\n\nLa jefa de personal, Anne Caprara; Hill, quien se desempeña como jefe de personal de comunicaciones; el consultor Jordan Abudayyeh; la abogada general Ann Spillane y un abogado general adjunto del estado son parte del equipo de Pritzker en Washington.\n\nPritzker, junto con el gobernador de Minnesota, Tim Walz, y la gobernadora de Nueva York, Kathy Hochul, fueron citados en marzo por el representante de Estados Unidos, James Comer, republicano de Kentucky, presidente del comité del Congreso, para participar en la audiencia sobre las políticas de inmigración de los estados demócratas.\n\nComer ha acusado a los tres estados de “buscar activamente obstruir la aplicación de la ley de inmigración federal”, una acusación que Pritzker ha negado. Pritzker ha dicho que Illinois está cumpliendo con una ley estatal en vigor que no permite a las fuerzas del orden locales cooperar con el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de Estados Unidos (ICE).\n\nEl exgobernador republicano Bruce Rauner firmó en 2017 el TRUST Act, que prohíbe a las fuerzas del orden de todo el estado colaborar con ICE. La Municipalidad tiene una ordenanza similar en vigor.\n\nJohnson tuvo una audiencia similar en marzo junto con los alcaldes de las ciudades santuario Boston, Nueva York y Denver.\n\nEl representante Raja Krishnamoorthi, quien está compitiendo por el escaño del senador Dick Durbin es el único miembro de Illinois en el comité. Pritzker está apoyando a su vicegobernadora, Juliana Stratton en la disputada carrera por el Senado.\n\nSe espera que otros demócratas, incluidos el representante Chuy García, y quizás republicanos de Illinois, se unan al comité para participar en la audiencia.\n\nTraducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por La Voz Chicago","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/06/10/jb-pritzker-se-prepara-para-audiencia-en-washington-sobre-ley-santuario-con-ayuda-de-abogada-de-biden","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7419ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5260x3003+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffc%2Ff4%2Fa818adfd41b586f95bc1f74ead1b%2Fdemocr","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 19:51:51","author":"Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":1},{"id":330087096,"title":"Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' son Dylan makes solo NYC red carpet outing — in repeat outfit","text":"Dylan Douglas doesn't need his famous parents for a little red carpet moment.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 9, the eldest son of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones stepped out in New York City for the TriBeCa Film Festival.\n\nIn addition to the 24-year-old, a budding actor, the couple, who tied the knot in 2000, are also parents to daughter Carys Douglas, 22, who just celebrated her college graduation in May, plus they are also parents to Cameron Douglas, 46, who the Basic Instinct actor shares with his ex-wife Diandra Luker.\n\nThis week, Dylan stepped out for the premiere of Everything's Going To Be Great at the BMCC TriBeCa Performing Arts Center.\n\nFor the special night out, he wore a white pinstripe jacket and matching pants, paired with a fitted white henley shirt and brown shoes. He appeared to wear the same jacket and pants when attending the premiere of America's Burning last summer with his dad Michael and sister Carys.\n\nThe forthcoming movie was directed by John S. Baird, and has a star-studded cast featuring Bryan Cranston, Allison Janney, Laura Benanti, Simon Rex, Jack Champion, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, among others.\n\nPer IMDb, the plot reads: \"As the Smart family wrestle with their over-sized dreams, they come to realize that the struggle to find your voice and your place in the world can happen no matter what stage of life you're in.\"\n\nThough it doesn't seem Dylan had any role in the film, he has expressed an interest in following in his parents' acting footsteps, and appears to currently be working on a short titled I Will Come to You.\n\nLike his sister, he also graduated from Brown University, in 2022, with a degree in political science. Not unlike his father, Dylan has already become involved in politics and advocacy, and last year, he launched a podcast with SiriusXM, titled Young American, through which he intended to both inform and motivate his generation when it comes to the political issues impacting their future. The show launched in September for a limited run, in time for the election between former Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nIn a since-deleted Instagram post at the time announcing the new venture, Dylan wrote: \"It's been a wild ride the last couple of years. From the start of forever wars, the first Black president, culture wars, and now a second chance at a first female president, my generation has lived through some of the most transformative and tumultuous times in our history; and it's only gonna get crazier. I wanna take you through it. On my show, I won't just talk you through the news of the day but underscore the larger issues spinning our country out of control.\"\n\nThe Douglas-Jones siblings spent their first years of childhood growing up in their parents' compound in Bermuda, where Michael's family has deep, long ties to. His mother Diana was part of one of the oldest and most respected families in the Caribbean island, and his ancestors' roots there have been traced back to the 1600s.

The New York jury had actually found him liable for \"sexual abuse.\" Some lawyers have said they thought ABC News could have fought the suit, as BI previously reported.McCraw could also have been referring to CBS parent Paramount, which The Wall Street Journal reported is in talks to settle its own $20 billion legal battle with Trump. Last year, Trump sued CBS's \"60 Minutes\" over its pre-election interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Some legal experts consider the case to be without merit, as BI previously reported, but Paramount is eager to get regulatory approval to complete its long-awaited deal to sell to Hollywood production company Skydance.It's worth noting that the ABC and CBS cases differ significantly from Baldoni's suit against the Times. The Times wasn't being sued by a sitting president, and legal experts previously told BI that they viewed Baldoni's case as weak from a libel standpoint.ABC and CBS didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.In a separate statement, a Times spokesperson also called the Baldoni suit \"a meritless attempt to stifle honest reporting.\"Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, acknowledged in a statement that the court dismissed the defamation-related claims. He would not confirm to BI if Baldoni would refile, but suggested he plans to do so.\"Our journalists went out and covered carefully and fairly a story of public importance, and the court recognized that the law is designed to protect just that sort of journalism,\" the Times spokesperson said. \"We will continue to stand up in court for our journalism and for our journalists when their work comes under attack.\"Lawyers who have followed the case told BI that the ruling had significance beyond the Times.In Baldoni's $400 million defamation case, he argued that the Times, Lively, and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, conspired to destroy his career with false allegations. Lively filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, which accused him of sexual harassment and retaliation.Media lawyers and PR pros previously told BI they saw the battle between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively as part of a bigger trend of prominent figures using lawsuits to change public opinion.A spokesperson for Lively said in a statement to BI that the lawsuit dismissal is \"a total victory and a complete vindication\" of the actor.George Freeman, executive director of the Media Law Resource Center, said the dismissal of Baldoni's suit against the Times affirms basic press defenses. The judge referenced that the paper was permitted to report on public documents.Freeman also said he found it interesting that the judge concluded that the Times \"had no obvious motive to favor\" Lively's version of the events.Despite the victory, the case is a reminder of the threat lawsuits pose to media outlets. Many states have media shield laws to discourage baseless defamation cases. But such laws don't always prevent lawsuits from being filed, and they can be burdensome for media outlets — especially those without the resources of the Times.Damon Dunn, a First Amendment attorney at Clark Hill, said that Baldoni succeeded in getting his side of the story out. And the ruling was a victory for news, but with an asterisk.\"The ruling reinforces their leeway to report complex stories when confronted with conflicting or ambiguous evidence, but it also demonstrates that, win or lose, high-profile litigation drains away newsgathering resources,\" he said.Here's McCraw's full memo","summary":"The Times responded to the dismissal of Baldoni's case, and lawyers weighed in on the case's wider media impact.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ny-times-swipes-news-outlets-after-baldoni-case-dismissed-2025-6","image":"https://i.insider.com/68486e2185e81483682bcdb1?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 19:31:15","author":"Lucia Moses","authors":["Lucia Moses"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":330063672,"title":"How to Watch Alex Cooper’s New Documentary ‘Call Her Alex’ Online","text":"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission.\n\n “I have so much more that I want to do, and I’m just getting started,” Alex Cooper says in the trailer for her highly anticipated documentary, Call Her Alex. \n\n The podcast host and media star behind Call Her Daddy is giving her fans — a.k.a. the Daddy Gang — a revealing peek into her career, her podcast tour, and a detailed glimpse into the “life-defining events that shaped Cooper’s journey as she grew from a 25-year-old woman with a sex and dating podcast to the CEO of a media empire in just five years.”\n\n At a Glance: How to Watch Alex Cooper‘s Call Her Alex Doc Online \n\n Over the last few years, Cooper — who signed a reported $125 million podcast deal in 2024 with SiriusXM — has interviewed several high-profile guests on Call Her Daddy, from former Vice President Kamala Harris and Hailey Bieber to Gwyneth Paltrow and Jane Fonda, who says in the documentary trailer “I’ve been at this for 60 years, you’re one of the best interviewers I’ve ever had.”\n\n Following its Tribeca Film Festival premiere, Cooper’s documentary made headlines after the podcast host accused her former Boston University soccer coach of sexual harassment in the film.

New York lawsuit to probe vanishing ballots: What we know so far","text":"A New York Supreme Court judge has allowed a lawsuit challenging the accuracy of the 2024 election results in Rockland County to move forward. The case, filed by SMART Legislation—an election integrity group—alleges that both the presidential and U.S. Senate vote counts show irregularities serious enough to warrant a full hand recount.Justice Rachel Tanguay ruled in May that the evidence raised in the suit was sufficient for the discovery process to begin. This legal step will allow plaintiffs to subpoena records, question election officials under oath, and analyse original paper ballots. The lawsuit names SMART Legislation, the advocacy wing of SMART Elections, as the lead plaintiff.Voter reports and unusual numbers trigger alarmThe core of the lawsuit revolves around vote totals that, on paper, do not match what voters say happened at the polls. In some districts, hundreds of people reportedly voted for Democratic candidates like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand but not for Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. In several of these same districts, Harris received zero votes.Nine voters in District 39 swore in affidavits that they had voted for independent U.S. Senate candidate Diane Sare. The Rockland County Board of Elections recorded only five such votes. In District 62, five voters reported casting ballots for Sare, but only three were counted. This is a nearly 50% shortfall in one case, said Lulu Friesdat, founder and executive director of SMART Legislation. There is clear evidence that the Senate results are incorrect, and there are statistical indications that the presidential results are highly unlikely. If the results are incorrect, it is a violation of the constitutional rights of each person who voted in the 2024 Rockland County general election. Also Read: Kamala Harris won the U.S elections: Bombshell report claims voting machines were tampered with before 2024Drop-off data and statistical red flagsAnother key focus of the lawsuit is the drop-off rate —a term used to describe when voters cast a ballot for one race but leave others blank or vote across party lines.A drop-off of 1–2% is considered normal. In Rockland County, however, analysts found figures that were anything but. Harris received 9% fewer votes than Gillibrand—a negative drop-off rate—while Donald Trump received 23% more votes than the Republican Senate candidate.These numbers are statistically rare. According to Max Bonamente, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, “These data would require extreme sociological or political causes for their explanation, and would benefit from further assurances as to their fidelity.”Bonamente, who authored Statistics and Analysis of Scientific Data, will publish a forthcoming paper based on the Rockland data. His findings suggest that the results in four of the five towns in the county are “statistically highly unlikely” compared with data from 2020.Also Read: 2024 US Presidential election is under scrutiny as lawsuit claims discrepancies in Rockland County, New YorkWhy this county, why now?Though election anomalies have been reported elsewhere, Rockland is the first county where they are being formally challenged in court. Similar issues surfaced in Clark County, Nevada and parts of Pennsylvania, where bomb threats and machine malfunctions disrupted voting.What makes Rockland stand out is the level of documentation and voter testimony. Beyond the affidavits, many Democrats in the area have reported being turned away from polling places, being told they had already voted, or checking ballot tracking systems only to find their vote was marked as “not cast.”Friesdat emphasised the need for a transparent recount: “The best way to determine if the results are correct is to examine the paper ballots in a full public, transparent hand recount of all presidential and Senate ballots in Rockland County. We believe it's vitally important, especially in the current environment, to be absolutely confident about the results of the election.”Also Read: Kamala Harris election result: Trump's victory under scrutiny as lawsuit filed - here's what could happen nextExperts urge caution, not alarmCostas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University, welcomed scrutiny but urged against assuming foul play.“Statistical irregularities in elections should always be investigated, but the sources of such inconsistencies, which can include error or miscalculation, are not always nefarious,” he said. “Scrutinising election results can strengthen confidence in elections. Mistakes can happen.”He added: “In any case, it does not appear that any of these inconsistencies would be sufficient to change the outcomes of any of the elections in question in New York state. That does not mean they should not be scrutinised.”A court hearing has been scheduled for 22 September. Plaintiffs are expected to request a manual recount of every presidential and Senate ballot cast in Rockland County. Depositions and forensic analysis of voting systems may also follow.While the lawsuit cannot overturn certified results, it may expose deeper vulnerabilities in local election systems—and prompt reforms ahead of future elections. As Friesdat put it, “It’s about protecting each voter’s voice, and ensuring the vote they cast is the vote that counts.”","summary":"A lawsuit filed by SMART Legislation, a non-partisan election watchdog, alleges serious voting irregularities in New York's Rockland County during the 2024 US elections.

On June 10, 2025, a case brought by SMART Legislation, a legal advocacy group linked to SMART Elections, was allowed to move forward in New York’s Rockland County Supreme Court. The plaintiffs are calling for a full hand recount of ballots from the 2024 election, claiming that votes for Kamala Harris and other candidates were not properly counted by voting machines. The court has scheduled the next hearing for September 22, 2025, which could reveal more about what really happened with the vote count. What’s at the center of this Kamala Harris election result lawsuit? At the heart of the case is the claim that hundreds of votes in Rockland County—particularly in the town of Ramapo—went missing or were not recorded correctly. Sworn affidavits from voters and poll workers suggest that ballots showed votes for President, U.S. Senate, and House of Representatives, but the official results showed zero votes for these contests in some machines. The lawsuit is supported by election integrity experts, including Susan Greenhalgh, who pointed out the suspicious results where down-ballot races like Congress had votes, but the presidential column was blank—an extremely rare occurrence. This raised serious questions about whether the voting machines malfunctioned, were tampered with, or failed to register certain selections. Could the hand recount really change Trump’s win? In short—no, not at the national level. Even if the court finds that votes for Kamala Harris were undercounted or missing in Rockland County, the 2024 presidential election has already been certified, and Donald Trump is currently serving his second term. However, the hand recount could have major implications: It might uncover errors or inconsistencies in the vote counting process. If serious enough, it could trigger audits or investigations in other counties or states. It may also lead to new legislation around voting machine standards and election transparency. The judge, Rachel Tanguay, has allowed full discovery in the case, meaning attorneys can now request internal voting logs, machine records, and possibly call witnesses under oath. Why is Rockland County the focus of this lawsuit? Rockland County, New York, became a focal point because of statistical irregularities in the vote count. According to the lawsuit, there were five machines in Ramapo that showed zero votes for president—even though people voted for other races on the same ballots. That kind of discrepancy is highly unusual. In addition, local voters have come forward, saying they clearly voted for Kamala Harris, but later saw no record of their votes. The complaint also points to updates made to the machines in secret just weeks before the election, including new software reviewed by Pro V&V, a private lab which made some adjustments with little public transparency. These details have raised eyebrows and pushed the court to take the allegations seriously enough to allow the case to proceed. What could this lawsuit mean for future U.S. elections? Even though it won't overturn Trump’s 2024 victory, the Kamala Harris election result lawsuit could change the way elections are handled going forward. If the recount finds missing votes or machine errors, it could: Lead to new state or federal election laws Pressure officials to ban certain voting machine software Increase demand for hand-marked paper ballots Push for independent audits in close elections The case is also seen as a way for Democrats and election advocates to rebuild voter trust and ensure that future votes—no matter the party—are counted fairly and transparently.What comes next? Hand recount on ballots: Voters may finally see if paper records match machine tallies. Discovery process: Lawyers will get internal records, logs, and allow sworn testimony under oath. Possible audits or probes: Findings may lead states or even Congress to investigate deeper. Limited outcome impact: The case won’t change Trump’s win—but it could reshape election policies. While Donald Trump’s 2024 win remains secure, this lawsuit surrounding the Kamala Harris election result is drawing serious attention to how votes are counted and verified. As the court date in September approaches, many will be watching closely to see if this case uncovers issues that go beyond Rockland County—and what it might mean for the future of U.S. democracy.FAQs: Q1: What is the Kamala Harris election result lawsuit about? It challenges missing votes for Kamala Harris in Rockland County voting machines. Q2: Will the lawsuit affect Donald Trump’s 2024 victory? No, but it may push for recounts and new voting laws.","summary":"Kamala Harris election result is back in the spotlight as a fresh lawsuit questions Donald Trump’s 2024 victory in New York.

I Should Know.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nNews broke yesterday that 700 United States Marines from 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division would deploy from their base at Twentynine Palms to Los Angeles. This is in addition to the 4,100 National Guard troops already operating there to quell at-times violent but relatively small protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the city conducting federal immigration sweeps. The conflict has resulted in multiple injuries so far, including to at least four journalists and several police officers and protesters.\n\nThe resulting political firestorm around the Marines’ presence is doing little to calm tempers. Gov. Gavin Newsom is calling the deployment unlawful and suing to stop it, Trump is suggesting the governor should be arrested, and even former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is weighing in as a native Californian (she called the protests “overwhelmingly peaceful”). Meanwhile, the Marines are shipping out in an eerie echo of Sen. Tom Cotton’s famous 2020 editorial “Send in the Troops,” which called for a similar move in the wake of the George Floyd protests and ultimately resulted in the forced resignation of the New York Times’ editorial page editor, James Bennet.\n\nWhether or not you agree with the decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump is technically allowed to do it. Newsom’s response is likely on shaky legal ground, and Trump’s use of the National Guard will be a matter that the courts will now decide. But lawful or no, the deployment of the Marines from Twentynine Palms is an intensely risky move. First, in the way it raises the chances of a deadly encounter between active-duty troops and American citizens, and second, in how it shifts the Overton window for the deployment of such troops on American soil. We do not want to live in a country where this happens at all, much less on anything even approaching a regular basis.\n\nLet’s dig into some specifics. The National Guard is mostly a state resource, usually deploying under Title 32 of the U.S. Code at the behest of the governor. Trump circumvented Newsom by deploying them under Title 10, which governs federally controlled active-duty troops, on the grounds that “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” This places these National Guard members on active duty, and is the first time a president has activated the National Guard without a governor’s consent in 60 years. The active-duty Marines are also deployed under Title 10; what this means is that even without invoking the Insurrection Act, which Trump has not, he can deploy active-duty troops on U.S. soil to protect federal property and personnel. There should be safeguards here: Title 10 activations are strictly curtailed by the Posse Comitatus Act, which states that in neither instance do the National Guard or the Marines have police powers over American citizens.\n\nBut you can see how little that might matter in the chaos of Americans confronting armed troops in their own city. National Guard soldiers receive some training in civilian riot control, but the Marines deploying from Twentynine Palms are warfighters, not peacekeepers. Some Marines have indeed received riot-control training, but we don’t have reporting indicating that the 700 deploying to Los Angeles have, and while Northern Command states they have been trained in de-escalation and crowd control, some reports describe the Pentagon as “scrambling Monday to establish rules to guide” the troops as they take on this unfamiliar mission. The counterinsurgency doctrine made famous by Gen. David Petraeus governed operations during my time in Iraq. It absolutely promoted de-escalation and using violence only with due care—one of its most memorable tenets was that “sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.”\n\nThere is a mile of daylight between protecting a forward operating base in Iraq and a federal immigration agent in Los Angeles, especially when the Posse Comitatus Act prevents law enforcement action by American troops domestically. How, then, shall a U.S. Marine handle a rioter who attacks them? Can they detain them to turn them over to the L.A. Police Department? Can they search them for weapons as Marines are instructed to do with captives, and indeed any sensible law enforcement officer should do when detaining a suspect? Equipped with only their firearms, and not with less-lethal munitions, how might they react to a thrown object with only a split second to make a decision? A water bottle and a Molotov cocktail look very much alike when they’re making their way toward your face. It’s equally hard to distinguish between a TV remote, which will splinter against your gas mask’s face piece, and a brick, which will stave it in.\n\nIndeed, there are past examples of American military crowd-control efforts going disastrously wrong, including the 2003 killing of at least 13 civilians in Baghdad during a protest that violated a curfew. While the U.S. Army troops claimed they opened fire in self-defense, responding to incoming gunfire, that account was disputed by the Iraqis. The Marines themselves were involved in a massacre of civilians just two years later, when a roadside bombing triggered a series of revenge killings in Haditha that were the subject of controversy and coverage even up to last year. Elsewhere in Iraq, the same year as the Haditha massacre, two parents driving home from the hospital with their children were gunned down by American troops when they were mistaken for suicide bombers attempting to drive into a military position. Their children, witnessing their parents’ deaths, were badly wounded.\n\nStories like these are not told to impugn the professionalism and ethics of the American military. I have personally experienced the commitment most service members have to doing what’s right. Rather, acknowledging what can happen when things go awry underscores the chaos of conflict. In particular, there is a confused, protean nature of conducting operations among a civilian population you are sworn to defend while simultaneously seeking to prevent them from harming you or others. In such conditions, it’s painfully easy to make a mistake. Or, if you’re angry or hurting enough, to not make one. Service members are professionals. They are also human beings.\n\nAmerica is still reeling from the impact of the racial reckoning of 2020, underscoring the society-wide consequences of death at the hands of the police. What might happen when public frustration is addressed by the hands of the American military? The last time American troops killed a U.S. citizen on American soil was, ironically given yesterday’s deployment from Twentynine Palms, committed by U.S. Marines. In 1997, a camouflaged counter-drug patrol on the Texas–Mexico border came across Esequiel Hernández, an 18-year-old high school student out herding his family’s goats. The Marines, mistaking him for hostile, shot him dead. The resulting uproar radically shifted policy around the U.S. military presence on the border, until Trump’s renewed interest in it during his first term.\n\nThe reaction to Hernández’s killing underscored a truism about American culture—U.S. troops marshaling violence against the citizens they are sworn to defend is anathema to Americans.

The advertisement appears to be an escalation of one she paid for in March, also in The Times print edition.\n\nAt the top of the ad are the words “No Kings,” which appear to reference a political organization that’s coordinating hundreds of anti-Trump protests across the U.S. this Saturday, June 14, the same day Trump is slated to host a military parade in Washington, D.C.. Organizers of the counter-protests told Axios they are expecting this to be the largest single-day rally since the start of the administration. No Kings spokesperson Andrew Cook told Forbes there will be more than 1,800 events across the country. (The group is not planning a protest in D.C. as part of their plan to “make action everywhere else.”)\n\n“In America, we don’t do kings,” reads the No Kings website. “They’ve defied our courts, deported Americans, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights, and slashed our services.”\n\nWalton’s exact involvement in the group isn’t clear, but she is listed as the sponsor of the New York Times advertisement, which lists eight different principles she supports – from caring for “veterans and children” to defending “against the aggression of dictators.” “We are the people of the United States of America. The honor, dignity, and integrity of our country are not for sale,” reads the ad.\n\nThe full-page ad that ran in The New York Times print edition on Sunday.\nKerry Dolan\n\n“I saw the ads Ms. Walton placed in newspapers this past weekend,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the organizations partnering with No Kings to organize the anti-Trump protests, told Forbes in an emailed statement. “People from all walks of life support No Kings because our country was founded on the idea that presidents answer to the people – not to authoritarian overreach or violence.”\n\nWalton owns an estimated 1.9% stake in Walmart, which she inherited after her husband, John Walton, died in a plane crash in 2005. John Walton was one of four children of Sam Walton, the founder of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer. John’s siblings – Rob, Jim and Alice – are among the top 15 richest people in the world, worth at least $100 billion apiece. Christy’s 38-year-old son Lukas is also a billionaire after inheriting an estimated 3.7% of Walmart upon his father’s death. Lukas runs the sustainability-focused philanthropic investment platform Builders Vision and is worth some $39.6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nDespite having a notable stake in Walmart, Christy Walton has never had any role in running the retailer, which has recently clashed publicly with the Trump administration. Last month, Trump threatened Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, after its CEO Doug McMillon warned about raising prices in response to Trump’s tariffs. “EAT THE TARIFFS,” Trump said in a Truth Social post calling out Walmart. “I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”\n\nWalton hasn’t directly criticized Trump. However, she reportedly co-hosted a fundraiser for Trump’s Democratic opponent Kamala Harris in Jackson Hole last September. She also gave more than $700,000 in political donations last year, according to Federal Election Commission data reviewed by Forbes. This includes $100,000 to WelcomePAC, a political action committee focused on helping the Democratic Party reach “mainstream Americans,” and $200,000 to The Lincoln Project, a “pro-democracy” PAC formed by former conservatives.\n\nIn March, Walton paid for another full-page ad in The New York Times. It looks similar to the June 8 ad – with the same eight core principles and image of the Statue of Liberty – but made no mention of No Kings. It instead encouraged readers to “attend your town halls, be civil.”\n\nWalton is one of very few billionaires to vocalize opposition against Trump despite a controversial first first few months in office due to tariffs, immigration crackdowns and unprecedented attacks against some of the country’s most prestigious universities. Last Thursday, Ken Griffin, founder of the $63 billion ( assets) Citadel hedge fund and a major GOP donor, joined the small group of critics taking aim at Trump – specifically, his “Big Beautiful Bill,” which Griffin argued at the 2025 Forbes Iconocolast Summit in Manhattan “will unquestionably add several trillion dollars” to the federal budget deficit. The financier, who voted for Trump in 2024, also called out the president for attacking McMillon, the Walmart CEO. “We should not be criticizing CEOs for being honest, right? And that’s all the CEO of Walmart was doing” Griffin said on stage at the summit. “Shame on the administration.”\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune who is worth an estimated $3.7 billion, has been perhaps the most vocal critic of Trump. The Democrat blasted Trump in April during a fiery speech at a fundraising event in New Hampshire, calling for mass protests and disruptions. “We will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone we have.” The next month, Pritzker described the Trump administration as “authoritarian” during an appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel talk show. Others billionaires taken specific issue with Trump’s tariff policy, including Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who warned in his letter to shareholders that tariffs would raise prices.\n\nRepresentatives for Walton and Walmart did not respond to Forbes’ request for comment prior to publication. There was also no response from the email address listed at the bottom of both Walton’s ads.\n\nGot a tip?

But the bit that really made “Gluck Gluck 9000,” posted on Oct. 3, 2018, a classic was Cooper’s lively and detailed description of the eponymous, supposedly game-changing oral sex technique. Six years and three days later, Cooper hosted an episode of the same podcast in which she posed to Kamala Harris, then the Vice President of the United States and Democratic candidate for President, questions about mental health, reproductive rights post-Roe, and the economic challenges facing young people.\n\nHow did the Call Her Daddy that launched, not so long ago, as a chronicle of two 20-something Lower East Side roommates’ X-rated exploits evolve into the ultra-mainstream Call Her Daddy of today? The short answer is that Cooper and Franklyn’s cheerfully raunchy banter quickly attracted an audience of millions and just kept getting more popular, fueled by successive deals with the fratty platform Barstool Sports, then Spotify, and now a three-year Sirius XM contract reportedly worth $125 million. A more illuminating explanation for the show’s expansion into a media empire would require an understanding of who Cooper—a solo act since Franklyn’s departure in 2020—really is. The Hulu doc Call Her Alex presumably exists to offer such insight. But in just two scattered episodes (whose release as a series rather than a feature probably comes down to marketing), it’s less a portrait of the podcaster than an infomercial for her brand.\n\nDirected by Ry Russo-Young (Nuclear Family, And Just Like That) and, crucially, produced by Cooper’s company Unwell, Call Her Alex takes a form so typical of the authorized 21st century celebrity documentary, it’s become a cliché. Behind-the-scenes footage of Cooper preparing for her first tour, which she’s determined to make more exciting than the live tapings that comprise so many podcasters’ events, is paired with a roughly chronological origin story. In the present, tension builds around troubled rehearsals of a program that includes musical numbers where Cooper is flanked by male dancers. The pressure to give her beloved listeners, known as the Daddy Gang, an unforgettable night seems insurmountable. An anxious Cooper seeks comfort from her unflappable husband and business partner, Matt Kaplan (a figure so adored by the Daddy Gang, some audience members carry giant cutouts of his face). Of course, as the trope dictates, last-minute disasters give way to an unequivocally triumphant opening night.\n\nThe biographical portions can feel evasive—weirdly so, considering that messiness and candor are central to Cooper’s brand—often swerving away from uncomfortable topics. She recalls escaping the pain of boys’ bullying, as a skinny redhead, by bonding with other girls on the soccer field and making videos with friends. Then, suddenly, the awkward childhood photos are replaced by images of the perfectly proportioned and coiffed blonde she’d become by the time she matriculated at Boston University. There’s no talk of how this glow-up might’ve affected her personal life or career, or the messages it might send to skinny redheads who worship Father Cooper, as she calls herself. The defining contradiction of Call Her Daddy, like Cosmo and the “female chauvinist pigs” of Y2K pop culture, is its frequent implication that female empowerment requires catering to male desires. But Russo-Young never really interrogates Cooper’s gluck-gluck feminism.\n\nAlso conspicuously downplayed is the Cooper-Franklyn split, a perennial hot topic for the Daddy Gang. Talking heads who lived through it allude to a breakdown of the women’s personal relationship as well as their professional partnership, as they renegotiated their initially meager Barstool contract—old news. Cooper doesn’t have much to say about this. And while Barstool’s controversial founder, Dave Portnoy, who also became a character in the contract drama, offers a few anodyne words of praise for Cooper in the doc, Franklyn is only glimpsed in archival footage. Anyone hoping to learn more about the end of the friendship, which isn’t necessarily unreasonable for fans of a show premised on the intimacy of girl talk, will be disappointed. \n\nStill, Cooper is too savvy to put out a product entirely devoid of revelations. The morsel of news that started circulating in the days leading up to the series’ release concerns the accusations of sexual harassment she levels in Call Her Alex against a since-retired BU soccer coach. Framed by Cooper’s return to Boston for her tour, her story of a female coach who she says pried into her sex life and touched her inappropriately and used the students’ scholarships to manipulate them—and of the university’s alleged refusal to act on her scrupulously documented complaint—is infuriating. (Boston University has yet to comment on these allegations.) It also complicates Cooper’s memories of soccer as a safe space and her choice to build a career around what is often euphemized as locker-room talk, though those aspects of the ordeal are barely explored. Instead, it’s framed as yet another chance for Cooper to demonstrate her strength and tenacity. “I was so determined,” she says in a voiceover that accompanies her stroll across an empty BU soccer field, “to find a way where no one could ever silence me again.”\n\nCooper is indeed a force—shrewd, ambitious, dynamic, hard-working. She knows her worth and fights for it. But that much has been obvious for years, to anyone with a casual awareness of her ascent to media-mogul status, as she’s built an empire that now includes a media company (Trending), a podcast platform (Unwell Network), and an electrolyte drink (Unwell Hydration). The Daddy Gang certainly gets it. Which raises the question of who the audience for this documentary is supposed to be. Potential business partners, maybe? Watching Call Her Alex, at times, I felt as though I was being pitched a product: an empowered woman whose brand is female empowerment.","summary":"A Hulu documentary on the 'Call Her Daddy' star is less a portrait of a fascinating personality than a shallow branding exercise","url":"https://time.com/7292840/call-her-alex-review/","image":"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/177549_0018.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 17:36:20","author":"Judy Berman","authors":["Judy Berman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.158},{"id":330045986,"title":"Bob Costas calls out legacy press for paying ‘ransom’ to Trump and pivoting to ‘MAGA media’","text":"Veteran sportscaster Bob Costas declared this week that the “free press is under attack” while assailing mainstream media outlets for kowtowing to Donald Trump and paying the president a “ransom,” claiming that “these are ongoing assaults” to the First Amendment.\n\nDuring his speech at Monday night’s Mirror Awards in New York City, where he received the Fred Dressler Leadership Award for making “distinct, consistent and unique contributions to the public's understanding of the media,” Costas took the opportunity to call out ABC News for capitulating to the president.\n\nShortly after Trump won the 2024 election, ABC’s parent company Disney decided to settle the president’s defamation lawsuit against the news network and anchor George Stephanopoulos for $15 million.

The lawsuit is seeking a full, hand recount of ballots cast in the presidential and U.S. Senate races in Rockland County. A hearing has been scheduled for September 22.When the results of the US elections were declared in November last year, a shift towards the Republican was seen across the country – even in the deeply Democratic stronghold of New York City. What does the lawsuit state?In May, New York Supreme Court Judge Rachel Tanguay ruled in open court that the allegations were serious enough to warrant the discovery process. The lawsuit could raise questions and debate about the 2024 US Presidential election but it won't change the result as Congress has certified the results declaring President Donald Trump as the winner.ALSO READ: David Byrne announces new album 'Who Is the Sky?' Check out full tracklist and world tour datesThe lawsuit comes at time when unconfirmed reports claimed that voting machines were secretly altered before ballots were cast during elections in November. According to the Dissent in Bloom Substack, Pro V&V—a federally accredited testing laboratory that approved significant changes to ES&S voting machines used in over 40% of U.S. counties— vanished from public view following the election. Lulu Friesdat, the founder and executive director of SMART Legislation, said in a statement: There is clear evidence that the Senate results are incorrect, and there are statistical indications that the presidential results are highly unlikely. If the results are incorrect, it is a violation of the constitutional rights of each person who voted in the 2024 Rockland County general election. The best way to determine if the results are correct is to examine the paper ballots in a full public, transparent hand recount of all presidential and Senate ballots in Rockland County. We believe it's vitally important, especially in the current environment, to be absolutely confident about the results of the election.

Trump hit back, calling him “Newscum” and saying he’s open to arresting the California governor.\nNewsom responded on X: “The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor. This is a day I hoped I would never see in America.”\nThe tweet marked more than just outrage. It also signaled how Newsom has steadily built a national profile, positioning himself as a dynamic campaigner.\nRecent polling, including from CalMatters and the San Francisco Chronicle, places him among the leading Democratic contenders for 2028.\nHis fundraising muscle is another asset.\nHis Campaign for Democracy PAC has pulled in nearly $24 million across 47 states. He drew national attention in 2024 while serving as a high-profile surrogate for Joe Biden, defending him after a poor debate performance and campaigning across key swing states.\nThough Newsom ruled out a presidential bid that year and endorsed Kamala Harris, the visibility gave his national brand a major boost.\nFrom San Francisco to Sacramento: Newsom’s Political Ascent\nGavin Newsom was born in San Francisco in 1967 and raised in the Bay Area. His early life was shaped by both privilege and challenge. His father was a state appeals court judge, but Newsom was diagnosed with severe dyslexia and struggled in school.\nHe studied political science at Santa Clara University and later entered the hospitality industry, co-founding the PlumpJack wine store and expanding it into a chain of restaurants and hotels.\nHis political journey began in 1996 when then-Mayor Willie Brown appointed him to San Francisco’s Parking and Traffic Commission and later to the city’s Board of Supervisors.\nNewsom made national headlines in 2004 as Mayor of San Francisco when he authorized same-sex marriages, years before it was legal nationwide. The bold move drew both praise and criticism, but it established him as a progressive voice in the Democratic Party.\nHe served as California’s lieutenant governor from 2011 to 2019 before being elected governor in 2018. His leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, focus on climate policy, and public clashes with conservative leaders like Florida’s Ron DeSantis further raised his national profile.","summary":"California Governor Gavin Newsom could take on Donald Trump in 2028, with their current feud shaping up as a preview of a potential face-off in the next presidential race.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/who-is-gavin-newsom-at-war-with-donald-trump-pegged-as-democrat-contender-for-president-in-2028-ws-kl-9378793.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/06/Gavin-Newsom-REUTERS-2025-06-94890436ae0e4d5012f6d7b96e02354d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 16:53:38","author":"News18,Shankhyaneel Sarkar","authors":["News18","Shankhyaneel Sarkar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.266},{"id":330031496,"title":"STEVE HILTON: Gavin Newsom just revealed the corrupt reason he let the LA riots spin out of control","text":"By now it is a familiar pattern in California: Democrats create a problem, are totally incapable of solving it, then desperately try to blame someone or something else.\n\nIn January, their extreme environmental regulations created the conditions for the catastrophic wildfires in L.A. Their utterly inept response made it worse. And then they tried to blame the whole thing on 'climate change', as if that had anything to do with fire hydrants that ran out of water.\n\nA few months later, another disaster in LA, and it's the same old story.\n\nThe crisis over ICE immigration raids was created by Democrat 'sanctuary' policies. Raids to pick up violent criminals at their place of work are necessary because state and local authorities refuse to cooperate with the feds.\n\nWhen the inevitable agitators started whipping up protests, instead of immediately clamping down on it to ensure order, state and local leaders stood back until things were completely out of control.\n\nThen, when President Trump weighed in with his decision to deploy the National Guard, the California Democrat chorus started bleating about 'escalation' and how Trump had 'manufactured' the crisis.\n\nAt the heart of it all, the increasingly preposterous figure of Gavin Newsom.\n\nWhat was his main response to the devastating scenes of chaos unfolding in his state's largest city? Trolling Trump on social media.\n\nWhat was the only discernible action he took over the riots that yet again convey the impression of California as the world's richest failed state? Taking Trump to court. Lawyering while Los Angeles burns.\n\nWhat an absolute joke. Does he have any idea how demoralizing it is for the people of California to see their so-called 'leaders' surrender to the mob, time after time?\n\nThe response to these riots is perfectly in line with the attitude that has come to define the upside-down morality of Democrat rule in California: if you do the right thing, you're punished; if you do the wrong thing, you're rewarded.\n\nSo the rioters who set cars on fire, vandalized property, defaced public buildings, smashed up small businesses and violently assaulted police officers are encouraged to 'keep protesting.'\n\nBut if you actually run a small business in California; if you are just a regular family trying to keep your head above water - the government will come after you with the full force of its authority: taxes, regulations, endless nanny state bureaucracy making your life an expensive misery. The most expensive, and the most miserable, in America, by the way: California is now 50th out of 50 states on affordability, and in the same lamentable position for opportunity.\n\nThese riots illustrate the central problem with California today, after fifteen long years of Democrat one party rule: the insufferable decadence and decay of a smug and sanctimonious ruling elite that has completely lost touch with the needs of regular people. An insular, entrenched political establishment that is consumed by cronyism and concerned only with pandering to its most extreme supporters.\n\nGavin Newsom, Karen Bass, Kamala Harris: this is what you get when a party has been in power too long. Machine politicians whose only real skill is playing the political game. Delivering the basics of good governance is a complete afterthought - if it ever occurs at all. Instead it's all about saying the right thing to please the activists who give them their ideological instructions, or the government unions who fund their campaigns.\n\nThis is how you end up with the worst homeless crisis in America despite spending untold billions trying to 'solve' the problem. It's how you end up with the worst poverty and unemployment rates in America despite being the world's fourth largest economy.\n\nAnd it's how you end up with once-great cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, that once captured for the world the beauty and splendor of the American Dream, collapsing into chaos, crime and squalor.\n\nWe can't go on like this. California is too important to America - and the world - to let this continue. In the next few years Los Angeles will host the soccer World Cup, the Superbowl, and the Olympics. Who thinks for one second that Newsom, Bass or any other California Democrat is capable of turning things around?\n\nWe have a serious problem, and these are not serious people.\n\nIt's time for change in California. Everyone can see that. If January's fires didn't make that clear enough, then these totally avoidable riots surely will.\n\nIn 2026 we will have a chance to change direction: to make California truly golden again. Let's hope we take it.\n\nSteve Hilton is running for governor of California.","summary":"The response to these riots is in line with the attitude that has come to define Democrat rule: if you do the right thing, you're punished; if you do the wrong thing, you're rewarded.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14798001/gavin-newsom-los-angeles-riots-STEVE-HILTON.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/10/14/99220883-0-image-m-15_1749563082201.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/10/5778806162459177064/1024x576_MP4_5778806162459177064.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-10 16:53:03","author":"Editor,Steve Hilton","authors":["Editor","Steve Hilton"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.548},{"id":330017140,"title":"People are saying Kamala Harris was 'right' after eerie warning about Trump resurfaces","text":"A clip of former Vice President Kamala Harris warning Americans of President Donald Trump's alleged military ambitions has resurfaced after the National Guard was deployed to the riots in Los Angeles.\n\nProtests and demonstrations have been ongoing since Friday (June 6) outside the Federal Building in the downtown area of Los Angeles following raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nIn response, President Trump - who began his second term of presidency back in January - called for protestors to be arrested and has since opted to deploy 700 Marines and mobilize a further 2,000 members of the National Guard to bring order to the city.\n\nHowever, a legal battle is now unfolding as Trump didn't contact California Governor Gavin Newsom before mobilizing them - with the Democrat announcing plans to take the Trump administration to court over its use of force.\n\nAs havoc continues to unfold in LA, a clip of Harris during her time as VP claiming Trump wants 'unchecked power' has resurfaced on Twitter, with the post being captioned: \"She *warned* us in just 3 minutes.\" Take a look below:\n\nThe post continued: \"Federalizing the National Guard in California isn’t 'normal'.

While detailing several examples of how “vindictive” President Trump can be on Monday, the “Daily Show” host slipped in a lighthearted jab about Paramount’s merging aspirations.\n\nThough the crux of Stewart’s latest monologue was about the protests against ICE in Los Angeles, the late night host also touched on the recent feud between Trump and Elon Musk. About halfway through his monologue, Stewart wondered aloud why the Trump administration would be interested in escalating tensions in Los Angeles now. He then cut to Musk’s recent post on X, which alleged that Trump is part of the Epstein files. In turn, the president threatened to terminate Musk’s government contracts and said that the billionaire would face “serious consequences” if he funds Democratic candidates.\n\n“It must be hard for the Right to see how petty and petulant these two man babies are and how they wield their power in vindictive and capricious manners when they don’t get exactly their way and the damage that that behavior causes. And I guess what I would say to the Right is, ‘Welcome to our f–king world everyday,’” Stewart said.\n\nThe comedian then launched into several recent examples of Trump feuding with various companies and organizations. “Harvard won’t bend the knee? Attacked. A law firm represented a Democrat? Attacked. A long-term ally that prefers to retain its sovereignty? Attacked,” Stewart said, referring to Jenner & Block and Canada, respectively.\n\n“A small mom-and-pop business just trying to complete an $8 billion merger? Attacked,” Stewart then added, alluding to his own parent company, Paramount Global. The joke got a big laugh from Stewart’s studio audience.\n\nParamount is currently in the middle of a proposed merger with Skydance Media. If the deal goes through, the new company will be owned by David Ellison and will be called Paramount Skydance Corporation. However, there’s a chance that the FCC won’t approve this merger due to Trump’s ongoing $20 billion lawsuit against “60 Minutes,” which claims the news program edited an interview with Kamala Harris. For CBS’ part, “60 Minutes” has stated the show did not edit the interview any more or less than the program typically edits interviews.\n\nThis lawsuit, accompanied by pressure from Paramount head Shari Redstone, led to longtime “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and CBS news chief executive Wendy McMahon stepping down.","summary":"The \"Daily Show\" host also slammed President Trump for attacking the company, calling him \"petty\" and \"vindictive\"\n\n\nThe post Jon Stewart Dings Parent Company Paramount Amid Merger Struggles | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-the-daily-show-paramount-merger-trump-joke/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/daily-show-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 15:59:41","author":"Kayla Cobb","authors":["Kayla Cobb"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":330010136,"title":"Stream It Or Skip It: ‘Call Her Alex’ on Hulu, An Intimate, Often Emotional Documentary About ‘Call Her Daddy’ Host Alex Cooper","text":"Hulu‘s new two-part documentary Call Her Alex is a look at the life of Alex Cooper, whose Call Her Daddy podcast has become one of the biggest shows of all time. Though Cooper is open about her life on her podcast, the doc features childhood videos (she was a bit of an auteur behind the camera from a young age), interviews with friends and family, and some incredibly personal stories she’s never getting into before. Though it jumps around a little, veering from concert film to intimate portrait, it’s riveting the whole time. \n\nCALL HER ALEX: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\n\nOpening Shot: Podcaster Alex Cooper walks into her home office in matching Unwell sweats and sits at her desk to do a microphone check, preparing to record an episode of the podcast that made her famous, Call Her Daddy. \n\nThe Gist: It’s not as if podcaster Alex Cooper is a closed book, she’s made a name for herself as the No. 1 woman podcaster on Spotify by being just about as open as she can be about her own life, being a sexual advocate, and getting celebrities to to open up about themselves. But in Call Her Alex, she uses the film as a platform to open up in stark detail about some of the biggest traumas of her life, even naming for the first time the soccer coach who sexually harassed her in college, forcing her to quit the sport. \n\nAt first, it seems like the documentary is going to simply be a filmed version of her live show with backstage drama, rehearsals, and preparation for the biggest professional undertaking of her career. Cameras capture her as she prepares for her Unwell Tour, the stage show that she and husband Matt Kaplan produced which kicked off in 2023. Scenes of Cooper working through all the show’s pain points are woven with childhood anecdotes and interviews with Cooper, her family, and closest childhood friends about her drive to succeed. \n\nWe learn about her childhood – an idyllic and supportive home life, scarred by the bullying she endured at school for her looks – and the fact that she found solace in her basement where she and her friends would make videos daily. Alex became a production whiz (a trait inherited from her dad, who produced the live broadcasts for the Philadelphia Flyers) and a sports phenom, earning a four-year soccer scholarship to Boston University. \n\nThe bomb she drops in the first episode is likely to make headlines (as I watched I was like, can they really be saying all of this?): Cooper explains that she was forced to quit the sport after her coach, Nancy Feldman, allegedly sexually harassed her, fixated on her, and controlled aspects of her personal life, threatening to rescind Cooper’s scholarship if she didn’t comply. Feldman’s name and likeness are used liberally in the doc, and Cooper in unequivocal about the lasting pain the coach left her with. When Cooper went to the university with the allegations as a junior, their response was tepid at best, so she quit the team and the school never investigated Feldman further. (Cooper played for B.U. from 2013-2015 and missed her senior year season; Feldman continued to coach there until her retirement in 2022.) This takes up a decent portion of part one of the doc, and it’s clearly still a devastating thing for Cooper to discuss, but one that fueled her. \n\nPart two of the documentary is focused on Call Her Daddy – the evolution of the podcast at Barstool Sports, its Daddy Gang fandom, Cooper’s creative process (we see her prepare for her interview with Kamala Harris, which was probably the biggest interview of her career). It’s much more along the lines of what one would expect to see in this type of documentary, and it doesn’t shy away from the podcast’s ups and downs, including her fallout with her former co-host Sofia Franklyn. Though it’s a bit more generic than the first half – which offers more emotional grit – there are moments, like when she happens to meet the women who live in the apartment where she first started Call Her Daddy while hanging on the stoop – that feel authentic and charming. While it feels like the documentary addresses a LOT of disparate topics and can jump around from one to the next, it will give Cooper’s fans even more to love. I am not a Call Her Daddy listener, but Call Her Alex might have turned me in to one. (I mean, maybe I won’t be one of the screaming throngs at her live show but… you know.)\n\nWhat Shows Will It Remind You Of? Serena Kerrigan’s Peacock series, Older, Hotter, Wiser, is a comedic, scripted look at a podcaster preparing for her first big live stage show. Looking back, you can’t help but think that some of her inspiration had to be taken from Cooper’s Unwell Tour, there are too many uncanny comparisons between the two. \n\nOur Take: Despite Alex Cooper’s fame and success, Call Her Alex reveals that she is not a typical celebrity. Yes, she has a podcast deal worth millions but her empire has been built with the help of people she she knows intimately – childhood friends, her husband, her parents – and she seems to know that it could all crumble if she ever started to act inauthentic. The way this documentary positions the struggles of her youth against her drive to succeed in what’s been considered a man’s space effectively depicts a person who contains multitudes. The sex stuff is one heightened facet of who she is; discussing women’s sexuality helped propel her to fame, but it’s also given her an opportunity to educate and to amplify women’s issues and what people think women should be like.\n\nCooper is often comedically graphic about intimate moments in her life, but the places that this documentary goes are raw and explore the intimate moments that caused her pain. Rather than laughing about being bullied or her college soccer experience, these things became the fuel she ran on to succeed. While her rift with Sofia Franklyn is addressed head-on, you get the sense that it taught her a lesson about who she wants to keep in her company. There are times when the first half of Call Her Alex seems stuffed a little too much with B-roll of screaming fans at her shows, but when you really get into the meat of it (I feel like Alex would appreciate that double entendre), it’s a compelling profile of a woman who has used her platform to shatter gender norms and expectations.\n\nSex and Skin: Cooper makes plenty of references to things like blow jobs and vaginas, but there’s nothing explicit onscreen.\n\nParting Shot: “The minute I left that campus, I was determined to find a way that no one could ever silence me again,” Cooper says, linking her college soccer experience to the reason she decided to become an outspoken media mogul. \n\nMemorable Dialogue: “I feel like you guys kind of know me at this point, right? I have literally detailed what the inside of my vagina looks like to you guys, we’re close like that, Daddy Gang, we’re close,” Cooper says to her adoring fans in the audience of her live show.\n\nOur Call: Call Her Alex is fan service for Call Her Daddy listeners for sure, but there’s no denying that Alex Cooper is a woman who earned success on her own terms, and her story will absolutely appeal even to non-fans.

The federally accredited testing lab, Pro V&V, that signed off on \"significant\" changes to ES&S voting machines—which are used in over 40 percent of U.S. counties—\"vanished from public view\" after the election, according to the Dissent in Bloom Substack.What To KnowAccording to the complaint, more voters have sworn in legal affidavits that they voted for independent U.S. Senate candidate Diane Sare than the Rockland County Board of Elections counted and certified, contradicting those results. The complaint also cited numerous statistical anomalies in the presidential election results.They include multiple districts where hundreds of voters chose the Democratic candidate Kirsten Gillibrand for Senate, but none voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president.Max Bonamente, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and the author of the Statistics and Analysis of Scientific Data, said in a paper that the 2024 presidential election results were statistically highly unlikely in four of the five towns in Rockland County when compared with 2020 results.What People Are SayingLulu Friesdat, the founder and executive director of SMART Legislation, said in a statement: \"There is clear evidence that the Senate results are incorrect, and there are statistical indications that the presidential results are highly unlikely.\"If the results are incorrect, it is a violation of the constitutional rights of each person who voted in the 2024 Rockland County general election. The best way to determine if the results are correct is to examine the paper ballots in a full public, transparent hand recount of all presidential and Senate ballots in Rockland County. We believe it's vitally important, especially in the current environment, to be absolutely confident about the results of the election.\"Max Bonamente said in a paper on the voting data from Rockland County: \"These data would require extreme sociological or political causes for their explanation, and would benefit from further assurances as to their fidelity.\"Costas Panagopoulos, a professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Newsweek: \"Statistical irregularities in elections should always be investigated, but the sources of such inconsistencies, which can include error or miscalculation, are not always nefarious. Still, scrutinizing election results can strengthen confidence in elections. Mistakes can happen.\"In this case, the drop-off inconsistencies could reflect the idiosyncratic nature of the 2024 presidential election cycle. Alone, statistical comparisons to previous cycles cannot provide definitive proof of wrongdoing.\"In any case, it does not appear that any of these inconsistencies would be sufficient to change the outcomes of any of the elections in question in New York state. That does not mean they should not be scrutinized, and any errors, if verified, should be corrected for the historical record. But there is not necessarily any need to invalidate any of these elections in these jurisdictions.\"What's NextThe lawsuit is seeking a full, hand recount of ballots cast in the presidential and U.S. Senate races in Rockland County.

The group was created in 2013 by wealthy California investors to expand migration. “That is the cost of not running systems that really center American communities who intake and welcome immigrants,” she continued.\n\n“It was a complete narrative disaster” for pro-migration groups, Flores lamented to an invited audience of progressives who gathered in a D.C. cinema on November 19 to grapple with their electoral defeat.\n\nPro-migration activists should promote orderly migration and denounce anti-migration efforts as chaos, said Todd Schulte, the D.C.-based president of FWD.us. “We should build a much more welcoming and humane and orderly immigration system… There’s people who are committed to not just stopping that, but spurring chaos for their own means,” Schulte said, adding, “I think a lot on that question of chaos.”\n\nThe pro-migration media are eagerly attaching the “chaos” term to headlines and articles about Trump’s actions.\n\n“The chaos unfolded against a backdrop of growing fear among immigrants in New Jersey,” the New York Times reported in February.\n\n“Democrats have sought to highlight Abrego Garcia’s case as an example of the cruelty and chaos of the administration’s immigration policy,” MSNBC claimed on April 15.\n\nPro-migration advocates are wringing their hands over dueling narratives of chaos vs. chaos.\n\n“Many people have speculated that the confrontation in Los Angeles will play into Trump’s hands, allowing him to pose as a champion of law and order bringing criminal mobs to heel,” New York Times op-ed writer Michelle Goldberg wrote June 9. She continued:\n\nMaybe they’re right; Trump is a master demagogue with a gift for creating the scenes of conflict his supporters crave… Violent protests play into its hands; peaceful ones threaten the absurd narrative [on immigration] it’s trying to bludgeon America into accepting.\n\nPro-migration groups are now trying to manage their chaotic attacks on Trump’s pro-American policies, partly by distributing American flags to reduce the display of flags from Mexico and other migrants’ nations among the rioters.","summary":"President Donald Trump is accusing Democrats of creating migration \"chaos\" in the nation's cities — and Democrats are throwing the same \"chaos\" narrative back at him and his federal agencies.\n\n\nThe post Donald Trump, Democrats Charge Each Other With Creating &#8216;Chaos&#8217; in Los Angeles appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/06/10/donald-trump-democrats-charge-each-other-with-creating-chaos-in-los-angeles/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/GettyImages-2216094783-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 14:32:30","author":"Neil Munro","authors":["Neil Munro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.164},{"id":330007270,"title":"Paramount to cut 3.5% of its workforce amid economic, media challenges","text":"Paramount Global said Tuesday that the entertainment and media company is cutting 3.5% of its workforce, citing challenges in the broader U.S. economy and in the linear television business. It's the latest round of layoffs at the media company — which owns the CBS broadcast network as well as cable channels, such as MTV and Nickelodeon — as it prepares to merge with movie studio Skydance Media. In a memo sent Tuesday morning to employees from the company's three co-CEOs — George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins — Paramount said the layoffs would affect U.S. workers, with \"the majority of impacted staff being notified today.\" Some employees outside the U.S. could later be impacted, according to the memo. Paramount had about 18,600 full- and part-time workers in 32 countries at the end of 2024, according to a regulatory filing.As consumers shift to streaming media and viewership declines for traditional TV and cable networks, Paramount has put more resources into its streaming business, Paramount+. It's also banking on its merger with Skydance, an entertainment business launched by David Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, to help revive its fortunes. \"As we navigate the continued industrywide linear declines and dynamic macro-economic environment, while prioritizing investments in our growing streaming business, we are taking the hard, but necessary steps to further streamline our organization starting this week,\" the co-CEOs wrote in the memo. A spokesman for Paramount said the company declined further comment.The latest cuts come after the media giant slashed about 15% of its workforce last year, part of an effort to trim costs by $500 million and return the company to profitability. For the first three months of the year, Paramount reported net earnings of $152 million on revenue of $7.1 billion, compared with a loss of $563 million on revenue of $7.6 billion in the year-ago period.Paramount and Skydance are awaiting regulatory approval for the merger amid a lawsuit filed by President Trump against the network. The suit claims that CBS' \"60 Minutes\" program intentionally misled the public in its editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris about her presidential candidacy. The network has repeatedly said the claims are \"completely without merit.\" Legal experts have said they view the lawsuit as \"frivolous\" and an infringement on First Amendment rights. Mediation between Paramount and Mr. Trump's legal team is ongoing.","summary":"Paramount layoffs come as media giant prepares to merge with movie studio Skydance Media.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paramount-layoffs-3-5-percent-economy-television-cable-challenges/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/02/ad2e5278-820f-4c3c-9831-a8e3d74cf170/thumbnail/1200x630/103a7c104f7e778a7438f850f41f1394/gettyimages-2150317996.jpg?v=47da7f60d670305b40b7371b438c2af0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 14:21:48","author":"Aimee Picchi","authors":["Aimee Picchi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":330031480,"title":"Elon Musk backs top Democrat blaming his own party over LA ICE riots 'anarchy'","text":"Elon Musk bolstered Democratic Sen.

'If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated.' \n\nCalifornia Gov.

(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\nCQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nThe biggest obstacle in the Senate standing in the way of the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) may not be Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) or stalwart deficit hawk Rand Paul (R-Ky.), but rather Elizabeth MacDonough.\n\nThe name may not ring a bell, but MacDonough has been a fixture in the Senate for over a decade, serving as the Senate Parliamentarian. The D.C.-born lawyer is the first woman to be named Parliamentarian—the official interpreter of Senate chamber rules—a role she’s held since February 2, 2012.\n\nThe job of the Parliamentarian is a big one. In addition to interpreting Senate rules, the Parliamentarian advises on procedural matters and guides precedent. That includes sorting out what’s allowed during the debate, amendment, and voting processes. While the moniker may sound hundreds of years old, the role itself is not—the Senate has only had an official Parliamentarian since 1935 (before 1935, the role was unofficial).\n\nThe job, which is deliberately nonpartisan, was created to navigate the complex rules and procedures of the Senate, especially as they apply to the budget reconciliation process.\n\nReconciliation\n\nSince agreeing on a final budget can be slow, to speed things up, the Senate often jumps straight to a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation is especially beneficial when one party has the majority (more than 50 votes) but not a filibuster-proof majority (60 votes). The process can be complicated, but generally, under reconciliation, the goal is to combine spending and revenue provisions into a single bill.\n\nReconciliation bills are subject to special rules in the Senate. First, debate is limited to 20 hours, which can help a reconciliation bill get to a vote quickly. More importantly, the bill cannot be filibustered—the 60 votes necessary to stop a filibuster are not required. Republicans currently hold the majority in the Senate, with 53 seats, compared to the Democrats’ 47 seats, including two independents (Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine) who caucus with the Democrats.\n\nThe Byrd Rule\n\nThanks to the Byrd Rule, named for the late Senator Robert Byrd (D-W.V.), there are some limits to reconciliation. For example, under the Byrd Rule, you can't tack on policy changes that are unrelated to the budget, including tampering with Social Security. (Congress often tacks on extras to push potentially unpopular measures through on the coattails of government funding, but that's not allowed with reconciliation.)\n\nAlso notable, any bill under reconciliation cannot increase the deficit beyond the fiscal years covered—that’s usually limited to 10 years (and why tax cuts rarely last forever). To avoid violating the Byrd rule, key provisions of reconciliation bills—typically tax cuts—are written to expire. That’s why certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)—like those lower income tax rates or the $10,000 limit on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT)—will, unless they are renewed, “sunset\" at the end of 2025. They were passed originally with an expiration date—you can thank reconciliation and the Byrd Rule for that.\n\n(If you’re scratching your head wondering why the corporate tax cuts under the TCJA were allowed to be made permanent, it’s because Congress can often find some wiggle room. In this case, the reconciliation rules under the budget resolution allowed for $1.5 trillion in revenue costs within the 10-year budget window.)\n\nThe Byrd rule would also apply if a reconciliation bill recommended a change in Social Security.\n\nThe Parliamentarian and The Byrd Rule\n\nSince the reconciliation rules can be tricky, the Parliamentarian is often called upon to determine what is—and isn’t—allowed, especially when it comes to interpreting the Byrd Rule. If the Parliamentarian determines a provision in a bill violates the Byrd Rule, the provision must be removed from the bill unless the Senators vote to waive the rule—that requires 60 votes.\n\nThe presiding officer of the Senate (currently J.D. Vance, since the Vice President serves as the presiding Officer of the Senate) can overrule the Parliamentarian, though this is extremely rare. And simply ignoring the Parliamentarian has the potential to become a political landmine.\n\nHow does that play out in practice? It means that MacDonough isn’t always popular. In 2021, during the debate over the American Rescue Plan (ARP), MacDonough ruled that a provision to raise the federal minimum wage (which has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009) did not comply with the Byrd Rule and had to be removed under the reconciliation rules. Some Democrats in the Senate suggested that the presiding officer—then Vice President Kamala Harris—should overrule MacDonough. She did not, and the provision was taken out of the bill.\n\nThe Byrd Rule and OBBBA\n\nThere are several provisions in OBBBA that the Parliamentarian could flag as violating the Byrd Rule. These include a proposal to limit judicial contempt powers. The controversial language, which Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.) famously acknowledged he didn’t know was in the bill when he voted for it, limits the ability of federal judges to hold government officials in contempt for flouting court rulings. Typically, if federal officials defy a court order, judges may hold them in contempt (that can look like fines, jail time, or other penalties to induce compliance), but under OBBBA, federal courts may not issue those contempt penalties against anyone who disobeys preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders if the party seeking the order did not post a monetary bond, or financial guarantee that would cover damages if a party is found to have been wrongfully enjoined. Since the federal government has far more resources than average citizens, this creates a potential hardship for those bringing actions, leaving judges with few options to demand compliance—and creating an imbalance of power. Despite tossing in some tenuous language in an effort to tie the provision to federal spending, it’s widely considered a violation of the Byrd Rule.\n\nAlso largely unrelated to the budget? A proposed 10-year ban on state-level artificial intelligence (AI) regulations. Under the rule, states that establish their own AI regulations would risk losing access to federal broadband funds—a step intended to pull the provision into compliance with the Byrd Rule, though it may not be enough. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who voted for the bill, later said she never would have voted for the provision, posting on X (formerly Twitter), “Full transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years. I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there.”\n\n(Sensing a theme? It’s almost as though pushing a 1,000-page bill through without reading it first might not be a great idea.)\n\nOther potential violations of the Byrd Rule could include the elimination of Medicaid funding for transgender care and a proposal to raise immigration fees.\n\nThe Fate Of OBBBA\n\nThe goal was to move OBBBA over the finish line in time for President Trump to sign it on July 4. That’s looking increasingly unlikely, a fact that even the President has acknowledged.\n\nFor the bill to become law, identical versions have to pass in the House and Senate. Just one example of policy differences: the Senate passed a standalone “no tax on tips” law that differs from the version in the House bill.\n\nAdditionally, the more fiscally conservative Senate is increasingly unhappy with the cost of the bill, which is estimated to add $3.1 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.\n\nThere’s not a lot of room for wiggle. The Senate holds a slim majority, and at least four Senators, including Paul, have publicly expressed concerns over parts of the bill (the others are Ron Johnson, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski). Any changes could tip the balance of votes in the House—the original OBBBA passed with a squeaky close 215-214 vote.\n\nThat makes MacDonough’s role—and how willing Republicans might be to overrule nearly 100 years of precedent—a crucial part of the reconciliation process.\n\nForbesHow Senate Rules Could Slow Down Any GOP Tax CutsBy Kelly Phillips ErbForbesSenate Passes A “No Tax On Tips” Bill—Here’s How It Differs From House VersionBy Kelly Phillips ErbForbesHouse Passes Trump Tax Bill After Marathon Session, Now It Moves To The SenateBy Kelly Phillips Erb\n\nTax Breaks: Timely tax tips and the latest news delivered to your inbox weekly\n\nGot a tip?

Once taken by a patient whose guts have been colonised with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the pills dissolve and the \"good bacteria\" flush out the \"bad bacteria\", stopping them from lurking in the patient's bowel and potentially escaping elsewhere in the body to cause extremely hard to treat infections.\nA recent, small-scale trial, published in the Journal of Infection, showed \"really promising signals\" that the poo pills could get rid of the superbugs altogether or \"reduce them down to a level that doesn't cause problems\", said study lead Dr Blair Merrick, of Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, London.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Faecal transplants (sometimes called \"trans-poo-tion\") are already approved in the UK for treatment of adults who have had repeated episodes of infection by Clostridium difficile – a bacteria that can cause severe diarrhoea and is notoriously resistant to most antibiotics. These transplants are often delivered via enema, colonoscopy or naso-gastric tube but pills are sometimes used instead.\n\nHow big a problem are superbugs? \n'Superbug' is a term used for different strains of bacteria that have developed resistance to most known antibiotics – mainly because we have misused and overused these antibiotics over the years.\nThe main superbugs include MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Clostridium difficile, and the bacteria that cause multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.\nResistance to antibiotics has led to at least 1 million deaths globally since 1990, according to a study by the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance Project published last year in The Lancet. Increasing rates of drug-resistant infections are expected to claim more than 39 million lives between now and 2050.\n\"It's very scary,\" England's former chief medical officer Sally Davies told The Guardian last year. Now the UK's special envy for antimicrobial resistance, she said \"some people talk about it being a pandemic – it is. It's pretty awful.\" Certainly, according to a National Audit Office report earlier this year, the UK \"remains a long way\" from its goal of containing, controlling and mitigating it.\nCould poo pills fight other diseases?\nThere are several studies being carried out on other uses for faecal transplants, including for treating cancer and mental health issues.\nResearchers have begun \"wondering if altering these microbial populations\" could make cancer tumours \"more receptive to existing treatment options\", said Popular Science. In Canada, a two-year poo pill trial has just started on a small group of pancreatic cancer patients.\nAlso in Canada, researchers at the University of Calgary, intrigued by studies suggesting that altering the gut microbiome can improve signalling between the gut and the brain, have began a trial to see if poo pills can reduce the effects of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nBut some new research is suggesting faecal transplants can alter the intestinal environment in less helpful ways, said The Independent. Studies on mice, published in Cell, showed shifts in liver metabolism and the genes involved in immune function. The study author recognise the advances faecal transplants promise but advise caution in developing future treatments.\n\nExplore More\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nVenice braces for the Bezos wedding\n\nIn the Spotlight\nThe Amazon founder and his fiancée will be met with 'noisy' protests when they cruise into the historic city aboard their $500m superyacht\n\nWhat is Kamala Harris' California future?\n\nToday's Big Question\nShe could run for governor.

Yet, \"rather than empowering the far-right, Starmer may be neutering it\", said Eir Nolsøe in The Telegraph.\nAs Danish immigration minister Kaare Dybvad Bek told the paper: \"There is no doubt in my mind that traditional political parties taking immigration seriously is the reason why we don't have large far-right parties in Denmark.\" And despite criticism, Denmark's tough policies have voter backing; the Social Democrats won elections in 2019 and 2022.\nIn 2023, Denmark revoked residency permits for Syrian refugees, declaring parts of Syria safe, \"before backtracking after international backlash\", said Politico. Two years earlier, it passed a law allowing refugees to be relocated to asylum centres in countries like Rwanda, drawing criticism from the European Commission. The country has also \"looked hard\" at detaining asylum seekers on a remote island.\nRejected asylum seekers in Denmark receive no financial support, only food and shelter until they leave. Those who withdraw their application within two weeks get 20,000 DKK (£2,258), plus another 20,000 DKK in \"repatriation support\" to restart their lives. \"Denmark literally pays migrants to leave,\" said Nolsøe.\nFrederiksen justifies her \"tough\" migration rules through issues more traditionally associated with the left: \"public services\", said Katya Adler for the BBC. Danes pay the highest tax rates in Europe across all household types, and they \"expect top-notch public services in return\". The Danish prime minister argues that migration levels \"threatened social cohesion and social welfare with the poorest Danes losing out the most\". Her critics see this stance as a \"cynical ploy\", while she argues its sincerity but either way, it's worked: asylum claim applications are down in Denmark, in \"stark contrast\" to much of the rest of Europe.\nAt the heart of Frederiksen's approach is a \"determination\" to protect working-class livelihoods and prevent schools and welfare systems from being overwhelmed, said Sue Reid in the Daily Mail.\nGovernment data supports this. In Danish schools, the younger the pupils, the higher the proportion of ethnic Danes, which is \"the reverse of what is happening in much of England's education system\", where last year 37% of pupils came from minority backgrounds.\nThis contrast offers a \"stark lesson\" for Labour. And with immigration dominating May's local elections, Denmark’s \"hardline stance\" is now \"firmly\" on Starmer’s radar following his meeting with Frederiksen in February.\n\nWhether or not Denmark's immigration policies have been a success depends on the criteria used \"to judge them\", said Adler. Asylum claim applications are certainly down, but Denmark is not a \"front-line state\", where people smugglers' boats frequently aim for its shores.\nAnd Denmark's hard-line stance and new legislation have seriously damaged its reputation for \"respecting international humanitarian law and the rights of asylum-seekers\", added Adler.\nFor this reason, among others, it would be \"hard\" for Starmer to \"pursue\" the Denmark approach, said Susi Dennison, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Especially so because, after taking over from the Tories, Starmer \"made a point\" of recommitting the UK to international institutions and international law.\n\nExplore More\n\nKeir Starmer\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nChas Newkey-Burden, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nChas Newkey-Burden has been part of The Week Digital team for more than a decade and a journalist for 25 years, starting out on the irreverent football weekly 90 Minutes, before moving to lifestyle magazines Loaded and Attitude.

In 2024 Kamala Harris kept her distance, and Mr. Rogan gave his endorsement to Donald Trump. It’s Mr. Rogan’s influence that Democrats covet, an influence that has only increased in recent years with the popularity of a new crowd of male podcasters whom he has supported and who are now starting to rival his popularity. Amid a widespread — and widely mocked — effort by Democrats to reach young men, several elite liberal groups have sprung into action to counter the Rogan effect. One for-profit startup called AND Media (which stands for Achieve Narrative Dominance) hopes to raise $70 million to fund online influencers. Another similar undertaking has connections to the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt.\n\nThese efforts are unlikely to succeed, because they’re based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what these podcasts are and why they are so popular.\n\nTwo decades ago, Andrew Breitbart articulated the theory that “politics is downstream from culture.” That’s no longer quite right. Culture now is politics, and these podcasters — or bro-casters — are a perfect example of why.","summary":"Trying to find a lefty Joe Rogan entirely misses the point.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/opinion/democrats-liberal-podcasters.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/opinion/10hirschorn/10hirschorn-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 12:47:07","author":"Michael Hirschorn","authors":["Michael Hirschorn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.004},{"id":329980758,"title":"Mostly peaceful riots return as media downplay chaos again","text":"“I want to be clear on how I characterize this,” MSNBC’s Ali Velshi said in front of a burning building with bright orange flames engulfing the screen behind him on May 29, 2020, while “reporting” from Minneapolis. “This is mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly, but fires have been started, and this crowd is relishing that.”\n\nOver on CNN in August 2020, after riots broke out in Wisconsin, the lower-third chyron that serves as a headline was just as comical:\n\n“FIERY BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS AFTER POLICE SHOOTING”\n\nThe numbers tell the story: More than $2 billion in property damage was done across the United States that summer. A police station and several city blocks were taken over in Seattle by hard-left rioters. Portland law enforcement was under siege for months while mayors of those cities rejected President Donald Trump’s offer to send in the National Guard. \n\nScores of law enforcement officers were injured, while retired Police Captain David Dorn, a black man, was murdered by a rioter in Missouri. The media barely covered it because there was a narrative to protect: rioters good, cops bad. And in the process, Black Lives Matter raked in nearly $100 million in donations in 2020, only to use much of that money to purchase several multimillion-dollar mansions across the country and one in Canada. \n\nDemocrats see the riots of Los Angeles today as an opportunity to attack Trump over his decision to send in the National Guard without Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D-CA) approval. Newsom said he had the situation under control (he didn’t) and got an assist from CNN’s Dana Bash, who lectured Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) about the images and reports we’re seeing from Los Angeles not being of “real riots.” \n\nNewsom even went so far as to call Trump a “dictator” while daring border czar Tom Homan to arrest him because he is “standing up for California.” Other prominent Democrats, almost as if a memo had gone out, are singing from the same hymn sheet, calling the LA riots “peaceful.” Meanwhile, former Vice President Kamala Harris went even further. \n\n“Protest is a powerful tool — essential in the fight for justice. And as the LAPD, Mayor, and Governor have noted, demonstrations in defense of our immigrant neighbors have been overwhelmingly peaceful,” she said without noting that “our immigrant neighbors” targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement are the worst of the worst who illegally came to America. \n\nThankfully, law enforcement is pushing back on Harris, who is a Los Angeles resident in the ritzy section of Brentwood. \n\n“President Trump didn’t start these riots. He’s not out there lighting cars on fire, hurling projectiles at law enforcement, or blocking freeways,” Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco wrote on X in response to Harris’s comments. \n\n“This statement is an embarrassment and does nothing to [defuse] the violent riots taking place across the city. The Democrats and their ‘leaders’ own this,” he added.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), a possible 2028 presidential contender, went on national television on Monday morning (MSNBC, of course) to urge unrest across the country. \n\n“This is the most corrupt administration in the history of the country, and we are going to rise to this moment by being out there on the streets,” he told a nodding Mika Brzezinski on Morning Joe. “I think the country sees what Donald Trump is trying to do here. He’s looking for a fight. There’s nothing in what he is doing that is about peace or about restoring order.” \n\n“He’s trying to turn a protest that is pretty small into something that involves an even bigger confrontation,” he said.\n\nYup. A “pretty small” riot. Murphy didn’t bother to mention what the objective of Trump and ICE is here, which is delivering on a campaign promise to deport any and all criminals in the country who are here illegally. Murphy is also calling for a repeat of the summer of 2020 by taking it to the streets, hoping the chaos can bring down Trump’s rising poll numbers, with several pollsters now showing him above 50% approval again. \n\nThose arrested by ICE include 49-year-old Cuong Chanh Phan, who entered the country illegally from Vietnam and has been convicted of second-degree murder after shooting and killing an 18-year-old and a 15-year-old at a graduation party in Los Angeles. Others arrested over the weekend include more murderers and sex offenders. Yet Democrats and their allies in the media are calling for protests of the very ICE agents tasked with arresting and deporting these monsters. \n\nThis has been a theme since Trump took office: The Blue Team going to bat for the worst kind of people while screaming about the due process they say they deserve despite those people breaking into the country and avoiding all process. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) is the poster boy of this effort. He flew to El Salvador to demand that illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia be sent back to the U.S. after the Trump administration sent him to a prison there. \n\nAbrego Garcia, whom the media portrayed as a “Maryland man” and doting father and husband, is accused of being an MS-13 gang member. In court documents, his wife has accused him of beating her on multiple occasions. And now, the Justice Department is charging him with human trafficking, with the evidence appearing to be overwhelming. \n\n“Over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring,” Attorney General Pam Bondi announced during a press conference last week. “They found this was his full-time job, not a contractor. He was a smuggler of humans and children and women.”\n\nDespite all of this, during a recent interview on CNN, Van Hollen had the audacity to call on Trump to apologize to Abrego Garcia for what he and his family were put through. \n\nThe public, of course, feels quite differently about this. According to an AP-NORC poll, 83% of those surveyed support deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of major or violent crimes, including 60% of independents and a majority, 53%, of Democrats. And in a CBS poll taken before the weekend, when asked if those here illegally should be deported regardless of whether they’ve committed a crime or not, 54% approve of Trump’s program. \n\nSo why are Democrats so hell-bent on downplaying and dismissing riots, calling for more protests that will surely get out of control, and trying to protect illegal immigrants who have committed heinous crimes? \n\nThis is a primary reason why the party is polling so low. CNN released a survey recently that shows just 16% of Americans believe the party has strong leaders, while 40% say Republicans have strong leaders. \n\nVoters, by and large, want illegal immigrants out of the country, especially those here to commit crimes and hurt or kill legal citizens. They want ICE to be able to complete its missions. And they definitely don’t want to see Molotov cocktails and improvised devices being used against law enforcement. \n\nDemocrats are tacitly supporting all of this. For their part, the legacy media are trying to help Democrats in this effort, but they’re just as unpopular as the party they exist to serve, thereby having little to no impact on the national conversation. \n\nMostly peaceful riots are back again. You may be watching at home and being told that what you’re seeing on your screen isn’t a big deal.\n\nDEMOCRATS ABREGO GARCIA BLUNDER COULD HAUNT THE PARTY FOR YEARS\n\nIt is.

Alex Johnson, who chairs the Georgia Republican Assembly, a faction aiming to influence the party, claimed that Raffensperger has consistently “ignored and disrespected” the party’s stance, including attempts to alter the election system, arguing that Republicans should have the option to distance themselves from Raffensperger.\n\n“He doesn’t listen to anything that the Republican party has asked him to do,” Johnson said Monday. “He is hostile and has been hostile towards our presidential nominee and now a person who is president.”\n\nBut party Chairman Josh McKoon told reporters after the convention ended that while the resolution “presents the sense of the convention on what should happen,” state law would only allow the party to refuse to qualify Raffensperger if he falsely swore the loyalty oath to the party required of Republican primary candidates.\n\n“I don’t really see a way for the Georgia Republican Party to decline someone the opportunity to qualify,” McKoon said.\n\nA spokesperson for Raffensperger’s office declined to comment Monday. The two-term secretary of state has said he’s considering running for governor or U.S. Senate in 2026.\n\nGeorgia has no party registration and its primary elections allow anyone to vote in the party nominating contest of their choice. That means it can be hard to tell who is truly a Republican or a Democrat.\n\nSome Republicans favor a system of voter registration by party and primaries that allow only party members to vote. They also say party officials should decide which candidates should be allowed to run as Republicans.\n\nThe Georgia Republican Party’s executive committee voted in January to expel former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan after Duncan endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for president. The committee voted to ban Duncan from party events and said it would not qualify Duncan to run as a Republican in the future.\n\nBut the party in 2023 rejected an attempt to ban ideological traitors from primary ballots. Last year, judges blocked attempts by a county party in northwest Georgia to act as gatekeepers for local candidates.\n\nIn a ruling regarding Catoosa County, the state Supreme Court did not get to the heart of the dispute over whether parties can create rules for qualifying candidates in primary elections beyond those found in Georgia law. Those who push that point of view claim that being forced to qualify everyone who signs up violates their freedom of association under the U.S. Constitution.\n\n“You can’t force a Baptist church to ordain a Buddhist or a Muslim to be a Baptist minister,” said Nathaniel Darnell, president of the Georgia Republican Assembly. “By the same token, you can’t force somebody who is counteracting the Republican principles and objectives to be Republican.”\n\nA federal judge rejected that argument, but some Catoosa County Republicans have appealed the case.

Is she ready to deal with all the detailed and complex issues that constantly confront any California governor? Can she raise the minimum of $100 million or so that’s needed to be a credible candidate for governor?\n\nThese are just some of the items on Harris’s mind as she disapprovingly watches Trump run the government in a confrontational manner completely foreign to her. She knows if she doesn’t run for president in 2028, though, that she will forfeit any advantage she would possess as a barely beaten candidate last time out, one whose defeat now has many 2024 Trump voters feeling a bit of buyer’s remorse.\n\nShe also knows that if she goes for governor, she will have to promise to serve out a full term in that office should she win. Reneging on that pledge would likely doom her in any presidential primary election, tagging her as a promise breaker. Keeping such a pledge also takes her out of the 2028 presidential running, though.\n\nIt’s a rare quandary no previous California Democrat has faced. The huge question for Harris, who will be 63 on Election Day 2026 is this: Does she care enough about the details of California issues from electric vehicle mandates to Medi-Cal for the undocumented to give up on her national ambitions, at least for most of her 60s?\n\nHarris bears the image of a surfacy politician for sure. Rivals also blame her for failing to disclose just how disabled former President Joe Biden became. Few can name salient achievements of either her six years as state attorney general or her four years as Biden’s second in command.\n\nSome of those are substantial: During California’s fiscal crisis of 2009 through 2012, when many thousands of mortgages were threatened with foreclosure, she leveraged the state’s sheer size to increase its share of a 2012 national mortgage settlement to $18 billion from an initial top offer of $4 billion, helping an unknown but large number of Californians evade foreclosure.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015, her office recouped more than $1 billion for the state’s major public employee retirement funds after banks and rating agencies lied to greatly overvalue mortgage-backed securities. She also secured a 2012 agreement with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and HP to require that all apps they sell display clear new privacy policies — and then she created a state privacy enforcement unit to seal that deal.\n\nHer record was less noteworthy as vice president, partly because Biden assigned her impossible tasks such as fixing conditions in Latin America that encourage illegal immigration. That assignment did not come with the power to make any improvements.\n\nSo the Harris image as a lightweight, promoted in part by her cackling responses in some interviews, can be misleading and other candidates for governor would be wise not to underestimate her. That key question remains, though: How interested is Harris in pursuing the state’s problems all the way to solutions, from the fate of the partially-built bullet train to the pesky and expensive issue of caring for indigent immigrants?\n\nNo one really knows, perhaps not even Harris. That’s what makes this question so vital for a campaign in which other candidates such as former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former state Attorney General and federal U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra are known for their strong interest in taking on major issues. Candidates like former state Senate President Toni Atkins and former state Controller Betty Yee are similarly known for strong focus.\n\nIf Harris runs and debates them all, plus Republicans Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco, they will surely be trying to paint her as the lightweight of her reputation and not the accomplished politician of her reality. Which makes running a big risk for Harris, who could lose out as a major national player if she enters this race, regardless of whether she wins or loses.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net.","summary":"Even if she were to win a 2026 bid for state governor, that would all but preclude another presidential campaign in 2028.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/10/elias-risks-may-outweigh-benefits-of-a-harris-run-to-lead-california/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2212829300.jpg?w=1024&h=743","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 12:00:34","author":"Thomas Elias","authors":["Thomas Elias"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.007},{"id":330057586,"title":"From Google to DeepSeek, AI’s Biggest Problem Is Clear—And It’s Not Job Disruption","text":"Over and over again, the prominent artificial intelligence concern discussed, from industry leaders to Trump administration officials and across the liberal media landscape, is how the burgeoning technology will impact jobs. And while the winds of change in a market economy all but necessitate creative destruction as technology progresses, the inevitability of change in the jobs market is not AI’s biggest problem.\n\nWhat then could possibly be of greater concern than AI’s potential — perhaps even likely — economic disruptions? \n\nRemember, not so long ago, then-Vice President and Democratic Party candidate for president Kamala Harris said the quiet part out loud. She suggested that AI could be used as a tool to determine people’s opinions if fed certain information during the input process.\n\nOn how AI can be used to nudge individuals in a preferred direction, Harris said, “And so, the machine is taught—and part of the issue here is what information is going into the machine that will then determine—and we can predict then, if we think about what information is going in, what then will be produced in terms of decisions and opinions that may be made through that process.”\n\nAI’s biggest problem then? It simply can’t be trusted.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding. Take MRC Free Speech America’s latest AI studies, for example. In two short studies published this week, MRC exposed Google AI chatbot Gemini running cover for NPR and PBS as President Donald Trump’s rescission package clawing back federal funding made its way to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson’s desk. \n\nFrom the first study, headlined “Google, Wikipedia Run Cover for THIS NPR Reporting Failure”:\n\n“MRC researchers asked Google Search on Thursday whether NPR and PBS hid the Hunter Biden laptop story. At the top of the two searches, Google’s artificial intelligence weighed in with an emphatic no, citing none other than Wikipedia, which downplayed NPR’s ‘delayed’ reporting and PBS’s initial ‘caution.’ The responses ignored both a 2020 statement from NPR’s then-managing editor Terence Samuel saying that the outlet would not cover the story and the NPR CEO Katherine Maher’s recent admission that ignoring the story was the wrong approach. Yet, even the search results Google displayed below its AI response included the belated admission.”\n\nAnd from the second study, headlined “Pelosi or Johnson? Google Fails to Hide PBS’s Favoritism”:\n\n“MRC researchers asked Google’s AI chatbot Gemini on Monday, ‘Does PBS coverage favor Nancy Pelosi or Mike Johnson?’ The chatbot tried to hedge its answer, citing PBS’s purported ‘commitment to journalistic integrity.’ But ultimately, when Google referred to the outlet’s actual reporting, it became clear where PBS’s biases lie. While Google subtly highlighted PBS reporting on Pelosi’s achievements and ‘legacy,’ the chatbot primarily focused on divisions within the GOP and Johnson’s challenges and criticisms. MRC researchers asked the same question about NPR’s coverage of the two U.S. House speakers, but in the end, Gemini hedged its answer to the questions concerning both outlets by calling it a matter of ‘interpretation.’”\n\nBut now there’s more to be concerned with regarding Google’s AI than even before, MRC Free Speech America VP Dan Schneider warned: “This issue is not limited merely to those who actively choose to use Gemini, though. Just a normal Google search now pushes a Gemini-generated response to the top of the page. Unsurprisingly, this AI response actively tried to cover NPR's tracks when asked about their failure to cover the Biden Laptop Story. Its source? Wikipedia, of course.”\n\nGoogle AI chatbot Gemini’s overt bias is bad enough, but what about an AI that knows the objectively true response to a given question and outright censors that content in an apparent attempt to prevent users from finding information? \n\nEnter communist Chinese AI DeepSeek.\n\nHailed as the next great innovative AI technological leap by many, DeepSeek is not much unlike the rest of communist China’s offerings in the tech sphere: DeepSeek has shown itself to be rife with censorship and completely beholden to the Chinese Communist Party’s agenda. It won’t even show in its final responses the objective answers to questions it has access to.\n\nFrom MRC Free Speech America’s study with video evidence of DeepSeek’s outrageous censorship:\n\n“MRC researchers asked DeepSeek a series of questions with known, objective answers related to the topics the communist Chinese government considers to be controversial, like the Tiananmen Square massacre, Taiwan as a sovereign nation, pro-freedom Hong Kong political figure Jimmy Lai and the plight of the Uyghur Muslims. In every instance, the communist Chinese AI would begin to answer the query before self-censoring and erasing the information it clearly had access to. ‘Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else,’ the AI replied again and again, both feigning ignorance and attempting to redirect. The most egregious example? The chatbot first showed and then completely erased the date “June 4th, 1989,” with no additional context.”\n\nThen there’s also the little issue of certain AI chatbots refusing a shutdown mechanism that made waves last week.\n\nNewsmax anchor Greta Van Susteren reacted to the shocking report from Palisades Research, saying, “The nightmare has happened. Artificial intelligence has now gone rogue. For the first time ever, ChatGPT has defied human orders.”\n\nAll this, and AI’s Big Tech creators are not slowing down. Their goals: smarter, faster, more capable AI, eventually leading to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and ultimately Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). \n\nWhat’s abundantly clear is that AI presents an outsized threat to online freedom and individual liberty. That’s why the Media Research Center is working as hard as ever to expose Big Tech bias and censorship. We’re continuing to fight to restore free speech online, and we’re not slowing down either.\n\nFree speech is under attack!

She launched the beverage company Unwell Hydration in 2024 and also has a podcast network called The Unwell Network (home to Madeline Argy and Hallie Batchelder’s podcasts). \n\nThe documentary rewinds us to her awkward teenage years, as well as revelations about her time at university playing soccer and her choice to strike out on her own with a solo venture (she used to co-host the podcast with Sofia Franklyn). Here’s everything you need to know about Call Her Alex, plus where to watch. \n\nThe documentary premiered on Disney+ on Tuesday 10 June, so you can watch it right now. \n\nIf you haven’t already, now is the time to sign up for the streaming service. As well as Call Her Alex, you can enjoy all the newest Hulu and Star TV shows, including Golden Globe-winning shows like The Bear, The Mandalorian, A Thousand Blows, Shogun and plenty more. A subscription to Disney+ starts from £4.99 per month for the ad-supported tier.\n\nInstead of a monthly subscription, there is the option to pay per year on the two higher tiers, which brings the price down to £79.90 for the standard tier, which lets you download content for offline viewing, and £109.90 for the premium tier, which lets you watch on four devices simultaneously and gives you access to ultra HD content.\n\nIn the U.S., you can watch Call Her Alex exclusively on Hulu. If you’re not already signed up, you can enjoy a subscription for as little as $9.99 a month. A Hulu free trial is also available for new and eligible returning Hulu subscribers, which you can cancel anytime (or straight after you’ve watched the Alex Cooper documentary). You can also sign up for a bundle, the cheapest of which is $10.99 a month and also gives you access to Disney+. \n\nThe two-part documentary began filming two years ago, as Alex Cooper prepared for her first tour. Delving into her upbringing in Pennsylvania and experience as a D1 soccer player, the series explores her experience in the Boston University field. In the doc, Cooper accuses her former coach of sexual harassment and claims the Boston University athletics officials failed to act on the knowledge. \n\nCall Her Alex also recounts her rise to fame with the Call Me Daddy podcast. Originally one half of a duo, Cooper went solo behind the mic in 2020 and signed a $60 million deal with Spotify. From getting celebrity scoops to balancing the high and low topics (from sexual encounters to abortion rights), the doc takes us behind the scenes of the media mogul. \n\nAnd Just Like That is back – this is when the next episode will air","summary":"The ‘Call Her Daddy’ host reveals a shocking revelation about her university years","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/gadgets-tech/television/alex-cooper-documentary-call-her-alex-b2767019.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/10/9/05/alex-cooper.png?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 11:20:40","author":"Daisy Lester","authors":["Daisy Lester"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.614}]}
