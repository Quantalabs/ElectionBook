Emerson's data shows Behn winning the early vote, while Van Epps would dominate Election Day tomorrow – assuming voters turn out:\n\n“The special election in Tennessee’s 7th District will come down to what groups are motivated to turnout on election day, and who stays home,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said. “Those who report voting early break for Behn, 56% to 42%, whereas those who plan to vote on Election Day break for Van Epps, 51% to 39%. Voters under 40 are Behn’s strongest group, 64% of whom support her, while Van Epps’ vote increases with age, to 61% of those over 70.”\n\nIn other words, Van Epps needs a yuuuuge turnout tomorrow in TN-07. Only one Republican these days can drive that level of engagement, and yesterday he sent out a call to action on Truth Social. Trump encouraged voters to turn out in support of Van Epps, but also to oppose the opponent that \"hates Christianity\":\n\nTrump also made a virtual appearance this morning at a rally in Nashville. \"The whole world is watching,\" Trump declared, and urged his supporters to turn out as a demonstration of strength:\n\nDemocrats are framing the contest between Democrat Aftyn Behn and Republican Matt Van Epps as a referendum on Trump’s second term, as the president faces slumping poll numbers, particularly in his handling of the economy. Early voting ended Nov. 26 with more than 84,000 ballots already cast, and voting wraps up Tuesday evening.“The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they’re watching the district,” Trump said at a rally for Van Epps on Monday morning. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) was at the event and held his phone to the microphone so the crowd could hear the president.“It’s got to show that the Republican Party is stronger than it’s ever been,” Trump said, encouraging Republicans to get out and vote.\n\nIt took Trump a while to get personally engaged in the TN-07 race. The resignation of Greene two weeks ago certainly changed the calculus. Greene will leave the House on January 5th, and the soonest that Georgia can hold a special election for that seat will be in May. That will leave Speaker Mike Johnson short a vote while already holding a wafer-thin margin for control of the House. If Republicans lose the seat that Mark Green (no relation) held until July along with MTG's absence, Johnson will have a zero-seat margin of error for at least four months. \n\nThose four months will be critical for Trump's agenda. Republicans will have to pass the rest of the FY2026 budget and start working on a budget resolution for FY2027. They have begun discussing another reconciliation envelope in the next budget, perhaps to deal with health-care reforms for the first time since the 2017 attempt to repeal ObamaCare. \n\nThat may be why Trump's jumping into the race more forcefully now. The same Emerson poll shows his approval numbers flagging, and the WSJ notes that Republicans seemed gun-shy about setting this up as a referendum on Trump. Democrats had no such hesitation:\n\nAdvertisements in the race, including from outside groups like the conservative MAGA Inc. and Democratic-supporting House Majority PAC, show the challenges facing both parties.Republican-backed ads have avoided mentioning Trump but have instead focused on attacking Behn as too liberal. Democratic ads have focused on tying Van Epps to Trump and files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “The Epstein files are locked away. Matt Van Epps will keep ‘em that way,” one recent ad said, portraying Van Epps as a puppet.\n\nThat message turned out to have an expiration date. However, early voting began before Trump flipped positions on the House discharge petition, and this attack may have boosted Democrat turnout. Over 84,000 ballots have been cast in early voting, which ended on November 26. For comparison, TN-07 voters cast around 313,000 ballots a year ago in the presidential election, where Trump beat Kamala Harris by 22 points and Mark Green won 60/38 over his Democrat challenger. Given the low expectations for special elections, especially one right after the Thanksgiving holiday, Van Epps and Trump need a strong surge tomorrow to overcome what will likely be a healthy lead for Behn in those early-vote ballots.\n\nHence, Trump has used today to pull out all stops and to cast this as a mission for God and country, not to mention country music. The question will be whether this push – and the GOP's oppo-research reveals – came too late to overcome Democrats' head start in this special election. Let's hope TN-07 voters rescue country music tomorrow.","url":"https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2025/12/01/trump-to-tennessee-voters-last-chance-for-god-and-country-music-n3809417","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/328/8ecc0fb2-a865-4f5b-a6b5-90c1816559d9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 23:40:00","author":"Ed Morrissey","authors":["Ed Morrissey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.093},{"id":384072948,"title":"\"Monster responsible\" for National Guard shooting will face \"most severe punishment\": US","text":"Washington DC [US], December 2 (ANI): The US has said that the \"monster responsible\" for the killing of a National Guard member in a shooting near White House will face \"the most severe punishment.\"An Afghan national on Wednesday shot at two National Guard members near the White House, killing Spec.

Gavin Newsom has an advantage with liberal Hollywood in his home state, and a new report shows he could be winning the early battle for the deep pockets of Tinseltown ahead of the 2028 Democratic primary. \"He’s a fighter, that’s what we need!\" a top-tier producer described as a \"reliable Dem ATM over the decades\" told Deadline. \"I just wish more Democrats, like [Chuck] Schumer and the leadership (in Congress), would emulate him, not take any s--- from Trump.\" Newsom has won plaudits on the left for his more pugnacious style toward President Donald Trump, trolling him on social media while also embracing new media platforms like podcasts and Substack. He also earned some love in progressive Hollywood for his fight for Prop 50, the amendment Californians passed easily last month that gerrymandered districts in favor of Democrats to offset Republican efforts in Texas. TRUMP-TROLLING GOV GAVIN NEWSOM SUGGESTS 'COIN' IS COMING TO ONLINE STORE: 'TRUMP CORRUPTION COIN' \"Donald Trump poked the bear.

The two-term governor said in October he would consider running for the presidency after the 2026 midterms. Newsom's even been praised by HBO's Bill Maher, who is never shy about criticizing Democrats he considers too far to the left. Former Obama U.S. Ambassador to Spain and HBO executive James Costos said Newsom had \"strong enthusiasm\" from Los Angeles donors. GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARED AS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S 2028 'FRONTRUNNER' BY POLITICO \"Big checks are being written,\" he told Deadline. \"It was a slow build early on as we recovered from the loss [last] November, but there has been momentum building, No Kings events, legal wins, the [Jimmy] Kimmel effect, resistance growing and it’s turning into clear ways to fight back against the administration’s overreach and organize to win in 2026 and 2028.\" Another \"big donor producer\" told Deadline that \"anyone who really matters\" wants to be sure to be on the Newsom train if and when it takes off. TRUMP FORCES INDIANA GOP INTO REDISTRICTING REVERSAL IN RACE TO DRAW NEW MAGA MAP Others quoted in the report expressed caveats about Newsom, noting it's still quite early in the 2028 primary process and some donors may be biding their time waiting for the best candidate.

In anticipation, Trump has been urging Republican-controlled states to help preserve his influence beyond the upcoming elections, aiming to avoid ending his term as a political lame duck or facing another impeachment trial.\n\nBohacek released a statement on Friday expressing his opposition to Trump, motivated not by political differences but by personal conviction.\n\nThe Indiana senator condemned Trump’s recent comments, which included derogatory language directed at Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who is Kamala Harris’s running mate for 2024. Trump criticized Walz’s handling of immigration issues involving Somalia and other nations, using a slur for individuals with intellectual disabilities.\n\nWalz is also a father to his son Gus who has a non-verbal learning disorder, as well as anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\n‘This is not the first time our president has used these insulting and derogatory references and his choices of words have consequences. I will be voting NO on redistricting, perhaps he can use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority,’ Bohacek wrote in a Facebook post in which he also explained that he is a father to a daughter with Down syndrome.\n\nWhile running for president in 2016, Trump was famously accused of mocking a disabled New York Times journalist.\n\nThe Indiana Senate is scheduled to vote on its proposed congressional district maps as soon as next Monday, December 8th.\n\nBohacek’s protest vote may not be consequential in the long run. Out of 50 seats in the Indiana Senate, 40 are held by Republicans.\n\nMaps must also be first passed in the Indiana House, where they have been initially introduced. Republicans hold 70 of 100 seats in the lower chamber. \n\nIndiana State Representative Kyle Pierce exclusively told the Daily Mail that he feels ‘the likelihood is high that we will pass these maps.’\n\n‘Nothing is sure until it is passed, but the Indiana House has the votes, and I believe the Senate does as well,’ Pierce added.\n\nCongressman Marlin Stutzman, a conservative Republican who represents parts of Northeast Indiana in a district that went for Donald Trump with 65 percent of the vote in 2024 told the Daily Mail that ‘redrawing Indiana maps is essential if Republicans are going to answer Democratic gerrymandering that has happened for decades.’\n\n‘Conservative Hoosiers and Republicans across the nation are relieved that the Indiana Senate will be voting on these new maps. Now is the time for the Senate to unify behind redistricting so we can defend our country from Democratic Socialists,’ Stutzman added.\n\nHowever, not all in Indiana are thrilled about the proposed changes.\n\nProponents took the statehouse in Indianapolis on Monday to urge their representatives to reject the mid-decade redistricting push.\n\nThe looming vote in Indiana comes as courts have halted redistricting efforts in Texas, and as California voters approved a plan to gerrymander the state’s congressional seats in a ballot measure, Proposition 50, during last month’s off-year election.\n\nCalifornians approved Proposition 50, the ‘Election Rigging Response Act,’ which temporarily allows Democrats to gerrymander the state to offset possible Republican gains in the Lone Star State.\n\nProposition 50 is the brainchild of California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom and would take the power of redrawing the map away from the bipartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission until 2030 and return it to the state legislature, which is controlled by the Democrats.\n\nThe Texas legislature approved a plan that would eliminate five Democratic seats in the state, but the proposal was struck down by a federal court last month when a three-judge panel ruled that ‘substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.’\n\nThe proposed map now sits before the Supreme Court of the United States.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump&#8217;s latest strategic maneuver faces potential opposition from within his own&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Controversial Remark About Tim Walz Loses Key Republican Support first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trumps-controversial-remark-about-tim-walz-loses-key-republican-support/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trumps-R-word-slur-against-Tim-Walz-costs-crucial-Republican-vote.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 22:58:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":384072946,"title":"How a deep red Tennessee House district turned into a political battleground","text":"At a get-out-the-vote rally in Nashville Monday morning for Republican congressional candidate Matt Van Epps, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson dialed in President Donald Trump to say a few words.\n\n\"The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching the district,\" Trump said.\n\nThis isn't the first time the president has gotten involved in the race for Tennessee's 7th Congressional District. Trump called in to another rally for Van Epps last month, in which he referred to Van Epps' Democratic opponent, Tennessee state Rep. Aftyn Behn, as the “AOC of Tennessee,\" invoking another young, female politician who ran an insurgent campaign from the left, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAsked if she considered the president's nickname for her an insult, Behn, 36, laughed.\n\n\"You know, she represents a very different district than I do,\" Behn said of Ocasio-Cortez. \"But, we have been both organizing to make life more affordable for our constituents, and so if that's what that means, then that's what that means.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to headline another tele-rally for Van Epps Monday evening; meanwhile, a tele-rally for Behn will be held at the same time -- featuring none-other than Ocasio-Cortez herself.\n\nThe special election to replace the outgoing Republican Rep. Mark Green has garnered national attention, as Democrats push to frame the tightening race as evidence of an oncoming \"blue wave\" in the 2026 midterms, and Republicans flood the deep red district with money to avoid a symbolic victory for the Democrats.\n\nThe election should be a slam dunk for any Republican candidate -- Trump won the district last year by 22 points -- but recent polls have Behn within striking distance of Van Epps.\n\n\"Our message of affordability is really resonating across the district,\" Behn told ABC News in an interview.\n\n\"Momentum is on our side, on the heels of the Democratic candidates winning earlier this month,\" Behn added, in a nod to this year's Democratic victories in places such as Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nBut unlike those states, the congressional district Behn is running in skews heavily conservative: a Democrat hasn't been elected to represent the district in Congress in more than 40 years.\n\n\"The Democrats have some enthusiasm that they think is gonna translate into Tennessee,\" Tennessee Republican Party Chair Scott Golden said of the national fervor around the race. \"Of course, you know, we're still Tennessee. We're still pretty red.\"\n\nTennessee's 7th Congressional District is heavily rural, stretching from Tennessee's northern border with Kentucky to the state's southern border with Arkansas. The district includes parts of liberal Nashville, where national figures such as former Vice President Kamala Harris and Johnson have traveled to stump for their respective candidates.\n\nIn order to stave off Democratic momentum, Republicans are seeking to paint Behn as too \"radical\" in a district Trump won by a landslide.\n\nIn a statement, Van Epps told ABC News that \"Tennesseans are fired up to stop radical Aftyn Behn on Tuesday, December 2nd.\" The Van Epps campaign declined a request for an interview.\n\nBehn says Republicans are attacking her because \"they don't have a plan to make health care more affordable.\"\n\nRepublicans are also highlighting Behn's 2020 comments on defunding the police when, in a June 2020 social media post, she asked a Nashville city councilman for a proposal to \"dissolve\" Nashville’s police department.\n\nBehn told ABC News \"that was a moment in time.\"\n\nOutside dollars have flooded into the race on both sides of the aisle to the tune of millions, with Republicans outspending Democrats. Golden says part of the reason this special election has become such a national battleground has to do with the historically tight margins in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"We have a very close, divided Congress. There's one seat in play. It's the last election of 2025. So, I sort of have been saying all along that this was going to be the final showdown of the year,\" Golden said.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see national attention devoted to a race like this,\" said Behn.\n\nBehn has also gained attention for the way she has been able to galvanize young voters in the Nashville area.\n\n\"A lot of us see it as an opportunity to finally get a seat at the table,\" said Trent Benge, the president of the Tennessee Young Democrats.\n\nRaeAnna Morales, a junior at Vanderbilt and member of the Vanderbilt College Republicans, said that Tuesday's special election has been the \"big talk\" on campus.\n\nMorales expressed concern about past comments of Behn’s that recently resurfaced, in which Behn says that she “hates” Nashville.\n\n\"I hate the city. I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music. I hate all the things that make Nashville apparently an 'it' city, to the rest of the country,\" Behn said on a podcast in 2020.\n\n\"Nashville is known to be fun for young college students and lively, and there's always concerts going on and events. So I think Matt Van Epps really reflects a love for Nashville,\" Morales said of Behn’s comments.\n\nWhen asked about the comments on CNN over the weekend, Behn said, \"Nashville is my home. Do I roll my eyes at the bachelorette parties and the pedal taverns that are blocking my access to my house? Yeah, every Nashvillian does. But this race has always been about something bigger.\"\n\nTurnout is going to be vital on Tuesday, when a special election following Thanksgiving weekend is one of the last things on voters' minds. More than 80,000 Tennesseans cast their votes in the early-voting period, with many more expected to come out on Election Day.\n\n\"We haven't had a special election in the state of Tennessee in 40+ years,\" Golden said. \"So nobody is really sure how many people will be coming out and voting.\"","summary":"Tuesday marks the special election for Tennessee's 7th congressional district.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/deep-red-tennessee-house-district-turned-political-battleground/story?id=128001509","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8f12b8d9-e90d-4e98-b31c-c4a5448e97e9/tennessee-ap-er-251201_1764611932775_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 22:03:10","author":"Halle Troadec","authors":["Halle Troadec"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.112},{"id":384057672,"title":"Trump's R-word slur against Tim Walz costs a crucial GOP vote that could tip DC balance of power","text":"Donald Trump's latest power play may be derailed by a member of his own political party in a vote planned to take place over 500 miles away from Washington, DC. \n\nIndiana State Senator Michael Bohacek, a Republican from the Hoosier State, has pledged to vote against a draft congressional map that would see two Democratic seats eliminated because of the president's inflammatory rhetoric. \n\nThe proposed map comes as part of a redistricting effort aimed at keeping a GOP majority in Washington, DC, after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nAs midterm elections typically result in the president's political party losing seats, Trump has pressured Republican-led states to assist him in keeping power after next November's elections, and not spend his last two years in office as a lame duck, or worse, going through another impeachment trial.\n\nBohacek issued a statement Friday opposing the president not for political reasons, but for one that was more personal.\n\nThe Indiana state senator rebuked Trump's recent rhetoric after the president called Minnesota Gov.

Republicans hold 70 of 100 seats in the lower chamber. \n\nIndiana State Representative Kyle Pierce exclusively told the Daily Mail that he feels 'the likelihood is high that we will pass these maps.'\n\n'Nothing is sure until it is passed, but the Indiana House has the votes, and I believe the Senate does as well,' Pierce added.\n\nCongressman Marlin Stutzman, a conservative Republican who represents parts of Northeast Indiana in a district that went for Donald Trump with 65 percent of the vote in 2024 told the Daily Mail that 'redrawing Indiana maps is essential if Republicans are going to answer Democratic gerrymandering that has happened for decades.'\n\n'Conservative Hoosiers and Republicans across the nation are relieved that the Indiana Senate will be voting on these new maps. Now is the time for the Senate to unify behind redistricting so we can defend our country from Democratic Socialists,' Stutzman added.\n\nHowever, not all in Indiana are thrilled about the proposed changes.\n\nProponents took the statehouse in Indianapolis on Monday to urge their representatives to reject the mid-decade redistricting push.\n\nThe looming vote in Indiana comes as courts have halted redistricting efforts in Texas, and as California voters approved a plan to gerrymander the state's congressional seats in a ballot measure, Proposition 50, during last month's off-year election.\n\nCalifornians approved Proposition 50, the 'Election Rigging Response Act,' which temporarily allows Democrats to gerrymander the state to offset possible Republican gains in the Lone Star State.\n\nProposition 50 is the brainchild of California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom and would take the power of redrawing the map away from the bipartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission until 2030 and return it to the state legislature, which is controlled by the Democrats.\n\nThe Texas legislature approved a plan that would eliminate five Democratic seats in the state, but the proposal was struck down by a federal court last month when a three-judge panel ruled that 'substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.'\n\nThe proposed map now sits before the Supreme Court of the United States.","summary":"Trump's latest power play may be derailed by a member of his own political party, in a vote planned to take place over 500 miles away from Washington, DC.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15341929/Trumps-R-word-slur-against-Tim-Walz-spectacularly-backfires-anguished-GOP-dad-breaks-ranks-crucial-vote.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/01/19/104346995-0-image-m-19_1764618631425.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2015/11/26/3789125835597527956/1024x576_3789125835597527956.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-01 22:02:31","author":"Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":384064568,"title":"Trump rallies Tennessee GOP by speakerphone on eve of US House special election","text":"FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) — President Donald Trump and top Republicans made a last-ditch push on Monday to prevent embarrassment in a hotly contested Tennessee special election for Congress, while Democrats enlisted former Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to back their candidate. \n\nThe crush of big-name politicians came as Trump hopes to rebound from recent Republican losses around the country as Tennessee voters choose the next representative for the reliably conservative 7th U.S. House Congressional District on Tuesday. Democrats want a strong showing that could propel them in next year’s midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, who is trying to protect his party’s narrow majority, dialed up Trump while speaking at a rally for Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate. As Johnson held his phone to the mic, Trump told the crowd inside a decked-out garage on a supporter’s sprawling farm in Franklin to “make it a sweeping victory.”\n\n“The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they’re watching your district,” the president said. “It’s a big vote and it’s gonna show something. And it’s gonna show that the Republican Party is stronger than it’s ever been.”\n\nRepublican Party Chairman Joe Gruters, Gov. Bill Lee, and Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty also turned out for Van Epps, who previously served as an Army helicopter pilot and as a state general services commissioner. He faces Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn.\n\nRepublicans have expressed concerns about turnout because early voting went into Thanksgiving week and Election Day follows the holiday weekend.\n\nTrump held a virtual rally in November with Van Epps. The president scheduled another call for him later Monday.\n\nBehn, a self-proclaimed “pissed-off social worker” and progressive community organizer from Nashville, was sprinting through her own day of campaign stops, leading to the evening’s planned online rally with Gore, a Tennessee native, and Ocasio-Cortez of New York. \n\nBehn was described by some state Democrats as “our very own AOC of TN,” a nickname that Republicans have harnessed to deride Behn as too far left for the district. \n\nBut Behn has said the virtual rally shows the range of her support. Former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared in Nashville to rally voters last month while on a book tour, and national party chair Ken Martin visited as well. \n\nThe 7th District is one of three seats redrawn in 2022 to erode the influence of Nashville, the state’s largest city and a Democratic stronghold. Only about 1 in 5 of the 14-county district’s registered voters are in Nashville. Last year, the district went to former GOP Rep. Mark Green by 21 percentage points and to Trump by a similar margin.\n\nBehn has condemned Trump’s tariffs and tax cut legislation, both of which Van Epps supports.\n\nRepublicans have tried to turn Behn’s own words against her in television advertising, such as when she described herself as a “radical” or claimed to be “bullying” immigration agents and state police officers. A frequent target are comments Behn made about Nashville years ago, when she said “I hate this city” and complained about annoyances like bachelorette parties.\n\nFor the most part, Behn has answered questions about those remarks by redirecting to cost-of-living issues. But she has responded specifically about Nashville, saying she wants it “to be a place where working people can thrive” even if she gets annoyed at some tourist draws.\n\n“The barrage of negative attacks is a result of the fact that they don’t have a plan to address the rising cost of health care,” Behn said at a campaign event Monday.\n\nJalen Smalls, a Behn voter, said his primary concern is getting people’s basic needs met, such as funding for schools, feeding children, supporting hospitals and maintaining roads.\n\n“Those are the bare minimum of what people need in order to thrive, not just survive,” Smalls said.\n\nJohn Rowenczak, meanwhile, said he is voting for Van Epps because he is concerned that the country is becoming too liberal. He said his primary concern is illegal immigration.\n\n“I feel like Trump is doing a good job, and that’s kind of the way we need to go,” he said. “We want to continue the Trump agenda in this district.”\n\nThe House Majority PAC has put $1 million behind Behn. Van Epps has been backed by more than $1 million from the Trump-supporting MAGA Inc. super PAC.\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries predicted an unexpectedly close race, which he called “shocking in deep-red Tennessee.”\n\n“Republicans have already lost,” Jeffries said Monday. “The fact that they are spending millions of dollars to hold a seat that Donald Trump just won by 22 points is extraordinary.”\n\nMattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-special-election-house-trump-db4477a0149cfa139a11ee13a7a01018","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/27251ef/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F62%2F7a%2F8f6816bb93f4e9d1793e94224ff6%2F712ad5ce7b854068855a875ae922b8aa","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 21:56:09","author":"Jonathan Mattise,Kristin Hall","authors":["Jonathan Mattise","Kristin Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":384075574,"title":"WATCH: Trump and Leavitt go scorched earth on Tim Walz for transforming Minnesota into Somalia","text":"Both President Donald Trump and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt went scorched earth Monday on Minnesota Gov.

The sheer magnitude of the fraud begs the question: Was Walz disastrously incompetent or criminally complicit?”\n\nSimilarly, the RNC said Walz suppressed the information when it was brought to his attention by Minnesota government employees and accused him of using intimidation tactics to silence the whistleblowers.\n\n“This is yet another reminder of why Americans overwhelmingly rejected Tim Walz,” the RNC said. “Under his watch, Minnesota became ground zero for massive fraud. Instead of fixing it, Walz retaliated against the very whistleblowers who tried to stop it using intimidation, cover-ups, and excuses. Even Kamala Harris and the DNC were warned about Walz’s incompetence and did nothing.”\n\nThe White House reacted to the alleged fraud, accusing Democratic leadership of allowing the asylum-seekers to defraud taxpayers.\n\n“Another scheme involved hundreds of organizations, who were reimbursed for services that were supposed to help people at risk of homelessness.

The site also features a “Hall of Shame” highlighting major media outlets, including CNN, MS Now (formerly known as MSNBC), The Washington Post and CBS News, posing accusations of biased or false reporting. \n\n“The Trump @WhiteHouse is holding the Fake News accountable like never before,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X as she announced the tracker on Friday.\n\nThe move is the latest tactic in President Donald Trump’s ongoing fight against mainstream news outlets he has repeatedly referred to as “fake news.” The launch also comes as Trump remains under scrutiny for his treatment of female journalists after telling a Bloomberg reporter, “Quiet. Quiet, piggy,” after she tried to ask a question about the Jeffrey Epstein files earlier this month.\n\nFollows Trump’s controversial remarks to reporters\n\nLast week, Trump called CBS News White House correspondent Nancy Cordes a “stupid person” after she asked a question about why he blamed the Biden administration for the shooting of two U.S. National Guard members in Washington, D.C. She noted that the Department of Justice had found that the suspect, along with other Afghans who fled after the fall of Kabul in 2021, had been thoroughly vetted before entering the U.S.\n\n“Because they let him in. Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person?” Trump responded. “Because they came in on a plane, along with thousands of other people that shouldn’t be here, and you’re just asking questions because you’re a stupid person.”\n\nHe also lashed out at Katie Rogers, a New York Times correspondent who co-authored a critical piece on Trump’s physical stamina in his second term. In a Truth Social post, Trump called Rogers a “third-rate reporter” and “ugly, both inside and out.”\n\nConcerns among free speech advocates and journalists\n\nThe tracker is raising concerns among those who argue that it is just the latest attack on freedom of the press by the Trump administration, and have panned it as a political “stunt.”\n\n“People understand the obvious conflict inherent in a presidential administration appointing itself as the arbiter of media bias, and I expect that after the initial wave of publicity, few Americans will be paying attention to this latest stunt,” Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told The Washington Post. “The gimmick is wearing thin,” he added. \n\nSome prominent media personalities have said the latest effort adds to the damage already done to the media industry through Trump’s lawsuit against several news outlets.\n\n“I think Donald Trump has cracked the code on how to hurt the press in this country with these lawsuits that have been settled,” former CNN anchor Jim Acosta told MS Now on Saturday. “It’s done terrible damage to the industry, I think, by and large when he puts that kind of stuff up on the White House website.”\n\nA spokesperson for The Post responded to the targeted effort by the Trump administration, saying that it “is proud of its accurate and rigorous journalism.”\n\nWhat’s on the website?\n\nThe website has a number of sections that categorize news coverage under sections such as “Bias, “Lie,” “Malpractice” and “Left-wing lunacy.”\n\nThis week’s focus is on coverage of the president’s response to a video featuring six Democratic members of Congress, including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who called on service members to refuse illegal orders from the Trump administration. The president responded to the video on Truth Social, writing that the message from Democrats was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” and shared a comment stating “HANG THEM.”\n\nThe Pentagon recently announced it may recall Kelly, a retired Navy captain, to active duty to face a court martial related to the video.\n\nThe White House contends on its new website that some news outlets misrepresented Trump’s posts as calling for the deaths of the six Democrats. The Trump administration argues that instead the president had been calling for accountability for what he considered to be a message that encouraged insubordination among members of the military, while claiming “President Trump has never issued an illegal order.”\n\nThe tracker calls out a number of “repeat offenders,” which include The New York Times, The Associated Press, Politico, Axios, The HIll and ABC News. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal is featured on the website’s “leaderboard” as Trump’s $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the media outlet plays out over a July article that reported Trump sent a “bawdy” letter and drawing to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. The president claims that the report is “fake, malicious and defamatory.” The Journal has defended its reporting.\n\nCBS News listed despite recent praise from Trump\n\nCBS News is significantly featured despite the president’s recent complimentary remarks about new leadership at the network and its parent company, including owner David Ellison and Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief for the news outlet. \n\nTrump described Weiss as a “great person” and commended the changes she’s made at CBS News. His remarks came in a recent “60 Minutes” interview, marking his first interview with the network after he received a $16 million settlement over the editing of an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race. \n\nThe post White House ‘Media Offender’ website escalates Trump’s attacks on journalists appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2025/12/01/white-house-media-offender-website-escalates-trumps-attacks-on-journalists/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2247075984_Getty_Images_clean-M1NSMt.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 20:19:11","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":384049868,"title":"Yet another red state weighs passing an extreme gerrymander","text":"Republicans in the Indiana state House on Monday introduced a new congressional district map that seeks to oust the two Democrats in the state's nine-member delegation, heeding President Donald Trump’s demand that state Republicans help him rig the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe map carves up to turn what is currently a 7-2 map in favor of Republicans to a 9-0 map in favor of the GOP.

Hernandez was convicted on drug trafficking and weapons charges in New York in 2024. He even once allegedly bragged, “We are going to stuff the drugs up the gringos’ noses, and they’re never even going to know it.” (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nTrump told reporters Sunday that he was pardoning Hernandez because he was unfairly targeted by the Biden administration.\n\n“Well, I was told — I was asked by Honduras, many of the people of Honduras, they said it was a Biden setup,” the president said aboard Air Force One. “He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country, and they said it was a Biden administration setup. And I looked at the facts, and I agreed with that.”\n\nSomething of note: the prosecution of Hernandez actually began under the first Trump administration, and concluded under Biden’s.\n\nTrump also suggested on TruthSocial the day of the announcement that Hernandez was “treated very harshly and unfairly” by the Biden administration, according to many people” that the president “greatly respect[s].”\n\nSo, who might these “many people” be, and why would they lobby Trump to pardon Hernandez?\n\nThe answer may lie in Hernandez’s previous support for tech-friendly development laws that had the backing of several American investors with ties to the current Trump administration. (RELATED: The Trojan Horse That Snuck Through MAGA’s Gates)\n\nIn 2013, the Honduran government passed a law that allowed corporations to set up Zones for Employment and Economic Development, also known as ZEDEs, within the country. Inside these zones, entire for-profit city-states could be built with their own laws, regulations, schools, and police forces, according to a 2022 report from Rest of World, a nonprofit publication that focuses on global tech stories. ZEDEs were “heavily pushed” by Hernandez during his time in office as a means to spur economic development, Rest of World noted.\n\nOne such ZEDE city-state, Próspera, attracted global investors with the promise of a coastal libertarian haven that offered low taxes and regulations conducive to the cryptocurrency industry. The zone even made Bitcoin an official currency. Próspera’s financial backers included prominent figures such as Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, who were involved through Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects aimed at creating autonomous cities.\n\nBoth Thiel and Andreessen have very close ties to the Trump administration, with Thiel having backed Vice President J.D. Vance’s Senate campaign in 2022. Andreessen has significantly benefited from his support of Trump’s campaign in 2025, and following the election, federal investigations targeting multiple companies backed by his venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, were reportedly dropped. Palantir, a company Thiel co-founded, has drastically expanded its work with the Trump administration.\n\nThe Honduran National Congress eventually repealed the ZEDE law in April 2022 after widespread backlash among local Hondurans. Próspera still exists, however it is embroiled in a legal fight with the government, which wants it gone.\n\nIn a telling quote to Rest of World, Thibault Serlet, who leads research at the Adrianople Group, a consultancy focused on special economic zones, said that investments in Próspera are not driven by profit expectations. According to Serlet, the primary motivation for these investors is an ideological alignment; many are libertarians eager to replicate Próspera’s model in their own nations.\n\nWhich leads us back to Trump’s pardon. Is there any evidence to suggest that the Biden administration unfairly treated Hernandez? I don’t think so, and the evidence against him was overwhelming. Or, was this purely an ideologically driven pardon, lobbied for and pushed through thanks to the tech and crypto bros, such as AI czar David Sacks, buzzing around the White House? Just as Próspera was about ideology over profit, the Hernandez pardon may be all politics and no justice.\n\nFrom a humble vantage point, it seems that the tech bros wanted to flex their power and influence within the Trump White House, and deliver a giant middle finger to Biden World, Kamala Harris, and other Democrats who fought for more stringent crypto regulation over the past several years. You also have to wonder how much influence the tech bros played in getting Trump to pardon convicted crypto billionaire Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering after he was prosecuted by the Biden Department of Justice.\n\nTrump even admitted in an interview after Zhao’s pardon, “I don’t know who he is.”\n\nThe tech bros in the White House, though, certainly do.\n\nSign up for John Loftus’s weekly newsletter here!

TIM WALZ FIRES BACK AT TRUMP ACCUSATION OF 'INCOMPETENCE,' DODGES ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FRAUD IN MINNESOTA The former vice president chose Walz, a two-term Minnesota governor and former U.S. congressman, as her running mate in August 2024. A post from the group on X in September 2024 replied directly to Harris’ account, explaining that Walz has \"caused incredible harm to our state & agencies, [and] retaliated against whistleblowers against fraud.\" Minnesota is currently at the center of a widening fraud scandal as federal prosecutors continue to unravel scandals, including one of the nation’s largest COVID-era fraud cases. MINNESOTA GOVERNMENT WORKERS BLAME WALZ FOR 'MASSIVE FRAUD' AMID ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SOMALI COMMUNITY The Justice Department announced new charges last week against the 78th defendant in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme, which prosecutors say involved more than $300 million in stolen funds from a federally-funded child nutrition program and has already resulted in over 50 convictions. Many of the individuals charged come from Minnesota’s Somali community. The New York Times reported that what initially appeared to many Minnesotans as an isolated case of pandemic-era fraud has broadened into a much wider concern for state and federal officials. TRUMP RIPS FORMER VP CANDIDATE ON IMMIGRATION: ‘TIM WALZ DOES NOTHING, THROUGH FEAR, INCOMPETENCE, OR BOTH’ The Times reported that over the past five years, according to law enforcement authorities, several fraud schemes proliferated in parts of Minnesota’s Somali community.

Her campaign has gained traction in recent days, drawing national attention and a direct attack from Trump, who used his Truth Social platform Sunday to promote Republican Matt Van Epps and disparage Behn.\n\nIn his post, Trump accused Behn of being a radical who “hates Christianity, will take away your guns, wants Open Borders, Transgender for everybody, men in women’s sports, and openly disdains Country music.” He added, “She said all of these things precisely, and without question — IT’S ON TAPE!”\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate and state lawmaker Aftyn Behn greets supporters during a campaign event in the special election for the 7th Congressional District on Saturday, November 29, 2025, in Nashville. (AP Photo/George Walker IV)\n\nBehn rejected the accusations, pointing to her record and community involvement. “These comments were mischaracterized and taken out of context,” she said, referring to remarks she made years earlier about Nashville. “It was a time when I was discussing why I decided to get involved in local elections… I’m a state representative that represents downtown Nashville, and I couldn’t think of a greater honor than representing the city that I love.”\n\nAgainst the Odds\n\nWhile the district has leaned red for more than a decade, Behn says economic discontent and frustration with GOP leadership has energized her campaign.\n\n“We had a day of action that featured over 600 volunteers knocking over 13,000 doors,” she said. “The momentum is on our side.”\n\nThough Trump endorsed Van Epps, he has not actively campaigned in the state.\n\n“Nothing really shocks me anymore in the year 2025,” Behn said. “But I will say that Trump and his billionaire friends are spending millions of dollars in a race that they should have won handily.”\n\nThe 7th District’s political landscape shifted after Tennessee Republicans redrew the state’s congressional maps in 2022, dividing Nashville’s Democratic-leaning Davidson County into three Republican-friendly districts.\n\nRepublican Representative Mark Green, the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, prepares before the start of a at the U.S. Capitol on January 10, 2024, in Washington, D.C.. \n\nFormer Representative Mark Green won under both the old and new boundaries. Before redistricting, he received between 67 and 70 percent of the vote. After the changes, his margin narrowed to 60 percent in both 2022 and 2024.\n\nTrump also won the district in 2024 with 60 percent of the vote, compared to 38 percent for then Vice President Kamala Harris. In the Davidson County portion, Harris received nearly 68 percent, accounting for about 22 percent of total ballots cast. Trump carried each of the other 13 counties with at least 59 percent.\n\nBehn believes the race is not a referendum on Trump, but rather a reflection of voter frustration over rising costs and economic strain.\n\n“If you are upset about the cost of living and the chaos of Washington, then I’m your candidate and we welcome you with open arms,” she said.\n\nShe also stressed the importance of Black voter turnout.\n\n“If I win tomorrow,” she said, “it will be due to Black voters turning out across the district—and what a message to send to Washington.”\n\nDespite the upstart campaign, political analysts have suggested Van Epps will win the election.\n\nThe Cook Political Report classifies the race as “Likely Republican.” Sabato’s Crystal Ball rated the race as “Likely Republican” and Inside Elections classifies the seat as “lean Republican.”\n\nTuesday’s election is the fifth special contest this year to fill a vacant U.S. House seat. Another will be decided in a January 31 runoff in a Democratic district near Houston. A vacancy in northern New Jersey, formerly held by Democratic Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, will be filled in April.\n\nRepublicans currently hold a narrow 219-213 majority in the lower chamber.","summary":"In the final hours before Tennessee’s high-stakes special congressional election, Behn is pushing back against Trump’s attacks.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrat-aftyn-behn-responds-to-trump-accusation-she-hates-christianity-11136577","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25333714239530.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 17:54:05","author":"Jesus Mesa,Leonardo Feldman","authors":["Jesus Mesa","Leonardo Feldman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":384013584,"title":"Scott Jennings Excoriates ‘Total Clown’ Gavin Newsom’s Presidential Prospects","text":"Republican strategist Scott Jennings said he was unconcerned about Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s presidential viability during a Manhattan Institute talk posted on Tuesday.\n\nNewsom led among likely Democratic 2028 contenders with 21% support among registered voters who were Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll conducted from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. However, when an audience member asked Jennings where Newsom was on his “radar” during the talk posted to the Manhattan Institute’s YouTube channel, the strategist replied, “Somewhere between Chuckles and Bozo on my clown scale.” (RELATED: ‘He B*tches On The Internet’: Anna Paulina Luna Says Gavin Newsom Has Feminine Energy)\n\n“I mean, one of the least serious national people out there, a complete and total clown. And now, their are Democrats, so they oftentimes nominate complete and total clowns,” Jennings said. “So I guess I shouldn’t discount it totally, but he is so inauthentic … authenticity is really the only thing that matters right now in politics and media. [President Donald] Trump has changed everything. These people who exude inauthenticity fail almost every time. [Former Vice President Kamala] Harris was the most recent example.”\n\n“She could not exist in a world that demanded authenticity. I view him that way. And so I don’t see it. I’m not a Democrat, so maybe I can’t see it. But I think that if you want to turn the rest of the country into California, that’s a choice,” he added. “But I think most Americans wouldn’t regard that as a good choice. And so I don’t personally see it. But I guess we’ll see what they want to do. But I think he is in politics for literally all the wrong reasons. And I think people kind of sense it.”\n\nNewsom announced on CBS News’ “Sunday Morning” in October that he would weigh a potential bid for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2028 following the 2026 midterms. He has faced backlash from California voters for years over his policies, including those on crime and homelessness.\n\nThe governor also received pushback from his own party after asserting on his “This Is Gavin Newsom” podcast in March that biological men competing in women’s sports is “deeply unfair.”\n\nAn April Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found that 54% of 6,201 registered voters believed Newsom was “doing things that might benefit him as a possible candidate for president,” while just 26% thought he was “governing the state and helping to solve its problems.” An October Emerson College poll found that, in a hypothetical matchup between Newsom and Vice President JD Vance, 46% supported Vance, 45% backed Newsom, and 10% remained undecided.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

On the right, MAGA populists and influencers are warning about the potential hazards of unrestricted AI development as President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and their administration have pushed for minimal regulations in the name of beating China to potential society-altering advancements. On the left, progressives are fighting against potential AI-fueled job losses and a further consolidation of financial power by Big Tech as center-left Democrats weigh the unknown downsides of technological advancement with major investments in their states and a need to stay competitive in a rapidly changing global economy. Potential 2028 presidential contenders — from Vance and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley on the right, to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the left — are all carving out unique lanes on the issue, creating some unusual bedfellows. Ocasio-Cortez is among the potential 2028 candidates who have highlighted growing concerns in recent weeks. Last month, she raised the potential for a market downturn fueled by what some are calling an AI bubble, warning at a congressional hearing of “2008-style threats to economic stability.” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in September that he fears “our democracy and many others could frankly collapse under the weight of both the economic and the spiritual impacts of advanced AI.” And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis noted at the Florida Rural Economic Development Summit last month that AI could undercut white-collar jobs. “I don’t think that’s a good thing,” he said, adding, “It’s one of the reasons why I don’t think we should be subsidizing it. Why would we subsidize something that could potentially cause problems for folks?” Meanwhile, some of the Democratic governors who are on the shortlist of 2028 contenders have taken a different approach. Newsom, who has embraced the use of AI-generated imagery in his monthslong effort to troll Trump and governs the state that’s home to Silicon Valley, has signed several AI regulations into law while vetoing others. He’s called for balancing the need for regulation with “ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive.” Others, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who align with the party’s center-left wing, have hailed AI and data center investments in their states. “We are already all in on AI,” Shapiro said in June, announcing Amazon’s $20 billion AI investment in his state, adding that Pennsylvania demonstrates “what a united front looks like to win the battle of AI supremacy.” Josh Orton, president of the progressive advocacy group Demand Justice, who was an aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, said his sense is that “most working people” will view AI as a threat. “Any candidate who doesn’t understand that will seem wildly out of touch,” Orton said. “Without question, you are going to see candidates propose policies from the perspective of people being more afraid of its repercussions than excited about its potential.” “There will be presidential candidates hungry for tech money who will make policy proposals about how AI is wonderful and amazing — to woo donors,” he continued. Steve Bannon, a former Trump White House adviser and prominent MAGA media personality, has ramped up his focus on the issue in recent weeks, describing the fight for the right’s future as between “broligarchs” in the tech industry and the populist movement he champions. “They have to be confronted,” Bannon said in an interview of AI companies. “They’re totally out of control.” He called for more guardrails to be put in place for AI in the U.S., saying “it takes more regulation to open a nail salon on Capitol Hill” than exists to constrain AI. “You have no idea where these things are going to end up,” Bannon added. “No idea. Maybe the most dangerous thing we’re dealing with right now.” Multiple AI-related fights are heating up at the moment. State and federal lawmakers are trying to quickly ensure child safeguards around AI as devastating stories emerge linking chatbots to instances of suicide and self-harm. Grassroots opposition to the rapid proliferation of AI data centers — a core element of the Trump economic agenda — is intensifying as state lawmakers deal with constituents who are worried about electricity bill hikes that are in part tied to the energy-hungry complexes. And perhaps the biggest fight of all is one the president and AI proponents have further fueled in recent days, with the White House having drafted an executive order that, if signed, would challenge states’ rights to regulate AI. Faiz Shakir, a Democratic strategist and the top aide to Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign, pointed to rising grassroots anger over data centers as an entry point for voter distaste for AI development. “The grassroots movement is going on organically, and it is not being matched by political leadership,” he said. Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio — who has worked on several pieces of AI-related legislation, including the bipartisan Recommending Artificial Intelligence Standards in Education, or RAISE Act, which he introduced with Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del. — said he sees opportunity in AI. Husted, who was appointed to fill Vance’s Senate seat and faces a tough special election next year, said he recognizes potential pitfalls, from children being exposed to harmful content from AI chatbots to consumers falling victim to deceptive products and practices. “I’m trying to lean in on the upside but also put protections in place so that we’re not being abused,” Husted said, also acknowledging the “anxieties” that workers have about AI rendering their jobs obsolete, describing it as a tension point. “We want progress, but we don’t want anything to change. That’s at the center of our human spirit. We like things the way they are, but we also want to win.” Super PACs and other interest groups focused on promoting AI have started to emerge, backed by millions of dollars from deep-pocketed donors who are likely to ramp up spending as elections near. That includes Leading the Future, a new super PAC backed by $100 million from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, a co-founder of OpenAI and a co-founder of Palantir, and two new super PACs led by former Reps. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, and Brad Carson, D-Okla., which will support candidates “committed to defending the public interest against those who aim to buy their way out of sensible AI regulation,” per a release. So far, the super PAC making the most noise is Leading the Future, which now seeks to boost candidates who support a national AI framework — federal regulations that would pre-empt any new state laws. The group recently announced the first candidate it will fight against: Alex Bores, a candidate in a deeply contested Democratic primary in New York’s 12th Congressional District who has championed AI safety legislation. “This is going to be a major issue this year and going into next year,” Josh Vlasto, a top official at the super PAC and former aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. “It’s front of mind for voters and for businesses and for parents and families.” A Democratic operative close to multiple potential 2028 presidential candidates, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said party leaders are having active discussions about where to come down on the matter. One approach is to “just go all in against it and say these tech oligarchs are bad, they don’t care about you, this is a disaster, they’re coming for your communities,” ahead of the upcoming midterm and presidential elections. “Or do you try to win over tech and say, ‘Stay on the sideline, just shut up, we need to put a couple rules in place,’” this person continued. “Just shut the f--- up and work with us here.” Some of Trump’s early moves in office, including his administration’s AI Action Plan, were unveiled with the goal of rapidly accelerating AI, an industry that has accounted for most of the gross domestic product growth in the U.S. during his first year back in office. In recent days, Trump has ramped up his own advocacy. In addition to the executive order that has been drafted to target state regulations, Trump signed a separate order launching “Genesis Mission,” which is aimed at supercharging American AI research, development and scientific applications. “Investment in AI is helping to make the U.S. Economy the ‘HOTTEST’ in the World, but overregulation by the States is threatening to undermine this Major Growth ‘Engine,’’ Trump posted on his Truth Social platform last month, adding, “We MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes. If we don’t, then China will easily catch us in the AI race.” Republican Rep. Gabe Evans, a former U.S. Army officer who represents a key swing district in Colorado, said in an interview that voters need to understand how important it is for the U.S. to reach these AI milestones before China. “What I tell people is, whether you love it or hate it, AI is here,” Evans said, adding, “If you’re nervous about AI, you need to be exponentially more nervous about communist AI controlled by the Chinese.” As with many policy debates, Trump is dictating the terms — and his effort to ensure the tech giants are unencumbered by red tape has come as those same companies have sought to curry favor with his administration while announcing historic AI investments in the U.S. For Vance, the early front-runner for the 2028 GOP presidential nomination, the administration’s advocacy is setting the stage for AI policy to be a major inflection point for his potential campaign. He already represents something of a bridge between two worlds: the lower-income, working-class world of his childhood in Middletown, Ohio, and the high-tech, big-money world of Silicon Valley, where he worked as a venture capitalist. Those potentially dueling interests were on display in Vance’s February speech at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris. There, the vice president heralded AI largely as an opportunity to be embraced — not feared or overregulated. More recently, Vance tackled the issue during a Fox News interview in which he linked his pro-AI stance to his anti-immigration views. Using home construction as an example, Vance described robots as complementary to “blue-collar” workers and immigrant laborers as an outright threat to replace them on job sites. “[I]f you use technology and you empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor, I think they’re going to do way better,” Vance said. A longtime Trump-aligned operative, speaking on the condition of anonymity, noted long-standing bipartisan buy-in on the need to win the AI race over China. This person sees a divide between the Trump administration’s advocacy for AI advancement and a “populist, socialist” wing of the Democratic Party “that wants to use fears of AI job loss as a means to get votes.” This person recalled similar job loss fears around the birth of the internet that ultimately did not materialize — an argument that could hold weight for Vance, who this person described as holding “pro-AI views,” in a future campaign. “That could be a fault line between the two parties in 2028,” this person said. But even among MAGA allies, there is no consensus on how to move forward on AI. Ryan Girdusky, a conservative consultant who helped run a super PAC that backed Vance’s 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, described AI as his “big fear” for Republicans who could suffer at the ballot box if they are unable to stave off AI-related job losses. “I think that they should try to do whatever they can to make the change to AI a little less dramatic,” Girdusky said. “That’s what’s going to feed the AOC presidential run of 2028. She’ll be talking about AI, and Republicans will still be like, ‘Well, you never know. We can still grow our way out of the deficit.’”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/ai-wedge-issue-midterms-2028-bedfellows-rcna244811","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251119-desantis-aoc-gk-874c9d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 17:43:32","author":"Allan Smith,Jonathan Allen","authors":["Allan Smith","Jonathan Allen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":383999606,"title":"Donald Trump issues confusing latest health update: 'I have no idea'","text":"In his latest update to reporters, President Donald Trump is shining a light on his health — although it seems like he may not have the full picture.\n\nFor context, the current POTUS, 79, shared a Thanksgiving message on November 27 on his platform Truth Social, in which he castigated the \"Great American Citizens and Patriots\" for the seeming demise of the country's values and for being \"Politically Correct.\"\n\nIn his message, he specifically mentioned Governor of Minnesota and Kamala Harris' former running mate Tim Walz, using a slur and saying he \"does nothing\" about the \"hundreds of thousands of refugees\" allegedly causing conflict in his state.\n\nIn response, Walz took to X to simply state: \"Release the MRI results,\" which reporters questioned Trump about on Sunday, November 30, while on board Air Force One. \"Governor Walz asked you to release the MRI results,\" one member of the press asked the President in a clip shared by the White House on YouTube, to which Trump replied by calling him the \"incompetent Governor Walz.\" \n\n\"If they want to release it, it's okay with me to release it.

National Collegiate Athletic Association. \n\nThat ruled that the federal government could not prohibit states from authorizing sports betting, and now, there are only 11 states, among them California, Alabama, Utah, South Carolina and Texas, where it remains illegal.\n\nThat certainly hasn't stopped platforms like FanDuel and DraftKings from amassing a massive base, and moreover, now prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi are cashing in on it as well.\n\nWhat is Polymarket?\n\nThe world's largest prediction market currently stands as Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction market founded in 2020 by then 21-year-old Shayne Coplan, a college dropout turned billionaire. Unlike a traditional bookie, where you bet against the house, Polymarket users trade binary contracts, priced between $0 and $1, where the contract price acts as the market's real-time probability estimate of that outcome; if you are correct, the contract settles at $1.00.\n\nSpeaking with Anderson Cooper for CBS News, Shayne described the platform as \"a site where you can basically bet on current events. Some sort of question about the future, like an election. And as a result, when a ton of people are betting, you get the betting odds, which basically tell you how likely each outcome is.\"\n\nOn Polymarket, you can bet on a variety of topics — there are usually around 10,000 questions posted at a time — including pop-culture questions like when or where will Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce get married or who will win the Super Bowl, and politics, with questions about the Ukraine-Russia conflict or whether Donald Trump was going to win against Vice President Kamala Harris in November 2024.\n\nThe latter bet was accurately predicted about a month before Election Day, when most conventional pollsters and pundits argued it was far too close to have a prediction, and a whopping $3.6 billion was wagered on the question.\n\nMeet its founder\n\nShayne, 27, grew up in Manhattan's Upper West Side, and went to public school In Hell's Kitchen. He began studying computer science at New York University before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, ultimately dropped out his freshman year, and founded Polymarket. \n\nSince then, billionaires like Figma's Dylan Field, Zynga's Mark Pincus, Uber's Travis Kalanick and hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin have become investors, and now, Shayne himself has become a billionaire too, with a net worth of $1 billion, with Polymarket's own valuation currently at $9 billion, per Forbes. \n\nThe FBI raid and its legality in the U.S.\n\nThere have been some concerns about Polymarket, particularly it thriving under an administration that favors deregulation. One month after the 2024 election, the FBI raided Shayne's apartment and seized his devices as part of an investigation into a possible violation of its agreement to block U.S. ers after it was ordered to pay a $1.4 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for offering unregistered markets. \n\nHowever in July, the Department of Justice and CFTC dropped the investigations, Polymarket then announced it had acquired CFTC-licensed derivatives exchange QCX for $112 million to prepare for a compliant U.S. launch, plus, just days after Donald Trump Jr. joined its advisory board (he has also served as a strategic advisor to Polymarket’s main competitor Kalshi), the company received federal approval to launch in the U.S.","summary":"Meet the billionaire, 27-year-old college dropout behind Polymarket, Shayne Coplan","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/us/870528/shayne-coplan-polymarket-founder-what-to-know/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/cf25ad774750-gettyimages-2244302972.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 16:51:52","author":"Beatriz Colon","authors":["Beatriz Colon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.098},{"id":384058836,"title":"Indiana Republicans release draft map that aims for all-GOP House delegation","text":"Republicans in the Indiana House on Monday released a draft map that aims to deliver the state’s nine congressional seats to the GOP but it’s unclear whether the Trump-backed plan has the votes to pass in the state Senate, which is also controlled by Republicans.\n\nDemocrats currently hold two congressional seats in Indiana, but both would become more favorable to the GOP under the proposed map. \n\nMarion County, a Democratic stronghold and home to the state’s largest city of Indianapolis, would be split among four districts under the proposal. Democratic Rep. André Carson’s 7th District, which is anchored in Marion County and backed Kamala Harris by more than 41 points last year, would be dismantled. President Donald Trump would have carried the proposed new version of the 7th District, which would stretch to the Ohio border, by 38 points, according to calculations by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. \n\nMeanwhile, Democrat Frank J. Mrvan’s 1st District, which is centered on the heavily Democratic city of Gary in the state’s northwest corner, would shift from a seat Trump lost by less than half a percentage point to one he would have carried by 12 points. Mrvan’s battleground seat is already a GOP target this cycle. \n\nUnder the proposed lines, Trump would have carried every House district in Indiana by double-digit margins, according to Inside Elections. \n\nThe Indiana House gaveled in on Monday to begin the process, as demonstrators gathered at the state Capitol in protest. The state Senate is scheduled to take up the issue next week.\n\n“The issue of redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state,” Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said in a statement, adding that his chamber would “make a final decision that week on any redistricting proposal sent from the House.”\n\nBray had initially resisted the redistricting effort, declaring that there weren’t enough votes in the state Senate.\n\nThat prompted an angry reaction from Trump, who referred to Bray and state Sen. Greg Goode as RINOs, or Republicans in name only, and signaled he would support primary challengers against Republican state senators opposed to the effort.\n\nBut it remains unclear whether sufficient support now exists in the Indiana Senate, with several prominent members already declaring they will oppose the measure. Republicans hold supermajorities in both legislative chambers. \n\nMeanwhile, NBC News reported that at least nine elected Republicans in the Hoosier State have been targets of swatting incidents after the state Senate’s initial decision to forgo mid-decade redistricting drew public criticism from Trump.\n\nThey included GOP state Sen. Jean Leising, who said over the weekend that her house was the target of a pipe bomb. Leising said last week that she remained opposed to redrawing Indiana’s congressional lines. \n\n“It is disappointing that redistricting is taking attention away from issues relevant to my constituents,” she said in a statement. “I will not cave on my position against redistricting but will stay focused on the needs of my seven-county district and the state of Indiana.”\n\nThe White House had been pushing for Indiana to join other GOP-controlled states in redrawing their House district lines ahead of the 2026 midterm elections in an effort to help Republicans pick up additional seats and maintain their majority.\n\nThe effort has spread across the nation to both red and blue states.\n\nTexas Republicans kicked off the process with a new map that could help the GOP gain up to five seats. That map awaits a ruling from the Supreme Court ahead of the state’s Dec. 8 filing deadline. \n\nCalifornia responded with a map, approved by state voters via a ballot measure last month, that could flip an identical number of seats for the Democrats. Republicans could see one-seat gains in Missouri and North Carolina under those states’ new lines. A new map in Ohio could help Republicans flip two seats in Ohio, while Utah’s new map gives Democrats a clear shot at gaining a Salt Lake City-anchored seat. \n\nOther states pursuing mid-decade redistricting include Democratic-controlled Maryland and Virginia, and GOP-led Florida, where a redistricting committee in the state House is expected to meet this week.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/12/01/indiana-republicans-redistricting-map-midterm-elections/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/carson_BC_167_041025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 16:51:14","author":"Posted December 1, 2025 At 4:51pm","authors":["Posted December 1, 2025 At 4:51pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":384050848,"title":"480 Minnesota Health Services Employees Warned Candidate Kamala Harris of Walz, Fraud in 2024","text":"Kamala Harris and the DNC were repeatedly warned about the widespread fraud in Minnesota under the leadership of Democrat Governor Tim Walz during her 2024 presidential campaign, a group of nearly five hundred Minnesota Department of Human Services employees reported Monday.\n\n“[W]e did write to Kamala Harris and the DNC - multiple times - warning them about Tim Walz & his incompetence, fraud scandals and retaliation,” a post on the Minnesota Staff Fraud Reporting Commentary (formerly, Minnesota Department of Human Service Employees) X.com account explained Monday:\n\n“We tried our best to keep the public informed as our tweets are public.

Prosecutors said the scheme involved more than $250 million in stolen funds from a child nutrition program and has led to over 50 convictions. According to a New York Times report, some of these schemes were linked to parts of Minnesota’s Somali community.\n\nWalz told NBC’s Meet the Press, when asked if he takes responsibility for not stopping the fraud: “Well, certainly, I take responsibility for putting people in jail.”\n\nMinnesota governor Tim Walz speaks to media gathered on the first day of school at Deerwood Elementary on September 2, 2025 in Eagan, Minnesota.\n\nHe added: “I will note, it’s not just Somalis. Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We’re AAA-bond rated. But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We’re doing everything we can. But to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few, it’s lazy,” he said.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Walz’ office, the X account. and DHS by email to comment on this story outside of normal business hours.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe fraud allegations raise questions about Walz’ governorship and the extent to which the state handles allegations of wrongdoing effectively.\n\nCriticism of Walz will impact his political standing especially given he is seeking reelection in the state and it could affect the Democrat’s performance in the state more broadly in the November 2026 midterm elections.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe DHS employee X account said it had informed Walz about fraud and claimed Walz “retaliated against whistleblowers” and discredited their reports.\n\n“This is a cascade of systemic failures leading up to Tim Walz,” the account wrote.\n\n“Leadership did not want to appear to discriminate against certain communities and were unwilling to take action, such as stopping fraud, that would have an adverse impact on their image,” it added.\n\n“Fundamentally, Tim Walz is dishonest, lacks ethics and integrity, has poor leadership abilities, and has never taken any accountability for his role in fraud.\n\nIt said it believed investigations would in total uncover $10 billion of fraud in total from small and large providers.\n\nThese claims have not been verified and the identity of the X account owner is not known, or their political persuasion.\n\nWalz has taken measures against fraud. In October, DHS disenrolled 800 Medicaid providers in the state who had not billed Medicaid for more than a year, in a move to combat fraud. Walz then announced that 14 other Medicaid services would be frozen during a fraud investigation.\n\nThe decisions fell in line with Walz’s Executive Order 25-10, which is about “empowering state agencies to continue combating fraud.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social last week: “Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.” He added “Tim Walz does nothing either through fear, incompetence, or both.”\n\nFlorida governor Ron DeSantis shared a New York Times story about fraud in Minnesota and wrote: “If even the NYT is calling out the Somali welfare fraud—and Democrats who enabled it — it must be really bad.”\n\nPolitical commentator Meghan McCain wrote: “This is an absolutely horrifying and enraging story.” She added: “Also Tim Walz should step down over this. The Somali social service scandal is one of the greatest frauds in American history.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nWalz is running for a third consecutive term in office.","summary":"An X account claiming to represent staff at the Minnesota DHS said: &quot;Tim Walz is 100% responsible for massive fraud in Minnesota.&quot;","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tim-walz-minnesota-welfare-fraud-11134602","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2232777699.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 15:02:31","author":"Kate Plummer","authors":["Kate Plummer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.527},{"id":383945976,"title":"In attacking Mark Kelly, Trump is elevating a 2028 contender","text":"Nearly two weeks later, headlines about Donald Trump’s violent threats against a group of Democratic lawmakers — and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly in particular — aren’t fading away. New plot lines keep emerging that are ensuring the focus remains on the Arizona senator, which carries a potential risk for Republicans in 2028.\n\nThe inciting incident came on Nov. 18 with the release of a video message featuring Kelly and five other Democrats — Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania — aimed at members of the military and intelligence community.\n\n“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,” the group said. “The threats to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad, but from right here right at home. Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”\n\nThe language used by the Democrats, all of whom are veterans or former intelligence personnel, was intentional, mirroring what can be found in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That didn’t matter to Donald Trump. Two days later, he erupted on social media. The Democrats were “traitors” who should face prison — and the death penalty. “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” read one of the president’s posts. (He later denied he had made any threats.)\n\nTrump’s threats triggered a statement of solidarity from the lawmakers reiterating their message. But the story kept evolving. On Nov. 24, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed that the Pentagon was investigating whether Kelly, a retired Navy captain and combat pilot, had violated military law with the video. According to the statement, the senator could be recalled to active duty to face “court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” The following day it was revealed that the FBI was opening a probe into the lawmakers’ conduct and would be attempting to schedule interviews with each of the six lawmakers.\n\nBy virtue of the Pentagon investigation, as well as rumors of his presidential ambitions, Kelly has received the lion’s share of attention. That’s bad news for Republicans and constitutes a major error on the part of Trump, whose actions have had unintended consequences: He has elevated Kelly as a potential 2028 rival, if not for himself then for his MAGA successor, whether that ends up being Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Donald Trump Jr. — who’s in second place behind Vance according to a recent poll — or even Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently announced her retirement from Congress. \n\nLike any politician worth their salt, Kelly is taking advantage of the increased attention from Trump’s attacks. Over the past 10 days, the senator has been on a media blitz. With the notable exception of Fox News, he has chalked up appearances on every major network and cable news channel. There was his Nov. 23 interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” followed by multiple appearances on MSNOW, including “Morning Joe” on Nov. 21 and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on Nov. 25. ABC was next; Kelly appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Nov. 26. He pulled double duty over the holiday weekend, sitting down with Kristen Welker on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\nIn interview after interview, Kelly denounced Trump’s comments and underscored his reason for making the video. “We’re concerned because of this president, with this secretary of defense, that we could have a significant problem,” he told Welker. “I’m not gonna be intimidated. I’m not gonna be bullied. Especially by people like Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth.”\n\nFor many potential voters, this will be their first substantial introduction to Kelly, who initially achieved national recognition as the supportive husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was severely wounded in a 2011 shooting, and for winding down his career as a NASA astronaut to support her recovery. In 2020, he won a special Senate election to fill the remainder of the late GOP Sen. John McCain’s term, and two years later he was elected to a full term. After Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race in 2024, Kelly found himself a contender to serve as then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate.\n\nWhile the senator has used his recent media appearances to defend his statement to members of the military and to push back against Trump and Hegseth’s threats, he has also seized the opportunity to go on the offense and talk about other issues. \n\nOn “State of the Union,” Kelly all but called Hegseth a war criminal in response to a recent report that the defense secretary issued a verbal kill-them-all order when Joint Special Operations were preparing a Sept. 2 strike on a Venezuelan boat in the Caribbean that the administration alleged was carrying drugs bound for the U.S. The senator also minced no words in attacking Trump over his mass deportations. “When he says things like ‘third-world countries,’ what is he really saying?” Kelly asked. “I think what he’s saying is he doesn’t want brown people in our country. And that is disturbing, and it’s un-American.”\n\nSuch comments are doubtless heartfelt. But they are also likely intended to quell concerns among progressives who might look askance at one factor in Kelly’s Senate record. On Capitol Hill, he’s known for his efforts to reach across the aisle, scoring in the top 25% of bipartisan senators according to the most recent Bipartisan Index released by The Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. \n\nWant more sharp takes on politics?

A sober presence in interviews and on the stump, he has tended to fade into the background in the Senate. But Kelly also has an unquantifiable quality that more voters, at least over the past couple of decades, have associated with Republican politicians: BDE. This understated confidence is something that Trump, with his hurricane of narcissism and swagger, has never possessed. It’s a trait that has been on full display in every interview Kelly has given since he became the target of the administration’s ire.\n\nIt’s unclear how much thought, if any, the mercurial Trump gave to attacking Kelly. In the past, going after a combat veteran — and a war hero, in the case of McCain, a Vietnam POW — has not mattered to Trump’s MAGA base, or to independent voters who broke for him over Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. \n\nRecent weeks have shown that the Donald Trump of 2025 is not the Donald Trump of nine years ago. Simply put, whether due to misjudging the country’s mood or the increasingly obvious effects of poor health and aging, the president has been off his game. His poll numbers are in sharp decline. After GOP candidates were roundly drubbed in November’s off-year elections, Trump was faced by a wave of bad press questioning his abilities and casting him, less than a year into his term, as a veritable lame duck. \n\nIn acts that would have been unheard of as recently as the summer, congressional Republicans are beginning to publicly defy him. After GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina — as well as Trump’s perennial thorn in the flesh, Thomas Massie of Kentucky — refused to withdraw their support for releasing the Justice Department’s files on the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein under immense pressure from the White House, the president was forced to change his position and support a bill mandating their disclosure. According to a POLITICO report that was disputed by the White House, Trump was poised to unveil a health care initiative that would have included continued subsidies for the Affordable Care Act. But it reportedly never saw the light of day because Republicans on Capitol Hill balked.\n\nNow, a Nov. 25 YouGov America poll has found that a majority of Americans have effectively sided with Kelly over Trump, with 50% of U.S. adults approving of lawmakers reminding active-duty service members of their legal duty to refuse to carry out illegal orders. (Of those, 35% strongly approved.) Thirty-two percent disapproved, while 18% were unsure. Among self-described independents, 50% approved, 26% disapproved and 23% were not sure.\n\nKelly has also taken to fundraising off Trump and Hegseth’s attacks, sending out two rounds of emails with subject lines that read “President Trump is calling for me to be hanged” and “The Department of War is coming after me.” Tellingly, the proceeds will not solely benefit Kelly. So far, the multiple emails in each of the two rounds were also sent on behalf of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who is up for reelection in 2026, California Sen. Adam Schiff, Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and the Nevada Democratic Party. \n\nAlthough Kelly’s media appearances have been well received, it’s unclear how his subdued manner and record of bipartisanship will play among an angry Democratic base that wants to see their leaders fight. But the senator, with a remarkable assist from Trump, is making it clear that he plans to give it a shot.","summary":"The president's threats are setting up the Arizona senator for a presidential bid","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/12/01/in-attacking-mark-kelly-trump-is-elevating-a-2028-contender/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/11/Mary-Kelly-2167814135-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 14:25:52","author":"Jason Kyle Howard","authors":["Jason Kyle Howard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":383944316,"title":"What to expect in Jersey City’s mayoral runoff election","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Voters in New Jersey’s second-largest city will get another chance to elect a new mayor Tuesday in a runoff election.

The winner will replace outgoing Mayor Steven Fulop, who lost the Democratic primary for governor in June.\n\nSolomon was first elected to the council in 2017 after stints as an adjunct professor in Jersey City. He previously worked in the offices of longtime Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker, now a U.S. senator. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2015 but says he is now “completely healthy.”\n\nMcGreevey was elected governor in 2001 after serving in the state legislature. He resigned in 2004 and came out as gay after admitting an extramarital affair with a male staffer whom he appointed as a state homeland security adviser. The aide denied the affair and instead said the governor had sexually harassed him. McGreevey now bills himself as a “champion of second chances,” citing his work as executive director of a nonprofit that provides services to those adjusting to society after serving in prison, addiction treatment or combat duty.\n\nSolomon received about 29% of the vote in the general election, compared with about 25% for McGreevey. Hudson County Commissioner Bill O’Dea received about 22% of the vote, while former Jersey City Board of Education President Mussab Ali received about 18%. Three other candidates split the remaining vote. O’Dea, Ali and sixth-place finisher Christina Freeman have endorsed Solomon. Fifth-place finisher and Jersey City Council President Joyce Watterman endorsed McGreevey.\n\nMcGreevey has spent about $2.5 million on his campaign, compared with about $1.3 million for Solomon.\n\nDemocratic then-Vice President Kamala Harris received about 73% of the vote in Jersey City in the 2024 presidential election. Democratic then-U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill received about 82% in the 2025 gubernatorial election.\n\nIt is uncommon for a former governor to run for mayor, but McGreevey is at least the third to seek local office in the past year. Former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo lost the race for New York City mayor to Zohran Mamdani on Nov. 4. In Delaware, Democrat John Carney was elected mayor of Wilmington in November 2024 after serving two terms as governor, four terms in the U.S. House and two terms as lieutenant governor.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nRecounts are very rare in New Jersey. The state does not have automatic recounts, but candidates and voters may request and pay for them, with the cost refunded if the outcome changes. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday:\n\nRunoff election day\n\nThe runoff election for mayor of Jersey City will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot\n\nThe AP will provide vote results for the mayoral runoff and declare a winner. Solomon and McGreevey are the only candidates.\n\nWho gets to vote\n\nAny registered voter in Jersey City may participate in the mayoral runoff election.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like\n\nThere were about 170,000 voters registered in Jersey City for the Nov. 4 election. Turnout for the mayoral general election was about 38% of registered voters. About 39% of the vote was cast early or by absentee ballot.\n\nAs of Nov. 26, about 3,000 mail absentee ballots had been returned. There is no early in-person voting for this election.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nThe AP first reported results in the Nov. 4 mayoral election at 8:03 p.m. ET, three minutes after polls closed. The last update of the night was at 11:51 p.m. ET, with about 92% of the total vote counted.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the 2025 election at https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2025/.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/jersey-city-mayor-runoff-election-solomon-mcgreevey-c5a9d9d157b234e29db120fbf30efc23","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/691f0ea/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F7f%2F54%2F2839b51eecb0fc3f9eae81c84bf2%2Ff162ec58b4704e768b5f4b5e3494bc3b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 14:19:19","author":"Robert Yoon","authors":["Robert Yoon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":383998516,"title":"Afghan suspect in Washington shooting likely radicalized in US: American security official","text":"Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, faces a first-degree murder charge in the November 26 shooting that left a 20-year-old guardsman dead and another critically wounded.\n\n“I will say we believe he was radicalized since he’s been here in this country,” Noem said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n“We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we’re going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members, who talk to them,” stated Noem during a separate interview on ABC.\n\nLakanwal entered the United States in 2021 as part of a massive airlift by then-president Joe Biden’s administration during the US military withdrawal and subsequent return to power of Taliban forces.\n\nA resident of the western US state of Washington, Lakanwal allegedly drove cross-country to carry out the shooting a few blocks from the White House — an attack that shocked Americans on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nOfficials from President Donald Trump’s administration, which reportedly granted Lakanwal US asylum in April 2025, have blamed Biden’s administration for lax vetting during the Afghan airlift.\n\nNoem told ABC’s “This Week” that Lakanwal was “maybe vetted” after entering the United States but said it was “not done well.”\n\n“Crooked Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and so-called ‘Border Czar’ Kamala Harris really screwed our Country by letting anyone and everyone come in totally unchecked and unvetted!” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform Sunday.\n\nOfficials announced that before coming to the United States, Lakanwal had served in a CIA-backed Afghan “partner force” unit fighting the Taliban.\n\nUS government officials have since suspended visas for all Afghan nationals and frozen decisions in all asylum cases.","summary":"The Afghan suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington may have been radicalized after entering the US, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has stated when questioned about his motive on Sunday talk shows.","url":"https://ifpnews.com/afghan-suspect-in-washington-shooting-likely-radicalized-in-us-american-security-official/","image":"https://ifpnews.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=350355&type=iran-front-page&hash=5c58aee8cc3631213162551651451c20","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 13:58:58","author":"Ifp Media Wire","authors":["Ifp Media Wire"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ir","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":383919754,"title":"What to expect in Tennessee's special congressional election","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Less than a month after Democrats scored a string of victories over Republicans in the Nov. 4 general election, the next test at the ballot box for both parties heading into the 2026 midterm season will be Tuesday in a Tennessee special congressional election on usually reliable GOP turf.\n\nHouse Republicans look to hold the seat in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District and pad their narrow 219-213 advantage in the chamber. Democrats hope to extend their winning streak by pulling off an upset in this Middle Tennessee district, where Donald Trump and other GOP candidates routinely win with around 60% of the vote.\n\nRepublican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July to join the private sector.\n\nVan Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who headed the Tennessee Department of General Services under Republican Gov. Bill Lee. With endorsements from both Trump and Green, he easily won the October special primary against 10 opponents.\n\nBehn is a state representative first elected in a 2023 special election. She narrowly won a four-way Democratic primary that featured two other state representatives and a well-funded local businessman. A former political organizer and progressive activist, Behn was described by some state Democrats as “our very own AOC of TN,” a reference to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Prominent Van Epps backers have frequently repeated the nickname in support of the Republican nominee.\n\nAs the final high-profile head-to-head party matchup of the year, the race has attracted attention from national political figures. Trump phoned into a tele-rally for Van Epps on Nov. 13 just as early voting began. His 2024 presidential election rival, Democratic then-Vice President Kamala Harris, appeared at a Nov. 18 event in Nashville to encourage Democratic turnout in the special election.\n\nAs a result, spending has ballooned. Going into the October primary, Van Epps had spent more than $348,000 and had about $54,000 in the bank. Behn spent more than $168,000 ahead of her primary and had about $20,000 in the bank. As of mid-November, according to the pre-election Federal Election Commission filings, Van Epps had raised an additional $590,000, compared with about $1 million for Behn.\n\nMost of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years. The district also includes parts of heavily Democratic Davidson County, which is home to Nashville. The Nashville area once anchored a separate congressional district favorable to Democrats, but state Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 and divided Davidson County among the 7th and two neighboring Republican-friendly districts.\n\nTrump carried the 7th District in 2024 with about 60% of the vote, compared with about 38% for Harris. In the Davidson County portion of the district, Harris received nearly 68% of the vote, which comprised about 22% of total votes in the district. Trump won each of the remaining 13 counties with at least 59% of the vote.\n\nGreen was elected twice each under the old and new district boundaries. Under the old lines, he received between 67% and 70% of the vote. His margin of victory narrowed after new lines were drawn in 2022 — he won with 60% of the vote in 2022 and 2024.\n\nThe contest marks the year’s fifth special election to fill a vacant congressional seat. An additional vacant seat in a heavily Democratic Houston-area district in Texas will be filled in a runoff election on Jan. 31, 2026, while a recently vacated seat in northern New Jersey held by Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will be filled next April.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nIn Tennessee, recounts are held only as part of a legal challenge in the courts. There are no automatic recounts, and losing candidates may not request recounts. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is subject to a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday:\n\nSpecial election day\n\nThe special election in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District will be held Tuesday. Polls in the district close at 7 p.m. local time, which is 8 p.m. ET. Although Tennessee is in two time zones, the 7th District falls entirely within the Central time zone.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot\n\nThe AP will provide vote results and declare a winner in the special congressional election.\n\nWho gets to vote\n\nAny voter registered in the 7th Congressional District may participate in the special election.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like\n\nThere were about 466,000 registered voters in the 7th Congressional District in the November 2024 general election. Turnout in the congressional race was about 69% of registered voters in the 2024 presidential election year and about 41% in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nAmong the 14 counties located either entirely or partly within the 7th District, about 73% of 2024 general election ballots were cast early in person or by absentee. About 51% of the vote in these 14 counties were cast early or by absentee in the 2022 midterms.\n\nAs of Nov. 26, the last day of early voting, just over 84,000 ballots had been cast before the special election.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nThe votes were tallied quickly in the Oct. 7 special primaries. The AP first reported results from both the Democratic and Republican primaries at about 8:05 p.m. ET from Perry County, about five minutes after polls closed. The vote count was completed in both contests at 10:28 p.m. ET with the final vote update from Humphreys County.\n\nIn the 2024 general election, the AP first reported results in the 7th District congressional race at 8:03 p.m. ET from Perry County. The election night tabulation ended at 12:36 a.m. ET, with more than 99% of total votes counted.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 336 days until the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the 2025 election at https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2025/.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-special-congressional-election-van-epps-behn-tn07-98e75478bb00740b0253a18a5a23e53e","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/0cfa52e/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5319x3546+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F17%2Ffe%2Fe16b52d3432afff2efdad690f647%2F46dea510c2d54159a9b5795ec36665b1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 12:53:15","author":"Robert Yoon","authors":["Robert Yoon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.023},{"id":383926796,"title":"Donald Trump Blasts Reporter For Questioning his MRI Scan and Claims he 'Aced Cognitive Test' Amid Dementia Fears — 'I Got a Perfect Mark Which You Would be Incapable of Doing'","text":"Donald Trump has blasted a reporter onboard Air Force One for questioning his MRI scan.\n\nRadarOnline.com can reveal the president claims he is happy to release results amid growing dementia fears and pressure from the likes of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who is demanding the findings are made public.'I Will Release Results'During the exchange with journalists, he was asked for his response to Walz's cries for transparency, sparking another fiery response.\n\nTrump said: \"They were perfect like my phone call where I got impeached.

Both parties are pouring millions of dollars into the district for a special election next week to replace former Republican Rep. Mark Green, who retired in July. And Democrats have a puncher’s chance of scoring an upset.\n\nThe sudden competitiveness of a special House election in a heavily gerrymandered Republican district is a good summation of Trump and the GOP’s current political freefall — and the rising political fortunes of Democrats.\n\nNothing says more about the toxicity of Trump and the GOP brand than a Republican candidate in an R+22 seat running away from the president and his party. \n\nBy all accounts, Republican Matt Van Epps, the former Tennessee General Services commissioner, is leading his opponent, Democrat Aftyn Behn, a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, in the polls. (Though on Wednesday late last week, a stunning poll from Emerson College/The Hill showed Van Epps ahead by only two points, with a roughly four-point margin of error.) \n\nBut with Democrats overperforming in special elections in 2025 by around 13 points — as well as a couple of unexpected double-digit victories in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, plus winning two statewide races in Georgia by nearly 25 points — seemingly even an R+22 seat could be up for grabs. \n\nYou don’t have to believe me. Instead, just follow the money. A pro-Trump super PAC, two other outside conservative PACs and the National Republican Congressional Committee have already spent more than $2 million in support of Van Epps. That wouldn’t be happening if Republicans felt comfortable that they had this race in the bag.\n\nMeanwhile, national Democrats, who initially seemed content to sit this race out, are also spending big. The House Majority PAC, which supports Democratic candidates, announced late last week it was spending $1 million on ads to boost Behn.\n\nCan Democrats pull off the upset? Vanderbilt University political scientist John G. Geer is skeptical. “It is a steep climb for Behn to win,” he told me. “Even making it a single-digit race is an accomplishment.” Still, says Geer, “it is clear that the GOP is worried.”\n\nJeff Yarbro, who is one of six Democratic members of the Tennessee state Senate (out of 33 total), has a slightly rosier view of the race. “Energy and attention [are] all going her way,” he told me. Van Epps doesn’t have “any real history with voters and is not generating any excitement.” He is, says Yarbro, “almost the perfect stand-in for ‘generic Republican.’” \n\nBehn, like successful Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia, has focused her campaign message on the latest buzzword in American politics: “affordability.” Her ads talk about rising health care costs and grocery bills, while painting her opponent as a tool of special interests and billionaire fat cats. \n\nNot surprisingly, Epps’ allies have portrayed Behn as a “Marxist” and a “lunatic” and have tried to tie her to New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Depicting a Democrat in a red state as a wild-eyed liberal is hardly a first, but with Behn, it’s a bit easier. She has a background as a liberal activist and has received backing from the Democratic Socialists of America, or DSA. In recent days, anti-police comments she made after the murder of George Floyd have also surfaced.\n\nBehn, however, isn’t exactly running away from her progressive past. She has made campaign appearances alongside liberal stars, who conservatives love to hate, such as Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and activist David Hogg. Earlier this month, former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared at a campaign event (though Behn was not present). \n\nThe one thing that scares most members of Congress more than anything else is the prospect of a competitive election.\n\nIn a special election, turnout is everything, and Behn’s strategy seems to be “turn out my voters and hope enough Republicans stay home.” The Behn campaign has likely concluded that Harris’ ability to motivate Republicans is more than offset by the impact on partisan Democrats who voted for her last year.\n\nFor his part, Van Epps isn’t exactly leaning into the support he’s received from President Trump. Though the president endorsed him in a crowded primary field and appeared at a tele-rally earlier this month, Van Epps’ latest ad not only doesn’t mention Trump — it also omits his partisan affiliation. (Instead, the ad identifies Van Epps as “American Patriot.”)\n\nNothing says more about the toxicity of Trump and the GOP brand than a Republican candidate in an R+22 seat running away from the president and his party. And the aforementioned Emerson/Hill poll shows Trump’s favorability in Tennessee’s 7th district at just 47%, with roughly 49% disapproval — a stunning reversal of fortune for the president. \n\nStill, make no mistake, Van Epps is heavily favored to win. While Democrats have been running 13 points ahead of Harris’ 2024 numbers, that kind of performance would still leave Behn several points short of winning. However, a single-digit defeat could have a seismic effect on Capitol Hill. \n\nThe one thing that scares most members of Congress more than anything else is the prospect of a competitive election. For the lion’s share of Republicans in safe, heavily gerrymandered districts, they can generally waltz to victory. \n\nBut if Behn loses by six or seven points, Republicans in districts that Trump won by less than 15 points might start getting a tad nervous (for those keeping score at home, that’s 53 Republican members).","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/tennessee-special-election-matt-van-epps-aftyn-behn","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1764195074/251126-aftyn-behn-zz/251126-aftyn-behn-zz.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 11:00:00","author":"Michael A.

Hours earlier, the governor, Josh Shapiro, had led a seder, sitting in the middle of a long rectangular table in the dining room, surrounded by his wife, three of their children, his three siblings, and several nieces and nephews. Many of the guests were spending the night; as Balmer broke another window in the dining room and climbed inside, about twenty people were asleep upstairs. He lit a second Molotov cocktail and smashed it on the floor. Almost immediately, the tablecloths in the room, which was still set up for the seder, caught fire.\nOn one side of the room, Balmer encountered a locked double door, the only barrier between him and the rest of the house. He would later tell police that, if he had encountered Shapiro, he would have attacked him with the sledgehammer. But, when he tried kicking the doors open, the lock held. The fire, meanwhile, was spreading rapidly. Balmer broke a third window and fled. He’d been inside for a little more than a minute.\n“I woke up to a bang on the door,” Shapiro later said. “It was a state trooper, telling us that there was a fire, and we needed to evacuate immediately.” Shapiro and his wife, Lori, roused the rest of the household. “We ran out of the home just as the first responders ran in,” Shapiro said.\nThat week, details about Balmer, who had turned himself in the day after the fire, began to accumulate. He had previously been charged with assault, after his wife told police that he had attacked her and two of his sons, and a bank had threatened to foreclose on his house. His mother told reporters that Balmer had gone “off his meds” and checked into a hotel. She had called multiple police departments in an effort to get him help. Balmer, shortly after leaving the governor’s residence, had called 911 himself. “Governor Josh Shapiro needs to know that Cody Balmer will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,” he told the operator. Balmer had no known history of pro-Palestinian activism, nor any obvious association with the Palestinian cause. Still, he told the operator, “Our people have been put through too much by that monster. All he has is a banquet hall to clean up.”\nAs the governor of Pennsylvania, Shapiro had no role in setting American policy for the war in Gaza. But he had been critical of the University of Pennsylvania’s handling of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, appointing an ally to its board of trustees who reportedly worked to amplify the voices of pro-Israel students and to punish some of the protesters. For several months, Shapiro did not say much publicly about the attack. But, behind the scenes, he was ruminating on a new reality of holding elected office in the U.S.—“the fact that my life choices put my family at risk,” as he would later put it.\nDuring the summer, several other acts of political violence briefly seized public attention. In May, a Chicago activist named Elias Rodriguez allegedly travelled to Washington, D.C., and shot two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a reception at the Capital Jewish Museum, killing them. In June, Vance Boelter, a mortuary assistant who had expressed anti-abortion sentiments, allegedly drove to the home of the former speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, Melissa Hortman, and shot and killed her and her husband. (Both Rodriguez and Boelter have pleaded not guilty.) In August, a young man named Patrick Joseph White, who held strong anti-vaccine views, took a rifle and a shotgun from his father’s gun safe, and fired into a hundred and fifty office windows at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, killing a police officer.\nA few weeks later, on September 10th, the conservative organizer Charlie Kirk was murdered. Investigators reported that the alleged shooter, a Utah college student named Tyler Robinson, had carved “HEY FASCIST—CATCH!” into one of his bullet casings. In the following days, as mourners organized vigils for Kirk across the country, the problem of political violence seemed only to intensify the country’s partisan divide. Donald Trump responded with anger, calling for a crackdown on liberal donors and activists. “For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” the President said on the night of Kirk’s murder. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.” But there was also a more general sense of fear. “As you might imagine, I get a lot of calls from people asking my advice on whether to run for office,” Shapiro told me. “I’d say that ten per cent of their questions are political, and ninety per cent are about what can I do to protect my family.”\nOn the Tuesday after Kirk was killed, I met Shapiro at an anti-hate conference in Pittsburgh, where he delivered a speech on political violence. In the immediate aftermath of the break-in, he often declined to theorize about his attacker’s motives. “Me opining from the outside isn’t particularly helpful to the case,” he said. I told him that I had been corresponding with Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head at a campaign event in 2011. The injuries still affect her ability to speak. “I don’t spend any time thinking about the man who shot me,” she wrote to me at one point. I could see the logic: it was a way of denying the perpetrator control over the political narrative. When I mentioned this to Shapiro, he told me, “It’s interesting she said that.” He lifted his head to the side, as if surprised to be considering the man who had tried to kill him. “I don’t think about him,” Shapiro said. “I don’t think about what he professed.”\nShapiro, in his polish, in his pragmatism, and in the frequency with which he invokes a spirit of bipartisanship, operates in the liberal tradition of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama—an appeal to hope and public good will that has been tested by the recent wave of attacks. In his speech, he criticized Trump, without naming him, for condemning only left-wing acts of violence and suggested that the trouble was a kind of ennui, especially among the young, who no longer trust American institutions to solve their problems. “Consumed by this feeling of hopelessness,” he said, “they find refuge in the dark corners of the internet.” The remedy he offered was for institutions to address those problems—he mentioned delivering building permits more quickly—so that people walked away with “just a little more faith in the system.” But Shapiro himself seemed to acknowledge a mismatch, in proposing incremental policy changes to counter acts of murder. He told the crowd, “I realize getting your permit earlier isn’t going to end political violence.”\nAfter the riot on January 6th, 2021, when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, Tom Manger, a tall, mustached sixty-six-year-old former police chief in Montgomery County, Maryland, was hired to lead the U.S. Capitol Police. Part of the department’s job is to investigate threats of violence against members of Congress. Manger soon learned that, in the years before his appointment, such threats had been increasing dramatically. A decade ago, he told me, members typically reported fewer than two thousand threats per year. “But around 2017 that really started to escalate,” Manger said. “Last year, it was almost ten thousand.” As Manger and his team analyzed the data, he concluded that one of the best predictors of which members received the most threats was not party, seniority, race, or gender but how much attention they generated on social media. “A lot of people love you,” Manger told me. “And a lot of people hate you.”\nNearly ten thousand violent threats a year amount to about twenty-eight a day, a number that overwhelmed the investigative capacities of the Capitol Police. A common type of threat, Manger found, emerged from a mundane situation: a member of the public would call his representative to say that he was dissatisfied with his care at the Department of Veterans Affairs, and then, frustrated by a lack of response, call a second time. “Then he calls a third time and says, ‘I’m gonna kill the congressman,’ ” Manger told me. The most ominous threats implied that a member of Congress was under surveillance. “A member will get a letter mailed to his house, and there will be a photo of the congressman’s kid walking the family dog, and there will just be a little Post-it note stuck to the letter that says, ‘What a pretty dog,’ or whatever,” Manger said. “And this sends the message: ‘I was close enough to your kid to take this picture.’ ”\nWhen Kirk was assassinated, in September, the size of his private security force appeared roughly equal to the number of campus cops on the scene. In the aftermath of the shooting, the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro told a story about a recent talk he’d given in Oxford, in which his security detail had insisted that, because of threats against him, he stay at a rural inn that could more easily be protected from attack. The following week, the conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who often addresses college audiences, told me that “the difference among conservative speakers is between those like Charlie, who have their own security, and those like me, that don’t.” (He said that he was revamping his speaking contracts to require more protection.) But such fears have become commonplace on both sides. This year, a Democratic Washington state senator named Adrian Cortes told a local newspaper that he had begun to wear body armor whenever he gave a speech in “an uncontrolled area.”\nBy 2011, when Giffords was shot by Jared Loughner, a mentally ill twenty-two-year-old with no apparent political motivation, the first hints of this new era were beginning to emerge. A year later, when Giffords travelled to Washington to attend the State of the Union address, she sat next to the Arizona congressman Jeff Flake. The shooting had made it difficult for Giffords to stand. Each time President Obama said something that drew applause from Democrats, Flake, a genial Mormon lawmaker, would help Giffords to her feet—which meant that he, a Republican, was also standing. Flake told me, “I got literally hundreds of e-mails and calls from voters at home, saying, ‘Why are you standing?’ ”\nBy 2017, Flake was a senator, an increasingly vocal anti-Trump figure, and an infielder on the G.O.P.’s congressional baseball team. At batting practice one morning, he was standing between first base and home plate when someone started calling out, “Shooter! Shooter!” Flake saw the Louisiana congressman Steve Scalise, out near second base, drop to the ground; as Flake started to run, he could see bullets sending up dirt near one of the dugouts. The shooter, James Hodgkinson, had volunteered at a Bernie Sanders debate watch party in Iowa, according to campaign records, and had written a couple dozen letters to the editor in his local newspaper, in southern Illinois, criticizing G.O.P. tax policies and advocating for legal marijuana. Before Hodgkinson started shooting, he had asked Ron DeSantis, then a third-term congressman from Florida, whether this was the Republicans’ practice. Flake recently told me, “The thought that came to my head in the moment was How can a shooter see a bunch of middle-aged men trying to play baseball and see the enemy? It still baffles me.”\nDuring Trump’s first term, centrist Republicans like Flake were also frequent targets of the President’s supporters. In 2018, Flake was threatened on social media by Cesar Sayoc, the so-called MAGA bomber, who was arrested after sending pipe bombs to a dozen of the President’s political enemies. Flake recalled, “They found that he had an alias on Twitter where he had tweeted at me with an aerial photo of my home, in Mesa, Arizona, saying, ‘Senator Flake, there are a lot of entrances. I’ll see you soon.’ ” Not long after, Flake said, a man who had recently attended a Trump rally travelled to a series of Mormon churches in Arizona carrying a rifle scope, apparently in an attempt to find Flake. Many anti-Trump Republicans have simply left politics. Flake retired rather than run for reëlection in 2018; he told me that he thought the current phase of political violence would outlast Trump. For now, he said, “it’s kind of waiting.”\nAt the Capitol Police, Manger’s task was to deal with political violence as a law-enforcement problem—to investigate threats, to conduct interviews, to charge people with crimes. And yet, he said, fewer than ten per cent of the threats he investigated resulted in charges. I heard similar complaints from other security officials. Trevor Nelson, who, until a few months ago, led investigations at the Treasury Department, told me that fewer than two per cent of the threats made against I.R.S. agents that were referred to the Justice Department resulted in charges. Social media blurred the line between political expression and meaningful threats. “Each U.S. Attorney’s office is going to have its own threshold,” Nelson said, “and most of them are very, very, very high.”\nNelson began working in government security with the Air Force’s Office of Special Investigations in the nineteen-nineties. For most of his career, he said, the daily work of threat response involved researching the person who had made the threat—their criminal record, if any, and whether they sympathized with an extremist group. But radicalization, even political ideology, came to seem a little beside the point. “People are now much more comfortable making really heinous threats,” Nelson said. He mentioned two relatively run-of-the-mill field investigations during which he was confronted, respectively, by a man with a gun and a man wielding a “homemade machete.” “People got emboldened in how they identified themselves in the cyber world—the anonymity, the no repercussions,” he told me. “And then they took that into real life.”\nLandsman said that he and his family spent the day trying to get the protesters to leave, working with both local authorities and the Capitol Police, but they “would not move.” His son was in the final stages of practicing for his bar mitzvah; that evening, he recited the Torah while the protesters chanted pro-Palestinian slogans outside. I asked Landsman whether the demonstration had made him reconsider his position on Israel. “No,” he said. “I definitely take the loss of life in Gaza to heart. I think it’s important to expose yourself to the suffering.” But mostly, he went on, the exchanges reinforced his conviction that he knew the issue better than the protesters did. Landsman told me he often thought back to a forty-five-minute video that the Israeli government had assembled from raw footage of the October 7th attack and screened for foreign officials and members of the media: “It’s so gruesome and so barbaric that I sort of had a life before I saw that video and a life after.”\nIn 2022, Princeton’s Bridging Divides Initiative, which tracks the effects of domestic political violence, began surveying local officeholders. The researchers found that roughly half of respondents had been insulted in the past three months, a third had been harassed, and fifteen per cent had been threatened. Forty per cent said that the current climate had made them less likely to run for higher office. Certain responses to the survey stand out. One anonymous official said, “I’m just going to be honest with you. There have been multiple times that I have thought [our town] is going to get put on the map when somebody comes to kill me.”\nThe research was timely. During Trump’s first term, threats of violence often tracked the President’s own political fights and mostly involved national figures. In the early years of the Biden Administration, members of school boards and municipal governments, which oversaw education and COVID policies, began to face similar forms of intimidation. Amanda Litman, who heads the progressive candidate-recruitment organization Run for Something, told me that, at every level of government, the hostile atmosphere has subtly shifted the kind of person who seeks public office: more adamant, more committed to their ideological goals. “People who know that harassment will be part of the experience,” she said. “People with an even thicker skin.”\nIn late September, not long after Kirk’s murder, I reached out to the office of Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who often generates attention on social media. On the day of Kirk’s murder, a clip of Mace telling a group of reporters outside the Capitol that “Democrats own what happened today” went viral. A reporter had asked if, by that logic, Republicans owned the shooting of Hortman and her husband in Minnesota. “Are you kidding me?” Mace replied. “Some raging leftist lunatic put a bullet through his neck and you want to talk about Republicans right now?” Her communications director sent me some of the voice mails that Mace’s office had received since then. On one recording, a man with a high-pitched Southern accent says, “So tell her, tell her to shut her pussy hole that Donald Trump’s always fucking. Fill it in with superglue or something. . . . She’s been fucked in it anyway and raped. That fucking whore. She’s bringing death upon herself.”\nAs more elements of American government have become politicized, even officials with no public profile have been subjected to threats. Three days after the shooting at the C.D.C.’s headquarters, in August, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., visited the facility. A small group of senior C.D.C. staff went with him, among them the organization’s chief medical officer, a former emergency-room doctor named Deb Houry. Bullet holes spider-webbed across the windows, and shattered glass still littered the floor. Houry noticed that some of her colleagues had moved filing cabinets in order to hide behind them, since “they thought any movement would draw fire.” It had already been reported that the shooter was motivated by anti-vaccine sentiments; Houry hoped that Kennedy, who has championed opposition to vaccines, would say something to reassure the staff. Instead, the following Friday, he laid off some six hundred C.D.C. workers, a hundred of whom worked in violence prevention. (Many of the employees were later reinstated.)\nA September hearing for Kennedy’s new vaccine-advisory committee was approaching, and officials in Houry’s office “very much did not want to testify,” she said. A few days after the shooting, an anti-vaccine doctor and blogger named Robert Malone, whom Kennedy had appointed to the advisory board, had sent out an e-mail newsletter that included anti-gun-control memes. “I talked to staff during this time that were afraid to leave their houses because they felt that they had been targeted personally,” Houry said. What she wanted, after the shooting, was some reassurance that C.D.C. officials would be protected. “And there certainly has not been a strong stance from the Administration saying, ‘Don’t target scientists,’ ” she said. Later that month, Houry resigned.\nBefore last year’s Presidential election, Neil Makhija, the Democratic chair of Montgomery County’s Board of Commissioners, in Pennsylvania—a seat once held by Shapiro—became the target of right-wing allegations that illegal ballots had been distributed in the county. The campaign was led online by a MAGA influencer named Jack Posobiec, who had grown up in Montgomery County. The threats got so intense that, one morning, Makhija’s wife asked why the family’s baby gates were set up throughout the house. Makhija replied that he’d been erecting barriers in case someone broke in. It became a joke between them, but the next day they got a message on their neighborhood WhatsApp—a Ring-cam image of a young man in a hoodie who seemed to be wandering through a nearby back yard. “My neighbor actually chased him, and he ran off,” Makhija said. “I never found out who it was.”\nMakhija told me that he was worried that the threat of violence might not just be scaring elected officials out of public life but changing how they did their jobs. Shortly after the 2024 Presidential election, Makhija thought there was a strong case that Posobiec, who is forty, married, and seemingly lives in Maryland, had voted illegally in Pennsylvania. But, conscious of the possibility of threats and harassment, he was wary of speaking out. “If we have a public event, I used to post—‘I’ll be at this park at 4 p.m.’—and I’m less likely to do that now,” Makhija said. “It just changes the way you interact with the public, and that, honestly, is a very damaging thing. Because, if you’re less accessible, then both you and the public are getting more of your information through digital mediums, and you don’t actually see the people who might be on the other side.”\nThe general atmosphere of violence also makes it easier to conflate political opponents with physical threats. Landsman, the Ohio Democrat, told me that this spring he travelled to Fountain Square, in downtown Cincinnati, for a public event. “It’s just a very open area,” he said. Landsman had no specific reason to think that he was in danger—“It’s fair to say they’re nonviolent,” he said of the protesters who often attended his events—but, he added, “it would only take one person who is unwell with a gun.” (This, Landsman pointed out, was similar to what had happened to Shapiro.) “At that moment, I had one of the most vivid images I’ve ever had in my life,” Landsman told me. “Someone had come behind me and shot me in the back, and the image I saw was my own body lying dead on the ground. It was haunting.”\nShapiro took a different approach. By age six, he was corresponding, through a program offered by his temple, with a Jewish boy in the Soviet Union; a decade later, he established a small organization that encouraged others to do the same. During his junior year at Akiba, Shapiro spent five months in Israel on an exchange program; as a student at the University of Rochester, he published a pessimistic op-ed about the Middle East titled “Peace Not Possible.”\nAfter graduating, he moved to Washington and worked for the Israeli Embassy’s public-affairs division, and then for a succession of Democrats in Congress. He married Lori, whom he’d met during their freshman year of high school, and moved back to suburban Pennsylvania, where he built a coalition of socially liberal professionals that helped turn Montgomery County from red to blue. This required unusual ambition, even by the standards of politics. “You don’t want to turn your back on him,” Joe Hoeffel, a former congressman who hired Shapiro as his chief of staff, told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2017. But he was effective—Shapiro led the Democrats to their first majority on the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners since Reconstruction.\nIn public addresses, Shapiro often operates by way of religious analogy, using words like “blessed” and “faith.” He’ll flag a point by saying, “Hear me on this.” (His oratorical style has earned him the nickname Baruch Obama.) But, as the Trump era unfolded and Shapiro rose politically, his faith was often contested, rather than common, ground. In October, 2018, when Shapiro was Pennsylvania’s attorney general, a right-wing antisemite murdered eleven worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh—which Shapiro often notes was the “deadliest antisemitic attack in American history.” In a biographical ad that aired during his gubernatorial campaign, four years later, he said, “I make it home every Friday night for Sabbath dinner—because family and faith ground me.”\nPennsylvania supplied more participants to the January 6th riot than any state besides Florida. One of the leading candidates for the Republican nomination for governor in 2022, Doug Mastriano, was a far-right state senator who often invoked Christian-nationalist themes and who had been videotaped walking through barriers at the Capitol on January 6th. (Mastriano has denied breaching any barriers, saying in a statement that “police lines did shift throughout the course of the day.”) Shapiro, who had the Democratic nomination effectively sewn up, took the unusual step of paying for an ad during the Republican primary that read “If Doug Mastriano wins, it’s a win for what Donald Trump stands for,” which was widely seen as an effort to boost Mastriano’s campaign.\nAs the Republican nominee, Mastriano used the general election as an opportunity to spread extreme, right-wing talking points—at one point, he compared gun control with the policies of Nazi Germany—which made it easier for Shapiro to move to the center. Shapiro supported what he called “responsible fracking,” earned an endorsement from the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, and supported school-voucher programs. One former official from the Pennsylvania teachers’ union told me, “I remember vividly the meeting at which I said, ‘Well, this is our choice: it’s vouchers versus Nazis.’ ” I asked Shapiro whether, in retrospect, he regretted intervening in the Republican primary. “I didn’t intervene,” Shapiro said. “He was going to win the primary, that was clear, and we wanted to define him early, and that’s what we did.”\nIn the fall of 2023, the arguments about Israel and Palestine took on a special intensity at the University of Pennsylvania. In the weeks before October 7th, a swastika was drawn in a room on campus. After the attack, someone wrote “The Jews R Nazis” on a vacant building next to a Jewish fraternity. In early November, the chair of Penn’s board of trustees, a banker named Scott Bok, was told that Shapiro wanted to appoint a Philadelphia attorney named Robb Fox as an observer on the board, to be his “eyes and ears.” “He didn’t say anything about Fox focussing on antisemitism,” Bok told me. “The appointment seemed pretty benign.”\nOn December 5th, Liz Magill, the president of Penn, testified alongside the presidents of Harvard and M.I.T. at a congressional hearing. The event went badly for all of them. Magill, in response to a question from the New York Republican Elise Stefanik, seemed unwilling to say that a call for the genocide of the Jewish people would unambiguously violate her university’s code of conduct. Shapiro denounced her appearance as “absolutely shameful.” Within days, both Magill and Bok resigned.\nShapiro’s office, meanwhile, was increasingly involved in what was happening at Penn. According to reporting by Ben Binday, a student journalist who wrote an account of the Governor’s behind-the-scenes maneuvers for The Chronicle of Higher Education, Fox, who had joined the university’s task force on antisemitism, and a senior Shapiro aide named Amanda Warren coördinated with a pro-Israel student group that was advocating for the suspension of certain professors and of a pro-Palestinian student group. Fox was also reportedly corresponding with Marc Rowan, a billionaire financier who had pushed for Magill’s ouster.\nThe following spring, student activists established a pro-Palestinian encampment on the Penn quad, calling for the university to divest from companies with ties to the Israeli military. Claims of harassment were made against both encampment members and counter-protesters, but there were no major instances of violence. After sixteen days, the university police, with the support of a hundred Philadelphia police officers, arrested thirty-three activists. The encampment was dismantled. “Unfortunate but necessary,” the university’s interim president, J. Larry Jameson, declared. Shapiro, who had called the encampment “out of control,” praised the decision.\nThe Governor’s critics have tended to interpret his intervention at Penn in one of two ways. Shapiro, who interviewed to be Kamala Harris’s Vice-Presidential candidate last year and who has been making the kinds of moves expected of a 2028 Presidential contender, often takes pride in finding the political center on any given issue. At Penn, he had chosen to be resolutely pro-Israel, perhaps not wanting to cede ground to Trump, who had made antisemitism on college campuses a central issue of his campaign. “Even now,” Bok, the former trustee chair, said, “my sense is that Shapiro’s calculation was that he had figured out which way this was going and wanted to be the leader of the parade, rather than a follower.”\nAnother theory was that Shapiro and the university manipulated the threat of political violence to mute a protest movement that they disagreed with. Rick Krajewski, a progressive Pennsylvania state representative whose district includes Penn’s campus, spent time at the encampment and told me that the scene had been peaceful. “This is a more insidious version of political violence, where you have very powerful people using their influence to push an agenda and shut down legitimate protests by calling them violent,” Krajewski said. “As someone who’s a political official, I do feel like we are in an unsafe time. And I also see people exploiting this moment of fear.”\nShapiro is attuned to the risks of politicizing threats of violence. “I do not like how Donald Trump is using Jews as his excuse for trying to take over universities and restrict their funding,” he told me. “I think that silences speech and puts an even greater target on Jewish students, faculty, and administrators.” Plenty of universities, he went on, had managed to balance the free-speech rights of protesters with the safety of other members of the community. “Where it got out of balance a year and a half ago at Penn and elsewhere is when that peaceful protest led to assaults on kids because they were Jewish,” Shapiro told me. There had been no documented cases of assault during the encampment on Penn’s campus. But Shapiro said that he was speaking more generally about the violence that had taken place at American universities that spring. “These are crimes,” he said. “And to me, that’s where a line was crossed.”\nIn the political shootings and bombings of the past year, there has not been a single proven co-conspirator indicted, and no fringe movements have been implicated. Thomas Crooks, who lived less than an hour away from the spot where he shot Trump in the ear, visited a shooting range forty-three times and searched online for upcoming campaign events for both Trump and Joe Biden. We still don’t know his motive. Patrick Joseph White, who shot up the C.D.C., left behind only a history of anti-vaccine statements. Apart from Elias Rodriguez, who was active in pro-Palestinian protests in Chicago, hard-core activism was not a common trait among the suspected shooters. Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk’s alleged assassin, was reportedly asked by his roommate in a text message how long he had been planning his crime. “A bit over a week,” he wrote.\nBut the perpetrators’ grievances have tracked with the issues driving daily political news. Luigi Mangione, who has been charged in the killing of the C.E.O. of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, on the streets of Manhattan last December, appears to have been frustrated with the health-care industry’s practice of routinely denying claims. (Mangione has pleaded not guilty.) Joshua Jahn, killed after shooting at an ICE field office in September, had inscribed some of his bullets with the phrase “ANTI-ICE,” as many ordinary protesters with no violent intent have written on their signs. Robinson may have been motivated by the ongoing conservative campaign against trans rights. (“I had enough of his hatred,” he allegedly texted his roommate about Kirk.) That Cody Balmer avowed the Palestinian cause in his call to 911, despite no prior connection to it, fits the general pattern, since that’s what was flitting across his screens. As Vance Boelter left the murder scene in Minnesota, he texted his children, “Dad went to war last night”—which, in a way, was true, even if no one else went with him. The perpetrators have grown more murderous, but they have not become radicalized as members of a larger ideological group.\nThese recent acts of violence are also similar in that their professed causes aren’t neatly severable from electoral politics. In the nineteen-twenties, the problem of anarchist violence could be understood as belonging to a different category than the partisan arguments between Democrats and Republicans—as could later acts of terror perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan and the Weather Underground. “They were so far outside of the mainstream that no one was making the case that they were, for instance, part of the Democratic Party,” Kevin Boyle, the chair of the history department at Northwestern University, who has written extensively about political violence in the U.S., told me. “But now we have people on both sides making those kinds of charges.”\nIncreasingly, these two seemingly distinct issues—the everyday matter of political division and the extraordinary pattern of political violence—are becoming the same problem. Even extreme acts can be absorbed into the partisan debate. When Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare C.E.O., was killed, the assassination itself seemed to create a coalition around Mangione. Polls have found that roughly one in four adults, and forty per cent of young adults, sympathize with his alleged cause. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said, “Violence is never the answer. But people can only be pushed so far.” (She later clarified that she does not believe there is ever a justification for murder.)\nThe collective outrage that might be expected to come after these attacks has also been stifled by how selectively the President responds to them—denouncing left-wing violence even as he calls his own opponents traitors and threatens to jail them or worse. After Hortman was murdered in June, Trump was asked whether he planned to call Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor and the 2024 Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, who was a good friend of his state’s former House speaker. Trump said he wouldn’t “waste time” by doing that, and described Walz as “whacked out” and “a mess.” Walz told me, “I think the story is how elected officials respond in the moments after a horrific killing. Keep in mind that, after my best friend was killed, the President of the United States went off and belittled me, and then he said he wasn’t going to call. There are two children who lost their parents, and nothing was said. No attempt to lower the flag, no attempt to acknowledge or honor this.” Walz continued, “I’ll acknowledge that I’m too close to this, because it’s incredibly personal. But if you don’t think that makes it easier to do these things . . .” He trailed off.\nThe line between law enforcement and partisan vindictiveness can also become muddied. In 2023, F.B.I. agents visited the home of Craig Robertson, a Utah man who had threatened on Facebook to put on his “ghillie suit”—full-body camouflage—and bring a sniper rifle to an upcoming visit by President Biden to Salt Lake City. The agents attempted to arrest Robertson, and, after a standoff, they shot and killed him. Some conservatives were outraged, arguing that Robertson was elderly, walked with a cane, and was not a plausible assassin. Some liberals were similarly incensed this fall over an investigation involving Barbara Wien, a retired academic in Virginia who had included the home address of Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, on leaflets denouncing him that police say she distributed. ICE officials have justified immigration agents wearing masks and covering up their badges while conducting operations by emphasizing the frequency with which they are threatened with violence or doxing. But those practices also make ICE’s actions less transparent and more terrorizing—and suggest how easily the state can use political threats and violence as a rationale for more aggressive tactics.\nIn response to the recent shootings, some politicians have suggested that Americans should log off from the internet and pay a little less attention to politics. “Get off social media, get married, have kids,” Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, said after Kirk’s murder. Cox’s response was praised by Shapiro and other like-minded Democrats. After an interview with the moderate Massachusetts congressman Jake Auchincloss, who voiced similar sentiments, the journalist Derek Thompson labelled this instinct “touch-grass populism.”\nAnd yet this notion—that the solution to political violence is to care less about politics—is, in a way, a confession that a liberal approach may not currently offer a way out. Neither law enforcement nor intermittent calls from elected officials to lower the rhetorical temperature have made political life safer. “We are all afraid,” Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican senator from Alaska, said at a conference of tribal and nonprofit leaders in April. “I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real.”\nAt the same time, in the campaigns against universities, the search for Tyler Robinson’s supposed left-wing collaborators, and the masking of ICE agents, there have been some indications of an emerging illiberal response to violence. The long-term danger isn’t just additional partisan attacks but also state reprisals. There is a perverse possibility that these lone-wolf acts could lead to collective punishment.\nWe walked outside to the courtyard that Balmer had crossed to break in. The building’s exterior was under construction—huge brick pillars were going up, part of an “anti-climb wall” that would, incidentally, conceal more of the residence from the public. I asked Shapiro if he found himself thinking about the attack. “Some nights I’ll just, like, walk two miles or something,” he said. “And I’ll think about, O.K., he was hiding there. He stood there. I’m aware of it. I’ll look at the windows.” We were standing on the spot where Shapiro had given his press conference on the day after the attack, in front of a burned façade. “That bush was totally charred—now it’s seemingly grown back,” he said. I offered that the building looked nearly pristine. Shapiro pointed out a tiny spot just above one of the windows that Balmer had shattered. “There’s a little bit right there,” he said.\nAs governor, Shapiro had confronted two other high-profile instances of political violence. In the summer of 2024, when Trump was shot in the ear in Butler, Shapiro rushed to the scene. “The issue was, O.K., well, how do we heal here?” he told me. “I thought it was very important for me, as a Democratic governor, to make clear that an attack on a Republican candidate who I was not supporting was not O.K.” A few months later, Mangione was arrested while eating fast food in Altoona. “The real hero in that story is the woman at McDonald’s who called 911 and made sure he got arrested,” Shapiro told me.\nBalmer had pleaded guilty in mid-October, not just to arson and terrorism but to attempted murder. But Shapiro was still reluctant to focus on his attacker. “The prosecutor felt it was important to introduce into evidence the bomber’s claims that he did that because of ‘what I did to the Palestinians,’ so clearly there was some motivation because of my faith,” Shapiro said. “But I think it is dangerous for you or anyone else to think about those who perpetrate these violent attacks as linear thinkers, meaning that they have a left-wing ideology or a right-wing ideology, or that they have a firm set of beliefs the way you might or I might. These are clearly irrational thinkers. And I think that’s true of others who have claimed lives, whether it’s Speaker Hortman’s or Charlie Kirk’s.”\nWe had moved to the anteroom of Shapiro’s office and were seated on a pair of couches. Pointing to a bookshelf, Shapiro indicated a framed piece of text. A few weeks after the fire, he and Lori held a luncheon to thank the firefighters who had responded. John Wardle, the eighty-two-year-old chaplain of the Penn Township Volunteer Fire Department, had handed the Governor a handwritten letter signed by every member of the department. On the back, Wardle had written what he said was his favorite Bible verse, from Chapter 6 of the Book of Numbers: “The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.” The prayer was immediately recognizable to Shapiro: he had recited it, in Hebrew, to his four children nearly every night of their lives.\n“I don’t know that, with the exception of that night, I’d felt that level of emotion come over me,” Shapiro said. “A guy who is registered to a different political party, who worships a different faith, who is of a different generation. And yet we found ourselves in this moment of darkness, not just for me and my family but for our commonwealth, and here we were, bound not just by text in the Old Testament but by the way that text landed on him.” Shapiro added, “It is hard writing about political violence, but it is somewhat easier to write about the bad actors in it. Sometimes lost in these stories, I find, are the good people, and the goodness people have at their core.”\nThis sounded a little sentimental, given the charred cups and singed windows a few feet away. But it also magnified how the spectre of violence can require willful acts of elision—to notice certain things and to pretend others away. Shapiro, with his commitment to a reasonable political center, had made his choice. “I am a prayerful person,” he told me. “I have never in my life, until the aftermath of this attack, felt the power of other people’s prayers. I became strengthened by their prayers, particularly of people of different faiths. And that is an extraordinary feeling that is very hard for me to put into words, to describe to you. And that came just because of the goodness that exists in people that I feel fortunate to be around every day.” ♦","summary":"During the Trump era, political violence has become an increasingly urgent problem.

U.S attorneys have charged 78 people, 56 have pleaded guilty and 7 have been convicted in trials, all but a handful of them members of Minnesota’s Somali community, the largest in the United States. At least $300 million has been lost to fraud, although some estimates exceed $1 billion. \n\nChristopher Rufo ⬆\n\nThe conservative activist, who was largely responsible for turning “critical race theory” into a household phrase, co-authored an explosive report in City Journal saying that the long-running fraud channeled money to al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based Jihadist group. The allegations have yet to be verified, and may be unverifiable, but they were explosive enough for Trump to cite them in his remarks on the D.C. shooting. Now the media, from The New York Times to the New York Post, is piling on. \n\nMinnesota Star Tribune ⬇\n\nThe hometown newspaper has covered the fraud investigation sporadically and the Somali community consistently, but barely ever put the two stories together. After Rufo’s story and Trump’s explosive reaction, the Star Tribune limped in with a story on the Somali community’s concerns about stereotyping and left the tough reporting on accountability to national media. \n\nThe Minnesota governor, who is running for an unprecedented third consecutive term, is under fire for allowing the fraud to blossom under his watch. Walz has come out swinging, showing off some of the modern masculinity he was supposed to bring to Kamala Harris’ presidential ticket. But with indictments mounting and reporters sniffing, he is unlikely to emerge unscathed. \n\nDonald Trump’s MRI ⬆\n\nThe president is in a confident mood after the shooting in D.C. by an Afghan immigrant and the fraud scandal bolstered the argument for his immigration policy. So confident that he responded to a barb from Tim Walz about mental acuity by promising to release the results of his MRI scan. Trump admits he has no idea what the results will show. \n\n‘People of East African descent‘ ⬇\n\nThe term of art adopted by the some left-wing media or avoid confirming right-wing stereotypes of Somalis. This despite the fact that most of the indictees are either Somali immigrants or of Somali heritage. No one seems to be concerned about stereotyping other East African communities of Kenyan and Ethiopian heritage who have made Minnesota their home. \n\nPayMeToDoYourHomework.com ⬆\n\nThe website was listed as one of the places a defendant in the fraud case spent his stolen money. Abdimajid Mohamed Nur was sentenced to 10 years in prison for taking $47 million to pay for 18 million meals that were never prepared or served. Nur, who graduated high school with a 1.75 GPA, paid $12,000 to the web service and graduated with a bachelor’s degree and a 3.75 GPA.

Be grateful for our nation","text":"In May, Michelle Obama, who, with her husband, has a net worth of approximately $70 million with homes in Martha’s Vineyard, Washington, and Chicago, complained about having to pay for her own food while living in the White House. “If you say you want some exotic fruit, ‘Yes, ma’am, we’ll get that right away,’ and then you get the bill for a peach and it’s like, that was a $500 peach?” Imagine the horror of having to pay for your own produce while living in the most famous rent-free mansion on Earth.\n\nShe has also complained, at length, about how her eight-year stint in the White House stifled her ambitions and imposed upon her the burden of a “glam team,” — “it’s not a luxury to have a hair and makeup team,” she said.\n\nAbsent from her commentary is even a whisper of gratitude for the country that made her into quasi-royalty, heaping fortunes and fame upon this daughter of the South Side of Chicago and electing her husband president twice with a majority of the popular vote.\n\nNo, in Michelle Obama’s eyes, America remains unworthy of her approval. At a recent stop on tour for her new book, The Look: A Life in Style, the former first lady scolded Americans for being insufficiently enlightened about women in politics. Speaking at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with actress Tracee Ellis Ross, she framed 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s loss as proof of America’s deep-seated misogyny, declaring that the nation “ain’t ready” for female leadership and has “a lot of growing up” to do before even entertaining the idea of a woman in the Oval Office — let alone her.\n\n“That’s why I’m like, ‘Don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying,’” she remarked. “’You’re not ready for a woman. You are not. So don’t waste my time.’”\n\nIn Michelle Obama’s mind, the frequent attempts to draft her for the Democratic nomination for president amount to pestering because America is not yet mature enough to select a leader of her caliber. And Harris’s failure, according to her, has nothing to do with runaway inflation, millions of illegal immigrants crossing through a wide-open border, or wars breaking out around the globe but is reducible to her anatomy. Unlike Michelle Obama and her elite pals, ordinary people lack the sophistication — or perhaps the moral courage? — to choose a president based on their sex, not their policies or record.\n\nBarack Obama, too, has made plain his disappointment with America in recent times. In the lead-up to the last election, he famously lectured “the brothas” for not rallying around Harris. Again, the implication being that black people, particularly black men, owe their votes to the Democratic Party out of racial solidarity rather than weighing the same economic pain, crime concerns, and border chaos as everyone else.\n\nHis dismay at the state of our politics, captured over the years by his condescending catchphrase “that’s not who we are!” extends to the nation as a whole — he frequently laments the “toxicity and division” in our politics, as if he played no part in sharpening the divide through incessant identity politics.\n\nAnd now, he admits to thinking little of the Democratic Party. Just last week, he huddled with dozens of freshman House Democrats with the goal, according to a person close to him, of building “a sustainable Democratic Party that can survive without him.” Given the current makeup of Washington, Barack Obama might want to consider whether the Democratic Party can survive with him.\n\nThankfully, people have moved on despite the lecturing, while the Obamas continue to cling bitterly to their glory days of influence. Perhaps people wouldn’t be so eager to turn the page on the couple if they showed a little gratitude for the nation that made them royalty once.","summary":"For most, the holiday season sparks feelings of gratitude, hope, and humility.

Sure. You have a problem with it? You know what? I think there’s something wrong with him. \n\n“Anybody that would do what he did, anybody that would allow those people into his state and pay billions of dollars out to Somalia– We give billions of dollars to Somalia. It’s not even a country because it doesn’t function like a country. It’s got a name but it doesn’t function like a country.”\n\nThe bulk of Trump’s original post was directed at the “Great American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World, for being ‘Politically Correct,’ and just plain STUPID, when it comes to Immigration.”\n\nHe used the mental health slur against Walz, who was Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election, while attacking the Democratic governor for having a large Somali population in his state. \n\nWalz hit back by posting a screenshot of the insult, which he captioned, “Release the MRI results.”\n\nThe Minnesota Governor again pushed back on Trump’s insult again on Meet the Press, where he said that he felt, as a teacher and a parent, the president’s language was “damaging.”\n\n“He's normalized this type of hateful behavior and this type of language,” Walz added. “And mainly, look, at first, I think it's just because he's not a good human being, but secondly to distract from using competency.”\n\nWalz has been a campaigner for greater support for Americans with disabilities, being the parent to a son with nonverbal learning disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety disorder.\n\nMeanwhile, a Republican state legislator in Indiana announced that he would move against Trump’s efforts to redraw the state’s congressional district lines, on the basis of the slur being used. \n\nAnnouncing his opposition to Trump’s gerrymandering scheme, Senator Mike Bohacek demanded that the president prove that “his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority.”\n\n“I have been an unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities since the birth of my second daughter,” Bohacek wrote on Facebook. “Those of you that don’t know me or my family might not know that my daughter has Down Syndrome. \n\n“This is not the first time our president has used these insulting and derogatory references and his choices of words have consequences.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for comment.","summary":"Trump’s use of the mental health slur cost him the support of at least one Republican senator, whom he had wanted to help redraw congressional district lines","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-tim-walz-slur-b2875477.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/01/8/49/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-08-31-39.png?crop=2014,1342.7,x0,y0&trim=0,0,56,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vPC9YlA8-kPrKkZNL.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-01 09:52:27","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.487},{"id":383861674,"title":"DC terrorist's red flags : He locked himself in a dark room and carried horrors from the 'death squad'","text":"Alleged Washington DC shooter Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who last week killed a U.S. National Guard soldier in Washington, D.C., and wounded another, underwent a process of radicalization only after his entry to the United States was approved Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revealed Sunday night when asked about Lakanwal’s motive. Lakanwal, 29, cooperated with U.S. forces fighting the Taliban while in Afghanistan and fled after the terror group seized power again, later resettling in the United States with the approval of American authorities. He is expected to be charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 20-year-old soldier Sarah Beckstrom. The soldier he wounded, Andrew Wolfe, remains hospitalized in serious condition. “We believe he went through a process of radicalization since he came here to this country,” Noem said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We believe it happened through connections within his community.” In terrorism contexts, “radicalization” is generally used to describe those influenced by extremist Islam who begin carrying out violent acts in its name. Lakanwal entered the United States in 2021, during the massive and chaotic operation carried out by President Joe Biden’s administration as the U.S. military withdrew all its forces from Afghanistan after 20 years of war, while the Taliban stormed Kabul and other cities and took control from the pro-Western government. Thousands of Afghans who had worked with the United States against the Taliban flooded Kabul’s airport at the time to escape on American aircraft, fearing the Islamist group would use the withdrawal to take revenge on them. U.S. officials confirmed that, before coming to the United States, Lakanwal served in “Unit Zero,” the Afghan “partner force” that fought the Taliban with assistance from the CIA. In the United States, Lakanwal settled in Washington state. For Wednesday’s attack, on the eve of Thanksgiving, he traveled distance from his home state to the capital, and there, a few blocks from the White House, shot the two American soldiers. President Donald Trump and his allies, on whose watch Lakanwal’s asylum request was approved in April, blamed Biden for allowing him into the country and said the previous administration failed to adequately vet Afghans evacuated in haste to the United States during the Taliban takeover. Noem repeated those claims Sunday in an interview with ABC. She said Lakanwal may have undergone screening and an approval process after entering the United States, but argued that the process “was not done properly.” Trump also again blamed the previous administration. \"Crooked Joe Biden, Mayorkas (the homeland security secretary in the Biden administration), and so-called “Border Czar” Kamala Harris really screwed our Country by letting anyone and everyone in without any screening or verification!” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Following last week’s attack, the Trump administration suspended all residency visas for Afghan citizens and froze decisions on all pending asylum requests. In recent days, the president disclosed that he is also considering deporting Lakanwal’s family, including his five children, all under 12. Asked about that possibility, he said his team is currently examining it. 'Blood, bodies, the wounded — he couldn’t bear it' Since the weekend, more and more accounts have surfaced about red flags that should have been raised regarding Lakanwal’s behavior. Reports say he suffered for years from severe mental health problems, including locking himself in a dark room, away from his wife and children, without speaking to them. Acquaintances say he struggled to keep stable employment and would take long solo trips across the country — lasting weeks — to cope with his condition. According to people who knew him, his mental state at one point deteriorated so badly that members of his community contacted a refugee aid organization out of fear he would take his own life. Documents attached to that appeal around March 2023 said he had ceased functioning as a person and father. That same year, his family faced eviction after months of unpaid rent. Relatives testified that they often sent his young sons into the dark room where he had shut himself to hand him a phone or pass messages, because he would not respond to anyone else. On one occasion when his wife left him alone with the children for a week to visit relatives, the children were not bathed, their clothes were not changed for the entire week, and they did not eat properly. Their school staff raised concerns about their condition. Acquaintances say Lakanwal periodically went through bouts of “mania,” during which he suddenly tried to rehabilitate himself and cooperate with welfare officials assisting his family, but these periods were brief, and after a week or two he would relapse. A friend said he struggled to cope with the horrors he witnessed and the violence he carried out during his service in the elite Afghan unit. “When he saw blood, bodies, and the wounded he couldn’t bear it,” a childhood friend told The New York Times. The unit in which Lakanwal served, “Unit Zero,” was dubbed by many as a “death squad.” It is unclear what role he held there, but its missions are known to have included night raids and covert operations, and they were suspected of involving executions as well.","summary":"Alleged Washington DC shooter Rahmanullah Lakanwal struggled to cope with the horrors he witnessed and the violence he carried out during his service in the elite CIA-supported Afghan unit","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/byuytccbbx","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/27/B1Z1YzL11Wx/B1Z1YzL11Wx_0_0_850_479_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 09:44:16","author":"Ynet","authors":["Ynet"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.363},{"id":383826530,"title":"Schoen and Mangel: Could Dems look to Shapiro for 2028?","text":"By virtually every metric, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is the front-runner for Democrats’ 2028 presidential nomination. \n\nFresh off a high-profile win on Proposition 50, Newsom leads almost all individual polls, giving him a 6-point lead (26% to 20%) over 2nd place Kamala Harris in the RealClearPolitics polling aggregator.\n\nNevertheless, there is another governor who could be a formidable challenger atop Democrats’ ticket in 2028: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nTo be sure, Shapiro does not have the national profile that Newsom does. So far, the most national attention he’s received came in the summer of 2024, when Harris was considering him for her running mate. \n\nAnd yet, lacking a strong national “brand” early on is not fatal in and of itself, as former President Barack Obama knows \n\nIn November 2005 – analogous to this point in the 2008 cycle – polling showed Hillary Clinton (41%) leading John Edwards (14%) and Al Gore (12%), with Obama not even included.\n\nStill, while a lack of name recognition can be overcome, Shapiro faces a number of hurdles should he decide to run.\n\nHe’s doggedly centrist at a time of increasing partisanship. \n\nIn that same vein, his support for Israel – to say nothing of his Judaism – is increasingly anathema to the far-left, which makes up a large part of Democrats’ primary electorate.\n\nHowever, Shapiro does have a number of strengths that others – particularly Newsom – do not, which could make him a strong candidate who Democrats should not overlook.\n\nForemost is his proven ability to carry Pennsylvania, the most important swing state. \n\nAptly named, the Keystone State – which Shapiro has won three times as attorney general then governor – holds the keys to the White House for any Democrat, given today’s electoral math. \n\nMoreover, polling among Pennsylvania voters suggests Shapiro would likely win again.\n\nIn a hypothetical 2028 matchup, Shapiro beat VP J.D. Vance by 10-points (53% to 43%) – including a 58% to 33% lead with independents – per Quinnipiac polling.\n\nPresident Trump won the state by less than one-half of a percentage point in 2024. \n\nTo that end, while Newsom’s advantage in national Democratic polling is clear, Democrats should be clear eyed about the fact that in order to win, they need someone who appeals to moderate swing voters, not solely coastal elites and progressives.\n\nPut another way, as Binyamin Applebaum posited in the New York Times, “A cardboard cutout of a presidential candidate could win California…and another 15 deep blue states. The question Democrats need to answer…is what kind of Democrat can win Pennsylvania.”\n\nIn his 2020 run for attorney general, Shapiro won more votes than both Joe Biden and Donald Trump did that year.\n\nLikewise, in 2022, running for governor, Shapiro not only held onto all of Biden’s 2020 voters, but also brought in Trump voters in key suburban areas, per a Pennsylvania political analyst. \n\nMoreover, according to the aforementioned Quinnipiac poll, six-in-10 (60%) Pennsylvania voters – including 66% of Independents – approve of the job Shapiro is doing. Just 28% disapprove.\n\nIt’s easy to see why. \n\nSince being elected governor, he’s secured a $20 billion investment from Amazon, delivered over $1 billion for farmers along with $500 million for business development, won funding for hiring more than 1,500 police officers, historic funding for K-12 education, and unprecedented permitting reform – all while cutting taxes.\n\nNotably, Shapiro has done all of this and more with a divided government, an impediment Newsom has never had to navigate in the deep-blue confines of Sacramento.\n\nFor their part, Republicans understand the threat Shapiro poses.\n\nGOP strategist David Urban said over the summer that, “Republicans will try to bang (Shapiro) up.” But, Urban continued, “whoever’s going to run against Josh is going to be pushing a big rock up the hill.”\n\nBehind Shapiro’s enduring popularity is his prioritization of delivering tangible wins for constituents, rather than endlessly appealing to “vibes” or spending considerable time waging partisan warfare.\n\nDescribing his time in office, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, “Mr. Shapiro, who has built a reputation of working across party lines, has remained popular while emphasizing a mantra of ‘Get (expletive) done.’” No wonder his official motto is “G-S-D.”\n\nPolitically, Shapiro’s pragmatic centrism is both a benefit and an obstacle. \n\nIt would certainly help in a general election.\n\nConversely, it would be an obstacle with a primary electorate increasingly dominated by the far-left. \n\nFurther complicating matters is that while Shapiro often sparred with Trump during his first term – as attorney general – he has taken a much softer approach as governor. \n\nSimilarly, during the height of the redistricting fight over the summer, Shapiro made no effort to redraw Pennsylvania’s maps.\n\nMost of this was due to political realities – the state legislature is GOP-controlled – but with Democratic voters prioritizing candidates with strong anti-Trump bona fides, Shapiro’s head-down approach may hurt him in the primaries. \n\nFinally, Shapiro’s biggest vulnerability in a Democratic primary is the elephant in the room that many, including the New York Times, Van Jones, USA Today, NBC, and others, attribute to the reason he was passed over for Harris’ VP slot – his Judaism and support for Israel. \n\nThis has had a real world impact on Shapiro.\n\nWhen, last April, someone threw Molotov cocktails into the governor’s residence – where Shapiro and his family had just finished their Passover dinner – the attacker stated that he targeted Shapiro due to his support for Israel.\n\nUltimately, assuming Democrats’ goal is to win the 2028 election and not merely placate their progressive base, Shapiro is the sort of candidate who could pose a genuine and formidable threat to Vance or any other Republican.\n\nThat being said, he would have to make it to a general election first. \n\nAs long as the far-left remains the most potent force in Democratic primaries, his support for Israel and centrist beliefs present considerable obstacles, despite his credentials or ability to win critical swing voters.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.

Jasmine Crockett Wins 2025 Turkey of the Year Award","text":"It is an annual tradition on our Ringside Politics TV and radio programs to award a “Turkey of the Year” during Thanksgiving week. This designation is bestowed on an especially worthy politician, bureaucrat or celebrity who deserves such special recognition.\n\nOur previous winners have included both Republicans, such as former Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney, and Democrats, such as former President Joe Biden. Most of our Ringside Politics “Turkey of the Year” winners are distinguished by foolish behavior, an ornery disposition, and idiotic actions, just like their ugly bird namesakes.\n\nThis year, as usual, we asked our audience members to submit their nominations for 2025 “Turkey of the Year” consideration. To say we were bombarded with worthy candidates is an understatement. Undoubtedly, 2025 was a particularly good year for “Turkeys.”\n\nThe list of qualified nominees was extensive and included local favorites such as New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, recently indicted, who left her successor with a $160 million budget deficit.\n\nOthers receiving consideration were U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), the creator of the federal government shutdown, and U.S. Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ), who could be court-martialed due to his participation in the “Seditious Six” video.\n\nAn especially popular nominee was 2024 “Turkey” winner, former Vice President Kamala Harris, who embodies this award in every sense. However, no repeat winners are allowed, thus she was excluded from consideration.\n\nLike Harris and other previous winners, our 2025 award recipient is a real “Turkey.” In fact, she is a “jive turkey,” a foolish congresswoman who exaggerates and makes empty promises. Of course, the 2025 winner of the Ringside Politics “Turkey of the Year” Award is U.S. Representative Jasmine Crockett, D-TX.\n\nFormer employees have called Crockett a “diva” and a “boss from hell.” In response, Crockett said the criticisms are evidence that she has “arrived, honey.” In a New York Post expose, former employees said that Crockett was “a terror to work with,” and was often “rude,” and would “scream” at her staff.\n\nShe would “rarely” show up for work and spent most of her time lying “around her apartment.” When she did go to the office, Crockett demanded staffers “chauffeur” her in an “Escalade.” A former employee said that Crockett would sit “in the back seat” because it was a “power play,” and the staffer would be treated as an “Uber driver.”\n\nCrockett dismissed the criticism as evidence of both sexism and racism. In a CBS interview, Crockett said the “hate” motivated her to “continue to do what I do.”\n\nSo, what does Crockett do? She is known for her negative President Donald Trump comments and for advocating a far-left agenda. She also makes ludicrous comments on a regular basis.\n\nIn a MSNBC interview, Crockett claimed that “It is not a criminal violation to enter the country illegally… It’s not a crime.” Sorry, Jasmine, it is a crime, according to U.S. Code Title 8, Section 1325.\n\nIn a speech lambasting President Trump’s campaign to deport illegal aliens, Crockett said America is a “country of immigrants” who do the work that Americans do not want to do. She claimed that Americans were “done picking cotton! We are. You can’t pay us enough to find a plantation.”\n\nObviously, Crockett was referring to pre-Civil War America, since today, almost all cotton is not picked by hand. Instead, farmers use large pieces of mechanical equipment.\n\nSeveral months ago, Crockett faced criticism for her insensitive remarks about wheelchair-bound Governor Greg Abbott (R-TX). She called him “Governor Hot Wheels,” leading her colleague, U.S. Representative Randy Weber, R-TX, to sponsor a censure resolution, although it was never introduced for a formal House vote.\n\nCrockett’s behavior has captured Trump’s attention. He has called her “a lowlife,” and “a low IQ (intelligence quotient) person who I can’t even believe is a congressperson.” However, he also posted on social media that “Jasmine Crockett is the future of the Democrat Party!”\n\nIf the President is right, Crockett may be a formidable candidate for the U.S. Senate in Texas. She is weighing whether to enter the race. In an interview on MS NOW, Crockett said that she is “closer to yes than I am no.”\n\nOne poll shows her leading in the race for the Democratic Party nomination with the support of 31% of voters. Republicans in Texas should pray that Crockett enters the race. Her history of outrageous statements and her support of far-left views would make it extremely difficult for her to win the Lone Star state. Maybe Massachusetts, but not Texas.\n\nHer chances of victory will not be helped by her propensity to make ridiculous statements that are laughably wrong. For example, on the House floor, Crockett claimed she was going to “expose it all” regarding convicted pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. She listed Republicans, including current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, who received donations from “somebody named Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\nShe strongly insinuated that Zeldin received contributions from the disgraced sex trafficker. Instead, Zeldin received donations from a different person, a Long Island, New York neurosurgeon named Dr. Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhen confronted with her mistake, Crockett refused to apologize or amend her remarks. She blamed the lack of time to investigate and the fact that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) does not place photos next to each donor’s name on their records.\n\nShe said her research team made sure that Dr. Jeffrey Epstein was from the “New York area” like the convicted pedophile. However, she mistakenly said that donations were made before the sex trafficker died. Instead, Dr. Epstein donated to Zeldin in 2020, months after the other Jeffrey Epstein died in prison.\n\nFor revenge, Dr. Epstein told the New York Post, “I should contribute money to Jasmine Crockett and then let everybody know that she also took money from Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\nBetter yet, Dr. Epstein, do not waste your money for Jasmine Crockett does not deserve a donation, only recognition as the Ringside Politics “Turkey of the Year.”","url":"https://townhall.com/columnists/jeffcrouere/2025/12/01/rep-jasmine-crockett-wins-2025-turkey-of-the-year-award-n2667164","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/310/e90722bb-d3a2-4859-8263-cb27780ad46b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-01 05:01:00","author":"Jeff Crouere","authors":["Jeff Crouere"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":383778804,"title":"Why Conservatives Are (Seemingly) Losing the Israel/Anti-Semitism Fight","text":"There is growing American hostility to Israel.\n\nIt all started with the universities, and from there, the younger generations, who are all bought into the groupthink imposed by their professors.\n\nMajor Islamic interests have flooded American universities with big money and are pressuring administrators, fundraisers, and professors to give a glowing appraisal of the Muslim world and Islam, while bashing Israel.\n\nBut there is a larger problem at work, one which exposes a long-standing failure of the conservative movement: winning the argument by predicting the opposition’s case and refuting it effectively. \n\nOne can see the political and cultural fallout that ensued from the redefinition of marriage. President Bush declared during the 2004 debates that he did not know if people were “born gay” or not. John Kerry, going with the progressive leftist talking points, asserted that people are “born that way.”\n\nThe fact that conservatives showed no interest in pushing back on these lies allowed those lies to fester and proliferate.\n\nConservatives knew what they believed, and they stood by their views, but after the Cold War, when everything was nice and peaceful around the world, domestic problems, including cultural Marxism, continued to rear their ugly heads, and conservatives didn’t have the truth prepared with well-researched evidence.\n\n“I just believe that marriage is between one man and one woman,” US Senator and Presidential candidate John McCain said to Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show in 2008. “But, I want to get married, too,” she retorted, painting McCain as backward and bigoted because he wouldn’t support a rash and destructive redefinition of marriage.\n\nConservatives needed to get back to basics about the fundamental norms and civilizing agency that marriage provides to our society. Yet conservatives didn’t do their research, and they didn’t have answers. Same-sex marriage became the norm, the broad talking point, and then, when the Supreme Court imposed the radical destruction of marriage on the country, conservatives didn’t have any pushback.\n\nThe same problem is plaguing the Zionist cause and the case for Israel.\n\nTo his credit, Alan Dershowitz wrote The Case for Israel in 2003, but there was no need then for either political party or its partisans to review and reaffirm their views. All of that changed with President Obama, who took more adversarial stances with Israel and openly differed, even defied Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The growing Muslim immigration has also forced politicians, especially in blue areas of Michigan as well as New York City, to accommodate differing views on social and foreign policy.\n\nThe advent of The Jihad Squad (AOC, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, etc.) into Congress gave a voice to anti-Semitic elements, forcing the Democratic Party to tolerate them, if not outright embrace them. Pro-Palestinian Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib defeated the African-American political machine in the Detroit area, and the broad progressive movement, based on intersectionality, anti-Western sentiment, and a general need to support the dispossessed or marginalized, lined up behind the Palestinian Cause. In contrast, they castigated the Jewish State as “white adjacent”, Western, and therefore colonialist and even “white supremacist.”\n\nThe DEI-CRT-BLM cult included in its frequent activism and attacks denunciations of Israel. I still remember Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, when they were sending angry acolytes to my home city’s city council meetings, they not only railed against the police department and systemic racism, but they were bashing Israel and demanding Justice for Palestine. No one said anything at the time, convinced that such empty left-wing rants wouldn’t amount to much.\n\nHow times have changed, with massive pro-Palestinian (read, pro-terrorist) protests and riots breaking out on college campuses and public squares across the country. The brazen abuses of the progressive left have included harassing high-ranking Democratic politicians, including presidential candidate Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris. Their hatred of Israel is all-consuming, and it’s devouring the well-being of America’s body politic.\n\nFor decades, the Republican Party included broad support for Israel, largely because the Evangelical vote was a core constituency of the Republican Party, and Christians support Israel due to kinship respect for the Bible, Judeo-Christian heritage of the country. Nothing could have disturbed that commitment.\n\nToday, Christians are losing touch with their Bibles, and churches have abandoned sound Biblical literacy. They can’t defend their support for Israel or explain why Christian Zionism is sound doctrine in the church. Taking advantage of the distractions and dearth of knowledge, Anti-Zionists have stepped in, effectively questioning foreign policy bona fides for Israel.\n\nEven PragerU has posted videos supporting Israel, but some of them leave key details out. In one video, an American general makes the case defending the $3 billion a year that we send to Israel, and then argues that we should be sending them more.\n\nSure, Israel’s government and leaders have engaged in military failures that have harmed Americans in the past. So have many governments. But Anti-Zionists have capitalized on these events, taking advantage of the relative ignorance of the general public, and have begun denouncing the Jewish State. Where is the Zionist movement to counter these lies?\n\nCombined with this outrage, Alt-right activists have championed the “research” of Kevin MacDonald, a disgraced academic who served at Cal State Long Beach. His most notorious work, The Culture of Critique, argues that Jews have been behind the majority of anti-Western movements, including the rise of Communism and Cultural Marxism. His thesis is subjective, his use of data is spotty, and his standards for evaluating evidence are shoddy.\n\nI remember the encouraging response of one of Kevin MacDonald’s colleagues at Cal State Long Beach: Dr. Arlene Lazarowitz, who opposed efforts to revoke MacDonald’s tenure. She was Director of Jewish Studies on campus, was very proud of her Jewish heritage, and she defended MacDonald’s academic freedom, and she urged students and scholars alike to challenge his views.\n\nAt the time of publication, however, no serious academics took MacDonald’s work … seriously. And that was a mistake. And here we are today. A growing cohort of young (conservative?) voters now hate Israel, believe that Israel controls our foreign policy, and Jewish thinkers and politicians are poisoning or undermining our domestic policy.\n\nThe answer to the rising anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not to shout “Racist, Bigot, Terrorist!” at the unfounded attacks on the Jewish State. Advocates must meet these arguments head-on and counter them with research, evidence, and Biblical truth. Instead of mocking the anti-Zionists and their white nationalist “thought leaders” as failed college kids living in their parents’ basements, investigate their claims and expose the lies. I think that Ben Shapiro should debate Nick Fuentes, for example, but I think no less of him if he chooses not to. Mark Levin should debate Tucker Carlson, although chances are Tucker would tuck and run.\n\nDinesh D’Souza took on Fuentes and bested him. Cam Higby debated the anti-Semitic survivor of the USS Liberty attack, Phil Tourney, and turned the tables on him. What is needed is more debate, not less.\n\nBut to do that, conservatives have to develop broad, evidence-based reasons for their support, rather than falling back on tradition and religion alone. This has been the broad weakness of the conservative movement (and I am tattling on myself here), and it’s time to remedy that.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

However, when Soldiers are ambushed and shot just blocks away from the White House in our Nation's capital, it shocks us. And so is the case with 20-year-old US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, who volunteered to take a Thanksgiving tour of duty to protect the streets of Washington, DC, so that others could enjoy Thanksgiving with family. Sarah was shot in the chest and head, and we lost her. US Air Force SSG Andrew Wolfe is fighting for his life.\n\nBoth were shot by an Afghan national who was allowed entry into our country, and it appears not properly vetted. And just so we are all on the same sheet of music, \"Green on Blue\" incidents were commonplace in Afghanistan, meaning Afghan Soldiers firing upon US troops. This shooter, I will never say his name, arrived in our Nation via the worst military debacle in US history, the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Oh, and this is not the first time we have had Afghan nationals seeking to harm Americans. Previously, there was one who plotted an attack during our November 2024 elections and another who opened fire on three police officers in Virginia.\n\nNot Our Fault!\n\nBut what has been the leftist response to this heinous shooting? Yes, it is someone else's fault. What was known as the Democrat party, now the American Marxist Leftist Party, is the party of no responsibility.\n\nThink about it, why were SPC Beckstrom and SSG Wolfe in DC? They were there because of the high level of violent crime in our Nation's capital, and I mean some disturbing high-visibility crimes. And this is the case in countless Blue cities across America, but when have you heard any of these leftists take responsibility? Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Memphis. Nah, it is so much easier to blame someone else. After all, if someone had not ordered the National Guard to be on the streets of DC, perhaps this shooting would not have happened. No mention of the rampant crime, which explains the need for better and more effective safety and security measures. I guess we should just keep allowing women to be set afire or stabbed to death as leftist judicial activists continue to release violent criminals onto our streets, but take no responsibility in doing so.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Afghanistan debacle, in which Kamala Harris said she was part of the decision, they took no responsibility. When 13 brave Americans lost their lives in Kabul at the Karzai International Airport, who took responsibility? I do know that Joe Biden was too busy to attend their ramp ceremony, so he had to check the time. I guess he needed to call in a lid for the day, or head to the beach in Delaware. We abandoned our real, vetted, US interpreters and their families, along with $80B of military equipment and weapons, with no responsibility to be taken by Biden and crew.\n\nDuring the regime of Barry Soetoro, aka Barack Hussein Obama, or whatever name he uses, they took no responsibility for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Matter of fact, it was Obama who told Dmitry Medvedev to convey to Vladimir Putin that he would have \"more flexibility\" after his reelection. As if he could bend even more over? Joe Biden continued that trend as we watched Russia continue its invasion of Ukraine, funny, after Kamala Harris went to Ukraine.\n\nAnd, as always, what does the left do? Blame someone else.\n\nTaking Responsibility… Not\n\nAmericans are facing the financial burden of having their government, aka Obamacare, healthcare premiums rise by year's end. Not a single Republican voted for Obamacare, but now, somehow, it is the Republicans’ fault. The subsidies are rising, not because of Republicans but because the Democrats planned it that way. I have yet to hear one single member of the Marxist leftist party say to the American people, “We screwed you.” Nope, they inflicted more pain on the American people for 40+ days in a government shutdown for no apparent reason, other than the left does not want to take responsibility for their failed healthcare policy and actions. So, now, if Republicans do not continue the failure of government (read taxpayer funds and bailout subsidies that go directly to insurance companies who jacked the prices because they are banking on getting said subsidies), it is Republicans' fault.\n\nRemember, when you subsidize something, you get more of it. In this case, you get rising healthcare premiums. When you tax something (Marxists' favorite thing), you get less of it, meaning economic production.\n\nThere are the unconstitutional actions taken on our border, which have cost the lives of nearly 300K Americans due to fentanyl poisoning and attacks by criminal illegal immigrants. However, the blame is with law enforcement officers who are now trying to enforce the law that leftists irresponsibly didn’t. Oops, I am sorry, the border was secure all this time.\n\nOr how about the way that leftists beat up and even assassinate those who they do not want to speak, and then call others fascists. Remember, everybody is guilty of creating an environment of violent political rhetoric, even though leftists are the only ones shooting people and burning down buildings. Leftists do not take responsibility for their anti-Semitic protests and alignment with Islamic jihadists, but refer to everyone else as being Nazis.\n\nThen we have the now infamous Seditious Six, who are playing the victim instead of accepting responsibility for their seditious speech. And no, their actions are based on no evidence of illegal orders being given. An illegal order is not based upon something happening that you do not like.\n\nFunny, Barry, Barack, whatever, had a target list in his office and was drone-attacking terrorists. No problem there. So, we have one Senator Mark Kelly going on Jimmy Kimmel and other leftist outlets playing the tough guy victim role. My recommendation to the Senator from Arizona: go and get fitted for a US Navy dress uniform, you're gonna need it, Capt. Kelly, since you are still under the jurisdiction of the UCMJ.\n\nIsn't it just grand that when you try to hold Marxist leftists responsible and accountable for their heinous, illegal, and unconstitutional actions, they cry like babies? Which begs the question, why vote for a bunch of irresponsible, whining babies? Perhaps the answer is that they have an appeal to other irresponsible, whining babies who need safe spaces and suffer from mental conditions and derangement syndromes.\n\nI learned an important maxim from my service in the Army: \"Leaders take responsibility, they never take credit.” It is time that America stops selecting imbecilic, irresponsible charlatans as elected officials. It is time for the adults to step up, as responsible adults, and do what is necessary to lead this Nation. It starts with telling the American people what they need to hear, not what they want to hear.\n\nSteadfast and Loyal.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?
