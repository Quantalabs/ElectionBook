The Biden administration has also released more than $137 million in federal funds – including $100 million in transportation funds for North Carolina to begin rebuilding damaged roads and bridges.\n\nMore than 800 people unable to return home are staying in lodging provided through FEMA, and 22 shelters are still housing nearly 1,000 people as mobile feeding operations continue to help survivors.\n\n“My Administration is sparing no resource to support families as they begin their road to rebuilding,” Biden said. “We will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders – regardless of political party and no matter how long it takes.”\n\nEarlier Sunday, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tills called for more resources to bolster the relief effort and likened the damage to Hurricane Katrina’s mark on Louisiana in 2005.\n\n“The scope of this storm is more like Katrina,” he told CBS News’ Margaret Brennan on “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan”. “It may look like a flood to the outside observer, but again, this is a landmass roughly the size of the state of Massachusetts, with damage distributed throughout. We have to get maximum resources on the ground immediately to finish rescue operations.”\n\nMr. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have all traveled to some of the impacted regions. \n\nHurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains and killed more than 225 people across multiple states. That number includes 114 killed in North Carolina alone.\n\nThe White House said Mr. Biden has also been briefed on Hurricane Milton, which is forecast to make landfall in Florida’s Tampa Bay area as a major storm on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. disaster relief chief blasts false claims about Helene response\n\nDeanne Criswell, who leads the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said on Sunday that the recent false claims and conspiracy theories about the federal response to the storm are “demoralizing” aid workers.\n\n“It’s frankly ridiculous, and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,” she said. “It’s really a shame that we’re putting politics ahead of helping people, and that’s what we’re here to do. We have had the complete support of the state,” she said, referring to North Carolina.\n\nRepublicans, led by Trump, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.\n\nTrump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants who are in the United States illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on Israel, Ukraine and other foreign countries.\n\nTillis, a Republican, on Sunday rejected that claim, telling “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” that resources being used on immigration is “not yet … affecting the flow of resources to western North Carolina.”\n\nTillis said the stream of misinformation about relief efforts in North Carolina is a “distraction.”\n\n“I believe that we have to stay focused on rescue operations, recovery operations, clearing operations, and we don’t need any of these distractions on the ground,” Tillis said. “It’s at the expense of hard-working first responders and people that are just trying to recover their lives.”\n\nMr. Biden said in a statement Sunday that his administration “will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders –- regardless of political party and no matter how long it takes.”","summary":"President Biden approved the mobilization of another 500 active-duty troops to North Carolina to assist in the recovery efforts after the deadly and devastating Hurricane Helene. &#8220;With a total of 1,500 troops now supplementing a robust on-the-ground effort – including more than 6,100 National Guardsmen and more than 7,000 Federal personnel – the Biden-Harris Administration &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Biden sends more troops to North Carolina for continued Hurricane Helene response appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/biden-sends-more-troops-to-north-carolina-for-continued-hurricane-helene-response/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/06/86dc5682-fed8-4856-9df5-f72f4a9a60b3/thumbnail/1200x630/0bc53609239657f92e8551d36b43f380/ap24276625450365.jpg?v=0736ad3ef1e9ddfe1218648fe91d6c9b","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-07 00:05:11","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":258702660,"title":"Adam Schiff says Trump has ‘more reason’ to challenge election results in 2024","text":"Trump has claimed numerous times since leaving the White House that he did not lose the 2020 presidential election against then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, with Schiff predicting a similar response from Trump should he lose the 2024 election against Vice President Kamala Harris. Ahead of the election next month, the former president has been in several legal battles while on the campaign trail, which Schiff referenced when predicting Trump’s potential objection to the 2024 election results.\n\n“He has more reason to contest it than he did before, not because of any flaw in the election, but because Donald Trump believes, and perhaps with reason, that if he doesn’t succeed at the ballot box, he may be going to jail,” Schiff said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “So he’s going to challenge the results, and we saw tragically what happened when he did that four years earlier. And what’s more, we see him laying the same foundation to fraudulently challenge the results once again, putting up the same big lies that he put out four years earlier.”\n\nSchiff was one of many Democrats who called on Biden to suspend his reelection campaign following the first presidential debate and also suggested Harris could win “overwhelmingly” against Trump. When asked if he still believes this to be the case, he argued Harris can still claim victory, though the race is currently “scary close.”\n\nEarlier this month, a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith was unsealed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, in which prosecutors claim that Trump responded “so what” when he was told then-Vice President Mike Pence was in danger on Jan. 6, 2021. Schiff argued the timing of this filing’s unsealing was appropriate about a month ahead of the 2024 election, as the Supreme Court dragged its feet on deciding whether former presidents have any immunity.\n\nSchiff was then pushed on why he supports the timing of Smith’s filing getting unsealed when he was previously critical of FBI Director James Comey for reopening the investigation into presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails shortly before the 2016 election. The California congressman defended his stance, as Comey “unilaterally” deciding to investigate Clinton was “a very different circumstance” compared to Smith’s filing getting unsealed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nLegal analyst Jonathan Turley cautioned that the timing of this filing could “backfire” on the case’s prosecutors. He also said Smith’s briefing was an attempt to make “his closing election argument to voters because he knows that the 2024 election will be the largest jury verdict in history.” \n\nTrump argued on Thursday that the federal charges related to his alleged efforts to interfere with the 2020 election should be dismissed, citing the Supreme Court’s ruling on Jan. 6 rioter Joseph Fischer. The rioter’s conviction under an obstruction statute was overturned by the Supreme Court, with Trump’s legal team arguing the same statute is misapplied in Smith’s federal case against the former president.","summary":"Rep.

No, I think there’s going to be another attempt.

The 34-year-old singer was commonly seen with several celebrities by her side, and her girl gang would often be seen celebrating holidays and special occasions at a soiree thrown by Swift, herself.\n\nIn the last several years, the “The Last Great American Dynasty” singer has largely been seen with her pals while supporting her football superstar boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in the VIP suites of his football games.\n\nThere is the occasional exception, such as when she was spotted strutting down the street with the HAIM sisters, following her split with actor and beau of six years, Joe Alwyn.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSwift has also been spotted having the occasional dinner with longtime friend and record producer, Jack Antonoff. Why does it seem like fans can count the “loml” songstress’ friendship outings on one hand?\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBeing one of the biggest superstars in the world comes with great responsibility. Swift has her blockbuster ‘Eras Tour’ to think about, she’s seemingly always crafting new music, and of course, she has her private life with her football guy.\n\nWith her packed schedule, witnessing the “Maroon” singer out in public is a rare occasion. So much so that the reception to Swift’s emergence can get out of hand, such as last Summer’s pandemonium at Antonoff and now-wife Margaret Qualley‘s wedding rehearsal dinner.\n\nOnlookers swarmed the rehearsal dinner’s location with many filming Swift as she left the restaurant. Footage of her exit later made it to social media, as The Blast previously reported.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe “Peter” singer reportedly had a “visible reaction” to the chaos going on around her but remained composed and smiling for and endless stream of cameras.\n\nAs a result, Swifties pleaded for the singer to be allowed privacy on social media. The conversation would later inspire the X hashtag, “leave her alone.”\n\nOne particular Swiftie had this to say regarding the public’s response to the “Exile” singer:\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“Every single person there taking pictures, swarming the restaurant, and peeking inside aren’t fans. It’s disgusting and a huge invasion of privacy. She was at her best friends f**ing wedding. LEAVE HER ALONE. She deserves it. Stop being an insecure person that you have to get out your phone just for the attention or go to a restaurant and swarm it forcing her to leave. It’s so rude and just because she is a star doesn’t mean she doesn’t deserve privacy. She deserves every second of it. I can’t even believe this happened and all these ‘fans’ should reflect on their life and how they conduct themselves. I love you Taylor and you absolutely shouldn’t have had to leave Jacks wedding because of these people,” one Swiftie wrote in the comments of an Instagram photo.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMore than a year after the aforementioned incident at Antonoff’s wedding, the singer is seemingly doing all she can to make sure her friendships are staying private, even if it means saying ‘no.’\n\nThe twosome’s friendship has recently been brought up in connection with reality television; reports surrounding a TV plot about the women behind the Kansas City Chiefs previously questioned whether the blossoming buddies would be involved, and the answer could disappoint some Bravo fans.\n\nBravo reality series may be a good way for reality TV devotees to get the inside scoop on their favorite reality stars’ topsy-turvy friendships but don’t count on Swift to bring cameras into her private moments with her pals.\n\nFollowing the reports suggesting that both Mahomes and the “Florida!!!” singer could be involved in the previously filmed Bravo plot, it has been revealed that both women are keeping themselves away from the cameras.\n\nAccording to People, a source said, “Taylor and Brittany are not part of the show at all, and will not even be filmed.” The insider also shared the “False God” singer’s reasoning for distancing herself from the project.\n\n“Taylor especially is very protective of what little private life she has left,” they added.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSwift’s protectiveness for her friendships could be reflected in the source’s next tidbit of news.\n\n“She enjoys all the ladies she has met, but she will not be a part of Bravo’s storyline,” the source continued.\n\nAs one of the most followed (and arguably most scrutinized) celebrities in the world, it would make sense if Swift would like to keep the public away from her friendships in order to minimize the negative chatter.\n\nAn X user noted, “I do find it disappointing that Taylor can’t drop Brittany. Like, why is she so loyal to this friendship of ten months.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAnother chimed in, “Taylor Swift, an assault victim, is endorsing a sexual predator for president by being with Brittany. Taylor Swift is endorsing racism, transphobia, and bigotry. Actions speak louder than words and she has just endorsed Donald Trump for president,” Swift later publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential election.\n\nUnrest over Swift’s endorsement of a candidate in the 2024 Presidential election was later put to rest.\n\nBoth Harris and Walz publicly acknowledged and thanked the “Only The Young” singer for her endorsement. The current Vice President called out Swift’s “Courage” for her public declaration, and Governer Walz did as well, as previously reported by The Blast.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBack in the day, pop icon Taylor Swift would commonly be surrounded&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Taylor Swift declines reality show to maintain privacy in friendships. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-declines-reality-show-to-maintain-privacy-in-friendships/","image":"https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/0x0/2024/09/11104527/taylor-swift-brittany-mahomes-scaled.jpg?","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 23:37:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.306},{"id":258701884,"title":"Could NZ foreign policy be Trumped? Why the government will be hoping Kamala Harris wins the US election","text":"Getty Images\n\nOne of the political ironies of the race for the White House is that the foreign policy interests of New Zealand’s centre-right government are probably best served by Democratic candidate Kamala Harris winning.\n\nSince the end of World War II, all New Zealand governments have supported multilateralism and an international rules-based order enshrined in the institutions of the United Nations.\n\nThe relationship with the United States has reflected that, and tends to outlast the periodic fluctuations associated with changes in government and policy in Wellington or Washington.\n\nNew Zealand’s current National-led coalition inherited close relations with the US, too. American visitor numbers were second only to Australians last year. The US is our third largest export market. And the two countries remain strategically linked within the Five Eyes intelligence sharing arrangement.\n\nNevertheless, one of the key foreign policy goals of the coalition is to strengthen alignment with traditional allies such as the US. Given the very different worldviews of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, the November 5 election will have a large bearing on how successful any push for closer relations with the US can be.\n\nCloser relations in the balance\n\nOn the one hand, Republican candidate Trump is opposed to multilateral institutions, unless they explicitly serve US national interests. And he wants to reverse the impact of globalisation by constraining immigration, free trade and global governance.\n\nNationalist slogans like “America First” promise a return to a so-called golden era of patriotism and sovereignty: a top-down world where the greatest power of all is unencumbered and free to assert its dominance.\n\nOn the other hand, Harris would seem to support a more traditional US foreign policy agenda. This recognises the importance of international institutions and alliances in a world where “isolation is not insulation”.\n\nWhoever occupies the White House next, then, is likely to have a significant impact on New Zealand foreign policy.\n\nIsolation and dominance: Trump plays the immigration card at Republican National Convention in July 18.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPower plays and the Pacific\n\nFirst, Trump’s belief in an international system run by great powers would seem to be a recipe for depriving smaller states like New Zealand of a voice on international issues that affect them.\n\nSecond, New Zealand’s regional focus on ties with Pacific Island nations – underpinned by close people-to-people links and a significant proportion of the country’s overseas development aid programme – is more likely to be complemented by a Harris foreign policy.\n\nOutgoing president Joe Biden reversed decades of US neglect of much of the Pacific, which had played to the advantage of other external powers – notably China.\n\nThe Biden team launched the annual US-Pacific Islands Summit in 2022. And Kamala Harris played an active role in delivering US$800 million in development and climate assistance to Pacific Island nations in 2022-23.\n\nWhether Trump will maintain this enhanced diplomatic and economic engagement in the Pacific (and elsewhere) is questionable. Similarly, after Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Accord, Trump will probably quit it for a second time.\n\nKamala Harris hosts Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in September.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAUKUS and Ukraine\n\nThird, the New Zealand government faces the delicate task of navigating relations with an increasingly assertive China – the country’s biggest trade partner – while pursuing its goal of moving closer to the US.\n\nSince March 2023, successive New Zealand governments have been considering joining an arrangement to share advanced defence technologies under pillar two of the AUKUS security partnership that aims to deter a rising China in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIt remains to be seen how China would react if New Zealand did join. But Trump’s insistence on US primacy in any multilateral agreement could make it more difficult for the government to win domestic support for pillar two membership.\n\nEven outside the AUKUS debate, Trump is more likely to insist allies spend more on defence than they did traditionally.\n\nFourth, New Zealand has a big stake in the failure of Russia’s attempted annexation of Ukraine. Wellington’s interests are clearly more in line with Harris’ pledge to maintain support for Ukraine to restore its territorial integrity.\n\nTrump’s promise to end the war within 24 hours, on the other hand, could probably only be achieved by giving Vladimir Putin what he wants.\n\nThe Middle East and the UN\n\nFinally, there do not seem to be substantive policy differences between Trump and Harris on the catastrophic situation in Gaza, and increasingly Lebanon.\n\nThere remains a slim possibility a Harris administration might recognise unconditional support for the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu is not sustainable for a superpower whose foreign policy is supposed to be driven by universal values and respect for international law.\n\nBut this would be near impossible for Trump. Indeed, he would probably provide Netanyahu with even greater support.\n\nOverall, the foreign policy interests of the National-led coalition seem to align more with a Harris presidency than one led by Trump.\n\nBut even if Harris wins, the alignment of interests will not be perfect. US exceptionalism – an informal ideology that claims the nation is a political exemplar for the rest of the world – and Washington’s veto power in the UN security Council are likely to remain constraining factors on the New Zealand-US relationship.\n\nThe authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.","summary":"The government’s push for closer relations with the US could be undone by a Trump victory in November.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/could-nz-foreign-policy-be-trumped-why-the-government-will-be-hoping-kamala-harris-wins-the-us-election-279381.html","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/623717/original/file-20241005-15-xjz2mq.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=40%2C24%2C5351%2C3564&q=45&auto=format&w=496&fit=clip","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 23:30:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.222},{"id":258701722,"title":"S&P 500’s $8 trillion rally will be tested by tricky earnings season","text":"The S&P 500 Index has soared roughly 20% in 2024, adding more than $8 trillion to its market capitalization. The gains have largely been driven by expectations of easing monetary policy and resilient profit outlooks. \n\nBut the tide may be turning as analysts slice their expectations for third-quarter results. Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report a 4.7% increase in quarterly earnings from a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s down from projections of 7.9% on July 12, and it would represent the weakest increase in four quarters, BI data show.\n\n“The earnings season will be more important than normal this time,” said Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research. “We need concrete data from corporates.“ \n\nIn particular, investors are eager to see if companies are postponing spending, if demand has slowed, and if customers are behaving differently due to geopolitical risk and macro uncertainty, Parker said. “It is exactly because there is a lot going on in the world that corporate earnings and guidance will particularly matter now,” he said.\n\nReports from major companies start arriving this week, with results from Delta Air Lines Inc. due Thursday and JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. scheduled for Friday. \n\n“Earnings seasons are typically positive for equities,” said Binky Chadha, chief US equity and global Strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. “But the strong rally and above-average positioning going in (to this earnings season) argue for a muted market reaction.”\n\nObstacles Abound \n\nThe obstacles facing investors right now are no secret. The US presidential election is just a month away with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump in a tight, fierce race. The Federal Reserve has just started lowering interest rates, and while there’s optimism about an economic soft-landing, questions remain about how fast central bankers will reduce borrowing costs. And a deepening conflict in the Middle East is raising concerns about inflation heating up again, with the price of West Texas Intermediate oil rising 9% last week, the biggest weekly gain March 2023. \n\nRead more: Mideast War Risk Puts Spotlight on Iran’s Quiet Oil Comeback\n\n“The bottom line is that revisions and guidance are weak, indicating lingering concerns about the economy and reflecting some election year seasonality,” said Dennis DeBusschere of 22V Research. “That is helping set up reporting season as another uncertainty clearing event.”\n\nPlus, to make matters more challenging, big institutional investors have little buying power at the moment and seasonal market trends are soft.\n\nPositioning in trend-following systematic funds is now skewed to the downside, and options market positioning shows traders may not be ready to buy any dips. Commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, are expected to sell US stocks even if the market stays flat in the next month, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. And volatility control funds, which buy stocks when volatility drops, no longer have room to add exposure.\n\nHistory appears to side with the pessimists, too. Since 1945, when the S&P 500 gained 20% through the first nine months of the year, it posted a down October 70% of the time, data compiled by Bespoke Investment Research show. The index gained 21% this year through September.\n\nBar Lowered\n\nStill, there’s reason for optimism, specifically a lowered bar for earnings projections that leaves companies more room to beat expectations.\n\n“Estimates got a little bit too optimistic, and now they’re pulling back to more realistic levels,” said Ellen Hazen, chief market strategist at F.L.Putnam Investment Management. “It will definitely be easier to beat earnings because estimates are lower now.” \n\nIn fact, there’s plenty of data suggesting that US companies remain fundamentally resilient. A strengthening earnings cycle should continue to offset stubbornly weak economic signals, tipping the scales for equities in a positive direction, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Even struggling small-cap stocks, which have lagged their large-cap peers this year, are expected to see improving margins, BI’s Michael Casper wrote.\n\nFriday’s jobs report, which showed the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined, quelled some concerns about a soft labor market. \n\nAnother factor is the Fed’s easing cycle, which has historically been a boon for US equities. Since 1971, the S&P 500 has posted an annualized return of 15% during periods in which the central bank cut rates, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. \n\nThose gains have been even stronger when rate-cutting cycles hit in non-recessionary periods. In those cases, large caps posted an averaged annualized return of 25% compared with 11% when there was a recession, while small caps gained 20% in non-recessionary periods compared with 17% when there was a recession.\n\n“Unless earnings are a major disappointment, I think the Fed will be a bigger influence over markets between now and year-end simply because earnings have been pretty consistent,” said Tom Essaye, founder and president of Sevens Report Research. “Investors expect that to continue.”","summary":"Companies in the S&#038;P 500 are expected to report a 4.7% increase in quarterly earnings from a year ago, the weakest increase in four quarters.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/10/06/earnings-season-preview-q3-reports-sp500-stock-market-outlook/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2176503298-e1728255630649.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 23:08:42","author":"Bloomberg,Esha Dey,Natalia Kniazhevich","authors":["Bloomberg","Esha Dey","Natalia Kniazhevich"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":258700232,"title":"Kamala Harris tells Call Her Daddy podcast what her mom taught her about ‘agency and autonomy’","text":"Kamala Harris attributed everything she knows about “agency” to her mom during her October 6 interview with popular podcast Call Her Daddy. \n\nThe vice president and Democratic presidential nominee joined podcast host Alex Cooper in Washington DC for an unfiltered interview where they talked about her upbringing as well as sexual assault, abortion rights, and criticisms against her.\n\nHarris discussed her childhood growing up with two divorced parents and being primarily raised by her mom, Shyamala Gopalan Harris. When asked by Cooper what “values” her mom “instilled” in her, she said she learned the importance of expressing her emotions. \n\n“My mother definitely impressed upon us the importance of being able to express how we were feeling,” Harris told Cooper.\n\n“And a lot of it, I think, was her teaching us that we had agency, and so, that things don’t just happen to you,” she said. “So, think about how you’re feeling, not just as a way to dump, but also as a way to kind of figure out where you are in a moment and center yourself.” \n\nThe former prosecutor explained how when she was in her late teens and early twenties, her mom wouldn’t accept that her problems weren’t in some way self-inflicted. \n\nShe noted: “I’m telling you, every time I came home with a problem, if I came home with a problem, the first thing that my mother would do is she would look at me ...

This wasn’t the case in her household. \n\n“But here’s the thing that I realized, she was actually teaching me, ‘Think about where you had agency in that moment and think about what you had the choice to do or not do,’” she explained. \n\nShe said she learned how to “take charge of a moment.” \n\nHarris said she quickly learned that you can’t control every situation.\n\n“But don’t just let things happen to you without thinking about, ‘What can I do in this moment?’” she said.\n\nThe other lesson Harris’ mom taught her is not to do anything “half-a**ed.”\n\nWhen thinking about how she’s implemented her mother’s lessons in her political career, Harris said she focused on her desire to “protect the most vulnerable” and anyone who has had their “power” taken away from them. \n\nCooper also brought up comment from Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said during a rally for Donald Trump that “doesn’t have anything keeping her humble” because she doesn’t have her own biological children.\n\nHarris is the stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s two children, Ella and Cole.\n\n“There are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,” Harris said.\n\n“A whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life,” she said. “And I think it’s really important for women to lift each other up.” \n\nCall Her Daddy is streaming on Spotify.","summary":"Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for October 6 episode","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-podcast-b2624787.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/06/22/MixCollage-06-Oct-2024-05-46-PM-9769.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FtjiLM5E-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-06 23:03:01","author":"Kaleigh Werner","authors":["Kaleigh Werner"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.09},{"id":258700388,"title":"Trump Suggests Mandatory Voting in Rambling Wisconsin Rally Speech","text":"During the middle of yet another rambling rant about how the 2020 election had been stolen from him, Donald Trump claimed on Sunday that one path to a victory over Kamala Harris is to make voting mandatory in battleground states.\n\n“The only way to avoid this miserable thing for America is if Wisconsin and the entire Midwest turn and, I mean, turn out in record numbers,” the former president told rally goers in Juneau, Wisconsin.\n\n“We need a mandate in the vote, and we’re going to get it,” he said.

It will be the first time Musk has appeared at a Trump campaign event since endorsing the former president after the July 13 assassination attempt.\n\nTrump narrowly escaped being shot in the head in Butler by a bullet that whizzed by and left his right ear bleeding, a near-miss that exposed serious gaps in security for the former president and led to heightened protection measures for his subsequent outdoor rallies.\n\nIn mid-morning, a large crowd was lined up to gain access to the event site at the local fairgrounds, and many were chanting the “fight, fight, fight” slogan that Trump used to rally his followers moments after he was shot.\n\nTrailers were lined up around the site as a protective measure, blocking the view, for example, from the building where the shooter had opened fire.\n\nIt was the first of two attempts on Trump’s life. On Sept. 15, a gunman hid undetected for nearly 12 hours at Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, with plans to kill him, prosecutors have said, but was thwarted by a U.S. Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Trump.\n\nRepublican officials hope Trump’s return to Butler will generate more support among his hard-core followers and drive up turnout for him in Pennsylvania, a state that he and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, see as crucial to winning on Nov. 5.\n\n“I’m going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler,” Trump told the NewsNation cable news network earlier this week. “We never finished what we were supposed to do.”\n\nTrump also will be joined at the rally by his vice presidential running mate, Senator JD Vance, and the family of firefighter Corey Comperatore, who was fatally shot during the attempt on Trump’s life.\n\nAnother attendee of the July rally, Shane Chesher, 37, said he would return on Saturday for what he expects will be an emotional event.\n\nChesher said he witnessed the assassination attempt from a seat on the stage behind Trump and is still processing what happened.\n\n“Honestly, I don’t know that I understand still to this day what we experienced that day,” Chesher said in an interview.\n\nReturning to the site, he said, “will be spiritual, and I think it will be very emotional, good and bad.”\n\nThe Butler shooting led to widespread criticism of the U.S. Secret Service and the resignation of its director.\n\nCritics raised concerns about how the 20-year-old suspect, Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was subsequently shot to death by Secret Service agents, was able to access a nearby rooftop with a direct line of sight to where Trump was speaking.\n\nA Secret Service probe found communication gaps and a lack of diligence ahead of the shooting. In its aftermath, the agency approved extra security measures for Trump, including using bulletproof glass to shield him at outdoor rallies.\n\nSecret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement before Saturday’s rally that there had been “comprehensive changes and enhancements to our communications capabilities, resourcing and protective operations.”\n\nTrump credits turning his head to read a chart on a big video as having saved his life. With blood dripping down his face, he raised a fist and shouted “fight” to his supporters, a vivid image from that day. He wore a white bandage on his wounded ear for days after the shooting.","summary":"BUTLER, Pennsylvania >> Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday will return to the rural Pennsylvania site where he was nearly assassinated for a rally in the critical battleground state exactly one month before the Nov. 5 election.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/10/06/breaking-news/trump-returns-to-site-of-assassination-attempt-in-pennsylvania-2/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/web1_2024-10-06T010255Z_1144346610_RC2NEAABJUUT_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 23:00:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":258700010,"title":"Kamala Harris on 'Call Her Daddy' Podcast: 5 Takeaways From Interview","text":"In a highly anticipated appearance on the popular Call Her Daddy podcast, Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris engaged in a candid conversation with host Alex Cooper.The episode, released on Sunday, covered a wide range of topics, from reproductive rights to personal attacks.Here are five key takeaways from the interview:Unwavering Stance on Abortion RightsHarris discussed the current state of abortion access in America.\"One out of three women in our country are in states with abortion bans,\" she stated and described the challenges faced by women in these states, particularly mothers.Harris added: \"Imagine she is in a state with an abortion ban and she's a mom. So she is going to have to figure out one, God help her if she has affordable childcare, God help her if she has paid leave, and then she is going to have to go to the airport, stand in a TSA line, sit on a plane next to a perfect stranger, to go to a city where she has never been, to receive the care she needs.\"The vice president emphasized that reproductive health clinics provide essential services beyond abortions. \"Do you know what those clinics also do? They do paps, they do breast cancer screenings, they do HIV testing, and they are having to close in many places with these bans,\" she noted.Harris also addressed claims about late-term abortions from former President Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, calling them \"a bold face lie\" and \"outrageously inaccurate.\"\"That is not happening anywhere in the United States. It's so insulting to suggest that that would be happening and that women would be doing that,\" the vice president said.Newsweek has contacted Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung via email on Sunday for comment.Highlighting her commitment to reproductive rights, Harris stated, \"I was the first vice president or president to ever in office go to a reproductive health center, ever.\"On the changing perspectives regarding abortion, Harris noted, \"What I'm finding as I travel, people who before two years ago, before Roe V. Wade was overturned, people who felt very strong about that they are anti-abortion, anti-abortion, are now seeing what is happening and saying, 'hm, I didn't intend for all of this to happen.'\"She concluded by emphasizing the importance of personal choice in health care decisions: \"You don't have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree, the government shouldn't be telling her what to do. If she chooses, she'll talk to her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling you what to do and that's what is so outrageous about it.\"Her Choice of Being Childless and Responding to That \"Humble\" CommentHarris responded to Arkansas GOP Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders' comments that the vice president \"doesn't have anything keeping her humble\" because she doesn't have children.Harris responded: \"I feel sorry for her and I'm going to tell you why because I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who one, are not aspiring to be humble, two, a whole lot of women out here, who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life and I think it's very important for women to lift each other up.\"Harris later discussed her own family situation, \"I have two beautiful children, Cole and Ella, who call me Mamala. We have a very modern family.\"She also elaborated on her approach to blended families: \"My husband's ex-wife is a friend of mine and also I'm a child of divorced parents and when I started dating Doug, my husband, I was very thoughtful and sensitive to making sure that until I knew that our relationship was something that was going to be real, I didn't want to form a relationship with the kids and then walk away from that relationship.\"Student Loan Forgiveness and Economic IssuesHarris acknowledged the financial obstacles facing young Americans, particularly in housing and family planning.\"We are fighting and I'm going to continue to fight for student debt relief,\" she stated, adding that the administration has already forgiven student loan debt for millions of people \"including doubling the amount of student loan forgiveness for public servants like nurses and teachers and firefighters.\"On housing affordability, Harris explained: \"Part of my plan is to work with home builders in the private sector to create tax incentives to build by the end of my first term 3 million more housing units.\"The vice president also proposed \"$25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers\" and tax credits for middle-class families, including \"a $6,000 tax cut for the first year of their child's life.\"On Sexual Abuse and Making America Safer for WomenHarris emphasized the importance of open dialogue about sexual abuse.\"Part of the issue is that people don't talk about it. I don't mean the survivors of it; I mean nobody does. And the more that we let anything exist in the shadows, the more likely it is that people are suffering and suffering silently, and we need to talk about it,\" she stated.She added: \"Child sexual assault is something that affects far more people than the public discourse about it acknowledges and the more we talk about it, the more we will address it and deal with it, the more we will be equipped to deal with it, in terms of schools, in terms of society at large and to not stigmatize it.\"Harris also addressed economic factors in abusive situations, saying, \"When a woman and particularly if she has children, if she is economically reliant on her abuser, she is less likely to leave, because most women will endure whatever personal, physical pain they must in order to make sure their kids have a roof over their head or food.\"The vice president also responded to Trump's claims about protecting women at a September campaign event. The former president cast himself as a \"protector\" of women, saying in the battleground state of Pennsylvania that he will save all women from \"fear\" and \"loneliness\" so they will no longer have to think about abortion.Harris responds, \"So he, who, when he was president, hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe V. Wade and they did just as he intended and there are now 20 states with Trump abortion bans, including bans that make no exceptions for rape or incest, which we just discussed, which means that you're telling a survivor of a crime with a violation of their body, they don't have a right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral.\"On \"Cat Ladies\" and Personal Attacks From the RightWhen asked about various attacks on her character from political opponents, including Trump's running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance's comments about \"childless cat ladies,\" Harris remained resolute. \"I think it's really important not to let other people define you. And usually, those people who will attempt to do it don't know you,\" she stated.Addressing these comments directly, Harris said, \"I just think it's mean and mean spirited. And I think that most Americans want leaders who understand that the measure of their strength is not based on who you beat down, the real measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.\"Newsweek has also contacted Harris' campaign via email on Sunday for comment.","summary":"Harris called Trump's abortion claims \"a bold face lie,\" addressed the \"cat lady\" remarks, and discussed reproductive rights.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/call-me-daddy-kamala-harris-alex-cooper-podcast-takeaways-1964663","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488632/kamala-harris-alex-cooper.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 22:54:21","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":258699842,"title":"Trump on the stump, Harris hits airwaves in razor-edge US election","text":"With just one month left in a deadlocked US presidential election, Donald Trump urged supporters on Sunday in battleground Wisconsin to get out the vote as Kamala Harris kicked off a week-long media interview blitz with a focus on reproductive rights.\nPolls have the Republican and Democrat candidates neck and neck, fuelling a high-cost, high-intensity scramble for each and every wavering voter in the seven key states that are likely to decide the outcome on November 5.\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 and this was his fourth visit in eight days. Harris was there earlier this week, holding a rally in Ripon, birthplace of the Republican Party, where she appealed to moderate and disgruntled conservatives.\n“I’m only asking you to do one thing,” Trump told the crowd in the town of Juneau. “Just go out and vote.”\nTrump also repeated false allegations that the Biden-Harris administration had redirected relief funds for areas devastated by Hurricane Helene and spent it on migrant programmes.\nHarris, he said, is “someone who steals your wealth and abandons your family when the floodwaters rise”.\n\nHarris has faced criticism for seemingly avoiding one-on-one interviews with national media since she took over as the Democratic nominee, and Trump hammered away at this on Sunday.\n“She doesn’t do interviews because she can’t answer the questions. She can’t answer anything,” he said.\nIn her bid to reach key voters, the vice-president is taking to the airwaves in the coming week with a host of television, radio and podcast appearances.\nHarris began her media flurry with an appearance on Sunday on the podcast Call Her Daddy – one of the most popular programmes on Spotify – that focuses on advice and issues affecting women.\nShe addressed reproductive rights – which Democrats view as a major vote winner among undecided voters, especially women.\n\nAt one point Harris was asked how she felt when she heard Trump, in their presidential debate last month, say that some Democratic states allow the “execution” of babies after birth.\nIn an impassioned reply, Harris denounced that as “a boldfaced lie”, something “outrageously inaccurate” and “insulting to women”.\n“This guy,” she added, “is full of lies.”\nAsked how she was feeling with just a month to go before the election, the vice-president replied, “nervous” – then jokingly mentioned what she called an adage: “there are only two ways to run: without an opponent or scared.”\n\nTrump’s visit to Wisconsin came on the back of a theatrical campaign return on Saturday to the same venue in Butler, Pennsylvania where he narrowly avoided a would-be assassin’s bullet in July.\nThe former president campaign’s team had hoped to recapture the momentum he enjoyed at that time -riding high in the polls before US President Joe Biden upended the race by withdrawing and being replaced by Harris.\nIn a long, often rambling speech delivered from behind bulletproof glass, Trump suggested his political opponents may have been behind the failed assassination bid.\n“Those who want to stop us … have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me,” he told tens of thousands of supporters who had gathered for the event.\nThe gunman, who was shot dead, was a registered Republican and investigators have found no motive – and no political link – to his attempt on the former president’s life.\nHarris spent Saturday in North Carolina, meeting relief workers and residents in one of the areas most impacted by Helene, which left a trail of destruction across half a dozen states and more than 220 people dead.\nLater in the week, she will also be a guest on ABC’s The View, as well as The Howard Stern Show and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert – all of which are seen as generally sympathetic to the Harris campaign.\nAnd former president Barack Obama will add his star power by stumping for Harris in key swing states from Thursday right through until election day, the campaign says.","summary":"Trump urged supporters in battleground Wisconsin to get out the vote as Harris kicked off media blitz with podcast on reproductive rights.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3281302/trump-stump-harris-hits-airwaves-razor-edge-us-election","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/07/622bdbb2-4e5f-4931-a8cd-c1c7f0f11c33_4dc346a9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 22:51:05","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":258698794,"title":"Kim Jong Un attempts display of power after threatening to nuke South Korea 'without hesistation'","text":"Tyrant Kim Jong Un has put on a show of North Korea's military power - days after sending a chilling message to neighbours in the south about his willingness to use nukes. \n\nThe country's official news agency showed the dictator inspecting live artillery firing by graduates of its top military academy. Kim watched cadets from O Jin U Artillery Academy in action at a secret location. During the drill he spoke again about his country’s willingness to use all available weaponry, including nuclear weapons, should he feel North Korea's sovereignty is threatened.\n\nState media, KCNA, reported on Sunday that the dictator stressed the importance of 'constantly training the guerrilla war tactics to wipe out the enemies through rapid mobile and surprise operations'. It comes just two days after Kim threatened to use nuclear weapons and destroy South Korea permanently and 'without hesitation' if provoked. \n\n\"If such a situation comes, the permanent existence of Seoul and the Republic of Korea would be impossible,\" Kim said, using South Korea's official name. There have been heightened tensions in recent weeks over the North's recent disclosure of a nuclear facility and missile testing. Last week, South Korea staged its own military parade where it showcased its bunker-busting 'monster' missile, fighter jets and American bombers.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the day that North Korea tries to use nuclear weapons would be the end of the Kim government because Kim would face \"the resolute and overwhelming response\" of the South Korean-US alliance.\n\nThe latest images of Kim issued by state media, show him clad in his familiar leather jacket. Kim said it was Seoul and Washington who were 'destroying regional security and peace', KCNA reported, while branding South Korea's leader 'an abnormal man'.\n\nSince 2022, Kim has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons pre-emptively. But many foreign experts say it's still unlikely that he would use his nuclear arms first because his military is outmatched by the US and its allied forces. In July, South Korea and the US signed a deal on integrating forces to better deal with North Korea's advancing nuclear program. \n\nThough South Korea has no nuclear weapons, the US stations tens of thousands of troops in the country. Its presence has remained since the Korean war ended in 1953 without a peace treaty.\n\nYoon is set to embark on a three-nation diplomacy trip that includes a stop in Laos for summits with Southeast Asian and other world leaders. He'll emphasise that North Korea's nuclear disarmament is essential to regional peace.\n\n\"At the upcoming ASEAN-related summits, I will stress the importance of denuclearisation of North Korea, which is a prerequisite for realising a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,\" Yoon said.\n\n'This will serve to send a clear message that the international community will never condone North Korea's reckless actions,\" reports the Mail.\n\nAnimosities between the Koreas are at the worst point in years with Kim's provocative run of missile tests and the South Korean-US military exercises intensifying in a cycle of tit-for-tat. All communication channels and exchange programs between the rivals remain stalled since 2019, when a broader US-North Korea diplomacy on ending the North's nuclear programme collapsed.\n\nIn January, Kim called for rewriting North Korea's constitution to eliminate the idea of a peaceful unification between the war-divided countries and to cement the South as an \"invariable principal enemy.\"\n\nObservers think North Korea's parliament will constitutionally declare a hostile \"two-state\" system on the Korean Peninsula to formally reject reconciliation with South Korea and codify new national borders.\n\nMany foreign experts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions like sanctions relief, after a new US president is elected. Both North and South Korea will be paying keen attention to the outcome of the next US elections.\n\nKim likely thinks a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump would increase his chances to get what he wants rather than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, says observers. But Yoon said the alliance is 'ironclad' regardless of the outcome.\n\nSince late May, North Korea has launched thousands of rubbish-carrying balloons toward South Korea, prompting South Korea to resume anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas.","summary":"The dictator of North Korea has been showing off the country's military arsenal and speaking again about his willingness to use nuclear weapons if threatened","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/kim-jong-un-attempts-display-33833082","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33833154.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_NKOREA-POLITICS-MILITARY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 22:21:42","author":"Paul Greaves","authors":["Paul Greaves"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.094},{"id":258700076,"title":"How important is Wisconsin? Trump’s now visited 4 times in 8 days","text":"JUNEAU, Wis. — Donald Trump on Sunday visited Wisconsin for the fourth time in eight days as his campaign showers attention on a pivotal state where Republicans fret about his ability to match Democrats’ enthusiasm and turnout machine.\n\n“They say that Wisconsin is probably the toughest of the swing states to win,” Trump said in his opening remarks at an airplane hangar in a rural Juneau where the overflow crowd spilled out on to the tarmac. “I don’t think so.”\n\nVoters in Wisconsin are already casting absentee ballots and in-person early voting begins Oct. 22. Trump stood on stage for nearly two hours, touching the third rail of Wisconsin politics by overlapping with a Green Bay Packers game, drawing derision from Democrats. But that didn’t stop thousands of people from sticking with Trump as he urged supporters to begin to vote by mail and early, when the time comes, so they turn out “in record numbers.”\n\n“If we win Wisconsin, we win the presidency,” Trump said.\n\nWisconsin is perennially tight in presidential elections but has gone for the Republicans just once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. A win in November could make it impossible for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to take the White House.\n\n“In the political chatter class, they’re worried,” said Brandon Scholz, a retired Republican strategist and longtime political observer in Wisconsin who voted for Trump in 2020 but said he is not voting for Trump or Harris this year. “I think Republicans are right to be concerned.”\n\nTrump won the state in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 23,000 votes and lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump made his first-ever visit to Dane County, home to the liberal capital city of Madison, in an effort to turn out the Republican vote even in the state’s Democratic strongholds. Dane is Wisconsin’s second most-populous and fastest-growing county; Biden received more than 75% of the vote four years ago.\n\n“To win statewide you’ve got to have a 72-county strategy,” former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, said at that event.\n\nJuneau is a a town of 2,000 about 50 miles north of Madison in Dodge County, which Trump won in 2020 with 65% of the vote.\n\nEarly arrivals filled the hangar, far exceeding the available seating. One large banner behind the bleachers inside said “Vote Early.”\n\n“Make sure we turn out because guess what, I’ve been to Madison,” said U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, who is from Juneau, at the event. “I’ve been to liberal Madison and they’re going to show up. We need to do the same thing because we are the firewall to keep this country independent and free.”\n\nJack Yuds, chairman of the county Republican Party, said support for Trump is stronger in this part of the state than it was in 2016 or 2020.\n\n“I can’t keep signs in,” Yuds said. “They want everything he’s got. If it says Trump on it, you can sell it.”\n\nTrump’s campaign and outside groups supporting his candidacy have outspent Harris and her allies on advertising in Wisconsin, $35 million to $31 million, from when she became a candidate on July 23 through Oct. 1, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nHarris and outside groups supporting her candidacy had more advertising time reserved in Wisconsin from Oct. 1 through Nov. 5, more than $25 million compared with $20 million for Trump and his allies.\n\nThe Harris campaign has 50 offices across 43 counties with more than 250 staff members in Wisconsin, said her spokesperson Timothy White. The Trump campaign said it has 40 offices in the state and dozens of staffers.\n\nHarris rallied supporters in Madison in September at an event that drew more than 10,000 people. On Thursday, she made an appeal to moderate and disgruntled conservatives by holding an event in Ripon, the birthplace of the Republican Party, along with former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of Trump’s most prominent Republican antagonists.\n\nHarris and Trump are focusing on Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the “blue wall” states that went for Trump in 2016 and flipped to Biden in the next election.\n\nWhile Trump’s campaign is bullish on its chances in Pennsylvania as well as the Sunbelt states, Wisconsin is seen as more of a challenge.\n\n“Wisconsin, tough state,” said Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita, who worked on Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s winning reelection campaign in 2022.\n\n“I mean, look, that’s going to be a very tight — very, very tight, all the way to the end. But where we are organizationally now, comparative to where we were organizationally four years ago, I mean, it’s completely different,” LaCivita said.\n\nHe also cited Michigan as more of a challenge. “But again, these are states that Biden won and carried and so they’re going to be brawls all the way until the end and we’re not ceding any of that ground.”\n\nThe candidates are about even in Wisconsin, based on a series of polls that have shown little movement since Biden dropped out in late July. Those same polls also show high enthusiasm among both parties.\n\nMark Graul, who ran then-President George W. Bush’s 2004 campaign in Wisconsin, said the number of campaign visits speaks to Wisconsin’s decisive election role.\n\nThe key for both sides, he said, is persuading infrequent voters to turn out.\n\n“Much more important, in my opinion, than rallies,” Graul said.\n\nMark Seelman, from Watertown, said the energy and size of the crowd sends a message that Trump is strong in Wisconsin.\n\n“Everybody’s into it,” he said during Trump’s speech. “It’s time for a change.”\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

It hit parts of Western North Carolina particularly hard, washing away roads, destroying homes, and leaving millions without power.According to the Associated Press, 227 people have died across six states as a result of the storm, with the number expected to rise as relief efforts continue, making it the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.On Sunday, directors of two major volunteer relief groups, Operation Airdrop and Operation Helo, somberly described the realities on the ground to CNN host Omar Jimenez.Operation Airdrop chairman Doug Jackson struggled to explain the destruction he saw in the region, \"Their homes are gone. What they have around them is all they have left in this world. It's absolutely devastating for them. It's hard to describe, never seen anything like it.\"The volunteer group uses planes and pilots to deliver life-saving supplies to people in need in more remote and inaccessible locations. Jackson said the operation \"had flown 673 flights, delivered over 400,000 pounds by air, and 700,000 pounds by truck, for a total of almost 1.2 million pounds of supplies out of one airport.\"Limited by fixed-wing planes at the Concord-Padgett airport outside of Charlotte, North Carolina, Jackson said he spoke with his friend Matt McSwain, who quickly co-founded Operation Helo to deploy helicopters to hard-to-reach areas. Operation Helo is based out of Hickory Regional Airport in Western North Carolina.McSwain said Operation Helo has \"forged over 400 LZs [helicopter landing zones] over the mountains into the remote locations,\" adding that the operation is \"flying over 400 missions per day, we have over 90 helicopters registered.\"During the interview, McSwain called out the federal government, explaining that when the operation began, \"there was no military presence, there was no military help, there was no FEMA, there was no nothing.\"He continued that today, nearly a week-and-a-half after the hurricane hit, there's \"still no FEMA, still no military, still no nothing, we're begging—this is day eight, nine now.\"Newsweek has reached out to FEMA for comment via email on Sunday afternoon.\"We're tired,\" he added. \"But if we go home, mama and papa won't get their medicine, and they die. So that's why were still forging on.\"McSwain continued: \"We're doing the best we can to keep these people alive,\" pleading that the volunteer groups \"need the military here, we want to go home, we want to turn this over to an operation, we want some help, we need some help, I don't know what else to do to get it.\"Behind McSwain was a map with various nodes showing the location of helicopters, landing zones, and the region's topography. Pointing to the map, he said, \"We are integrated with the military, they are watching what we're doing, but for some reason, they won't show up.\"On Sunday afternoon, Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said nearly 1,000 soldiers \"have been mobilized to support the residents and affected counties devastated by Hurricane Helene in Western North Carolina. These soldiers are closely working with FEMA to provide commodity distribution to local jurisdictions designated by FEMA, in close coordination with North Carolina officials.\"The federal government's response to Helene has come under scrutiny by many, including political opponents and supporters, who say the disaster relief organization isn't doing enough to support Americans in need.On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, announced that FEMA workers were going door-to-door in affected areas to provide residents with immediate relief money worth $750. The $750 is part of a larger effort to provide aid to those impacted by the hurricane.\"FEMA is also providing tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair, to be able to cover a deductible when and if they have insurance, and also hotel costs,\" Harris said at the time.Scrutiny about FEMA spending has increased in recent weeks after FEMA spent money on assisting communities across the country dealing with an influx of migrants through its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). The program had a budget of $640 million for the 2024 Fiscal Year, which ended on September 30.Former President Donald Trump, the GOP's presidential nominee, has criticized the SSP, which helps local governments and nonprofits support migrants. However, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have denied that any FEMA disaster relief funds have gone to the program.\"The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA's disaster-related authorities or funding streams,\" a DHS spokesperson previously told Newsweek.Claims have been surfacing that FEMA doesn't have enough money to assist those in need after Helene, however FEMA has publicly rebuked these rumors, writing on its website, \"FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund has enough funding to support Hurricane Helene efforts and FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts.\"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters Wednesday that while the agency can address immediate needs, \"FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.\"","summary":"Hurricane Helene made landfall last month as a Category 4 hurricane and then tore through the Southeast region of the U.S.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/volunteer-aid-pilot-groups-blast-fema-military-helene-recovery-1964646","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488619/hurricane-helene.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 22:10:31","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":258700762,"title":"Harris, Trump barrel down campaign trail with weeks until election","text":"Oct. 6 (UPI) -- With just several weeks until Election Day, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump scrambled along the campaign trail, Trump holding a rally Sunday in Wisconsin and Harris going after the former president on a podcast.\n\nSaturday, Trump returned to the fateful site where he barely escaped assassination earlier this year in Butler Pa. accompanied by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who encouraged people to register to vote.

No, I think there’s going to be another attempt.

Trump stood on stage for nearly two hours, touching the third rail of Wisconsin politics by overlapping with a Green Bay Packers game, drawing derision from Democrats. But that didn’t stop thousands of people from sticking with Trump as he urged supporters to begin to vote by mail and early, when the time comes, so they turn out “in record numbers.”\n\n“If we win Wisconsin, we win the presidency,” Trump said.\n\nWisconsin is perennially tight in presidential elections but has gone for the Republicans just once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. A win in November could make it impossible for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to take the White House.\n\n“In the political chatter class, they’re worried,” said Brandon Scholz, a retired Republican strategist and longtime political observer in Wisconsin who voted for Trump in 2020 but said he is not voting for Trump or Harris this year. “I think Republicans are right to be concerned.”\n\nTrump won the state in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 23,000 votes and lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump made his first-ever visit to Dane County, home to the liberal capital city of Madison, in an effort to turn out the Republican vote even in the state’s Democratic strongholds. Dane is Wisconsin’s second most-populous and fastest-growing county; Biden received more than 75% of the vote four years ago.\n\n“To win statewide you’ve got to have a 72-county strategy,” former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, said at that event.\n\nJuneau is a a town of 2,000 about 50 miles north of Madison in Dodge County, which Trump won in 2020 with 65% of the vote.\n\nEarly arrivals filled the hangar, far exceeding the available seating. One large banner behind the bleachers inside said “Vote Early.”\n\n“Make sure we turn out because guess what, I’ve been to Madison,” said U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, who is from Juneau, at the event. “I’ve been to liberal Madison and they’re going to show up. We need to do the same thing because we are the firewall to keep this country independent and free.”\n\nJack Yuds, chairman of the county Republican Party, said support for Trump is stronger in this part of the state than it was in 2016 or 2020.\n\n“I can’t keep signs in,” Yuds said. “They want everything he’s got. If it says Trump on it, you can sell it.”\n\nTrump’s campaign and outside groups supporting his candidacy have outspent Harris and her allies on advertising in Wisconsin, $35 million to $31 million, from when she became a candidate on July 23 through Oct. 1, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nHarris and outside groups supporting her candidacy had more advertising time reserved in Wisconsin from Oct. 1 through Nov. 5, more than $25 million compared with $20 million for Trump and his allies.\n\nThe Harris campaign has 50 offices across 43 counties with more than 250 staff members in Wisconsin, said her spokesperson Timothy White. The Trump campaign said it has 40 offices in the state and dozens of staffers.\n\nHarris rallied supporters in Madison in September at an event that drew more than 10,000 people. On Thursday, she made an appeal to moderate and disgruntled conservatives by holding an event in Ripon, the birthplace of the Republican Party, along with former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of Trump’s most prominent Republican antagonists.\n\nHarris and Trump are focusing on Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the “blue wall” states that went for Trump in 2016 and flipped to Biden in the next election.\n\nWhile Trump’s campaign is bullish on its chances in Pennsylvania as well as the Sunbelt states, Wisconsin is seen as more of a challenge.\n\n“Wisconsin, tough state,” said Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita, who worked on Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s winning reelection campaign in 2022.\n\n“I mean, look, that’s going to be a very tight — very, very tight, all the way to the end. But where we are organizationally now, comparative to where we were organizationally four years ago, I mean, it’s completely different,” LaCivita said.\n\nHe also cited Michigan as more of a challenge. “But again, these are states that Biden won and carried and so they’re going to be brawls all the way until the end and we’re not ceding any of that ground.”\n\nThe candidates are about even in Wisconsin, based on a series of polls that have shown little movement since Biden dropped out in late July. Those same polls also show high enthusiasm among both parties.\n\nMark Graul, who ran then-President George W. Bush’s 2004 campaign in Wisconsin, said the number of campaign visits speaks to Wisconsin’s decisive election role.\n\nThe key for both sides, he said, is persuading infrequent voters to turn out.\n\n“Much more important, in my opinion, than rallies,” Graul said.\n\nMark Seelman, from Watertown, said the energy and size of the crowd sends a message that Trump is strong in Wisconsin.\n\n“Everybody’s into it,” he said during Trump’s speech. “It’s time for a change.”\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

You know who doesn't vote much? Rifle owners. We are Second Amendment people; the NRA gave us complete and total endorsement. And during that...they did tell me that people who own guns and rifles don't vote relatively, a very small percentage, like 15 percent,\" the former president said. \"If you would vote nobody would beat us.\"Newsweek could not independently verify that number and reached out to the NRA via email for comment.While gun ownership does fall along partisan lines, gun owners typically lean towards voting Republican as the Democratic Party has generally supported more gun control measures as opposed to the GOP.A study published in Social Science Quarterly in 2017, examined the connection between gun ownership and vote choice. Using information from the General Social Survey—which gathers data on American society to monitor and explain trends in attitudes and behaviors—every four years from 1972 to 2012, University of Kansas researchers found that gun owners and non-owners select candidates based in part on their commitment to firearms and exposure to gun culture. According to the data, since the Richard Nixon-era of the 1970s, possessing a firearm has increased the likelihood of voting for Republican candidates.Trump also called on evangelical Christians to go out and vote, \"I'll tell you another one that don't vote, I love these people, evangelical Christians. The Christian community doesn't vote as much as they should; they go to church. So now what we are going to do is go to church and we are to get out and vote...If they did vote, we couldn't lose an election.\"Newsweek has also reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.This comes as evangelical Christians are a key voter bloc for Republicans, whose support for culturally right-wing policies like opposition to legal abortion and LGBTQ+ rights have long drawn socially conservative, highly religious voters. High turnout among white evangelical voters would be key to a Trump victory in November, but his relationship with the bloc has faced some tension, as his positions on some of these social issues have at times been less rigid than those of other conservatives.According to a poll from Lifeway Research, Trump's support among Christian pastors has changed since 2020 with 61 percent of evangelical pastors who responded to the poll said they plan to vote for Trump, compared to 68 percent in a poll conducted in September 2020.The survey was conducted among 1,003 Protestant pastors from August 8 to September 3. The earlier polling of 1,000 Protestant pastors was held from September 2 to October 1, 2020. In 2020, the poll found Trump with a 32-point lead over President Joe Biden (53 to 21 percent) while the current poll shows the former president with a 26-point lead over Harris (50 to 24 percent).Sunday's campaign rally comes after Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday to complete the speech that was cut short following the assassination attempt on his life on July 13 at the Butler Farm Show.Trump has consistently defended gun rights and is expected to be the keynote speaker at the NRA's \"Defend the 2nd\" event in Savannah, Georgia, on October 22.Harris has also recently made headlines as she spoke about being a gun owner herself, hoping to appeal to moderate and even right-leaning voters who may be wary of a second Trump term but still have reservations about the Democrats' positions on issues like gun control.Harris revealed her personal gun ownership to the surprise of many viewers, during the September 10 debate with Trump and gave more details in her first solo TV interview of the election cycle with Oprah Winfrey last month.\"I'm in favor of the Second Amendment, and I'm in favor of assault weapons bans, universal background checks, and red flag laws,\" Harris said at the \"Unite for America\" event. \"These are just common sense.\"","summary":"Citing low voter turnout among those demographics, Trump urged them on Sunday to vote for him in this year's election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-calls-out-gun-owners-evangelical-christian-voters-1964623","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488613/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 21:56:37","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":258696452,"title":"Harris talks about combating abuse, makes no mention of accusations against husband during interview on sex podcast","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris spoke of strategies to curtail sexual and other types of domestic violence during an interview on a wildly popular podcast Sunday, but the accusations against her husband that surfaced last week never came up.\n\nIn Sunday’s episode of “Call Her Daddy,” Harris, 59, passionately recalled how she began her career as a prosecutor inspired to take on domestic abusers, but host Alex Cooper, 30, declined to press the veep on the thorny topic of her husband allegedly drunkenly hitting an ex-girlfriend, avoiding the issue altogether.\n\n“The first thing that I would say to anyone going through it is tell someone that you trust. Don’t, don’t quietly suffer. You have done nothing wrong,” Harris said about advice she would give to victims of domestic violence. \n\n“Often, the abuser will tell her that if she tells then something worse will happen, and that is usually wrong. And know that there are people that want you to be safe.”\n\nWhile hearkening back to her efforts to combat abuse as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, Harris reiterated the harrowing situation that first inspired her to become a prosecutor. \n\nOne of her best friends in high school, Wanda Kagan, had told Harris she was being abused by her stepfather. That motivated Harris to want to defend others who were suffering from similar terror.\n\n“We have to talk about it. Child sexual assault is something that far more people than the public discourse about it acknowledges,” Harris said while emphasizing the need to “not stigmatize it.”\n\n“Abuse of anyone is something we should all take seriously, as opposed to saying it’s not our business. It’s something that we have to agree should not happen.”\n\nKey to making the US a safer country for women is economics, Harris argued. \n\n“When a woman, and in particular if she has children, if she is economically reliant on her abuser, she’s less likely to leave,” she said. “Most women will endure whatever personal, physical pain they must in order to make sure their kids have a roof over their head or food.”\n\nLeft unmentioned during the interview were the shocking accusations against second gentleman Doug Emhoff from three friends of one of his ex-girlfriends, who claimed he became intoxicated and slapped her back in May 2012, as reported by the Daily Mail. \n\nHis reps later gave a flat denial to those accusations.\n\n“This report is untrue,” an Emhoff spokesperson later told Semafor, adding that “any suggestion that he would or ever hit a woman is false.”\n\nBack in August, Emhoff fessed up to having an affair during his first marriage, after the outlet reported that he cheated on her and got the nanny pregnant. \n\nAt times on the campaign trail, Harris has dubbed her rival, former President Donald Trump a “predator.” The GOP presidential nominee has faced a number of sexual misconduct allegations, all of which he has denied.\n\nTrump was found liable by a jury for defamation and sexual abuse against writer E. Jean Carroll. The 78-year-old is appealing that verdict. \n\nDuring her podcast appearance, Harris laced into Trump for appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ripping him for telling women, “I will be your protector.”\n\nShe also bristled when asked about Trump’s suggestion that she supports abortion “right up until birth, and even after birth.”\n\n“That is so outrageously inaccurate, and it’s so insulting to suggest that would be happening and that women would be doing that. It’s not happening anywhere,” she said. “This guy is full of lies.”\n\nHarris has often demurred when asked about the limitations she would enact on abortion, claiming that she would merely restore the policy first established in Roe v. Wade. Prior to the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, Supreme Court precedent technically did not set gestational limits and instead deferred to the states and Congress. \n\nAt the moment, there are just over half a dozen states and Washington, DC, that do not impose gestational limitations on abortion, according to Axios. \n\nFewer than 1% of abortions took place in the US during or after 21 weeks of gestation back in 2021, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pro-life activists argue that data on late-term abortions is incomplete. \n\nKilling babies after birth is illegal, but Trump appears to be referencing “comfort care” that abortion doctors sometimes administer to a baby that survives a botched abortion procedure — which is generally thought to be rare. \n\nIn the early 2000s, Congress passed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act to provide protections for fetuses and babies that survive abortions. Trump has blasted Democrats for scuttling efforts to strengthen those laws during his first term. \n\nHarris also addressed GOP vice presidential hopeful JD Vance’s swipe at “childless cat ladies,” which she called “mean and mean-spirited” as well as Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ diss at her for not having biological children. \n\n“[There are] a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life. And I think it’s really important for women to lift each other up,” she rebutted. \n\n“Call Her Daddy” was the second-best performing podcast on Spotify last year behind Joe Rogan’s podcast and topped the charts among women.\n\nThe podcast is known for featuring discussions about sex and advice for women.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris spoke of strategies to curtail sexual and other types of domestic violence during an interview on the wildly popular podcast \"Call Her Daddy\" which dropped Sunday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/06/us-news/kamala-harris-talks-about-combating-abuse-makes-no-mention-of-accusations-against-husband-during-interview-on-sex-podcast/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/2024-charlotte-north-carolina-harris-91149339.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 21:53:51","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":258696270,"title":"Harris rebuts attacks on family in personal podcast interview","text":"Harris’s remarks came in an interview released Sunday with the Call Her Daddy podcast that focused more on personal details about her life, career, and women’s issues rather than in-depth policy positions.\n\nHost Alex Cooper read a quote from Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R-AR) where she said her “kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.”\n\nHarris responded: “I feel sorry for her, and I’m going to tell you why. Because I don’t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who one, are not aspiring to be humble, two, a whole lot of women out here, who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life, and children in their life, and I think it’s very important for women to lift each other up.”\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) has faced backlash for past comments about “childless cat ladies.” Harris’s role raising her husband’s stepchildren rather than having biological children of her own has led to criticism from some Republicans.\n\n“I feel very strongly we each have our family by blood and then we have our family by love. And I have both,” Harris said. “I consider it to be a real blessing. And I have two beautiful children: Cole and Ella, who call me ‘Mamala.’ We have a very modern family. My husband’s ex-wife is a friend of mine. And also, I’ll tell you, I’m a child of divorced parents, and when I started dating Doug, my husband, I was very thoughtful and sensitive to making sure that until I knew that our relationship was something that was going to be real, I didn’t want to form a relationship with the kids and then walk away from that relationship.”\n\nAbortion rights were also discussed, and Harris laid out some of her policy proposals that she says would make it more affordable to raise families, such as child tax credits for the first year, down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and medical debt not appearing on credit history.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris responded to conservative criticism of her family and decision not to have children of her own with husband Doug Emhoff, whose two children she helped raise.

He’s on his way to help a friend who lost much of what he owned when Hurricane Helene blew through last weekend.\n\nHis friend, like countless others across western North Carolina, is starting over, which explains why Farrington isn’t thinking too much about politics or the White House race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris right now.\n\n“I don’t believe people’s hope is in either people that are being elected,” he said.\n\nFarrington pauses, then gestures toward a dozen volunteers loading water and other necessities into cars and trucks.\n\n“I believe we’re finding a lot more hope within folks like this,” he said.\n\nIn the election’s final weeks, people in North Carolina and Georgia, influential swing states, are dealing with more immediate concerns: widespread storm damage. If that weren’t enough, voters in Watauga County, a ticket-splitting Appalachian county that has become more Democratic in recent years, must contend with politicians laying blame while offering support as they campaign in a race that could be decided by any small shift.\n\nLarge uprooted trees litter the sides of roads, sometimes blocking driveways. Some homes in Vilas are inaccessible after bridges collapsed and roads crumbled. More populous areas like Boone, home of Appalachian State University, saw major flooding.\n\nResidents wonder where are missing friends and relatives, is there enough food and water to last until new supplies arrive and how will they rebuild.\n\nThe focus is on survival, not politics — and may remain that way for weeks.\n\nTrump and Harris have visited North Carolina and Georgia five times since the storm hit. Trump was in North Carolina on Friday, and Harris was there the next day.\n\nAfter Trump went to Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, 20-year-old Fermin Herrera said the former president clinched his vote with his display of caring, not out of any frustration with how President Joe Biden and Harris, the vice president, are handling the federal disaster response. Herrera already leaned toward voting for Trump.\n\n“I feel like everybody’s kind doing what they can,” he said. “All the locals are appreciating the help that’s coming.”\n\nTrump, who has his own mixed record on natural disaster response, attacked Biden and Harris for what he said was a slow response to Helene’s destruction. Trump accused the Democrats of “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas” and said there wasn’t enough Federal Emergency Management Agency money because it was spent on illegal immigrants. There is no evidence to support either claim.\n\n“I’m not thinking about voters right now,” Trump insisted after a meeting with Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Ga., on Friday. “I’m thinking about lives.”\n\nBiden pushed back hard, saying he is “committed to being president for all of America” and has not ordered aid to be distributed based on party lines. The White House cited statements from the Republican governors of Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee expressing satisfaction with the federal government’s response.\n\nCriticism so soon after a natural disaster is “inappropriate,” especially when factoring in the daunting logistical problems in western North Carolina, said Gavin Smith, a North Carolina State University professor who specializes in disaster recovery. He said the perilous terrain from compromised roads and bridges and the widespread lack of power and cellphone service make disaster response in the region particularly challenging.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooper has made several stops in western North Carolina, including Watauga County and surrounding areas, and Biden viewed the extensive damage via an aerial tour.\n\nIn Watauga County, Jessica Dixon was scraping muck and broken furniture off the ground with a shovel, then dumping it in the bucket of a humming excavator. The 29-year-old stood in a home she bought two years ago. It’s now gutted after a rush of water forced Dixon, her boyfriend and their two dogs to flee to safety.\n\nWithout flood insurance, Dixon is not sure what will happen over the next month. She said she filled out a FEMA application but hasn’t checked her email since. She had given the presidential election some thought before Helene, but now she’s preoccupied with cleaning her home.\n\n“It wouldn’t change my views on anything,” said Dixon, who was planning to vote for Harris.\n\nThe presidential election isn’t top of mind for 47-year-old Bobby Cordell, either. He’s trying to get help to neighbors in western Watauga County, which has become inaccessible in some parts.\n\nHis home near Beech Mountain is one of those places, he said, after a bridge washed away. Cordell rescued his aunt from a mudslide, then traveled to Boone and has been staying in Appalachian State’s Holmes Convocation Center, which now serves as a Red Cross emergency shelter.\n\nHe’s trying to send disaster relief back where he lives by contacting officials, including from FEMA. That conversation, he said, “went very well.”\n\nAccepting help isn’t easy for people in the mountains, he said, because they’re used to taking care of themselves.\n\nNow, though, the people who are trapped “need everything they can get.”\n\nOver the past week of volunteering at Skateworld, where Farrington stopped for water, it’s become harder for Nancy Crawford to smile. She’s helped serve more than 1,000 people, she said, but the emotional toll has started to settle in for “a lot of us that normally are tough.”\n\nThat burden added to the weight she was already feeling about the election, which she said was “scary to begin with.” Crawford, a registered Republican, said she plans to vote for Harris. As a Latina of Mexican descent, she thinks Trump’s immigration policies would have harmful effects on her community.\n\nThe storm, she said, likely won’t change her vote but has made one thing evident.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what party you are, we all need help,” she said.\n\nJan Wellborn had a similar thought as she made her way around the Watauga High School gym collecting supplies to bring to coworkers in need. A 69-year-old bus driver for the school district, she said the outpouring of support she’s seen from the community has been a “godsend.”\n\nShe takes solace from the county’s ability to pull together. The election matters, she said, but helping people make their way through a harrowing time matters more.\n\n“The election, it should be important,” Wellborn said. “But right now we need to focus on getting everybody in the county taken care of.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Russ Bynum in Savannah, Georgia, contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern's satellite radio show, ABC's “The View” and “The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Her interview on the podcast “Call Her Daddy\" is scheduled to be released later Sunday. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel's ABC show on Monday.\n\nWalz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.\n\nWalz said Sunday that “specific operations will be dealt with at the time” and he spoke of ”consequences for what they do.\" \n\nHe said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran’s nuclear program.\n\nWalz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it \"puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers.” \n\nTrump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law, and during the interview Sunday, Walz was asked whether he was calling that “a flat-out lie.”\n\n“Yes ... of course,” Walz said.\n\nOn the economy, Walz said Harris' proposals would make life more affordable for the middle class by helping with the construction of 3 million new homes and expanding tax credits for parents. He said tariffs floated by Trump could increase costs by an estimated $4,000 a year on a typical family.\n\nWalz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements pertaining to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.\n\n“I will own up when I misspeak,” Walz said. “I will own up when I make a mistake.”\n\nHe said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could be restrictions on the infertility treatment of intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.\n\n“I think they’re probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,\" Walz said. \"So I think folks know who I am.”\n\nBream noted that Trump has come out in support of fertility treatments, even as he has said that abortion questions should be decided by states.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump encouraged supporters to vote by mail and early, when the time comes, so they turn out “in record numbers.”\n\nWisconsin is perennially tight in presidential elections but has gone for the Republicans just once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. A win in November could make it impossible for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to take the White House.\n\n“In the political chatter class, they’re worried,” said Brandon Scholz, a retired Republican strategist and longtime political observer in Wisconsin who voted for Trump in 2020 but said he is not voting for Trump or Harris this year. “I think Republicans are right to be concerned.”\n\nTrump won the state in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 23,000 votes and lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump made his first-ever visit to Dane County, home to the liberal capital city of Madison, in an effort to turn out the Republican vote even in the state's Democratic strongholds. Dane is Wisconsin’s second most-populous and fastest-growing county; Biden received more than 75% of the vote four years ago.\n\n“To win statewide you’ve got to have a 72-county strategy,” former Gov Scott Walker, a Republican, said at that event.\n\nJuneau is a a town of 2,000 about 50 miles north of Madison in Dodge County, which Trump won in 2020 with 65% of the vote.\n\nEarly arrivals filled the hangar, far exceeding the available seating. One large banner behind the bleachers inside said “Vote Early.”\n\n“Make sure we turn out because guess what, I’ve been to Madison,” said U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, who is from Juneau, at the event. “I’ve been to liberal Madison and they’re going to show up. We need to do the same thing because we are the firewall to keep this country independent and free.”\n\nJack Yuds, chairman of the county Republican Party, said support for Trump is stronger in this part of the state than it was in 2016 or 2020.\n\n“I can’t keep signs in,” Yuds said. “They want everything he’s got. If it says Trump on it, you can sell it.”\n\nTrump’s campaign and outside groups supporting his candidacy have outspent Harris and her allies on advertising in Wisconsin, $35 million to $31 million, since she became a candidate on July 23, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nHarris and outside groups supporting her candidacy had more advertising time reserved in Wisconsin from Oct. 1 through Nov. 5, more than $25 million compared with $20 million for Trump and his allies.\n\nThe Harris campaign has 50 offices across 43 counties with more than 250 staff in Wisconsin, said her spokesperson Timothy White. The Trump campaign said it has 40 offices in the state and dozens of staff.\n\nHarris rallied supporters in Madison in September at an event that drew more than 10,000 people. On Thursday, she made an appeal to moderate and disgruntled conservatives by holding an event in Ripon, the birthplace of the Republican Party, along with former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of Trump’s most prominent Republican antagonists.\n\nHarris and Trump are focusing on Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the “blue wall” states that went for Trump in 2016 and flipped to Biden in the next election.\n\nWhile Trump’s campaign is bullish on its chances in Pennsylvania as well as Sunbelt states, Wisconsin is seen as more of a challenge.\n\n“Wisconsin, tough state,” said Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita, who worked on Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s winning reelection campaign in 2022.\n\n“I mean, look, that’s going to be a very tight — very, very tight, all the way to the end. But where we are organizationally now, comparative to where we were organizationally four years ago, I mean, it’s completely different,” LaCivita said.\n\nHe also cited Michigan as more of a challenge. “But again, these are states that Biden won and carried and so they’re going to be brawls all the way until the end and we’re not ceding any of that ground.”\n\nThe candidates are about even in Wisconsin, based on a series of polls that have shown little movement since Biden dropped out in late July. Those same polls also show high enthusiasm among both parties.\n\nMark Graul, who ran then-President George W. Bush’s 2004 campaign in Wisconsin, said the number of campaign visits speaks to Wisconsin’s decisive election role.\n\nThe key for both sides, he said, is persuading infrequent voters to turn out.\n\n“Much more important, in my opinion, than rallies,” Graul said.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But some emerging trends in the data hint at warning signs for the vice president’s campaign.\n\nThe share of Americans hearing anything at all about Harris has dropped each week since her presidential debate with former President Donald Trump in early September, and during that same time, the tone Americans use in describing what they’ve heard about her has grown more negative, reaching the lowest point of her campaign in the latest results.\n\nLooking at what people say they have heard, read or seen about Harris, “lie” has emerged as a persistent top word that some Americans associate with her. In the latest data, it was the fourth-most mentioned word after “border,” “polls” and “campaign.” It ranked sixth in the previous week’s data and second the week of the ABC News presidential debate, after ranking no higher than 12th in earlier rounds of the survey and no higher than 20th prior to the Democratic convention in August.\n\nThe survey, conducted September 27-30 by SSRS and Verasight for research teams from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, measures what Americans say they have recently heard, read or seen about Harris and Trump.\n\nThe share of Americans mentioning words such as “lie” or “liar” when asked what they’ve heard about Harris remains quite small — just 6% in the latest data, compared with 15% who mentioned something related to immigration, for example — but it has grown over time, rising from 3% or less prior to the Democratic convention to peak at 9% shortly after the debate.\n\n“Kamala says nothing,” wrote one respondent included in the latest survey. “She uses a bunch of words that make no sense. She says she will close the border, but that is a lie to get elected. Everything she promises are lies.”\n\nThe broader focus on immigration (mentioned by 15% in relation to Harris) and the economy (mentioned by 13%) in the latest data marks a notable shift in responses about Harris, following her campaign’s efforts to focus attention on the two topics with a visit to the southern border in Arizona and an economic policy speech in Pittsburgh. It marks the first time in the survey that multiple policy-related topics have landed in the top five for Harris, and the most recent data saw by far the most mentions for immigration-related words in relation to her campaign since she entered the race in late July.\n\n“I have watched her speeches and appreciated her articulate explanation of her policies and positions on various things,” another respondent wrote. “Her concern for all and ability to concretely point to solutions to problems is a sharp contrast to Donald Trump.”\n\nOn Trump’s side, the assassination attempts against him remain prominent in the public’s attention, while immigration has faded a bit and his meeting last month with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky garnered attention.\n\n“He met with Zelensky and was not very enthusiastic about helping Ukraine,” one respondent wrote.\n\nResponses calling the former president a liar are also persistently near the top of his list. About 8% in the latest data use the word “lie” or “liar” in relation to Trump. That figure has frequently been in the high single digits as a share of topics about Trump since the start of the survey in June, dipping below that at times, including around the first assassination attempt against the former president and the Republican National Convention.\n\nAlthough responses about Harris are generally still less negative in tone than those about Trump, there has been a notable decline in overall sentiment in the Harris responses, while Trump’s numbers have rebounded slightly following a post-debate drop. For Harris, the negative shift is apparent across parties, with sentiments expressed by Democrats, Republicans and independents all tilting slightly more negative in the new data than in the week prior. For Trump, though, sentiment has held steady among Republicans, while shifting slightly less negative than the previous survey among independents and Democrats.\n\nThe latest poll found that just under two-thirds of Americans (64%) reported seeing, reading or hearing something about Harris, compared with 68% who said the same about Trump. It marks the fourth straight week in which more people reported hearing about Trump than they did about Harris, and it’s a notable drop from the previous week in the shares saying they’d heard about each candidate (Trump down 7 points, Harris down 5).\n\nThe overall level of attention to the presidential candidates now is lower than it was at this point in previous cycles, though that may be a side effect of debate timing. In 2020, for example, more than 8 in 10 Americans reported having heard news about Trump and Joe Biden in the same week of that campaign, but there was a presidential debate held on September 29. In 2016, there was a mid-September dip in attention ahead of that year’s first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on September 26.\n\n“It has been relatively quiet this week,” one respondent to the latest survey wrote when asked about Trump. “I haven’t heard of anything.”\n\nCNN’s Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/harris-border-visit-economy-speech-190038239.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/922f0da9e1a007c077f07593cd34c87e","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 21:39:34","author":"Jennifer Agiesta","authors":["Jennifer Agiesta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.158},{"id":258695828,"title":"Post-debate polls say JD Vance was the clear winner, but Tim Walz still viewed favorably","text":"The consensus among surveyed voters asked who won the debate between the Republican and Democratic vice presidential candidates is that Ohio’s U.S. Senator JD Vance out performed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nThough Walz continues to enjoy a higher level of likability than Vance, the younger politician made a better show of presenting himself to voters when the pair met on October 1, according to a survey of likely voters released by Data for Progress.\n\n“When voters who watched or read about the debate are asked who won, 48% say Vance and 46% say Walz. Among Independents, 47% say Vance and 44% say Walz,” pollsters wrote. “While a plurality of voters think Vance won the recent vice presidential debate, voters still have a more favorable opinion of Walz than Vance overall.”\n\nAccording to the poll, despite Vance’s better performance, more voters say they like Walz when compared to Ohio’s junior senator. Pollsters say that after the vice presidential debate, Walz held a favorability rating of +6 — that’s 44% favorable, 38% unfavorable — while that Vance remains underwater at -6 — or 40% favorable, 46% unfavorable.\n\n“Similarly, (Vice President Kamala) Harris’ rating is +2, while (former President Donald) Trump’s is -12. President Joe Biden sits at -10,” pollsters wrote.\n\nThe survey also shows that voters were not happy with Vance’s answer when he was asked whether or not Trump lost the 2020 election. Vance said he was focused on the future election, not rehashing the contests of the past and did not address the question.\n\nTrump lost the 2020 election to Biden in the electoral college 306 to 232, with 270 needed to win. Biden also took the popular vote and broke a record doing so after winning 81,283,098 votes, or 51.3 percent of the ballots cast, compared to Trump who earned 74,222,958 votes, or 46.8 percent of the votes cast. Biden was the first presidential candidate in history to hold the support of more than 80 million voters.\n\nWalz called Vance’s refusal to respond to what should have been a fairly straightforward question “a damning non-answer,” and most voters are apparently apprehensive about his dodge.\n\n“Voters were informed that, at the vice presidential debate, Vance refused to say whether he thinks Trump lost the 2020 election and whether he would contest the 2024 vote if Harris wins next month. When asked if they are concerned about this, a majority of voters (54%), including majorities of Democrats (81%) and Independents (52%) and more than a quarter of Republicans (28%), say they are concerned, while 46% say they are not concerned,” pollsters wrote.\n\nAccording to Trump’s campaign, Walz “destroyed the great state of Minnesota with his far-left lunacy — and now, he’s joining forces with Kamala Harris to unleash that destruction on the rest of the country.”\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign, meanwhile, said that Vance can’t answer the 2020 question because Trump can’t get over the loss.\n\n“Donald Trump can’t lead our country forward because he refuses to let go of the past. He can’t improve your family’s life because he is obsessed with himself. That’s why, instead of offering any real solutions, the closing message from Trump and his running mate to battleground voters is a lie to undermine our democracy,” a campaign spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe vice presidential debate does not seem to have had much impact on the overall general election horse race, where polling still finds the ticket-topping candidates in an all-but-tied contest.\n\nThe Data for Progress poll, which leans left, found that voters “Harris over Trump by 3 points in a head-to-head race.”\n\nRMG Research, where pollster Scott Rasmussen does his work, showed in a poll conducted on behalf of Napolitan News that the pair are running even.\n\n“This is the first time the candidates have been tied in our national polling since mid-August. Since then, Harris has consistently maintained a very modest lead. Last week, Harris had a two point edge. Harris leads by five among women while Trump has a six point advantage among men,” those pollsters wrote.\n\nEven without “leaners,” Harris and Trump remain tied, RMG found.\n\n“On the initial ask this week– the number without leaners– the candidates were tied at 48%,” they wrote.\n\nThis result is important, because if the pair were to go into the November 5th general election with their numbers still in lockstep, chances are better than not that Trump retakes the White House, according to RMG Research.\n\n“A tie in the popular vote would likely lead to an Electoral College victory for Trump. A two-point popular vote victory by Harris would make the Electoral College race a toss-up,” they wrote.\n\nTrump leads in the most important battlegrounds, according to the conservative-leaning pollster.\n\n“Polling released yesterday showed Trump leading by four in Florida. Other recent Napolitan News surveys have shown close races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Trump has significant leads in Ohio and Montana,” they wrote.","summary":"Though Walz continues to enjoy a higher level of likability than Vance, the younger politician made a better show of presenting himself to voters when the pair met on October 1, according to a survey of likely voters released by Data for Progress.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/10/06/post-debate-polls-say-jd-vance-was-the-clear-winner-but-tim-walz-still-viewed-favorably/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Election_2024_Debate_76850.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 21:39:28","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.041},{"id":258700844,"title":"Harris attacks Trump abortion record in sex-positive podcast 'Call Her Daddy' interview","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris was all business in an interview on the sex-positive \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast that aired Sunday.\n\nHarris, the Democratic presidential nominee, spent the bulk of the roughly 40-minute conversation litigating her case against Donald Trump, blasting the Republican nominee's track record on abortion and women's rights.\n\n\"There are now 20 states with Trump abortion bans,\" Harris told \"Call her Daddy\" host Alex Cooper. \"This is the same guy that said women should be punished for having abortions.\"\n\nIn 2022, three Supreme Court justices whom Trump nominated during his presidency were part of a majority that overturned Roe v.

The shouting match between Democratic strategist Keith Boykin and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., occurred during a discussion about Donald Trump and his policies.\n\nCNN Host Abby Phillips facilitated the talk on Trump claiming at a rally, seemingly during an unscripted moment, he could solve shoplifting quickly if he let the police have ‘one rough hour.’ The speech led many to suggest what Trump is proposing is the plot of the movie series The Purge.\n\n‘Is he suggesting that cops can do whatever they want for a day and that will actually solve the problem?’ Phillips says in disbelief after playing the clip of Trump. Byron then snaps back saying ‘No, he’s not’ and says that crime in the U.S. has gone up. The pressure before the explosion was building.\n\n‘Even the clip you just played was five seconds out of, for Donald Trump, an hour speech. I think a lot of times people say, ‘Oh well, he said this.’ For five seconds? Yes, he says things that are unscripted. He goes off the cuff. He’s not serious, there’s no policy behind that,’ Donalds said. The Floridian continued: ‘Donald Trump said a comment for five seconds. That’s not setting policy, that’s revealing the angst of the American people.’ But the Democrat immediately pushed back.\n\n‘Donald Trump has a history of saying inflammatory things. It’s not just those five seconds, congressman, and you know that,’ Boykin said. The strategist spoke about Trump’s role in January 6, arguing how he has a history of fiery rhetoric.\n\nHowever Donalds countered saying Trump has been the one who has been the target of partisan discourse, noting how he was targeted by assassins twice. ‘Are we going to talk about the rhetoric directed at Donald Trump? Because we do realize he’s been tried to kill twice now,’ Donalds said. ‘The reality in America is that crime is massively up,’ the Republican pressed on.\n\nBoykin grew incensed, shouting that Donalds is a liar. ‘Crime is not massively up!’ ‘That’s a lie! You’re lying! You’re lying!’ the Democrat loudly claimed. The strategist then aimed his ire at Phillips for letting Donalds challenge him.\n\n‘Abby, why do you let this man lie on national television like this? That’s not right. You’re a liar, congressman.’ Boykins said. Phillips then quieted down both guests, regained control of the program and showed statistics from the Justice Department showing that crime in major categories like murder and rape have fallen.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz stepped onto the brightest stage of their careers during their unusually civil vice-presidential debate last week.The face-off largely went as expected: Vance sought to carry the banner for former President Donald Trump and conservatism, while Walz zeroed in on issues of importance to Democrats, seeking to boost Vice President Kamala Harris.But while Walz attacked Trump right out of the gate, Vance took a more balanced approach: He promoted the former president's brand of conservatism, but he also discussed his own philosophy.Immediately after the debate, CNN political analyst and former Trump administration aide Alyssa Farah Griffin remarked on Vance's ability to communicate with Trump's supporters while also calling him a \"chameleon\" who sought to make inroads with more voters.\"I don't know that this moves the needle, but I do think it solidifies his place as the MAGA heir apparent,\" she said in a post-debate analysis.Here's a look at some of the recent steps Vance has taken to solidify his GOP credentials ahead of a potential 2028 campaign.Trump has defined the Republican Party for nearly a decade, with the June 2015 campaign launch of his 2016 presidential campaign setting into motion a broad rebrand of the GOP.Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley earlier this year sought to articulate their own visions for what a post-Trump GOP could look like during their unsuccessful presidential campaigns.But Trump easily secured his third presidential nomination, reflecting the longstanding appeal that he has with many conservatives.But what will happen to the party in 2028, whether or not Trump wins in November? Who will take up the party's mantle? Right now it looks like it could be Vance.Vance has enjoyed a national profile since publishing \"Hillbilly Elegy\" in 2016. He expanded that profile when he was elected to the Senate in 2022.But Trump's decision to tap Vance as his running mate took the senator's young political career to heights that have surpassed many of the more experienced Republicans on Capitol Hill — including onetime presidential candidates like South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.For a party that could face an identity crisis after Trump no longer dominates it, Vance is someone who could offer a transition, appealing to both moderate Republicans and Trump's \"MAGA\" base.During the debate, Vance showed that he could walk that line. He brushed aside questions about the 2020 presidential election results and the events of January 6, 2021, largely following the lead of other prominent pro-Trump Republicans. It showed that despite Vance's efforts to take on a more congenial persona, there'd still be plenty of pro-Trump signals of support.Mike Nellis, a former Harris senior advisor and \"White Dudes for Harris\" organizer, told Business Insider after the debate that Vance leaned into the Trump political brand in a way that would appeal to conservative decision-makers, who will have to envision a GOP universe where the ex-president isn't the top figure.\"What he did do was articulate MAGA policies in a much more articulate and thoughtful way than what you hear from Donald Trump,\" he said. \"And there is value to that, but there's value to that amongst a very small class of people, many of whom are positioning Vance to be the future of the MAGA movement.\"Of course, 2028 is a long way off, and Republicans remain focused on Trump's reelection campaign, as Vance's spokesperson, William Martin, made clear in a statement.\"The only thing Senator Vance is thinking about is making sure we put President Donald J. Trump back in the White House,\"he said. \"If we come up short this November, what happens in 2028 won't matter because this country will be beyond saving.\"","summary":"Vance has embraced Trump's MAGA political brand.

In a ‘60 Minutes’ interview set to air on CBS News on Sunday night, Harris was asked how the US can supply Israel with billions of dollars’ worth of military aid, while seemingly exercising “no sway” over Netanyahu. After a rambling answer in which she claimed that the US has pushed Netanyahu closer to ending his ongoing war in Gaza and Lebanon, Harris was asked again whether the US has “a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?” “I think, with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people,” she responded. “And the answer to that question is yes.” \n\nEver since she replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate in July, Harris’ position on Israel has come under fire from both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian factions within the party. Apparently attempting to placate both sides, Harris declared her support for an independent Palestinian state at the Democratic National Convention in August, before immediately promising that she would continue to supply Israel with arms and ammunition. Netanyahu, who is widely believed to favor Donald Trump in the upcoming US presidential election, has spoken to and met with Biden and Harris on multiple occasions since he declared war on Hamas last October. Following these conversations, Biden and Harris have both claimed that the Israeli leader is moving toward a ceasefire, only for Netanyahu to return to Israel and promise to continue waging war. Most recently, Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire proposal drawn up by the US and France, before backing out at the last moment and ordering the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, American and other Western officials claimed last month. Two days later, he again defied American calls for de-escalation by sending ground troops into Lebanon, and on Tuesday he vowed to make Iran “pay for” a missile attack on Israel, despite US officials urging him to avoid any steps that may trigger a wider regional war. “Whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know,” Biden told reporters on Friday. Biden followed this comment with a reminder to the Israeli leader. “No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none,” he said. “And I think [Netanyahu] should remember that.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris has said that the US’ loyalties lie with the Israeli people rather than their leader \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/605331-kamala-harris-israel-netanyahu/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.10/article/6702f12185f54033de615727.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 21:20:30","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":258696812,"title":"Fact-checking Donald Trump’s claims at Butler rally","text":"Former US President Donald Trump on Saturday returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the first assassination attempt against him, to rally his supporters just a month before Election Day.\n\n“Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country,” Trump said on Saturday, referring to his “Make America Great Again” catchphrase.\n\n“For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper’s perch, not so far away. But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal.”\n\nEarly in his address, Trump spoke about Corey Comperatore, a volunteer firefighter who had been in the July 13 crowd and whom Thomas Matthew Crooks, the suspect in Trump’s attempted assassination, killed. One of Crooks’s bullets grazed Trump’s ear.\n\nA Secret Service countersniper killed Crooks.\n\nTrump described Comperatore as a “folk hero” and called for a moment of silence at 6:11pm, the minute the shooting had begun on July 13. After the pause, bells rang and a vocalist near the stage launched into the song Ave Maria.\n\nTrump’s speech included claims about the Biden-Harris administration’s response to Hurricane Helene, “illegal” immigration and the economy.\n\nWe fact-checked him.\n\nTrump claimed ‘illegal’ immigration was the lowest when he left office\n\nTrump: “I love that chart. I love that graph. Isn’t it a beautiful thing? But also beautiful because, look at the number, that’s the day I left office. It was the lowest Border Patrol, the lowest it’s ever been, illegal Immigration.”\n\nPolitiFact has fact-checked the contents of the chart.\n\nTrump added misleading markings on a chart originally posted by Ron Johnson Senator from Wisconsin.\n\nHe also highlighted a low migrant encounter total during April 2020 and claimed that was when he left office. But Trump’s presidency ended in January 2021.\n\nThat April 2020 period also marked the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, when lockdowns and travel restrictions contributed to decreased migration.\n\nThe chart also alluded to Trump’s claim that millions of immigrants came illegally to the US from jails, prisons or mental institutions during the administration of US President Joe Biden. Immigration experts said there is no proof that large numbers of people from prisons or mental institutions are coming to the US.\n\nTrump claims $750 aid for hurricane victims too little\n\nTrump: “They’re offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away. And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of.” \n\nWe rated a version of this claim false.\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris has not said people affected by Hurricane Helene will only get $750 from the federal government.\n\nThe $750 is under the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Serious Needs Assistance programme, which covers immediate needs after a disaster, including “food, water, baby formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and other emergency supplies”. Through this programme, the White House said, FEMA paid out more than $1m to more than 1,400 North Carolina households within a day.\n\nAs of October 4, FEMA said the Biden administration provided more than $45m “in flexible, up-front funding” to Hurricane Helene survivors. The agency said it has provided more than 11.5 million meals, 3.32 million gallons of water, 150 generators and 400,000 tarps to the affected region.\n\nOn October 2, in Augusta, Georgia, Harris said FEMA was also providing funding for home repairs and hotel costs.\n\nHours before Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, on September 26, Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and announced a new $8bn security assistance package for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Congress had already appropriated the funding for Ukraine.\n\nImmigration and crime data\n\nTrump: “When you look at the crime, look at the crime, look at the people that are coming in. Murderers – 13,099 murderers, let in over the last short period of time.”\n\nTrump is referring to a figure from a September 25 Immigration and Customs Enforcement letter saying 13,099 immigrants convicted of homicide are not in immigration detention. But that data goes back 40 years; it doesn’t specify that those 13,099 people entered the US during the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nNon-citizens convicted of crimes may not be in immigration detention for multiple reasons. For one, they may be in law enforcement custody serving time in prison.\n\nA 2001 Supreme Court ruling also said people cannot be detained indefinitely. This means people from countries that don’t accept deportation flights must be released into the US.\n\nGreatest economy ‘we ever had’\n\nTrump: The Trump administration boasted “the greatest economy we ever had”. \n\nThe unemployment rate during the Trump administration dropped to levels dating back to the early 1950s. But gross domestic product growth during Trump’s administration was well below that of previous administrations. Other metrics, such as wages and business investment, don’t support Trump’s claim, either.\n\nHarris’s role in border control narrative\n\nHarris “was appointed border czar … she was in charge of the border.”\n\nMostly false.\n\nThis is a repeated mischaracterisation of Harris’s role. Biden tasked Harris with working with Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras officials to address migration issues. But managing the border – controlling who and how many people enter the US – is the Homeland Security secretary’s responsibility.\n\nBiden asked Harris to focus on migration’s root causes, including relevant countries’ economic struggles, violence, corruption and food insecurity.\n\nClaims that Harris inflated families’ costs by $29,000 per family\n\nTrump: Harris “cost you $29,000 a family through inflation [and] price hikes”.\n\nMostly false.\n\nHarris cast the tiebreaking vote on the motion to proceed to a final Senate vote on the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, a coronavirus pandemic relief bill. Economists believe the law contributed to inflation’s increase, but say supply chain shortages and Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine were bigger drivers of the spike.\n\nThe $28,000 is a likely estimate of increased spending for items such as food, shelter, transportation and energy. But wages also increased, evening out many of the increased costs – or, depending on the time period, all of them.\n\nHarris’s stance on ICE\n\nTrump: Harris “vowed to abolish ICE”.\n\nIn 2018, when she was a US senator from California, Harris said the function of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should be reexamined and that “we need to probably even think about starting from scratch”. But she didn’t say there shouldn’t be immigration enforcement. In 2018, Harris also said ICE had a role and should exist.\n\nTrump boasts US has more oil than Saudi Arabia\n\n“We have more liquid gold, oil and gas under our feet than any nation in the world, including Saudi Arabia and Russia.”\n\nThe US Energy Information Administration reported that Venezuela ranked first for proven crude oil reserves in 2021 with 304 billion barrels, followed by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Russia. The US ranked ninth internationally, with 61 billion barrels.\n\nThe US ranks higher internationally in coal reserves (number one) and natural gas (number four), administration data shows.\n\nClaims of California banning voter ID requirements\n\nTrump: California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom “has banned any and all ID requirements from voting and registering to vote”.\n\nMostly false.\n\nCalifornia law already doesn’t require the majority of voters to provide ID when voting in person. Senate Bill 1174, which prohibits local governments from requiring voter ID at polling places, was drafted in response to a Huntington Beach, California, measure that conflicted with state law.\n\nPeople who register to vote in California must provide proof of identity. People whose information is not verified must present their IDs at the polls when they vote for the first time. All people who register to vote in California must sign a notice, under penalty of perjury, that states they are US citizens.\n\nTrump claims Imane Khelif was ‘a male transitioned to a female’\n\n“A young lady from Italy, very good boxer, very, very good. She was all excited, but she played a person who transitioned… a male transitioned to a female.”\n\nTrump’s claim that a boxer “transitioned” to female is unsubstantiated.\n\nTrump was referring to boxer Imane Khelif, who competed in the 2024 Paris Olympics. She is not Italian, but is Algerian. The decision to allow Khelif to compete in the Olympics was controversial because a boxing organisation previously disqualified her over a DNA test that supposedly showed she has XY chromosomes. That organisation is no longer recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\n\nIOC spokesperson Mark Adams said, “The Algerian boxer was born female, was registered female, lived her life as a female, boxed as a female, has a female passport. This is not a transgender case.”","summary":"Trump spoke of surviving his first assassination attempt, and of election opponent Kamala Harris.

This is bad policy.”\n\nReferring to Donald Trump calling the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v Wade a “beautiful thing”, Walz said that “it’s not a beautiful thing to see women dying. It’s not a beautiful thing to put doctors at risk of being imprisoned.”\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign has moved to highlight examples of women injured or killed by delays in lifesaving abortion care due to Republican-led anti-abortion laws, while also pounding Republicans for the supposed plan to create a national abortion registry under Project 2025 — part of efforts by conservatives to respond to women seeking abortion care across state lines, even when living in states where bans are in place.\n\nOpponents of abortion rights have claimed for years that American political opinion will trend away from support for the provisions of Roe v Wade in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to revoke the ruling.\n\nBut the opposite has happened. Polling shows that more Americans now support protecting access to legal abortion care in most cases.\n\nDonald Trump continues to tout his own role in the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision, given his nomination of three justices to the bench, while trying to distance his campaign from state-level bans in Florida and other places.\n\nAnd despite bans snapping into place in states with conservative local governments, the number of abortions performed in the US increased last year over 2022.","summary":"VP candidate shuts down debate over Minnesota’s abortion rights as Republicans amplify debunked ‘born alive’ laws","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tim-walz-fox-abortion-b2624755.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/06/21/SEI224357509.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VD6RscK6-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-06 21:10:06","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":258699760,"title":"Pennsylvania bakery known for election cookie poll swamped with orders","text":"A suburban Philadelphia bakery’s cookie “poll” that started during the 2008 presidential campaign as a joke between the owners and their customers has grown into much more.\n\nLochel's Bakery in Hatboro is swamped with orders.

Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, responded Sunday to Eric Trump’s implication that his father’s Democratic opponents were responsible for the attempts on former President Trump’s life, saying the innuendo was “of course” inaccurate but political candidates on both sides of the aisle “need to deescalate” their rhetoric.\n\n“No, of course not,” Turner said in his latest appearance on “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,” after being asked whether he believes there was truth to claims made by the former president, his son Eric, and his vice presidential running mate, Sen. JD Vance, at a rally where each either implied or suggested Democrats tried to kill him.\n\nTrump returned Saturday to Butler, Pennsylvania, to speak to supporters gathered at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds, the site of the July 13 assassination attempt against him. A gunman facing Trump on the podium at that rally opened fire into the crowd, grazing Trump’s ear, killing one attendee and injuring two others, according to authorities. The gunman was killed by a Secret Service sniper, officials said. \n\nAnother apparent assassination attempt happened in September when a suspect pointed a gun in Trump’s direction on the Florida course where he was playing golf. The FBI has opened probes into both incidents. \n\nTrump, his son and Vance all acknowledged the assassination attempt in Butler at Saturday’s campaign event.\n\n“Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me impeached me indicted me tried to throw me off the ballot and, who knows, maybe even tried to kill me,” said the former president, while Eric Trump claimed his father’s political opponents “tried to kill him, and it’s because the Democratic party, they can’t do anything right.”\n\nVance, in his remarks, addressed Trump’s Democratic challenger in the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris, and suggested that the Republican nominee “took a bullet for democracy.”\n\nBrennan asked Turner: “You don’t mean to imply here anything that would suggest Eric Trump’s allegations that Democrats are trying to kill him?”\n\n“No, of course not,” Turner responded. “But I do think that Vice President Harris needs to actively state and acknowledge that her administration is saying a foreign power, which would be an act of war, is actively trying to kill her opponent.”\n\nThe attempts on Trump’s life came after a citizen of Pakistan with ties to Iran was arrested and charged with allegedly planning a murder-for-hire scheme targeting Trump, among others. Although the timing of the charges coincided with the first attempt, there was no indication that the two incidents were related.\n\nTurner criticized Harris for what he viewed as a failure to openly condemn the alleged plot.\n\n“I think there’s certainly a role for her to play and for the president to play in this, in both identifying that there are threats against Donald Trump that need to be acknowledged and responded to, to deter,” he said. “I think all the candidates need to de-escalate, certainly in their language.”\n\nBut the congressman did acknowledge that a Biden-Harris Justice Department official, Matthew Olsen, the head of the national security division, said the U.S. government has been “intensely tracking Iranian lethal plotting efforts targeting former and current U.S. government officials — and that includes the former president.”\n\n“I would say that we are very concerned — gravely concerned — about Iranian plotting,” Olsen told CBS News in a recent interview.","summary":"Rep.

Critics have since compared her statement to comments made in 2022, where she cited FEMA resources were available to illegal immigrants. \"FEMA Regional Administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate – to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other federal agencies,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters at a Sept. 16, 2022, press conference. \"Funding is also available through FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter program to eligible local governments and not-for-profit organizations upon request to support humanitarian relief for migrants,\" she added. FEMA has a pool of funds explicitly used for natural disasters, while Congress called on FEMA in 2022 to disseminate funds from Customs and Border Protection to assist American communities affected by the immigration crisis. KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS FEMA’s website currently has a \"Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response\" page to address false claims surrounding recovery efforts, including a rebuke of the claim that FEMA diverted disaster response funds to \"border related issues.\" \"This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,\" FEMA posted in response to the claim. Hurricane Helene has left more than 220 people dead after flooding devastated towns and cities across Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas drew national attention last week when he indicated that FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season, which typically wraps up in November. LAWMAKERS OUTRAGED OVER FEMA FUNDING CONCERNS \"We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,\" he said Wednesday, heightening concerns around funds for Americans left displaced by the hurricane. \"FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.\" The DHS, however, said the following day that FEMA has the funds needed to assist those currently affected. \"FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,\" spokesperson Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. \"As [Administrator Deanne Criswell] said, she has the full authority to spend against the President’s budget, but we’re not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it.\" FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ‘FAILED TO ACT’ IN HURRICANE HELENE AFTERMATH: REP. CORY MILLS Johnson said during his interview Sunday that when citizens take public transportation and spot illegal immigrants traveling the nation, their tickets are \"gleefully\" paid for by the Biden-Harris administration via non-governmental organizations. \"When you see illegals in your local airport and you see them being transported around the country with planes, trains and automobiles to every community, everywhere, every state's a border state now, because of that. That's the NGOs, the non-governmental organizations mostly, that are transporting those people around. And then they send the receipts to the federal government,\" he continued. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"And Biden, Harris and Mayorkas gleefully pay those receipts because they open the border intentionally. The American people are disgusted by this. They're fed up with it, and so are Republicans in Congress. And it'll stop after Nov. 5 because we're going to have a unified government with Republicans in charge, and we will bring sanity back to this situation,\" he added.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders' comments that Harris \"doesn’t have anything keeping her humble\" because she doesn't have children. \"I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,\" Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, told \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast host Alex Cooper. \"Two,\" she added in the taped interview, which aired Sunday, there are \"a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life, and I think it's really important for women to lift each other up.\" “We have our family by blood and then we have our family by love. And I have both,” Harris, who is a stepmother to her husband Doug Emhoff’s two children, told Cooper, adding, “And I consider it to be a real blessing.” Harris discussed her relationship with her stepchildren, Cole and Ella Emhoff, who are her husband’s biological children from his first marriage. “They are my children. And I love those kids to death, and family comes in many forms,” Harris said. Last month, Huckabee Sanders, who served in former President Donald Trump's administration, told attendees at a town hall: \"My kids keep me humble. Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn’t have anything keeping her humble.\" A spokesperson for Huckabee Sanders' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump’s running mate, has criticized women on a similar basis, saying in 2021 that Democrats who don’t have biological children are “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Asked what message Vance's comments send to women who can't conceive or have children naturally, Harris them \"mean and mean-spirited.\" \"I think that most Americans want leaders who understand that the measure of their strength isn't who you beat down. The real measure of strength of a leader is who you lift up,\" she added. Cooper also asked Harris about Trump's comments last month at a rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania, where he said that under a future Trump administration, \"you will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger. You’re not going to be in danger any longer. You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems today. You will be protected, and I will be your protector.\" Trump added, \"Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free.\" Harris blasted Trump, blaming him for nominating three Supreme Court justices who voted to overrule Roe v. Wade. \"They did just as he intended,\" Harris said, adding that \"there are now 20 states with Trump abortion bans, including bans that make no exceptions for rape or incest ... which means that you’re telling a survivor of a crime with a violation of their body they don’t have a right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. \"This is the same guy that is now saying that?\" Harris asked, referring to Trump's comments about protecting women. \"This is the same guy that said women should be punished for having abortions? This is the same guy who uses the same kind of language he does to describe women? So yeah, there you go.” A spokesperson for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris responded to Arkansas GOP Gov.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy Nola Ojomu, Senior Entertainment Reporter For Dailymail.Com\n Published:21:53 BST, 6 October 2024 |Updated:21:53 BST, 6 October 2024 \n\nKeeping up with your favorite celebrity's every move couldn't be easier thanks to the popularity of dedicated social media accounts with the sole purpose of sharing updates with supporters across the globe.\nThe biggest stars on the planet, from Taylor Swift to Beyoncé and Kylie Jenner have a multitude of fan accounts that breathlessly chart their latest updates - while some even parody the stars or their family members with such accuracy that fans playfully interact with them like it is the real deal.\nSome experts would argue that fan accounts have become an effective way to gage the importance of a celebrity in modern culture, with almost every star of note having their career tracked on a public platform by loyal followers.\nYet most of these pages are run by mystery users who rarely reveal their true identities despite garnering hundreds of thousands of followers and often helping provide more impactful promotion than the star's own professional teams.\nHere, DailyMail.com spoke with the fans behind the popular accounts @kyliesnapchat, @tswifterastour and @norisblackbook to find out what it is really like to run a top celebrity fan account. \nKylie Snapchat (@kyliesnapchat): 2 million followers on Instagram\n\nThe biggest stars on the planet such as Kylie Jenner have a multitude of fan accounts that breathlessly chart their latest updates\n\nJessica created her account 'Kyliesnapchat' with the hope of turning her natural interest in the reality star into something impactful online\nJessica, 28, created 'Kyliesnapchat' after she noticed how the fans running 'KylizzleSnapchats' would simply repost the content shared by the reality star on the social media platform.\nIt made the Kylie super fan feel confident about the fact she too could turn her natural interest in the reality star into something impactful online. \n 'I chose to post about the Kardashians because I genuinely was a big fan of them and thought this was something I would have fun doing whether it became successful or not,' she told DailyMail.com.\nThe simple idea to start her page has blossomed into Jessica running both her dedicated Kylie Snapchat Instagram page as well as the popular Kardashian Social Instagram account, which boasts 337,000 followers.\nJessica said she soon started to look into the financial benefits to be gained, adding: 'I viewed it as a business opportunity and saw how much income you can make just by posting something you enjoy.'\nNaturally, running two accounts about a family who are arguably some of the most prolific social media users in the world is no small task.\n'It can be overwhelming trying to keep up with posting when all the Kardashians have stuff going on and are active on social media,' Jessica admitted. 'But for me it’s fun to post and I know now that if I miss anything, it’s not a big deal.'\nShe continued: 'It used to take up a lot of time. Sometimes hours depending on how active they were in a day. Now it does not take up much time at all. Maybe 20 minutes per day just getting a few posts up.'\nJessica has consciously made efforts to ensure her dedication to her accounts doesn't get in the way of having a normal life outside of her side hustle.\n\nThe simple idea to start her page has blossomed into Jessica running both her dedicated Kylie Snapchat Instagram page as well as the popular Kardashian Social Instagram account\n\nJessica admitted: 'It can be overwhelming trying to keep up with posting when all the Kardashians have stuff going on and are active on social media'\n'As active as I may be on social media, I have a busy life outside of this,' she explained. 'I am usually posting or responding to things while I have a free moment at work.'\nShe admitted choosing to initially keep the account hidden from her family members because it 'did not feel important enough to immediately tell them'. \nBut once the account gained a large following, Jessica revealed her project to her loves ones.\nWith Kylie and her extended family attracting hateful trolls thanks to their fame, Jessica has had to field her fair share of negative comments and reactions over the years.\n'I try to ignore them, but I do respond back at times,' she admitted, stating that it is partly why she doesn't share any of her own personal content.\nShe continued: 'It does not bother me as much as it would if I were posting myself and my own content, but I keep my personal self off of my page and stick to just the Kardashians.'\nOverall, the positives have always outweighed any stressors that come from running the pages - including getting a follow and interaction from Kylie herself.\nJessica gushed: 'I remember the first time Kylie interacted with a post of mine. She liked a video I posted and it seemed surreal that the person I was a fan of was seeing a post of mine. \n\nJessica gushed: 'I remember the first time Kylie interacted with a post of mine. She liked a video I posted and it seemed surreal that the person I was a fan of was seeing a post of mine'\n\n'I was always, and still am, hyperaware that she has no idea who I am and just sees it as another page on Instagram but as a fan of the Kardashians it is still a cool feeling to be recognized by them.'\nShe continued: 'Kylie is incredibly kind and has sent well wishes via Instagram messages as well as recently sending a couple of products, one which was signed by her. I'm so appreciative of that!'\nElsewhere, other family members have also interacted with the Kardashian Social account.\n'I will say the most interaction I get is from Khloe. She is incredible! Constantly liking and commenting on posts and you can really tell it is sincere,' Jessica revealed. 'Khloe is always tweeting about how important her fans are to her. She is very active with her fans and it is so nice to see that.'\nReflecting on the best thing that has happened since she launch the account, Jessica stated: 'One of the coolest was getting invited to the People’s Choice Awards. I got to see Khloe Kardashian and Kris Jenner in person accepting their award. \n'It was unbelievable to think that I got to experience this all because of my Instagram page that I created.'\n\nThe Eras Tour (@tswifterastour): 771,000 followers on Twitter\n\nThe popular account, The Eras Tour, was started by CGB in November 2022 when Taylor Swift first announced she would be embarking on the mammoth tour\n\nWith the tickets sales leading to a meltdown on Ticketmaster, the account quickly became a way for the millions of fans to come together as they scrambled to figure out another option\nPopular account, The Eras Tour, was started by CGB in November 2022 when Taylor Swift first announced she would be embarking on her mammoth tour. \nWhile plenty of fan accounts for the music superstar already existed at the time, CGB - a student from Singapore - decided to create the page in a bid to help fellow fans get their hands on much-coveted tickets.\n'We were all collectively freaking out,' they explained. 'I started the account with the intent of helping people get tickets safely and also spread information on the tour like I myself love to learn about.'\nWith the tickets sales leading to a meltdown on Ticketmaster, the account quickly became a way for the millions of fans who failed to get their hands on tickets to come together as they scrambled to figure out another option.\nEventually, the page became a space for all Swifties to enjoy the shows thanks to the content being shared online in real time.\nCGB recalled: 'I honestly did not expect the account to be as successful as it is but it just motivates me more even in my real life knowing that there's a place I can always fall back on. Updating the eras tour and interacting with so many other Swifties has brought me an insurmountable amount of joy.'\nNaturally, attempting to keep up with the floods of videos, pictures and information regarding Taylor and her tour has been an incredibly difficult challenge.\nCGB admitted: 'I do get a little stressed or overwhelmed knowing that with such a large reach I have to be extremely careful with everything I post out.'\nIn fact, CGB has spent up to 'four hours' per day ensuring that they can trawl through concert posts and updates in order to share the latest news with their fellow Swifties.\nThey added: 'I'm not one who shares disrespectful information about Taylor such as leaked images or photos taken secretly because that is just completely disrespectful and I imagine how stressful all that is on a person.'\n\nCGB - who is a student from Singapore - has spent up to 'four hours' per day ensuring that they can trawl through concert updates in order to share the latest news with their fellow Swifties\n\nRunning the account has proven that organization is a key skill most who run these accounts could boast about on their resume\nLike Jessica, CGB is conscious of making sure that the account doesn't encroach on their real life. \n'I am a someone who values that there is life outside of social media and my phone and make sure that I am constantly active in my outside life as well,' they said. \n'I don't really feel much pressure, except during hectic days when a lot is going on, as this account is more fun for me than it is anything else... I also answer basically anyone who approaches me nicely but I admit it takes a while and I'm not the best at answering all of them when it gets a bit overwhelming in volume which is something I'm working on.'\nFor all the positive that comes from running the account, CGB does find themselves dealing with trolling comments that they are unable to avoid.\n\nThey said: 'I learned that the bigger this account gets, the more trolls there will be. The only real way is to ignore them which is why I don't really read all my DMs, requests or replies or usually just scroll through the heaps of them. \n'However, I can't completely scroll past all of them because a lot of other fans and even opportunities are approached to me via DMs and I always take time to help answer any questions regarding tour if I am able to help the person.'\nThey continued: 'The more successful Taylor gets as an artist, the more people are going to hate her because these are people who can't stand to see a woman be successful by her own means.'\nWhile CGB is proud of what they have achieved with the account, their family has no idea about it.\n'The account is actually still a secret from my family,' they said. 'They are aware that I'm a major Swiftie but as far as this account goes, they aren't really aware.\n'My friends on the other hand, I've told most of them and they're supportive about it and whenever I need help with little things, they help me out and I am so grateful.'\nThey concluded: 'All in all, this is a part of my life that has brought on so many opportunities for me, so many things I never thought I'd be able to achieve.' \n\nNori's Black Book (@norisblackbook): 1.5 million followers on Instagram \n\nNatalie Franklin has grown her following in the years since she started a Tumblr account focused on North West - the first-born daughter of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian\n\nNatalie counts the likes of Kris Jenner and Paris Hilton as followers on Instagram, while Kim and other members of her family have often liked posts on the page\nIn 2013, Natalie Franklin chose to create a Tumblr account focused on North West, the first-born daughter of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.\nThe 36-year-old said she started 'Nori's Black Book' when she was living in San Francisco working at GAP Headquarters - a job she 'absolutely hated.'\n'I needed to do something creative to distract myself, she said. 'I remembered how much I loved \"Suri's Burn Book\", so I decided to make something similar based on North West's life. \n'I initially started on Tumblr. The account was really for my own entertainment, but I grew an audience really quickly. I was surprised by how much people enjoyed it.'\nAnd it wasn't just Kardashian fans that enjoyed the content, but North's own father himself sharing one of the post's back in 2018. In the years that followed, Natalie has counted the likes of Kris Jenner and Paris Hilton as followers, while Kim and other members of her family have often liked posts.\nNatalie was even able to appear in the final season of Keeping Up With The Kardashian's on E! where Kim and Khloe Kardashian praised the writer for her content. \nOpening up about how she has dealt with the pressure of successfully parodying one of the world's most famous children, Natalie explained: 'I feel a lot of pressure. Especially after my \"reveal\". It's hard to stay consistent and keep the quality of my writing at a high level. \n'Constantly being creative and finding comedic ways to talk about things is challenging. Sometimes I can do it quickly and sometimes it takes time. It depends on the topic. I want to keep giving people quality content and I put a lot of pressure on myself to do so.'\nNaturally, having to put so much effort into her posts in comparison to the standard fan pages means that the account is a time-consuming job.\n\nNatalie was even able to appear in the final season of Keeping Up With The Kardashian's on E! where Kim and Khloe Kardashian praised the writer for her content\n\nShe reflected: 'I spend a lot of time running the account. Probably too much time. It's not just writing. It's research, selecting pics/videos, combing through social media, watching The Kardashians, watching interviews, and reading articles. \n'It's a full-time job, and it's extremely time-consuming, and it's not as easy as it may appear to some people.'\nNatalie continued: 'Sometimes it feels like North is my life. I'm actually just coming off of a much-deserved two-month break from writing earlier this year because I was burnt out. This is my first real break since starting the account 10 years ago. \n\nFans of the page can't get enough of the sassy posts which mock Kim and the family\n'It felt good. I got to the hit refresh button on the North West portion of my brain. I was also able to explore other things I wanted to do creatively. The break made me a better writer.'\nAs highlighted in her guest appearance on KUWTK, the real North is aware of the account and Natalie is still unsure about when she will decide to call time on her parody as North continues to become more of a star in her own right.\n'I sincerely thought it was over after North got on TikTok, but that wasn't the case,' she said. 'Luckily, the real North West's personality is aligned with the personality I created for NBB, so North's TikToks don't interfere with my content. \n'I don't know when I'll stop NBB and maybe I don't have to stop. Parody accounts of adults exist so you never know. I might be writing NBB until North is 80 at this rate.'\nNatalie's own family has been supportive of her venture since the very early days of the account, but some friends were confused. \n'When I started the account, I would tell my friends, but they didn't get it,' she said. 'They would say, \"So you're pretending to be a baby on social media?\".'\nIt was at this point that Natalie stopped sharing with others.\n'I didn't want other people's opinions to discourage me or make me feel weird, so I stopped talking about the account to people,' she said. 'I understood what I was doing and that's all that mattered. \n'Not until my appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians did all my friends and family finally know. It truly was my best-kept secret.\n\nNatalie admits running the account is stressful as she said: 'I feel a lot of pressure. Especially after my \"reveal\". It's hard to stay consistent and keep the quality of my writing at a high level'\n\nDespite the positive feedback she has received from the famous family who often like her posts, Natalie stressed that she has chosen to keep them at a distance\nLooking back at the journey she has been on so far, Natalie explained that she has never had reason to regret running the account.\n'It's been fun and I like making people laugh,' she said. 'It also helped me realize some things about myself: I'm funny, a talented writer, I'm amazing at content creation. North has taught me a lot about myself.' \nAnd much like the young child, Natalie pays no mind to those who might bring negativity her way online.\n'Trolls don't get a response. Trolls or haters don't bother me,' the writer stated. 'They don't know me and they can't do what I do, so why would I listen to them? Those people would probably kill to have even half of the success that I've had.'\n'They probably want to meet Kim and Khloe and are mad that they can't and never will. But when I'm bored, I troll them back as North. That's fun.'\n\nNatalie is still unsure about when she will decide to call time on her parody as North continues to become more of a star in her own right\nPR expert Eric Schiffer believes fan accounts are now 'vital' for the growth of a career. \n'Harnessing fan power is a critical component in an artist’s marketing strategy,' he said. 'Once considered a niche corner of the internet, fan accounts have grown into their own micro-industry with many influencers turning fandom into a career.\n'Especially as Swifties and the Beyhive redefine the role fans play in an artist’s career, fan accounts will become more and more important and prominent.'\nSchiffer explained that while stars such as Zendaya and Selena Gomez are 'highly unlikely' to run their own fan accounts, the world might be surprised to know that the teams of some mega stars do have a big part to play in things.\n'It does happen with mega stars, and is secretly shrouded in layers of protection to insulate them', the PR guru noted. 'Upcoming stars on the rise of fame with a few million followers are sometimes either running their own fan accounts or deeply influencing them.'\nNaturally, the risk of being found out is a great one, with the PR guru noting: 'It's brand suicide for certain celebs that can explode their star into tiny bits forever.' \nTaylor SwiftKim KardashianMet GalaZendaya\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFrom Kylie Jenner supporters to Taylor Swift stans, top fan account creators reveal what it REALLY takes to manage some of the internet's most popular celebrity pages\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVEKing Charles set to 'pause' his cancer treatment for 11 days during high-profile royal visit to Australia later this month\n\nStrictly Come Dancing viewers left cringing after spotting an 'awful' blunder - with head judge Shirley Ballas completely oblivious\n\nMeet the Big Brother 2024 housemates: King Charles' former butler and climate activist join the line up as the iconic show returns\n\nInside the Beckhams' new £60m mega-mansion.

Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and claims the case is politically motivated.The former president has also raged about the timing of Smith's latest briefing, accusing the DOJ of looking to help Vice President Kamala Harris' election bid in November by releasing the evidence now.In an opinion piece published by The Hill on Saturday, Turley, who has been supportive of Trump throughout his legal battles, wrote that Smith's briefing was an attempt to make \"his closing election argument to voters because he knows that the 2024 election will be the largest jury verdict in history.\"\"If voters reelect Trump, then neither Chutkan nor Smith will likely see a jury in the case,\" Turley added. \"This is why they must convict Trump now in the public eye or else admit to an effective acquittal by plebiscite.\"Turley continued, however, that Smith's \"timing could well backfire.\"\"The weaponization of the legal system is central to this election, including the role of the Justice Department in pushing the debunked Russia-collusion allegations from the 2016 race,\" the attorney wrote in his op-ed. \"For many, the contents of Smith's filing is not nearly as important as the time stamp over the case caption. Titled a 'Motion for Immunity Determination,' it seems more like a 'Motion for an Election Determination.'\"Newsweek reached out to Smith's office on Sunday via email for comment on the pushback prosecutors have received over the timing of the briefing.The evidence laid out in Smith's new briefing is largely based on grand jury testimony from unnamed White House aides and others close to Trump during the aftermath of the 2020 election, during which prosecutors allege Trump and his allies pushed baseless claims of widespread voter fraud.In one example, prosecutors state that a Trump campaign staffer pressed a Trump operative in Detroit to start a riot among the former president's supporters while the state was tallying its votes on November 4, 2020. In a text to the operative, the campaign staffer allegedly wrote. \"Make them riot. Do it!!!!\"Prosecutors also focused on Trump's actions in connection to the riot. According to the briefing, on the day of the insurrection, a White House aide had approached the former president to inform him that the Secret Service and Capitol police had to relocate then-Vice President Mike Pence to a secure location due to the threats being made by rioters. Trump reportedly responded to the aide in the exchange, \"So what?\"Newsweek also reached out to Trump's campaign via email Sunday for comment.Legal experts have told Newsweek that Smith's evidence against Trump is \"pretty damning.\" Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani said last week that the evidence included in the briefing \"may turn off some moderate, undecided voters\" come November.\"The motion is also important because it helps prove Trump's knowledge that he lost the election and his intent to overturn the results nonetheless,\" Rahmani said. \"By detailing Trump's communications with his inner circle, including his Attorney General and others who told him there was no fraud, Smith can get inside Trump's head and prove the intent necessary for a criminal conviction.\"Los Angeles-based attorney John Perlstein echoed to Newsweek that Smith's new evidence helps to establish Trump's intentions after the 2020 election.\"He [Trump] said that he wouldn't accept the results if he were to lose and would do everything possible to get the election overturned,\" Perlstein said. \"There is damning evidence against him, but whether it circumvents the immunity grant given by the Supreme Court is a whole other issue.\"Turley noted in his op-ed on Saturday that while \"Smith's raw political calculation should be troubling for anyone who values the rule of law. None of this excuses anything in these allegations against Trump.\"Trump's federal election trial will not begin until after November's election as pre-trial proceedings continue. On Thursday, Chutkan gave Trump until November 7 to file his response to Smith's new filing.The reason that Smith filed his 165-page brief in the first place goes back to a U.S. Supreme Court decision on July 1 that former presidents have immunity for official acts conducted while in office but not for unofficial acts. The case was brought to the high court in a push from Trump to have the case thrown out. Smith, meanwhile, updated Trump's original indictment, and a grand jury reindicted the former president last month.The superseding indictment removes some specific allegations against Trump, but the former president is still charged with the same four counts from the original indictment filed in August 2023: conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.","summary":"Jonathan Turley wrote in a Saturday op-ed that Smith's latest court filing against Trump was a \"raw political calculation.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jack-smith-donald-trump-filing-backfire-jonathan-turley-1964620","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488608/smiths-new-donald-trump-filing-could-backfire.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 20:51:54","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":258693330,"title":"Kamala Harris Says Donald Trump Is ‘Full of Lies’ on ‘Call Her Daddy’ Podcast: ‘I Just Have to Be Very Candid With You’","text":"Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris appeared in a new episode of Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” podcast, where she spoke about abortion rights, student loans and remarks made by Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Absolutely BRUTAL!!’ one person said.\n\n‘Finally, SNL is going back to non-partisan comedy love this,’ said another.\n\nA third person said, ‘You know things are bad when left-leaning liberal Saturday Night Live is making fun of the Harris-Walz campaign.’\n\n‘Omg SNL actually made fun of them! They know she’s cooked – so it’s okay now,’ a fourth person said. \n\nOthers appreciated the moment Dana Carvey’s Joe Biden later arrives on scene at Harris’ house to give her some advice.\n\nBiden is portrayed as bumbling as he appears with his signature ice cream cone and general all-round confusion. \n\n‘Opening sketch —funny! Fox News has been more flattering to President Biden!’ said one person.\n\n‘Wow, you know the left is in trouble when SNL actually does comedy,’ another said. \n\nThe skit mocked how reverential JD Vance, played by Bowen Yang, and Walz were to one another during Tuesday night’s debate, while also poking fun at the Democrat presidential nominee.\n\n‘I am feeling good tonight,’ Rudolph’s Harris says. ‘We have got momentum. Liz Cheney’s about to endorse me and Bruce Springsteen. Cause baby I was born to run,’ she jokes, while quoting a line from one of The Boss’ legendary songs.\n\nThey proceeded to turn on the vice presidential debate with SNL’s Heidi Gardner and Chloe Fineman played CBS News debate moderators Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan respectively.\n\nAs the questions in the mock debate begin, the moderators Gardner’s O’Donnell and Fineman’s Brennan ask Gaffigan’s Walz: ‘Governor Walz. You claimed you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre when you were home in Minnesota. Can you explain that?’\n\nGaffigan’s Walz answers: ‘I think what happened is I went to Epcot. You can go around the whole world, and I had a couple in the Germany section, and I thought I went to China. Anyway, I’m a knucklehead.’\n\nBack at the Harris residence, Rudolph’s Harris begins to show concern for her running mate.\n\n‘OK, OK he’s out there he’s doing his thing, whatever that may be.’ Andy Samberg’s Doug Emhoff says. ‘Do you wanna watch something less stressful like the Menendez Brothers show?’ he asks.\n\nRudolph’s Harris suggests they re-watch her Presidential debate against Donald Trump. ‘Remember when I said his crowds were tiny and I broke his brain?’\n\nSamberg’s Emhoff tries to calm Rudolph’s Harris’ fears. ‘It’s not like he’s gonna say something crazy,’ he says.\n\nBut Samberg’s Emhoff jinxes Gaffigan’s Walz who flubs a line: ‘I’ve become friends with school shooters,’ he yells, mimicking a line during the debate in which he misspoke.\n\nIn what was likely the most memorable moments of the sketch, the pair of VP candidates find ‘common ground’ and can be seen on screen staring into each other’s eyes.\n\nDuring the skit, the two are seen saying the same thing at the exact same time as they turn to one another.\n\n‘Why are they friends? Why are they vibing?,’ Rudolph’s Harris exclaims.\n\nGaffigan’s Walz is then allowed a few more seconds speak and attempts a ‘hail Mary’ – referencing a football term to score some points before the clock runs out on the game.\n\n‘I got to get some points on the board here, so I’m going to chuck a hail Mary. Senator, will you admit that Donald Trump lost the election?’ he asks.\n\n‘Tim, I’m focused on the future,’ Yang’s Vance responds, deftly deflecting the question.\n\n‘Bump, it’s good!’ praises Gaffigan’s Walz.\n\nBack at the Harris household, Rudolph’s Harris expresses relief that Walz made it through the debate.\n\n‘This is a huge victory. It made no difference,’ she said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSaturday Night Live fans declared that the show has destroyed Kamala Harris with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8216;SNL Criticizes Kamala Harris&#8217;: Social media reacts intensely as late-night show ridicules &#8216;impaired&#8217; Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/snl-criticizes-kamala-harris-social-media-reacts-intensely-as-late-night-show-ridicules-impaired-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-SNL-officially-turns-on-Kamala-Social-media.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 20:46:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.368}]}
