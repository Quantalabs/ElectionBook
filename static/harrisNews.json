Martin O’Malley (D). Several other candidates also ran for the position.\n\n“It is my guarantee to each of you that we’re going to take the great ideas from all the candidates in this (DNC) race — we’re going to bring them into this great Party,” Martin told committee members after being elected their next chairman.\n\n“We’re going to unify this party together and we’re all going to roll up our sleeves together to build this Party,” he added.\n\nMartin further stressed to DNC members, “We have one team: the Democratic Party. And we have one fight. The fight’s not in here, it’s out there.”\n\nMartin then vowed to fight against President Trump, adding, “The fight right now is against Donald Trump and the billionaires who bought this country.”\n\nLast month, the running mate to failed presidential candidate former Vice President Kamala Harris, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), endorsed Martin as the next Democratic National Committee chairman.\n\n“In Minnesota, Ken has built a national model for how to elect Democrats in a competitive state,” Walz said at the time. “I have seen Ken’s leadership in action, and it’s exactly what we need from our next DN[C] chair.”\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Bernie Sanders in 2020. \n\nWilker fell short despite endorsements from Democrat heavyweights including House leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate leader Chuck Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \n\nIn his victory speech, Martin declared: 'The fight's not in here. The fight is for our values. The fight is for working people. The fight right now is against Donald Trump and the billionaires who bought this country.' \n\nThe race to replace outgoing DNC Chair Jamie Harrison centered on how the Democrats should respond to November's electoral drubbing, where Republicans won all seven swing states and control of both chambers of Congress. \n\nMartin's role will see him working mostly behind-the-scenes in preparing for the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election, primarily through fundraising and organizing the party's platform. \n\nHowever, DNC chairs often do not become leading national figures, and the Democrats are left searching for new leaders, with Kamala Harris losing the election comfortably while Barack Obama has been seen by some as losing his kingmaker image. \n\nDemocrats have elected Ken Martin (pictured) as the new leader of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) as the party attempts to rebuild after Donald Trump's landslide presidential election victory\n\nMartin embraces outgoing DNC Chair Jamie Harrison (left) following his election on Saturday \n\nWith his election as DNC Chair on Saturday, Martin becomes the first white male in the job since Virginia Senator Tim Kaine left the position in 2011. \n\nMartin's victory comes months after he raised eyebrows with an appearance on CNN following Trump's election win, where he slammed his own party. \n\nServing as the vice-chair of the DNC at the time, Martin declared that Republicans are now seen as the party that best represents the working-class. \n\nMartin pointed to issues within the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, with in-fighting over controversial policies such as President Biden's funding of Israel's war in Gaza seen by some observers as undermining the party in the election. \n\nHe told CNN's Jake Tapper in his election post-mortem: 'For the first time, the majority of Americans believe that the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor.\n\n'And the Democratic Party represents the interests of the wealthy and the elite.\n\n'That is a damning indictment on our party brand,' he continued. 'And that's something we have to figure out as we move forward.'\n\n'How we actually reconnect our very popular policy ideas which are passing in ballot initiatives throughout this country back to our party and candidates,' he pondered, before ultimately concluding, 'Because that's not happening.\n\n'We gave to do a better job there.'\n\nMartin beat out Ben Wikler (pictured), chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, despite Wilker gaining endorsements from several Democrat heavyweights in the race \n\nMartin seen with former Vice President Kamala Harris and her 2024 running mate Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota\n\nMartin's election to lead the Democrats in the coming years comes as the party looks ahead to the 2028 race. \n\nIn a poll held this week, the party's losing candidate Kamala Harris retained support among voters with 33 percent, overwhelmingly the number one choice. \n\nShockingly, ESPN star Stephen A. Smith received more support than several big-name potential candidates, if the 2028 primary were held today. \n\nThe sports broadcaster has previously teased a possible run for president and his recent comments on the 2024 election have gone viral.\n\nSmith shocked Bill Maher's audience with his blunt verdict on why Donald Trump won a second term in the White House - and why he feels like a 'damn fool' for supporting Kamala Harris. \n\nTwo percent said they would choose ESPN star Smith. That is more than the likes of Beto O'Rourke - who ran for the nomination in 2020 - and JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois (both one percent). \n\nRemarkably, Smith also polled only one percentage point behind Tim Walz - Harris' vice-presidential pick - and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro. \n\nDonald TrumpRepublicansDemocrats\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nThe Democrats have elected a new leader who previously gave Republicans a major shout-out\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Democratic Party elected a new Chair of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Saturday as it attempts to rebuild following President Trump's landslide election win in November.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14350237/ken-martin-elected-new-dnc-chair.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/01/20/94759393-0-image-a-38_1738442803508.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/11/24/2967998536595491229/1024x576_MP4_2967998536595491229.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-01 20:59:33","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.165},{"id":286136252,"title":"Will Stephen A.

FINAL DNC CHAIR DEBATE ROCKED BY PROTESTS He topped Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler by over 100 votes among the 428 DNC members who cast ballots as they gathered for the party's annual winter meeting, which this year was held at National Harbor in Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C. Martin O'Malley, the former two-term Maryland governor and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate who served as commissioner of the Social Security Administration during former President Biden's last year in office, was a distant third in the voting. Among the longshot candidates were Faiz Shakir, who ran the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Marianne Williamson, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2020 and 2024 Democratic presidential nominations. Williamson endorsed Martin on Saturday, ahead of the vote. The eight candidates in the race were vying to succeed DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, who decided against seeking a second straight four-year term steering the national party committee. With no clear leader in the party, the next DNC chair could become the de facto face of Democrats from coast to coast and will make major decisions on messaging, strategy, infrastructure and where to spend millions in political contributions. \"It's an important opportunity for us to not only refocus the party and what we present to voters, but also an opportunity for us to look at how we internally govern ourselves,\" longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley told Fox News Digital. Buckley, a former DNC vice chair who backed Martin, said he's \"very excited about the potential of great reform within the party.\" He emphasized that he hoped for \"significantly more support for the state parties. That's going to be a critical step towards our return to majority status.\" In his victory speech, Martin stressed unity and that the party needed \"to rebuild our coalition.\" \"We need to go on offense,\" Martin said. \"We're going to go out there and take this fight to Donald Trump and the Republicans.\" Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who succeeded President Biden last July as the party's 2024 standard-bearer, spoke with Martin, Wikler and O'Malley in the days ahead of Saturday's election, Fox News confirmed. But Harris stayed neutral in the vote for party chair. In a video message to the audience as the vote for chair was being tabulated, Harris said that the DNC has some \"hard work ahead.\" But she pledged to be with the party \"every step of the way,\" which could be a signal of her future political ambitions. The debate during the three-month DNC campaign sprint mostly focused on the logistics of modern political campaigns, such as media strategy and messaging, fundraising and grassroots organizing and get-out-the-vote efforts. On those nuts-and-bolts issues, the candidates were mostly in agreement that changes are needed to win back blue-collar voters who now support Republicans. But the final forum included a heavy focus on race and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, issues that appeared to hurt Democrats at the ballot box in November. The forum, moderated and carried live on MSNBC and held at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., devolved into chaos early on as a wave of left-wing protesters repeatedly interrupted the primetime event, heckling over concerns of climate change and billionaires' influence in America's elections before they were forcibly removed by security. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The chair election took place as a new national poll spelled more trouble for the Democrats. Only 31% of respondents in a Quinnipiac University survey conducted over the past week had a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, with 57% seeing the party in an unfavorable light. \"This is the highest percentage of voters having an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party since the Quinnipiac University Poll began asking this question,\" the survey's release noted. Meanwhile, 43% of those questioned had a favorable view of the GOP, with 45% holding an unfavorable opinion, which was the highest favorable opinion for the Republican Party ever in Quinnipiac polling.","summary":"The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Saturday elected Ken Martin as its next party chair, in the wake of major setbacks up and down the ballot in the 2024 elections.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-elect-new-chair-party-aims-rebound-following-major-2024-election-setbacks","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/ken-martin-dnc-chair-fox-news-intv.-dec.-12-2024-dc.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 19:01:08","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":286130464,"title":"Democrats choose a political operator from Minnesota as their next leader.","text":"The swiftness with which Mr. Trump has imposed his will on the government, and the nation, has only added urgency to the discussions, which are playing out in closed-door gatherings on Capitol Hill, at retreats for donors and strategists and in the intramural campaign culminating in this weekend’s election of the next leader of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nMany loud voices in the party are demanding a reckoning, and a reinvention. But others envision less an overhaul than a wait-and-see approach, hoping to harness what they expect will be a backlash of public opinion against Mr. Trump’s ambitious White House agenda to capture the House of Representatives in 2026.\n\nThe divide does not fall neatly along ideological lines. Some of the most moderate and progressive Democrats alike are aligned in seeking a sharp course correction to reverse the party’s erosion of support, especially among working-class voters.\n\n“We need deep changes and hard conversations, not nibbling around the margins,” said Representative Pat Ryan, a Democrat who represents a swing district north of New York City and who outperformed the top of the ticket by one of the wider margins in the nation. “At the core, the brand is weakened to the point that, without members running against it in tough districts, we can’t get to a majority, which is structurally untenable.”\n\nDemocrats who share this bleaker outlook see statistical signs of the party’s decline everywhere: Blue states are ceding population to red states. Voter registration figures are mostly headed in the wrong direction. More Americans are identifying with the G.O.P. than with Democrats. And Democrats lost ground last year among core constituencies including lower-income, Latino and younger voters as Mr. Trump swept every battleground state.\n\nYet, there are a number of glass-half-full Democrats, too.\n\nThat more upbeat group tends to focus on the narrowness of the G.O.P.’s current 218-to-215-seat advantage in the House, the extraordinary circumstances of the 2024 race — Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt and Democrats switched nominees over the summer — and the fact that political pendulum swings are as common as they are predictable.\n\nAlmost no one is suggesting Democrats should simply stay the course. But the differing diagnoses of the party’s affliction could lead to wildly different treatment plans — on policy, on personnel and on political priorities. One early focus has been on whether the party’s message or its difficulties in delivering that message is more to blame.\n\nRepresentative Suzan DelBene of Washington, who served as the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2024 and is staying on to oversee the party’s efforts to take the majority in 2026, noted that House Democrats “actually gained ground in 2024.” She blamed an unusual Republican redrawing of congressional maps in a single state last year for her party’s continued minority status.\n\n“Except for North Carolina doing a gerrymander, we’d be in the majority,” she said of a remapping that prompted three Democratic incumbents to abandon hopes of re-election.\n\nOthers pointed to the relatively slim 1.5-percentage-point margin of Mr. Trump’s popular vote victory, and to the fact that Democrats won Senate races in four states that Mr. Trump carried — an unusually high number to split their ticket in the current hyperpartisan era.\n\n“We know what an electoral mandate looks like for a president and his party, and it is not losing a House seat and losing four of the five swing-state Senate contests,” said Neera Tanden, who served in the White House for the last three Democratic presidents, including as director of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s domestic policy council.\n\n“There is work the party needs to do to be more compelling with working-class people — on economic and security issues,” Ms. Tanden continued. “But Trump’s popular-vote margin was less than half Biden’s four years ago.”\n\nOf course, parties that enter periods of soul-searching are often blind to what exactly they are looking for: Republicans famously ordered a political autopsy after their 2012 loss and recommended a rebranding that was, more or less, the opposite of the strident, strict approach to immigration that Mr. Trump used to return the party to power in 2016.\n\nFor Democrats, the recommendations could vary widely, given the range of groups making them: Dozens of congressional progressives recently met on Capitol Hill to settle on a message to counter Mr. Trump. A Democratic super PAC and nonprofit, American Bridge, is holding a retreat for its donors next month. And Third Way, a centrist Democratic group, is organizing a gathering in February to discuss how to “empower moderate and mainstream views and voices.”\n\nSuch air-clearing conversations are not happening in every corner of the party.\n\nTop officials on the Kamala Harris campaign and the leaders of the leading super PAC that supported her, Future Forward, have not sat down since the election for a formal discussion of what went wrong in their multibillion-dollar spending blitz. Campaign finance law prohibited such conversations during the election, and tensions rose between the two sides.\n\nFuture Forward’s leadership reached out to suggest a summit of sorts on lessons learned, but such a gathering was declined by the Harris side, according to three people briefed on the outreach, though they said there had been some informal communications across the divide.\n\nSome Democrats see the party’s losses in 2024 as more situational than systemic. They blame Mr. Biden for ignoring polling that showed the public was gravely troubled by his age, and for withdrawing so late and in such a politically weakened state that Ms. Harris effectively inherited his unpopularity without enough time to carve out a separate identity for herself.\n\n“There were people who were just very unhappy with the incumbent administration, and all they needed to know about Harris was she worked with Biden,” said Jared Bernstein, who was the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers for Mr. Biden.\n\nMr. Bernstein warned against “over-interpretation” of the 2024 result, which he said aligned with a worldwide backlash against parties in power over inflation.\n\n“It was largely a global anti-incumbency — in our case very much fueled by immigration and inflation,” he said. “We might have been able to overcome that had we been able to launch a compelling defense of pronouns versus paychecks. But we weren’t.”\n\nThe final result was Mr. Trump’s first popular-vote win in three tries, and only the second for a Republican since 1988. (The last was George W. Bush’s 2004 re-election.)\n\n“Nobody can say that this was a landslide — hell, I was Walter Mondale’s policy director in 1984, and I got buried under one,” said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nBut Mr. Galston said that focusing on the closeness of the popular vote masked unnerving movements beneath the surface, like Gallup data showing that more Americans have identified or leaned Republican than Democratic for three straight years. That had not been the case in a single year since 1991, when the G.O.P. had won the last three presidential elections.\n\nBack then, when Democrats were in the wilderness, Mr. Galston and Elaine Kamarck, a longtime Democratic National Committee member, wrote a paper together called “The Politics of Evasion” — a critique of those who made excuses for the party’s electoral shortcomings, rather than facing up to serious problems — that became a manifesto for the party’s post-Reagan revival.\n\nIn 2022, the two, who are both fellows at Brookings, published a revised warning, prescribing a course of “reality therapy” to Democrats, including over the party’s “cultural bubble,” which they said put many in the party out of touch with less-educated or lower-income Americans.\n\nMr. Galston said he and Ms. Kamarck were getting “the band back together for the last time” to draft a post-2024 update.\n\n“It makes sense to break the glass and pull the fire alarm,” he said of the party’s predicament.\n\nSome Democrats have aimed a spotlight at the long-term erosion of voter registration in key states, which seemed to come due in 2024. In Pennsylvania, the most recent figures show the Democratic edge in the state at roughly 189,000 voters — down sharply from 916,000 when Mr. Trump carried the state in 2016, and from over 325,000 as recently as last October.\n\nBut Molly Murphy, a Democratic pollster who worked on the Biden and Harris campaigns, urged her party to focus exclusively on solutions.\n\n“We don’t even need to debate how deep the hole is,” she said. “What Democrats need to do is act like we’re in a very deep hole — and if it turns up, upon climbing out, we weren’t in a deep hole, then that’s spoils to us.”","summary":"Ken Martin, a well-connected state party chair, took over the Democratic National Committee as the party searches for ways to win back power.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/01/us/dnc-chair-news/dnc-chair-pick","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/01dnc-chair-02/01dnc-chair-02-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 18:49:14","author":"Shane Goldmacher","authors":["Shane Goldmacher"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":286114704,"title":"AN OFFER THEY CAN’T REFUSE: Trump’s Brilliant Plan to Defang the Deep State","text":"President Donald Trump has offered federal employees who don’t want to return to work a deal too good to refuse, and it may also weed out some of the deep state activists who otherwise would have planned to oppose Trump’s agenda from within the federal government.\n\nA new White House memo offers a hefty paycheck to federal workers who are disinclined to acquiesce to Trump’s request that they work in the office.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management memo allows federal employees to accept “deferred resignation.” As long as they resign by Feb. 6, bureaucrats can remain on administrative leave with pay and benefits through Sept. 30, the last day of the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nAt first blush, this offer seems incredible. How many American workers wouldn’t leap at the opportunity to receive more than seven months of paid leave, during which time they can pursue another job?\n\nOn the flip side, how can the Trump administration justify giving so generous an offer to federal employees? Doesn’t this put the taxpayer on the hook to pay federal employees not to work?\n\nWhy It May Be Cost Effective\n\nFirst, the White House claims that the deferred resignation offer will save Americans money in the long run. According to Axios, the administration projects the buyouts could ultimately save up to $100 billion per year—because the administration won’t be filling all the jobs of employees who resign.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management memo phrases the changes as a “fork in the road.” It lays out four pillars of the new administration’s policy regarding federal government employment: a mandatory return to in-person work in the office; a performance culture focused on “excellence at every level”; a “more streamlined and flexible workforce” as federal agencies are restructured or closed; and “enhanced standards of conduct.” Given these changes, federal bureaucrats should expect that working in the new administration will not resemble the previous administration.\n\n“The government-wide email being sent today is to make sure that all federal workers are on board with the new administration’s plan to have federal employees in office and adhering to higher standards,” an official told Axios. “We’re five years past COVID and just 6% of federal employees work full-time in office. That is unacceptable.”\n\nThe White House projects that 5% to 10% of federal employees will accept the offer.\n\nWhile the offer is unlikely to placate federal unions like the American Federation for Government Employees—which oppose reforms like Schedule F that would enable Trump to fire bureaucrats who oppose his agenda—it may expose these unions’ true goals. If unions vehemently oppose this offer of honey, perhaps the administration has no choice but to use less sweet methods to oust Trump’s opponents.\n\nA Deep State Buyout\n\nThe offer may also defuse some of the deep state effort to oppose Trump from within. \n\nAccording to a recent RMG Research survey commissioned by the Napolitan Institute, nearly half of federal bureaucrats in the Washington, D.C., area plan to oppose the new administration politically. Worse, 64% of D.C.-based bureaucrats who voted for Kamala Harris in the last election say they would refuse to follow a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy. This opposition from within the federal government represents a classic deep state threat.\n\nTrump has already issued an executive order to resurrect his Schedule F reform, which will enable him to root out nefarious actors who would prevent the administration from carrying out its public mandate. As he gears up to aggressively implement this order, it certainly won’t hurt to offer these would-be deep staters a gracious exit.\n\nBureaucrats who plan to oppose Trump from within may be tempted by seven months of paid administrative leave. Why stick around and entrench when you could leave early, have time to find a new job, and keep your pay and benefits?\n\nAs I expose in my book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government,” a vast network of nonprofits I call the Woketopus infiltrates and brainwashes the federal government, getting its policies enshrined in regulations. Many of the bureaucrats who might otherwise oppose Trump from within may choose instead to go work at these nonprofits, which form a kind of government-in-exile.\n\nThose who do decide to stay will have to work in the office again, and the administration may ferret them out, anyway. Two of the groups I expose in The Woketopus have already sued to block Trump’s Schedule F order.\n\nThe Trump White House announced that the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, will become part of the federal government. The U.S. Digital Service, an agency established under Barack Obama, will become the U.S. DOGE Service, and this service will have mini DOGEs, what I call “DOGE-lets,” inside all other federal agencies. These DOGE-lets will keep an eye out for deep state activity against the people’s elected president.\n\nIf the deep staters don’t take the deal now, they may face DOGE accountability later. Then, when Trump fires them for opposing his administration from within, they will rue the day they refused to accept this gracious Office of Personnel Management offer.\n\nNow’s their chance. Let’s hope they take it.","summary":"President Donald Trump has offered federal employees who don’t want to return to work a deal too good to refuse, and it may also weed...

They don’t trust that when we are given power, that we know how to use it,” Conrad said.\n\nAnd the fight starts now, she added — there can be no waiting until the next presidential election, set for 2028. “We have to be organising all year round,” said Conrad, a candidate for one of the party’s deputies.\n\nAmong the favourites to lead the Democrats into the future are Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, party chairmen in Wisconsin and Minnesota, respectively, two neighbouring Midwestern states.\n\nTrump narrowly won Wisconsin over Democratic opponent, former vice-president Kamala Harris, in last November’s election. Harris defeated Trump in Minnesota — but lost the majority of traditionally conservative states in the centre of the country.\n\n‘Dog chasing the car’\n\nBoth DNC chair candidates are relatively unknown to the general public and both come from progressive backgrounds.\n\nThey emphasise the need to renew the link between the Democratic Party and working-class Americans, as well as the need to take the electoral fight to all 50 states — even those firmly in the conservative camp.\n\n“If we’re going to be a national party, we need to compete everywhere,” said Martin, 51.\n\nHis opponent, 43-year-old Wikler, said: “The soul of the Democratic Party is the fight for working people.”\n\nWikler has received endorsements from several powerful Democratic elders, including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nFacing a Republican majority in Congress and a second term for Trump, who has roared back into the White House with all the provocative rhetoric of his first administration, Democrats say they must pick their battles.\n\n“We have to be able to decipher crazy rhetoric versus policy violence,” Conrad said and not be like a “dog chasing the car”. All the more so in a sharply polarised political landscape.\n\n“This Republican Party doesn’t care. It doesn’t care about the norms, doesn’t care about institutions,” Conrad said.\n\n‘Echo chamber’\n\nWhile many are “exhausted” after the last election campaign, Jeanes said the party must learn to respond to the frantic pace of shock moves from the Trump administration.\n\nMuch of Democratic success going forward will be in how the party presents itself to an American public weary of politics. That includes going into new spheres, often far from the traditional media — which will mean being “in places that have sometimes been uncomfortable” for Democrats, according to Conrad.\n\nLast year, Jeanes said, Democrats “didn’t realise until it was too late that we were in an echo chamber of our own making”.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party was “haemorrhaging” young male voters who were being “fed part and parcel through the alt-right pipeline” to the Republican Party, according to Jeanes.\n\nAfter his victory in November, Trump credited a series of interviews on largely right-wing podcasts, including the popular Joe Rogan Experience for aiding his return to the White House.\n\n“We need to be getting on sports podcasts and video games and trying to make sure that we’re reaching into apolitical spaces,” Jeanes said.","summary":"US Democrats will choose a new flagbearer on Saturday who will be tasked with rebuilding a party still reeling from last year’s crushing presidential defeat, and figuring out how best to oppose Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n\nMeeting in a large hotel near Washington, members of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the party’s governing body, are carrying out a postmortem of their November loss and selecting a chairperson responsible for drawing up their new battle plan.\n\n\n“This is not a game of chess where everyone is moving their pieces back and forth in a respectful, timed manner.

Don’t worry though, he also thinks “President Trump is going to be an amazing president.”\n\nThe ass-kissing only ramped up from there.\n\n“I do think what President Trump is trying to do generally is correct,” Morrisey said. “The federal government, and quite frankly, the state government is operating way beyond its means, right? So you have, finally, leadership in Washington, and you have leadership here in Charleston. I’m going to work just like President Trump to tackle these issues and be transparent.” \n\nAh yes, the federal government spends too much money. But …\n\n“According to Morrisey, close to 50% of the nearly $19.9 billion West Virginia aggregate spending budget comes through federal dollars such as IGTs and transfers of some sort,” WBOY reported. \n\nFifty percent.\n\nThey hate socialism, but … 50% of West Virginia’s budget is subsidized by the rest of the country, and really, by blue states—specifically California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington. \n\nWest Virginia’s high federal spending was buttressed for years by ostensibly Democratic former Sen. Joe Manchin. He knew how to make it rain federal dollars for his constituents, and his absence will cost the state billions now that he’s retired.\n\nIf West Virginians want federal help, they can start voting for Democrats again. Otherwise, they can enjoy economic ruin in exchange for Trump and the GOP’s “only two genders” propaganda. \n\nDown in the bayou, Louisianans voted for Trump 60-38, clearly agreeing with his plan to cut trillions from the federal budget. But when Trump actually made a move to do just that by announcing the draconian spending freeze, state officials sang a different tune.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry, along with several other GOP leaders, issued a statement calling for Trump to “develop a responsible runway to untangle us from any unnecessary and egregious policies without jeopardizing the financial stability of the state.” What the diplomatic wording couldn’t betray was the threat to the state’s finances if they’re cut off from the federal taxpayer dole. \n\nOf course, they opened the statement by saying, “President Trump was elected on a mandate to cut government waste and increase the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar, a goal we whole heartedly embrace.” Yet few states are more dependent on outside taxpayers than Louisiana. \n\nWhile 20% of Americans are on Medicaid, that number is 40% in Louisiana. A startling 63% of all baby deliveries in the Pelican State are paid for by Medicaid, so take that, “pro-life” advocates. Indeed, Louisiana is ranked the seventh most federally dependent state in the country, according to a WalletHub analysis. (West Virginia is ranked fourth.) And according to Pew, in 2022, Louisiana was the state with the highest percent of revenue from the federal government, at 50.5%. \n\nThose Louisiana Republicans aren’t serious about “cutting government waste” and blah blah blah. Actually doing what Trump’s proposing would decimate their state. Like all Republicans, they think the waste and inefficiencies lay elsewhere, and their federal funding largesse is all well-deserved. And maybe it is! But regular voters in the state need to be cognizant about what they’re voting for. \n\nBottom line: If Louisianans want those federal dollars, they can start voting Democratic.\n\nAs the shockwaves from Trump’s funding freeze announcement reverberated across the country, most red-state Republican governors and legislators kept their mouths shut, likely quietly rooting for the swift Democratic lawsuits that halted Trump’s scheme. But this only delays the Trump cabal’s efforts to hack away at “woke” programs they don’t like. \n\nIt’s widely known that these cuts Trump is fixated on will affect Republican states and voters disproportionately. But a new round of billionaire tax cuts won’t pay for themselves, and congressional Republicans have made that their top priority. Those craven lawmakers have certainly made it clear that Medicaid and other programs that benefit poorer Americans are something they’re happy to sacrifice.","summary":"West Virginia is one the nation’s most reliably Republican states, as is Louisiana.

Ed Paltzik, an attorney for President Trump, said CBS needs to be held accountable. \"President Donald J. Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in deception and fake news accountable. CBS and its parent company Paramount deceived the American People by unlawfully tampering with their interview of Kamala Harris, and then hiding the transcript from the public in an attempt to save the failing, and now failed, Harris campaign, all in desperate commercial pursuit of increased profit and viewership.\" FOR THIRD YEAR IN A ROW, MORE AMERICANS HAVE ‘NO TRUST’ IN MEDIA THAN THOSE WHO DO: GALLUP Trump sued the news network in Oct. 2024, alleging \"deceptive conduct\" in how it produced the interview with Harris just ahead of the presidential election. The then-GOP candidate had accused the network of editing the exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker at the time. According to Trump and his legal team, a longer, meandering answer that Harris gave to Whitaker during a promotional clip for the interview, appeared to be edited to a sharper, more condensed answer when the primetime interview aired. Trump’s team demanded CBS News to release the full transcript of the interview that month, though the network refused, citing the First Amendment. The network insisted that \"the interview was not doctored\" and that the program \"did not hide any part of the vice president’s answer to the question at issue.\" CBS NEWS STATEMENT ON CONTROVERSIAL ’60 MINUTES’ EDIT FALLS FLAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA: 'PUBLISH. THE. TRANSCRIPT.' The refusal prompted Trump to sue for damages in a Texas federal court. The then-candidate’s attorneys said the suit comes in response to the network’s \"partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public.\" Democratic FCC commissioner Anna Gomez criticized her agency for filing the inquiry this week. The New York Times quoted her, stating, \"Let’s be clear, this is a retaliatory move by the government against broadcasters whose content or coverage is perceived to be unfavorable. It is designed to instill fear in broadcast stations and influence a network’s editorial decisions.\" CBS and Paramount reps did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for any additional comment.

Meeting in a large hotel near Washington, members of the Democratic National Committee, the party's governing body, are carrying out a postmortem of their November loss and selecting a chairperson responsible for drawing up their new battle plan.\"This is not a game of chess where everyone is moving their pieces back and forth in a respectful, timed manner. This is guerilla warfare in political form,\" said Katherine Jeanes, deputy digital director of the North Carolina Democratic Party.Maryland Governor Wes Moore, a rising Democratic star, warned the party must \"not to go into hiding until the next general election.\"\"We need to band together and show the country what we can achieve,\" he said at the party's general session on Friday.The moment calls for boldness, added Shasti Conrad, chair of the party's Washington state branch, warning that many Americans have lost the faith. \"They don't trust us to be able to make things better. They don't trust that when we are given power, that we know how to use it,\" Conrad said.And the fight starts now, she added — there can be no waiting until the next presidential election, set for 2028.\"We have to be organizing all year round,\" said Conrad, a candidate for one of the party's deputies.Among the favorites to lead the Democrats into the future are Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, party chairmen in Wisconsin and Minnesota, respectively, two neighboring Midwestern states.Trump narrowly won Wisconsin over Democratic opponent, former vice-president Kamala Harris, in last November election.Harris defeated Trump in Minnesota — but lost the majority of traditionally conservative states in the center of the country. 'Dog chasing the car' Both DNC chair candidates are relatively unknown to the general public and both come from progressive backgrounds.They emphasize the need to renew the link between the Democratic Party and working-class Americans, as well as the need to take the electoral fight to all 50 states — even those firmly in the conservative camp.\"If we're going to be a national party, we need to compete everywhere,\" said Martin, 51.His opponent, 43-year-old Wikler, said: \"The soul of the Democratic Party is the fight for working people.\"Wikler has received endorsements from several powerful Democratic elders, including former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.Facing a Republican majority in Congress and a second term for Trump, who has roared back into the White House with all the provocative rhetoric of his first administration, Democrats say they must pick their battles.\"We have to be able to decipher crazy rhetoric versus policy violence,\" said Conrad, and not be like a \"dog chasing the car.\"All the more so in a sharply polarized political landscape.\"This Republican Party doesn't care. It doesn't care about the norms, doesn't care about institutions,\" Conrad said. 'Echo chamber' While many are \"exhausted\" after the last election campaign, Jeanes said the party must learn to respond to the frantic pace of shock moves from the Trump administration.Much of Democratic success going forward will be in how the party presents itself to an American public weary of politics.That includes going into new spheres, often far from the traditional media -- which will mean being \"in places that have sometimes been uncomfortable\" for Democrats, according to Conrad.Last year, Jeanes said, Democrats \"didn't realize until it was too late that we were in an echo chamber of our own making.\"Meanwhile, the Democratic Party was \"hemorrhaging\" young male voters who were being \"fed part and parcel through the alt-right pipeline\" to the Republican Party, according to Jeanes.After his victory in November, Trump credited a series of interviews on largely right-wing podcasts, including the popular \"Joe Rogan Experience,\" for aiding his return to the White House. \"We need to be getting on sports podcasts and video games and trying to make sure that we're reaching into apolitical spaces,\" Jeanes said. by Robin Legrand","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/02/01/us-democrats-look-for-a-roadmap-new-leader-to-take-on-trump","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-01-14/asz88nf4/00036EL37J.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 15:10:15","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.05},{"id":286069622,"title":"Leadership For Facing Distraction, Disruption And Destruction","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nLeaders best able to face the chaos of this time have access to centeredness, truth, agility and ... [+] wholeness of heart.\nPavel Danilyuk, PEXELS\n\nOnly two times in its history has the American Association for the Advancement of Science waded into the waters of endorsing a presidential candidate: Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024. Both times, it was for the same reason, that their opponent—now President Trump—was deeply unscientific. Shortly into his second term, we see evidence of that as he shut off public health communication from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) while an active health threat to Americans, the bird flu virus, is underway. He also shut down activity at the National Institutes of Health, which determines funding to academic institutions. As for priorities in the Department of Health and Human Services, his direction was to root out any Diversity, Equity or Inclusion (DEI) initiatives and report colleagues who might be “disguising” such activities.\n\nAs of this writing, we’re still in the shock and awe stage of the second Trump presidency. Some of his directives will turn out to be distractions, some will be disruptive, many will be destructive. Regardless which side of the political aisle one favors, it’s hard to miss the irony—or dangers—of a deeply unscientific President supported by a billionaire class whose wealth was made possible by science, leading a country who advances have been made possible by science. We seem to be regressing as a country to a pre-rational stage while flouting the power that comes only with being a rational, scientific society. Leaders, meaning anyone committed to making a positive difference, are in for a wild year. All the more reason to have some trustworthy strategies for facing its distraction, disruption and destruction-. Here are four.\n\nBe Centered\n\nThe ability to face unsettling conditions on the outside starts with stability on the inside, that is, a quality of centeredness. Our language and experience tell us that the countervailing force to being spun up, upset or wound up is to slow down, settle down and calm down. So, the centeredness that will best support us is grounded down, through our feet into the earth, and centered in the lower abdomen, the region called hara.\n\nHara centeredness is central in Japanese martial arts, as well as in Zen Leadership and my line of Zen training as it supports deep, slow breathing, generates vital energy and coordinates the most effective use of the body. Techniques for hara breathing have been written about and shown elsewhere. In meditation, hara breathing cuts through discursive thinking and cultivates the kind of mind that is not easily distracted. In martial arts and leadership, it supports clarity and coherence in action, even under tense conditions.\n\nAs an example of this training at work, tense conditions are exactly what Zen colleagues, David and Sarah, face in their home city of Chicago, which has been targeted by the Trump administration for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, against which due process resistance has organized including the Mayor’s and Governor’s offices and the Chicago police. According to David, the ICE activity seems to be aimed at “instilling fear and making people feel targeted from multiple sides, literally scared into submission. And we tell everyone what we do to not default into fear: Zen, walking, connecting with people, puzzling, reading, napping, anything that brings joy and centers us.”\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warns iPhone And Android Users—Stop Answering These Calls\n\nGmail Security Warning For 2.5 Billion Users—AI Hack Confirmed\n\nApple’s New ‘Game Changer’ iPhone Update Brings Starlink Satellite Access\n\nThe more centered we are, the more we can help others find similar stability in themselves. The more stable we are collectively, the less unhinged we will become in this time, including being unhinged from the truth.\n\nIt’s worth remembering in an era of Truth Social that truth is not clicks; it’s not up for grabs to the highest bidder or most outrageous tweeter. There is a Way to life, a way to know when to seed and when to harvest, or how to use the laws of physics to launch a rocket into space. For millennia, from Indigenous wisdom traditions to Taoism to science, humans have tried to understand that way, indeed, participate in and harness that way to flourish. None of that changes because of who’s president; truth is truth, and being a human part of it means we have a compass for it.\n\nBill George calls this the “True North” that guides leaders through a successful life. It shows up in staying true to our values, true our mission and reminding people why we do what we do. For example the day after the CDC gag order came out, Katelyn Jatelina, writing as Your Local Epidemiologist, reminded people to see past distraction to what is true:\n\nThis is a moment of uncertainty, but public health has always been about more than federal leadership. It’s about the local communities, the health workers, and the scientists who step forward when systems falter. There are a lot of unknowns, but what we know is that public health is needed today, tomorrow, and every day after that. Stay steady, stay engaged, and keep your eye on the ball. The health of 330 million Americans depends on it.\n\nOf course, not everyone has the same values or sees the same truth. Each person reads their compass from their own perspective. Part of being committed to truth is recognizing that no single perspective can see the whole picture, so we willingly seek multiple sources and listen to one another. This is exactly how science accumulates collective knowledge, where each person declares their truth and how they came to it, so others can replicate it, improve on it, perhaps disprove it, but collectively we keep unveiling more of the cosmos.\n\nPart of being true is being willing to drop our opinions in favor of getting to a common foundation in empirical facts.\n\nBeing centered and true helps us lead with clear intention, but in times of wild uncertainty, we also need to be agile and not attached to outcomes. Aiming for an outcome is part of clear intention, but getting stuck there when the landscape has radically changed is pointless and exhausting. At times, when major social, political or climatic forces are raining down on us, the best we can do is simply take care of people. Advance the mission another day.\n\nAn ever-present way to access this agility is through the four energy patterns of our nervous system. By skillfully moving between them, we cover the bases of leadership from sensing a future ready to happen to giving that vision some form and process, to engaging others in collaboration, to making a determined push to bring that future into the present. These four patterns—Visionary, Organizer, Collaborator and Driver—also respond differently to change. The Driver in us wants to fight, especially if the change is unwanted and unsupportive of our goals. The Collaborator in us can more readily roll with the punches, connect with others and find its way around obstacles. Our inner Organizer might feel anxious and struggle to adapt to the new rules of the game, while our Visionary pattern can connect to the big picture, let go and expand into new possibilities.\n\nWhat we know from our research into FEBI, the personality assessment that measures these mind-body patterns, is that most of us have a couple of preferred patterns that we use regularly. But it’s also true that we have all four and can physically access weaker patterns as we need them, making them easier to access with practice. If you were a leader in a government agency that was suddenly shut down or silenced, which patterns would most help you most now? They may not be the patterns that got you the job.\n\nHara centeredness, a commitment to and connection with what’s true, and agility of means without attachment to ends can help meet the chaos of this time with the best that can come through us.\n\nBe Heartened\n\nZooming in on the chaos campaign of these early days of the second Trump administration might be entertaining to some but is also a source of outrage and despair to many—certainly to all those who have dedicated their careers to scientific and democratic values. Zooming out on this pre-rational regression that has taken hold in our culture, one can see it fitting a larger picture of autocracies on the rise in a “might makes right” world, where the wealthy are determined to be the prevailing class. Zooming out further, one can see how this even pattern is fueled by the existential fear that the overburdened ecology of our planet cannot sustainably support modern human life as we’ve construed it. Zooming out further still to take in the long arc of evolution and human development, one can see how it always moves in fits and starts—not a straight line—but the direction is clear: we grow up toward greater complexity, consciousness and connection. And finally, zooming out to the level of the great cosmic dance of Big Bangs and creation and destruction and ever-churning change, one can see how, yes, even the creative destruction of our current time is not out of place.\n\nWhether as an act of imagination or the Zen Leadership experience of ourselves as this whole, churning picture, we can take heart in recognizing that we are both part and whole: both a local self-in-a-skin and an unborn and undying whole Self through which this phenomenal universe resonates. We can take heart in the possibility that we chose this time to be local, to take our place as a leader, so that some truth could come through us—what we might call our purpose, our True North—that adds value for others. From a place of wholeness, we can face distraction, disruption and destruction centered in our truth, agile in our means and with boundless resilience and resourcefulness.

That’s by Design","text":"This morning, the Democratic National Committee will begin a multi-round election to choose its new chair. Former President Joe Biden’s appointee, Jamie Harrison, is on his way out, and an array of party insiders and outsiders are competing to replace him. \n\nThe DNC’s 448 voting members include hundreds of Democrats elected and selected through state parties, along with smaller numbers of appointees, elected officials, and representatives from party groups like the Young Democrats of America. They will cast ballots for a new chair at a time when the Democratic Party itself is adrift, with no clear leader and no strategy for fighting the Trump agenda or regaining power. As one DNC member told me, “The DNC is not really talking about what went wrong and what we did wrong.”\n\nWith Republicans running the White House and Congress, the person who wins the DNC chair race will take on a critical role in U.S. politics. They will serve as a national spokesperson for the Democratic Party while simultaneously leading a fundraising and campaign organization that received and disbursed over $450 million in campaign funds over the last two years.\n\nGiven these realities, the DNC chair race has attracted national media attention – mostly of the horse-race sort. What hasn’t gotten the attention that it deserves is the curious reality of just how undemocratic the DNC actually is, and how this perpetuates the risk of national political defeats for the Democratic Party as a whole.\n\nIn writing this piece, I reached out to 427 of the DNC’s 448 voting members and interviewed 19 of them. Those who spoke with me came from ideologically, geographically, and racially diverse backgrounds. They included Democrats from rural and urban communities, grassroots party members, elected officials, and party insiders and critics alike. Most agreed to speak on the condition their names wouldn’t be used.\n\nWhat emerged from these conversations is a picture of a DNC that is built to be an undemocratic, top-down institution, unable to truly leverage the wisdom and guidance of the DNC members who hail from local and state networks across the country. This is especially true when those local and state members disagree with the DNC’s posture or strategic choices.Harrison, the outgoing chair, did not respond to interview requests, and DNC executive director Sam Cornale did not reply to written questions regarding the concerns raised by DNC members to me. If these member concerns are not addressed, there’s reason to fear the organization will be unable to effectively steer the party away from the kinds of electoral crises that it has faced in recent years, including its resounding national defeat in 2024.\n\nA Culture of Deference \n\nThe DNC has several responsibilities: setting the Democratic presidential primary election calendar, organizing the Democratic National Convention, determining the Democratic Party platform, and supporting the election and re-election of Democratic presidents. \n\nIn practice, what this means is that when a Democrat holds the White House, that president decides who should be DNC chair and in turn dictates the DNC’s strategic and organizational priorities. And so a key contradiction emerges – that which is in the perceived self-interest of a sitting Democratic president is not necessarily in the interest of the Democratic Party. \n\nThe 2024 elections were a case in point. President Biden may have wanted to run for re-election, but America would have been better served if DNC members were empowered to publicly challenge that decision and force a national debate to happen much sooner. But Biden controlled the DNC through Harrison, his hand-picked chair, and the culture of the DNC is not one that rewards dissent.\n\nEven after news of Biden’s cognitive decline started to leak out, significant pressure was brought to bear to keep everyone in line. In the words of one very angry DNC member, “The Democratic Party fucked up by wholeheartedly supporting Biden when everybody and their brother knew that he could not win the general election.” The member said anyone who spoke out against the process became a target. “The character assassination that happens when people raise legitimate issues is a significant problem,” they said. “I’ve seen it over and over again.” They pointed to numerous Democrats’ attacks on former Congressman Dean Phillips, who challenged Biden in the 2024 primaries, as one example.\n\nThis highlights a central tension inside the committee. Does it exist to shape the party’s direction, or provide a perfunctory sign-off?\n\nThe DNC’s 448 members serve as a kind of board of directors for the organization, though in reality, a much smaller number have leadership roles. (DNC members also serve as superdelegates to the Democratic National Convention that occurs every four years, though most convention delegates are selected through separate state primaries and caucuses.)\n\nIn my interviews, multiple DNC members articulated variations of the sentiment that they feel like rubber stamps expected to give their blessing to strategic and financial decisions with little oversight. As one DNC member put it, “I know we have a $300 million budget, but I have no idea where the $300 million budget goes. I don’t know more than your average Democratic voter.” \n\nMembers said their meetings don’t feel like a place for participation or governance. They described these gatherings as a combination of party presentations and social time, as opposed to real debates or discussions. During COVID, for instance, one member said that meetings were held via web conference, with the chat function turned off. And while the potential for real decisionmaking can occur at the DNC committee level, “committees are completely rigged, with the chair appointing whoever they want,” one DNC member told me. \n\nUntil very recently, DNC members weren’t even given access to each other’s contact information. One DNC member suspected that this was an effort to prevent independent organizing among members and to protect the privacy of higher profile members, such as prominent elected officials or donors.\n\nTo preserve the culture of deference to Democratic Party elites, DNC members are chosen through a system that appears designed to dilute the power of local Democratic Party voices and representatives. Of the 448 DNC members who ostensibly govern the DNC, 75 are elected by the DNC members themselves. In practice, these 75 DNC members are actually appointed by the DNC chair.\n\nAs one member described it, building majority support for internal reforms is a difficult task made harder by the presence of 75 appointed votes. If the DNC chair or a Democratic U.S. president opposes a change to how the DNC operates, these appointed votes make it “almost impossible” to build the needed majority.\n\nMoney in Democratic Politics\n\nComing out of a disastrous 2024, a common progressive critique is that the Democratic Party is beholden to corporate and wealthy interests that steer the party away from populist, working class oriented campaigns and policies. They point to the example that Kamala Harris managed to outspend Donald Trump yet lost the popular vote. \n\nIn some ways, the race for DNC chair has itself become a microcosm of this tension between money, transparency, and winning elections. Minnesota Democratic-Farm-Labor Party chair Ken Martin and Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler are considered the frontrunners based on their declared, though likely inflated, DNC vote counts. But neither has disclosed how much money they have raised for their campaigns, who their donors are, or how much they have spent. \n\nPerhaps sensing an opportunity, last week DNC chair candidate and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley disclosed his donor list and total funds raised: $350,000. O’Malley, who is presumed to be in third place, called on Wikler to release his donors’ names as well. \n\nVinod Thomas, a DNC member from North Carolina, said multiple chair candidates and members of their staffs told him they were spending either six or seven figure sums on their campaigns. “Considering that there are only 448 eligible voters, and the win number for the race is 225, the cost per vote in these elections raises a lot of questions for me,” Thomas said.\n\nI requested interviews with Martin, Wikler, and O’Malley, as well as Faiz Shakir, a late entry to the campaign. Only Shakir agreed to my request for an on-the-record interview. \n\nTheir reluctance to speak makes sense in a way: they only need the votes of 448 very specific people and can strategically ignore those who might ask troublesome questions.\n\nShakir, the former chair of the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign, told me in an interview that he had raised “zero dollars” and that his campaign expenses were “slight” and “out of pocket.” He added, “I couldn’t in good conscience ask people to give me money for a PAC, which I then use to send mailers to delegates and buy branded water bottles and throw cocktail parties. That’s just not the way I think we should raise and use money. I’m doing it the old-fashioned way – trying to talk over the phone, one on one.”\n\nIn our conversation, Shakir laid out his vision for a Democratic Party that stands in the trenches with working class voters and their struggles for economic fairness. He envisions a Democratic Party that is actively supportive when workers face off against the injustices in their lives, including when working class communities go on strike, challenge utility rate hikes, oppose unjust evictions, or fight addiction in their local communities. \n\nShakir argued that if the Democratic Party wants to be the working class party, it should use its resources to stand in solidarity with workers and prove through actions and words that “We stand with you.” \n\n“When they see you don’t act with that kind of fire in your belly, they stay home,” he said.\n\nCan the DNC and Democratic Party change to address these concerns? On the one hand, the DNC is not the sole or necessarily even most powerful organization in the Democratic Party. It exists within an alphabet soup of party entities that focus on overlapping concerns – congressional campaigns, state races, and more. In many cases, the funds that the DNC receives and spends actually originate with these other Democratic entities. \n\nBut the DNC is unique in that its voting members draw in significant part from state and local Democratic Party communities. Because of this, the DNC could in theory be transformed into a robust organization that helps to hold the Democratic Party accountable to its base – and as a result, makes the party as a whole more responsive and likely to win in national elections. \n\nOne reform-minded DNC member was cautiously optimistic that change could be coming. They argued that the three front runner candidates for DNC chair – Martin, Wikler, and O’Malley – have advocated for reforms in the tactics, structure, and operations of the DNC. The candidates’ statements and proposed reforms have addressed the internal dominance of consultants, reducing the number of DNC chair appointments, devolving more power and funding to state parties and communities, and improving Democrats’ communications strategies. The DNC member saw these proposed reforms as helping make the Democratic Party a “more mobile and change-oriented organization.”\n\n“There’s a broad understanding that we do need to change how we do business or we are not going to survive as a party, or even as a country,” the member said.\n\nStarting with today’s election, we will begin to see just how deep that understanding is, and whether it leads to substantive changes in how the Democratic Party engages the public and competes for power.","summary":"With the Democratic party reeling from its losses, the DNC is voting on a new chair.

It's claimed Ellen and her wife Portia de Rossi, 52, made a \"technical breach\" with their home improvements. However, according to reports, the pair's updates are thought to risk disturbing Roman remains on the site.\n\nIt's thought the proposed work has led to parish councillors contacting local planning enforcement officers to air their concerns.\n\nAccording to Mail Online, three parish councillors said the onus is on the owner of a property to report any historic remains which are uncovered. The publication states parish council minutes reading: \"Concern was expressed by residents that the hedge and wire fence could increase flood risk in the village' if rubbish was swept down and 'caught on the fence', thereby 'limiting flow across the field'.\"\n\nIt comes after the area dealt with floods in December. As the UK was hit by torrential rain, 80 mph winds, and severe flooding, residents were left struggling to cope with the aftermath.

Can cities help?","text":"By Rachel Somerstein for Next City\n\nAmaryllis Castillo gets to work at 7:45 a.m. for her job as a certified home health aide. The mother of two, who is 26 weeks pregnant, works a six-hour shift caring for elderly patients, taking them to activities and out for lunch. At 5 p.m., she clocks in for her second job providing customer service, which she works until 9 p.m. She does that from home, which allows her to be with her children, who are 12 and two.\n\nBut despite working these two jobs—for a combined 50 or more hours a week—Castillo, who lives in Philadelphia, barely makes enough to cover rent, daycare, car payments, utilities, and groceries (though she makes too much to qualify for food stamps), Next City reports. Neither job comes with benefits: No health insurance, no paid sick leave, no 401(k), and no paid time off to recover from the upcoming birth of her baby.\n\n“I’m just making it happen,” she says.\n\nThe American approach to pregnancy and birth has largely been to leave families to manage the transition to new parenthood on their own. The United States is one of the only countries in the world without paid parental leave, and while a handful of states have started their own paid-leave initiatives—though Pennsylvania isn’t one of them—even these programs do not cover all workers. Nor is there a national program for preventing or treating postpartum mood disorders, or PPMDs—mental health conditions that include postpartum depression, postpartum anxiety, PTSD, and postpartum psychosis—which affect about 15-20% of new mothers in America.\n\nFinancial stress is among a myriad of factors that can trigger PPMDs. Being low-income is a risk factor for developing depression, and one of the greatest predictors for developing a PPMD is having previously experienced a mental health disorder. When it comes to postpartum depression in particular, financial strain and hardship have been found to exert a “small but significant” impact on the likelihood of developing it. This effect, researchers assert, is “consistent across different cultures and countries.”\n\nThe impacts of postpartum mood disorders are significant: One of the drivers of the U.S.’s maternal health crisis is suicide, which accounts for about one in five pregnancy-related deaths during pregnancy or up to a year postpartum. PPMDs are also costly in other ways, with a recent study in the American Journal of Public Health estimating that over five years, each mother and baby affected by PPMDs cost $31,800—from their higher usage of health care, lost time at work and greater use of public services like Medicaid—adding up to an estimated $14 billion public cost over five years. New programs in Philadelphia and Flint, Michigan have implemented a simple solution to the patchwork of paid leave programs and potentially protect against some of the harm of PPMDs: a universal basic income during pregnancy and for the first year postpartum. The Flint program, Rx Kids, is so promising that Kamala Harris modeled her proposed tax-credit initiative on it.\n\nThese programs are expected to demonstrate improved health outcomes for mothers and babies: maternal stress has been linked to preterm birth and low birth weight, for instance. And there’s ample evidence for their efficacy in reducing parents’ symptoms of anxiety, initiating changes to infant brain activity, and increasing the likelihood that children of recipients will finish high school and college. A 2022 review of 20 studies of cash transfer programs in Canada, which has hosted such initiatives since 1945, demonstrates similar improvements to parents’ and children’s health over time.\n\nHere in the U.S., these programs demonstrate the unique role that cities can play in reducing high financial stress—and thereby reducing the risk of developing a PPMD and initiating a cascade of harms. Though some amount of postpartum mood disorders cannot be prevented, reducing financial stressors may prove protective.\n\nThree Cities Take On Post-Partum Health\n\nCastillo is one of 250 mothers from three Philadelphia neighborhoods receiving $1,000 a month from the city’s new Philly Joy Bank, beginning in their second trimester of pregnancy and lasting until their baby’s first birthday.\n\nThe money has already made a difference: She opened a savings account and now can afford life insurance, both tasks that alleviate existential fear about the future. The funds will also enable her to put money toward school, she says, which will help her work toward a job in optometry—that would pay $7 an hour more than what she’s currently making. Castillo also plans to put the money toward taking six weeks off from work after her baby’s birth, though she notes that the monthly $1,000 isn’t enough to cover her bills for that whole period.\n\nThe Philly Joy Bank, which launched in June 2024, is funded by local philanthropic organizations and administered by the city’s Department of Health’s Division of Maternal, Child and Family Health. The initiative emerged from the city’s Community Action Network, a collaborative group that includes parents, physicians, and community organizations focused on reducing infant mortality in the city. Together, the group agreed that guaranteed income would significantly reduce pregnant people’s stress. The program enrolls mothers from three neighborhoods with the city’s highest rates of low birthweights and preterm birth. The money is offered unconditionally. Participants are also offered a menu of other support—financial counseling and other programs, for instance—but they do not have to participate in them.\n\nMother of four and new enrollee Briana Mitchell is using some of the money to move. In September 2024, she was doubled up with family. She will be relocating to a three-bedroom house, which wouldn’t have been possible without the Philly Joy Bank money, or the assistance from a program that provides security deposits. Mitchell, who works independently to do hair, does not have access to paid leave. Her husband, who recently started his own construction company, does not have access to paid leave either.\n\n“Entrepreneurs don’t get paid leave at all,” she says.\n\nAnd while she’s accustomed to working as much as possible—seeing as many as 20 clients in a three-day span—”I don’t have to do as much” because of the Philly Joy Bank funds, she says. “I don’t have to take as many people.”\n\nRx Kids, the Flint program, differs slightly from Philly Joy Bank’s design. For one, it’s universal: Every new mother in Flint is eligible. The initiative, launched in January, is a public-private partnership that uses $16.5 million of government Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, funding, earmarked for low-income people, over five years and $30 million in philanthropic and other funds, including corporations and American Rescue Plan money. Participants receive $1,500 once during the second trimester of pregnancy and $500 each month for the first year of their baby’s life. This money, too, is no-strings-attached.\n\n“Families have the freedom of choice to best meet their needs,” says Dr. Mona Hanna, Rx Kids cofounder, associate dean of public health and professor at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. Hanna, a pediatrician, identified elevated levels of lead in Flint’s children from the city’s water in 2015 and led a community initiative to respond to the crisis.\n\nLuke Shaefer, a cofounder of the program and a professor of social justice and social policy and director of Poverty Solutions at the University of Michigan, identified an “obscure provision” in state TANF funds that allows families to receive four months of financial aid during an acute economic crisis without triggering time limits or work requirements. Shaefer and Hanna made the case that childbirth qualifies as an acute crisis. At that point, a person is at her poorest; earnings go down toward the end of pregnancy and mothers step out of the workforce, while babies also bring on additional costs. Yet pregnancy and the newborn period are “the most critical for child development,” says Hanna. “It’s crazy when you think of the science of it.”\n\nThe philanthropic money Hanna and Shaefer raised enabled them to make the program available to every person who has a baby in Flint—as opposed to only those who would be eligible for Medicaid or a small pilot serving only a few families—and to extend the support to a year. The initiative, she says, is a “place-based intervention. It’s not about poor people, but about poor places.” The universality of the program is key, says Hanna. It “conveys dignity, as opposed to” programs “that convey shame or stigma.” More than 90% of newborns in Flint have participated since its inception—about 1,185 families.\n\nSeveral other communities in Michigan are planning to adopt Rx Kids, Shaefer and Hanna says, including Kalamazoo—which will begin in February. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer included $20 million more TANF dollars in the state’s 2025 budget to make it possible to expand the program to other low-income parts of the state. Shaefer and Hanna have raised another$40 million to make that public-private partnership possible, and are still raising money to explore how such a program might work in rural parts of Michigan such as the Upper Peninsula.\n\nDr. Stacey Kallem, director of the Philadelphia’s Department of Public Health’s Maternal, Child and Family Health division, says that if programs like Philly Joy Bank demonstrate their efficacy, they might also provide leverage to change how federal funding can be used for maternal-child health. Presently, many public maternal and child health funding mechanisms like the Healthy Start program cannot be used to give cash to people as guaranteed income programs. But, says Kallem, “if programs like ours show they’re effective,” and ultimately improve outcomes and save money for communities, “shouldn’t we change the way that government funding flows?”\n\nIn that way, the cash transfer programs in Philadelphia and Flint attest to how nimble local governments can be, says Rachel Louise Moran, associate professor of history at the University of North Texas and author of “Blue: A History of Postpartum Depression.” Previous attempts to pass federal legislation supporting mothers with postpartum depression stumbled over unrelated issues that ultimately stripped the legislation of real power or funding or killed it altogether.\n\n“When you’re going big and national, you’re dealing with some really entrenched political issues,” she says. But with local governments, she points out, the “intense performing for CSPAN politics are not there.”\n\nThat’s how the California Abundant Birth Project has functioned; the program, which provides no-strings-attached cash and started in 2021, has enrolled 561 mothers so far at risk of preterm birth in Alameda, Contra Costa, Los Angeles and Riverside Counties, who each receive money starting in their first or second trimester and lasting through the first year of the baby’s life. (Mothers in San Francisco, in Contra Costa County, receive $1,000 a month; mothers in other places receive slightly less.)\n\nDoing this work requires overcoming an entrenched American ideology about maternal mental health, which is that it’s an individual, private problem—something a mother must overcome on her own. But that approach is inadequate, not least because the impacts of postpartum mood disorders extend far beyond a mother’s life and relationship to her child and last longer than the first few months after birth.\n\nBut it also matters how and whether a city indicates that PPMDs are an issue of public health. On its city website, Santa Barbara includes information and links to Postpartum Education for Parents, one of the country’s earliest organized postpartum depression advocacy groups, that helps mothers with postpartum mood disorders; the City of Toronto does so too. In doing so, these cities demonstrate that PPMDs aren’t a private problem; they’re definitively a public issue, deserving not only of attention, but resources—a critical argument to make given that research and treatment of PPMDs has historically been underfunded.\n\nStill, the Philly Joy Bank, Rx Kids, and Abundant Birth Fund initiatives differ from other supports because they provide cash unconditionally. That also stands out from the kind of support that large postpartum depression advocacy groups have pushed for, Moran points out. “The large organizations have had a very strong emphasis on bipartisan support for legislation, sometimes to the detriment of being able to think systemically,” she says.\n\n“I feel like [programs like] Philly Joy Bank should be everywhere,” Castillo says. “You can see the economy is bad. The cost of food is bad. And as you can see, these jobs are not paying [anything]. If they paid us more money, we could possibly make things happen, but we’re really making under what we should be making.”\n\nWhich is why the extra money from Philly Joy Bank is so critical: “Having the extra money makes me feel less stressed,” she says. “Way less stressed.”\n\nThis story was co-published with The 19th, a nonprofit newsroom reporting on gender, politics, and policy.\n\nThis story was produced by Next City, a nonprofit newsroom covering solutions for equitable cities, and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.","summary":"One of the drivers of the U.S.’s maternal health crisis is suicide, which accounts for about one in five pregnancy-related deaths during pregnancy or up to a year postpartum.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/01/post-partum-depression-is-costing-us-billions-can-cities-help/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1468298759.jpg?w=1024&h=706","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 14:05:00","author":"Stacker","authors":["Stacker"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.059},{"id":286063098,"title":"Caribbean Matters: Black History Month and its Caribbean connections","text":"Caribbean Matters is a weekly series from Daily Kos. Hope you’ll join us here every Saturday. If you are unfamiliar with the region, check out Caribbean Matters: Getting to know the countries of the Caribbean.\n\nWe enter Black History Month this year filled with uncertainty. It’s unclear how the newly elected government led by President Donald Trump and his appointees will attempt to limit or erase annual celebrations which have been in place since Dr. Carter G. Woodson initiated Negro History Week in 1926. This unease isn’t new, given right-wing efforts to ban teaching Black history and remove books from school curriculum and libraries.\n\nThe contributions of Caribbean Americans to our history are an important part of our story that should not be overlooked, and those of you who are teachers or who have children at home can resist the efforts at erasure by utilizing resources that are available online.\n\nLet’s start at the beginning. The advent of massive numbers of Black people to the Caribbean and the Americas began with the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Contrary to how many people in the U.S. may view that history, the vast majority of enslaved Africans were not brought to America.\n\nStatistica has posted a simplified map:\n\nStatistica data journalist Katharina Buchholz gives some background to the map:\n\n400 years ago, in August 1619, the first ship with enslaved Africans destined for the United States arrived in what was then the colony of Virginia. But the cruel history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade begins much earlier and goes on much longer – for more than 350 years.\n\nIn fact, many enslaved people lived in the English colonies in North America before that date. They came to the present-day U.S. via Spanish and Portuguese colonies, where enslaved Africans arrived as early as 1514, or were transferred as bounty from Spanish or Portuguese ships.\n\nThe United States are heavily associated with slavery and the capture and forceful relocation of Africans. Around 300,000 disembarked in the U.S. directly, while many more arrived via the inter-American slave trade from the Caribbean or Latin America. It is estimated that almost 4.5 million enslaved Africans arrived in the Caribbean and another 3.2 million in present-day Brazil.\n\nProfessor Henry Louis Gates wrote for The Root back in 2014 about how many slaves actually landed in the U.S.:\n\nPerhaps you, like me, were raised essentially to think of the slave experience primarily in terms of our black ancestors here in the United States. In other words, slavery was primarily about us, right, from Crispus Attucks and Phillis Wheatley, Benjamin Banneker and Richard Allen, all the way to Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass. Think of this as an instance of what we might think of as African-American exceptionalism. (In other words, if it's in \"the black Experience,\" it's got to be about black Americans.) Well, think again.\n\nThe most comprehensive analysis of shipping records over the course of the slave trade is the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, edited by professors David Eltis and David Richardson. (While the editors are careful to say that all of their figures are estimates, I believe that they are the best estimates that we have, the proverbial \"gold standard\" in the field of the study of the slave trade.) Between 1525 and 1866, in the entire history of the slave trade to the New World, according to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, 12.5 million Africans were shipped to the New World. 10.7 million survived the dreaded Middle Passage, disembarking in North America, the Caribbean and South America.\n\nAnd how many of these 10.7 million Africans were shipped directly to North America? Only about 388,000. That's right: a tiny percentage.\n\nThis JAM60 article, from 2022 makes an important point about historical connections:\n\nPeople from the Caribbean were taken to America in 17th century as slaves. The beginnings of a strong Caribbean community was established in South Carolina and Virginia by British slave masters who took slaves from Barbados around 1650. The majority of South Carolina’s slaves were from Barbados up to 1750. It was estimated that as high as 20 percent of South Carolina’s slaves were from the Caribbean. The majority of slaves living in the north states were also of Caribbean origin. Slaves from New York were three times more likely to be from the Caribbean than those from Africa.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute covers contemporary data on Caribbean immigrants in the U.S.: \n\nVoluntary, large-scale migration from the Caribbean to the United States began in the first half of the 20th century, following the end of the Spanish-American War, when a defeated Spain renounced its claims to Cuba and, among other acts, ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. In the early 1900s, U.S. firms employed Caribbean workers to help build the Panama Canal, and many of these migrants later settled in New York. A high demand for labor among U.S. fruit harvesting industries drew additional labor migrants, particularly to Florida. After World War II, U.S. companies heavily recruited thousands of English-speaking “W2” contract workers from the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Barbados to fill critical jobs in health care and agriculture. Around the same time, political instability in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic fueled emigration from the region. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, an estimated 1.4 million people fled to the United States. Whereas the first major migration of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and other Caribbean nations was comprised mostly of the members of the elite and skilled professionals, the subsequent flows consisted chiefly of their family members and working-class individuals.\n\nCBS New York posted this feature on Caribbean immigrants arriving via Ellis Island. While millions of immigrants from Europe and Asia arrived through Ellis Island, hundreds of thousands of Black people entered from the Caribbean as well:\n\nPolicy Analyst Dr. Valerie Lacarte in a post for the Sustainable Development and Climate Change blog points out the contributions of Caribbean Americans.:\n\nBlack Caribbean immigrants and their children contribute to improving the Black experience in the US by taking an active role in dismantling barriers that plague all Black people. \n\nJamaicans and Haitians make up two thirds of Black Caribbean immigrants and 9 out of 10 Black Caribbean immigrants live on the East coast.\n\nSince the 1950s, a combination of low economic opportunities, political instability, crime and natural disasters have pushed thousands out of the Caribbean. In the US, the number of people born in the Caribbean who identifies as Black totals 2,083,488, representing 44% of all Black immigrants in the US. Jamaicans and Haitians make up two thirds of Black Caribbean immigrants, followed by Trinidadians, Dominicans, and in smaller numbers Barbadians, Cubans, Grenadians and Bahamians.\n\nYou may wonder why I’m emphasizing this data, and the connections between us Black folks here, those in the Caribbean, and Caribbean Americans. During the 2020 election cycle and this last one as well, there were a series of right-wing-funded attacks perpetrated against Vice President Kamala Harris questioning her “blackness,” though she has a Black Jamaican father. Alongside of that, Caribbean Americans were also dubbed not “Black Americans” by groups like ADOS and their social media followers.\n\nLiz Dunn wrote for Left Voice:\n\nADOS, or American Descendants of Slavery, is a group founded by Yvette Carnell and Antonio Moore that is ”in favor of reparations for the descendants of slaves who were held in captivity in the United States, affirmative action for slavery descendants, and government subsidy of education and health care.” Their strategy involves differentiating themselves from non-American Black people, including more recent immigrants who have suffered and resisted alongside us for generations. For them, reparations are based on a specific kind of American identity, and ”Black immigrants should be barred from accessing affirmative action and other set asides intended for ADOS, as should Asians, Latinos, white women, and other ‘minority’ groups.” While addressing the issues Black Americans face in their specificity is important, doing so by scapegoating other marginalized groups and aligning with white supremacists is a misstep.\n\nAccording to Media Matters, co-founder of ADOS Yvette Carnell is a board member for Progressives for Immigration Reform, which has been identified by the SPLC as a front for the far-right group Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). FAIR has supported Trump’s border wall, mass deportations, concentration camps, and other violent and racist policies. Carnell, by associating with white supremacist groups, is pushing for material gains for Black Americans by targeting undocumented people.\n\nIn 2020, in response to ADOS, Black social media influencers like Reecie Colbert were quick to point out the names of some of our illustrious Caribbean Americans such as Malcolm X, Shirley Chisholm, Marcus Garvey, Stokely Carmichael, Sidney Poitier, and others.\n\nWe recently featured President Joe Biden’s pardon of Marcus Garvey, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s ties to the Caribbean.\n\nAs we gear up for the battle to take back the House and the Senate in 2026, alongside the election struggles in state legislatures, and local elections, we need more solidarity, not less. We have to push much more forcefully to support those most affected by the right-wing push to destroy birthright citizenship. \n\nWhile a majority of media attention has been focused on our southern border, we must not forget the plight of undocumented (and documented) Caribbean nationals and their children in other parts of the country. The recent detention of a Puerto Rican military vet in an ICE raid in Newark, New Jersey, has raised more concerns, since Puerto Ricans are American citizens.\n\nI raised these same concerns about right-wing funded divisiveness in 2022 multiple times. I feel it is important to repeat them, and I plan to keep doing so.\n\nThough Black History Month is celebrated in our shortest month, and in other times of the year elsewhere in the world (it’s in October in the UK), Black history is foundational to our history all year round. We should work to ensure that the role of the Caribbean and Caribbean Americans are always included.\n\nJoin me in the comments section below to discuss and for the weekly Caribbean News roundup.\n\nI’m curious.

He announced plans to declare a “national emergency at our southern border,” with measures aimed at halting immigration and deporting “criminal immigrants.” Additionally, he also took responsibility for his administration’s commitment to restoring the economy and addressing other pressing national concerns.\n\nTrump’s second term was also marked by a series of controversial decisions and actions that sparked intense debate across the political spectrum. From pardoning convicted criminals to clashing with allies on the international stage, the impact of his presidency left a lasting imprint. Here are four deeply troubling things Trump did during his second term that raised concerns about the future of U.S. governance, justice, and global leadership.\n\n1. Donald Trump responded to the Potomac River plane crash with a conspiracy theory\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nTrump being Trump, In the aftermath of the tragic plane crash in the Potomac River, the White House, under his guidance, issued an initial statement indicating that the President had been fully briefed and would release more information later. However, soon after, the President took to Truth Social with claims that the airplane was flying along a perfect and routine line of approach to the airport and that a helicopter had been heading straight toward it for an extended period. He also questioned as to why the aircraft was not navigated properly.\n\n2. Donald Trump’s orders to freeze government funds \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by John B. Larson (@repjohnblarson) \n\nFollowing his return to office, Trump ordered a freeze on nearly all government grants and loans; the White House reversed the decision within 48 hours. The sudden freeze caused controversy, including questions about the alleged misuse of government funds, such as claims about $50 million for condoms sent to Gaza, which turned out to be unfounded. A judge even ordered the halt of the freeze, leading to the White House backing down. This move also brought mixed reactions on social media.\n\n3. Donald Trump’s Unfounded Claim about Hamas Condoms\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAs per The Mirror, at a bill signing, the President claimed: “We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.” He claimed that they made bombs from condoms. However, his words were pointed out by experts, who said that USAID spends much less on contraceptives globally, with the $7 million spent last year providing approximately 137 million condoms worldwide—far from the inflated number Trump mentioned.\n\n4. Trump’s orders to set up migrant detention camps in Guantanamo Bay\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Wake Up Singapore 🇸🇬 (@wakeupsingapore) \n\nWhile Donald Trump gave orders for a new migrant prison at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, aiming to detain up to 30,000 individuals he deems “the worst criminal illegal aliens,” his move was criticized by the Cuban government, which criticized the US for illegal detention on what it considers occupied land. Trump argued that the severity of the offenses committed by some individuals made it unsafe for their home countries to take them back, so they would be sent to the infamous detention center instead.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n Apart from these four points, several other key points that Trump mentioned in his inaugural speech, like focusing on illegal immigrants and policies that are already being carried out, As per Mint, on January 24, the US government launched a major deportation operation under President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Hundreds of migrants were arrested, and some were flown out of the country by the military.\n\nWhile few of these quick and sudden changes carried out by Trump’s administration have deeply shocked people. For better or for worse, Donald Trump is back, and he is all set to make America great again! Love him, hate him, but we surely cannot ignore him.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump, who won the U.S. presidential elections held on November 5, 2024, against Kamala Harris, returned to the White House on January 20, 2025, after his inauguration.

And the stock market did not like it at all.\n\nAnd he emptied a couple of reservoirs for no reason, risking immediate flooding and future droughts for farmers.\n\nMeanwhile, he started to purge those who investigated him for his literal crimes from the FBI.\n\nAnd he apparently continues to let his buddy Elon Musk and his bully boys take over highly sensitive parts of the US Government and do whatever he wants with them.\n\nWe've reached the \"find out\" stage of Trump's shock and awe strategy - here's what you need to know.\n\n1. Sent the stock market tumbling after confirming tariffs on Canada, Mexico and Canada\n\n Trump confirmed last night that tariffs of 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico and 10% on goods with China would kick in today. Even crude oil imports from Canada - which make up a huge chunk of America's supply - will have a 10% tariff slapped on them. \n\nIn response, the Dow Jones Industrial Average did this.\n\nTrump was largely elected on promises to make goods cheaper for Americans. This is unlikely to help with that.\n\n2. Purged people who investigated him from the FBI\n\nAs the evening went on, it emerged that as many as 20 senior FBI heads of field offices - including those in Miami and Washington DC who investigated Trump - had been told to resign or retire.\n\nMany of them are in positions where they can only be fired for \"cause\" - as in, if they've done something manifestly wrong. The legality of the purge is deeply questionable.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the acting FBI director confirmed last night in a memo to staff that he's been ordered by the Department of Justice to fire eight FBI executives and turn over the names of every employee who worked on January 6th cases.\n\n3. Let Elon Musk do basically whatever he wants\n\nA top Treasury official was forced out of his job this week after refusing to give Elon Musk access to the US government's payment system.\n\nDavid Lebreyk resisted requests from Musk's bully boys - before announcing he was resigning after 35 years at the department, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe system Musk wants access to makes billions of payments for the government - including staff payroll, pensions and contractors.\n\nHe reportedly claims to want to examine the system for \"fraud and abuse\" - claiming the government is sending money to fraudsters or people who don't exist.\n\nBut it contains sensitive personal data about millions of Americans, as well as financial details of companies.\n\nAnd that's not all he's been up to.\n\nMusk's lackeys charged with running the government's HR system are reported to have locked civil servants out of computer systems that contain the personal data of millions of Americans.\n\nSenior officials at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) have had their access revoked to some of the department's data systems.\n\nThey include the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, which contains dates of birth, Social Security numbers, appraisals, home addresses, pay grades and length of service of government workers.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Musk allies moved into OPM on the day of Trump's inauguration - installing sofa beds so they can work around the clock.\n\n Meanwhile, Wired reported Musk's minions have taken over the Government Services Administration (GSA) - which manages government offices and technology. \n\nThe team is said to be \"attempting to use White House security credentials to gain unusual access to GSA tech, deploying a suite of new AI software, and recreating the office in X's image.\"\n\nThe changes could reportedly allow Musk to gain remote access to laptops and read people's emails.\n\nOne GSA staff member told Wired: \"I believe these people do not want to help the federal government provide services to the American people. They are acting like this is a takeover of a tech company.\"\n\nAll totally normal. Definitely not bone-chilling.\n\n4. Admitted it could take months to end the Ukraine war\n\n Before he took office, Trump infamously promised to end the Ukraine war on day one. \n\nLast night his Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, severely downgraded that pledge.\n\nHe said: \"I would like to say it's months, and it's not years. I would like to think that we could have something in the short term...I'd like to see it count down from 100 days back...this is all in the realm of the doable.\"\n\n5. Emptied a bunch of reservoirs for no reason\n\nTrump has been borderline obsessed with the idea that someone in California has refused to turn a tap on that could put out all the fires.\n\nThe fires have (at this time) all been put out, but that's by the by.\n\nLast night, someone - apparently under orders from Trump's White House - opened dams and emptied two reservoirs California.\n\nOne problem - neither reservoir flows to Los Angeles, 200 miles away, where the fires were.\n\nWhich means all he's accomplished is to lose billions of gallons of water which was being stored so farmers could use it in the Summer.\n\nOh, and pose a risk of flooding to populated areas.\n\nA former official told Politico the move could \"endanger property and lives.\"\n\nThey said: \"Dumping the water from Lake Kaweah and Success Lake poses a flood risk to downstream communities...It also reduces the amount of irrigation water available to farmers during the driest months of the year.\"\n\nStill, Trump thought it was \"beautiful\".\n\n6. Demanded journalists hand over materials to pursue a feud with Kamala Harris\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last night demanded CBS News hand over unedited transcripts and tapes of an interview with Kamala Harris from before the election - which Trump has long claimed was edited in order to make her look better.\n\nCBS says \"we are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do\", according to media analyst Brian Stelter.\n\nAs a licensed broadcaster, CBS is legally required to respond to \"reasonable requests\" from the FCC.\n\n7. Started scrubbing science research from the internet\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has started to delete science data and research from its website under orders from the Trump administration.\n\nThe body's website says it has removed data to comply with Trump's executive orders on diversity and transgender policies.\n\nThe agency has reportedly ordered employees to scrub any mention of \"gender\", replacing it with \"sex.\"\n\nThe missing information includes nearly 20 years of CDC surveillance data on HIV, hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis, according to The Atlantic.\n\n8. Gave his picks for FBI chief and Education Secretary $800k worth of shares in his company\n\nTrump Media Inc, the loss-making business that owns Truth Social, handed around $800,000 worth of shares to Kash Patel - who Trump wants to make director of the FBI - and Linda McMahon, the former Wrestling executive he's picked to lead (and abolish) the Education Department.\n\nTrump Media called the gifts in the filings \"consideration for services provided\".","summary":"Donald Trump yesterday oversaw some of the most chilling - and probably illegal - actions ever taken by a US President.

The photo was taken on January 21, the day after her husband's inauguration, in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House by Mrs Trump's favourite photographer, the Belgian Regine Mahaux.\n\nIt was clearly no accident that it contrasted sharply with the official picture Mahaux took of Melania after the 2017 inauguration. That earlier portrait was in colour, soft-lit and had the former model looking far more approachable with her arms folded and the glimmer of a smile.\n\nThis time, Mrs Trump – wearing a Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo jacket, open-necked blouse, and Ralph Lauren cummerbund and trousers – is resting her fingers on a table, with the obelisk of the Washington Monument visible behind her.\n\nThis is a First Lady who, accused of being unenthusiastic and out of her depth last time, wants to tell us this time round she means business. If so, she isn't the only one.\n\nUS Vogue magazine, which regards itself as the ultimate arbiter in such matters, delivered its own verdict and editor-in-chief Anna Wintour didn't miss the opportunity to re-open a long-running feud with Mrs Trump.\n\nVogue fashion writer Hannah Jackson, giving her assessment of the First Lady's portrait, was merciless. Wearing a tuxedo rather than a blazer or blouse made her 'look more like a freelance magician than a public servant'.\n\nMs Jackson continued: 'It's perhaps unsurprising that a woman who lived in a gold-encrusted penthouse, whose fame is so intertwined with a reality-television empire, would refuse to abandon theatrics – even when faced with 248 years of tradition.'\n\nMs Jackson twists the knife in further by noting that 54-year-old Mrs Trump, whose face in the 2017 photo was 'airbrushed into oblivion', 'regularly sends messages with her clothing choices', mentioning her infamous decision to wear a Zara jacket emblazoned with the words 'I Really Don't Care, Do U?' when she went to visit migrant children held in a Texas detention centre in 2018. (She later insisted she'd been referring to her critics not the children's plight.)\n\nMs Jackson observed: 'Now, attempting a no-nonsense businesswoman approach in her situationally inappropriate tuxedo, it seems Melania Trump still struggles with sartorial messaging.'\n\nWas this a case of a writer going rogue? Far from it, fashion industry insiders said it was inconceivable Vogue would have lashed out at the incoming First Lady without its long serving and powerful editor-in-chief knowing.\n\nAt 75, Ms Wintour is just three years President Trump's junior and has been at the helm of the magazine since 1988. 'Anna approves every single word of that magazine,' a source told the Mail. 'This is Anna saying, 'We have nothing to do with that woman. She is invisible to us'.\n\n'To say anything favourable about Melania would go against everything Anna stands for. She doesn't need to be associated with that regime. Effectively, ['freelance magician'] was dictated by Anna herself.'\n\nMrs Trump has yet to comment but yesterday Bill White – a friend of Melania, as well as Donald Trump's nominee for US ambassador to Belgium – said: 'We love and adore her. We have cancelled all our subscriptions to Conde NASTY [Vogue is published by Conde Nast]. I encourage everyone who loves America to do the same.' \n\nSocial media has also erupted in fury from Trump supporters incensed by the cattiness of the attack. Meanwhile, conservative commentator Todd Starnes lambasted the 'mean girls who run Vogue' and, contrasted the magazine's failure to put Mrs Trump on its cover when she was first in the White House with the endless times it has afforded that honour to prominent Democrat women.\n\nCertainly, given this latest chapter in the feud between the First Lady and the first lady of fashion, it appears ever more unlikely Mrs Trump will appear on the fashion bible cover during her second term.\n\nBut surprising as it sounds, there was a time when Ms Wintour and Vogue courted Melania.\n\nMs Wintour put her on the cover in 2005 just after she married Trump, a predictably lavish affair at his Mar-a-Lago palace in Palm Beach, Florida, which the fashion queen actually attended.\n\nHowever, when Trump ran for the presidency in 2016, shrugging off his former Democrat leanings to embrace the Republicans, the couple came to understand why she's nicknamed 'Nuclear Wintour'.\n\nAccording to Wintour biographer Amy Odell, towards the end of that year, Ms Wintour went to meet Trump at the couple's Manhattan home in Trump Tower and failed to let Mrs Trump know she was coming. Melania was reportedly 'so offended' she 'didn't even say hello' to Ms Wintour.\n\nAnd while it is often claimed that Ms Wintour snubbed Mrs Trump by making her the only First Lady she refused to put on her front cover, Ms Odell reported that Vogue insisted it actually made two attempts to photograph her 'but in part since they wouldn't guarantee [her] a cover, Melania wouldn't do it'.\n\nConsidering Ms Odell also claimed that Ms Wintour was so upset by Trump's 2016 election victory that the famously glacial journalist cried in front of staff the following day, sceptics might wonder how hard Vogue actually tried to get the First Lady back in its pages.\n\nMrs Trump certainly believed she'd been snubbed, telling Fox News in 2022: 'They're biased and they have likes and dislikes, and it's so obvious.\n\n'It was their decision, and I have much more important things to do – and I did in the White House – than being on the cover of Vogue.'\n\nShe put it in rather blunter terms in 2018 in a secretly-recorded conversation with her former aide and friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, in which she reportedly said: 'I don't give a f*** about Vogue or any other magazine. They would never put me on the cover.'\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Wintour has been pointedly antagonistic towards Mrs Trump. In 2019 she gave an interview to The Economist in which, asked what she thought of the First Lady's fashion statements, she heaped praise on her predecessor Michelle Obama instead.\n\nAnd when asked if only Democrat First Ladies graced her front covers, Ms Wintour sniffed: 'I think it's important for Vogue to support women who are leading change in this country.'\n\nIn the same year, Ms Wintour was asked about snubbing Melania Trump in a CNN interview.\n\n'Those of us that work at Conde Nast believe that you have to stand up for what you believe in,' she explained.\n\nWhile some have complained that Vogue should stay out of politics, Ms Wintour ramped up her efforts to root for the Democrats in last year's election.\n\nShe held private fundraising parties for Joe Biden and put his wife Jill on the front cover of Vogue's August issue. And just two days after Biden announced he was stepping down, Vogue endorsed Kamala Harris.\n\nEven so, having Mrs Biden wear a £3,900 Ralph Lauren dress and similarly priced earrings for her Vogue photo shoot badly backfired as both Republicans and Democrats mocked the moneyed elitism on display.\n\nRepublicans may be counting their blessings, then, that Melania never has had that First Lady front cover.\n\nShe, on the other hand, may have discovered this week that there may be one thing worse than being ignored by Vogue – and that's not being ignored.\n\nOne suspects – either way – these days she really doesn't care.","summary":"Starkly dressed in black and white and photographed in monochrome, Melania Trump appears intent on projecting not only stylishness but power and determination.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14347461/fashions-ice-queen-froze-Lady-does-Melania-care.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/31/17/94734561-0-image-m-9_1738344337458.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 11:40:57","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":286042430,"title":"Foreign Hackers Are Using Google’s Gemini in Attacks on the US","text":"The rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI platform, heightened concerns this week over the United States’ AI dominance as Americans increasingly adopt Chinese-owned digital services.

China-linked groups used Gemini for tactical research into technical concepts like data exfiltration and privilege escalation. In North Korea, hackers used it to draft cover letters for remote technology jobs, reportedly in support of the regime’s effort to place spies in tech roles to fund its nuclear program.\nThis is not the first time foreign hacking groups have been found using chatbots. Last year, OpenAI disclosed that five such groups had used ChatGPT in similar ways.\nWhatsApp Reveals Targets of Paragon Spyware\nOn Friday, WhatsApp disclosed that nearly 100 journalists and civil society members were targeted by spyware developed by the Israeli firm Paragon Solutions. The Meta-owned company alerted affected individuals, stating with “high confidence” that at least 90 users had been targeted and “possibly compromised,” according to a statement to The Guardian. WhatsApp did not reveal where the victims were located, including whether any were in the United States.\nThe attack appears to have used a “zero-click” exploit, meaning victims were infected without needing to open a malicious link or attachment. Once a phone is compromised, the spyware—known as Graphite—grants the operator full access, including the ability to read end-to-end encrypted messages sent via apps like WhatsApp and Signal.\nWhile it remains unclear who orchestrated the attack, Paragon’s spyware is marketed to government clients, and is similar to that of NSO Group, the controversial Israeli firm behind the Pegasus spyware.\nIn October, WIRED reported that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement had signed a $2 million contract with the Israeli firm. After our reporting, ICE later issued a stop-work order to review whether the deal complied with a Biden administration executive order restricting the use of spyware to limited circumstances. That 2023 executive order remains in effect, despite the Trump administration rescinding dozens of Biden-era policies in Trump’s first two weeks in office.\nHackers Used AT&T Breach Data to Hunt for Info on US Politicians\nHackers behind last year’s massive AT&T data breach sifted through stolen records in search of information linked to high-profile figures, including members of the Trump family, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Jeanette Rubio, the wife of Senator Marco Rubio, according to 404 Media.\nIn April 2024, hackers breached AT&T’s instance of Snowflake, a widely used data warehousing tool, gaining access to 50 billion records of calls and text messages. According to 404Media, the hackers then enriched the dataset using publicly available tools, appending names to phone numbers to make the records more identifiable as part of a plant to launch a lookup tool that would allow anyone to search the stolen records—for a fee.\nTwo individuals have been identified as allegedly responsible for the breach: Connor Riley Moucka, a Canadian national who was arrested in November; and John Binns, an American hacker residing in Turkey who was previously arrested for a 2021 breach of T-Mobile. They are linked to a loosely connected online network of criminals called the Com.\nMystery Drones Over New Jersey Were ‘Authorized,’ White House Says\nAt the first press briefing of Donald Trump’s second administration, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the surge of unexplained drones spotted over New Jersey and other parts of the East Coast late last year. Leavitt said President Trump personally briefed her on the issue in the Oval Office, stating, “After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.”\nLeavitt downplayed concerns about a foreign threat, adding, “In time, it got worse due to curiosity. This was not the enemy.”\nThe wave of sightings began just before Thanksgiving, with witnesses reporting unidentified drones flying in formation night after night. Some were spotted hovering over military installations and water reservoirs. Within weeks, the FBI received more than 5,000 reports of drone activity—only about 100 cases warranted further investigation.\nDespite mounting public pressure, officials offered few definitive answers. By mid-December, a coalition of federal agencies—including the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Department of Defense—issued a joint statement concluding that the reported aerial objects were a mix of lawful drones, airplanes, helicopters, and stars.","summary":"Plus: WhatsApp discloses nearly 100 targets of spyware, hackers used the AT&T breach to hunt for details on US

Minutes’ Harris interview transcripts to FCC","text":"CBS says it will turn over an unedited transcript of its October interview with Kamala Harris to the Federal Communications Commission, part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing fight with the network over how it handled a story about his opponent.\n\nTrump sued CBS for $10 million over the “60 Minutes” interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good.\n\nPublished reports said that CBS’ parent company, Paramount, has been talking to Trump’s lawyers about a settlement.\n\nThe network said Friday that it was compelled by Brendan Carr, Trump’s appointee as FCC chairman, to turn over the transcripts and camera feeds of the interview for a parallel investigation by the commission.\n\n“60 Minutes” has resisted releasing transcripts for this and all of its interviews, to avoid second-guessing of its editing process.\n\nThe case, particularly a potential settlement, is being closely watched by advocates for press freedom and by journalists within CBS, whose lawyers called Trump’s lawsuit “completely without merit” and promised to vigorously fight it after it was filed.\n\nThe Harris interview initially drew attention because CBS News showed Harris giving completely different responses to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker in clips that were aired on “Face the Nation” on Oct. 6 and the next night on “60 Minutes.”\n\nThe network said each clip came from a lengthy response by Harris to Whitaker’s question, but they were edited to fit time constraints on both broadcasts.\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in Texas on Nov. 1, Trump charged it was deceptive editing designed to benefit Harris and constituted “partisan and unlawful acts of voter interference.”\n\nTrump, who turned down a request to be interviewed by “60 Minutes” during the campaign, has continued his fight despite winning the election less than a week after the lawsuit was filed.\n\nThe network has not commented on

Trump?","text":"If the only way to stop a bully is to punch them in the nose, who is balling up their fists and putting Donald Trump in their sights?\n\nIn the less than two weeks since he returned to the White House, Trump has fired federal prosecutors who targeted him in criminal cases, stripped critical former top officials with threats on their lives of security details, and ordered that the Guantanamo Bay military base—home since 2002 to detained enemy combatants—be turned into a migrant detention camp.\n\nThat’s on top of his threats to take Greenland and the Panama Canal by force, make Canada the 51st American state, and slap tariffs on any country that doesn’t submit to his will.\n\nThis, at least, is Trump’s plan as he starts his second four-year term as president.\n\nHe’s quickly set his country on a collision course with allies and enemies alike, seemingly confident that he can bulldoze his way to victory, leaving in his wake a broken pile of “woke” opponents, migrant masses, economic rivals and legal checks on the world’s most powerful politician.\n\nBut even a hard-headed negotiator like Trump would be wise to remember the words of another legendary combatant, Mike Tyson: everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.\n\nDemocrats on the defensive\n\n“When we fight, we win.”\n\nThat Kamala Harris campaign slogan was also a reminder this week from a half-dozen Democratic state governors to Sen. Chuck Schumer, who leads the Democratic minority in the U.S. Senate, according to the New York Times.\n\nOutnumbered by Republicans in both congressional chambers, the domestic political opposition is struggling to be heard and seen amid Trump’s daily flurries of presidential proclamations and press statements.\n\nThere are court challenges planned or already launched against some of the president’s executive orders, among them one that would end automatic citizenship for those born on American soil, which has its origins in an 1868 constitutional amendment that extended rights to former slaves.\n\nSome cases will inevitably be decided by the Supreme Court, to which Trump appointed three conservative judges during his first term in office.\n\nBut Democrats have already claimed one win after the Trump administration was forced to clarify a presidential order that froze federal funding after payments to social assistance and Medicaid beneficiaries, small businesses and farmers were cut off, sparking chaos across the country.\n\n“This is Trump’s first major loss,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declared on social media. “When we fight, we win.”\n\nBut if the dearth of people gearing up for the fight is any indication, that’s a contested take.\n\nCanada pushes back\n\nLook across the U.S. border to Canada, where the debate on how to take on Trump is raging.\n\nIn the race to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, former Liberal finance minister Chrystia Freeland is running a leadership campaign that boasts about her bad relations with the world’s most powerful political leader.\n\nThis week, she released a retaliatory plan to protect the Canadian economy from Trump’s tariff threats that proposes an axis of angst made up of Mexico, Panama, Denmark and the European Union to fight back against American aggression.\n\nHer primary leadership opponent, Mark Carney, has also called for tariffs on American imports, but his campaign has focused more broadly on casting him as an experienced and responsible economic steward.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre might be horrified to find himself allied with Freeland but, in his own words, they are agreed on the need for retaliatory tariffs as well as one other key matter: “You have to respond with strength,” he told an interviewer earlier this month. Trump, he said, “respects strength.”\n\nIron-fist idolatry was a takeaway from Trump’s first term in office, when he cozied up to dictators, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean President Kim Jong Un.\n\nHe’s also spoken admiringly of Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying, “He runs 1.4-billion people with an iron fist.”\n\nThis time around, those traditional American adversaries have some reason for concern, despite the president’s admiration for autocrats.\n\nChecking Chinese dominance is a key driver of Trump’s foreign and economic policies, as well as the reason he’s given for needing to seize control of the Panama Canal.\n\nBut there appears little appetite in Beijing for a full-on fight with Washington, said William Matthews, a senior research fellow with Chatham House.\n\n“I think they would rather avoid that, if possible,” said Matthews. “I get the impression that they are prepared for a fight over trade, for example, if there’s going to be one. I think they’d rather it didn’t happen.”\n\nChina could make life difficult for Trump by starving the U.S. of critical minerals needed for things like computer chips used in the automotive, defence and other vital industries.\n\nMatthews warned, however, that China was likely to continue building up its military presence in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, testing whether Trump’s “America First” world view would give it free reign to create its own regional zone of influence.\n\nPutin, meanwhile, is awaiting an icebreaker telephone call and an eventual meeting with Trump as a prelude to talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nThat could be a temporary blessing in disguise for Putin, whose economy is suffering after three years of war and economic sanctions.\n\nCordial as any meeting between Trump and Putin may appear, the Russian president has deep distrust of American power due to the real and perceived slights he says his country has suffered since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nAmerica’s allies reassess\n\nThe last time Trump was in power, Peter Mandelson, a former British Labour MP, cabinet minister, European trade commissioner and member of the House of Lords, rather undiplomatically referred to him as “a bully,” “a danger to the world,” and “a little short of a white nationalist and racist.”\n\nMandelson’s tone has moderated since he was tipped by U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer to be the country’s next ambassador to Washington.\n\n“I think (Trump) has won fresh respect,” Mandelson told Fox News in an apologetic interview this week. “He certainly has from me, and that is going to be the basis of all the work I do as His Majesty’s ambassador in the United States.”\n\nIt is by far the most radical recalculation, but not the only one occurring on the European continent, where the 27-state European Union is deeply divided on what feels like an absentee ally.\n\nTrump has questioned the orthodoxy of defending Ukraine as well as the utility of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while demanding that NATO member states commit billions of dollars more to defence spending. And Europe is also threatened with tariffs to tackle trade grievances.\n\nTrump has his cheerleaders on the continent, including Viktor Orban of Hungary, Slovakia’s Robert Fico and Poland’s Andrzej Duda. Giorgia Meloni of Italy has been touted as a European “Trump whisperer.”\n\nOthers are more fearful of the risks facing Europe, from procuring energy to managing migration to combating Russian interference, and they are concerned that Trump’s policies will only exacerbate EU divisions.\n\nThe likely next German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a recent campaign stop that Europe must be bold in response to the America First agenda.\n\n“What’s our response? Be small, obey, be fearful?” he asked, adding that those who supplicate themselves before the powerful in America are too often treated like a doormat.\n\nFirst fight?\n\nWho will bow and who will rise?\n\nThe first to be tested could be the Kingdom of Denmark and its autonomous Arctic territory, Greenland. Trump has said he wants to buy the island, but wouldn’t rule out using military pressure to seal the deal.\n\n“This is not a joke,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Megyn Kelly Show in an interview Friday. He said the American military was bound by a defence agreement to protect Greenland against threats from China “because Denmark can’t stop them.”\n\n“If we’re already on the hook for having to do that, then what we might as well have more control over what happens there,” Rubio said.\n\nThe simple response to that assertion is that Greenland is not for sale and an overwhelming majority of Greenlanders are opposed to having the American flag fluttering in their frigid winds.\n\nThat was the message that Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen took to Paris, Berlin and Brussels this week as she attempts to build a common front against an expansionist America.\n\nBut there is a divide-and-conquer logic behind Trump’s attempts to take the island.\n\nGreenlanders are going to the polls this spring. A key ballot issue will be the island’s independence from Denmark, promoted by Prime Minister Múte Egede’s party, Inuit Ataqatigiit.\n\nThe 36-year-old leader has a simple message that he would like to deliver in person to the suddenly menacing leader of the free world: Greenland’s 56,000 souls don’t want to be Danes, but they don’t want to be Americans either.\n\nWhile he awaits that meeting, Frederiksen is scrambling to deal with the rotten situation facing her country.\n\nOn Friday, she explained that her government is considering the imposition of a potentially painful ”war tax” in response to Trump’s other order from his White House bully pulpit, that NATO allies increase their defence spending from two per cent of GDP to five per cent.\n\nIt’s a two-track attack that indicates there is some method in the global menace that Trump 2.0 is spreading: it’s the prospect that even if he loses in his most outlandish demands, he could still emerge a winner.","summary":"The U.S. president has set his country on a collision course with allies and enemies alike, seemingly confident that he can bulldoze his way to victory, leaving in his wake a broken pile of “woke” opponents, migrant masses, economic rivals…","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/who-in-the-world-will-stand-up-to-donald-trump/article_57203b14-dfd6-11ef-81ee-331978661e44.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/6b/b6bd1e1a-45e5-5fdf-9c19-845b728b6614/679d2ad71606e.image.jpg?crop=1761%2C925%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 11:00:00","author":"Allan Woods","authors":["Allan Woods"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":286030362,"title":"The RFK Jr. Op-Ed the Los Angeles Times Didn’t Want You to Read","text":"As public health scholars have long observed, the root of our collective problem lies in gross overinvestment in profitable medical interventions, which account for only 10–20 percent of what shapes health in the U.S., alongside massive underinvestment in the far more consequential political-economic determinants of health: housing, working conditions, basic income, environmental and food regulation, and everyday social support. Yet, instead of prioritizing these issues, the Biden administration called for a “return to normal”—a boon for the healthcare industry but a death sentence for the approximately one million U.S. residents who die from preventable causes each year. Despite an historic opportunity to rally the public behind bold changes, Biden––and then Kamala Harris too—chose to defend an indefensible status quo. \n\nDonald Trump, by contrast, has risen to power on the promise of wide-ranging disruption. What unites Trump’s chosen health officials are their militant critiques of entrenched public health norms shaped by technocratic experts who have allowed mass preventable death for corporate profits to become our national norm. But while Trump’s health nominees have been loud in their criticisms of the status quo, they have so far offered no coherent vision for rebuilding the nation’s public health on a new basis. Many worry their agenda will ultimately be purely destructive and simply further feed the private profit-making machine. After all, destruction is easy, but building new systems and improving existing institutions requires competence, vision, and hard work.\n\nIf they hope to do more than simply destroy and leave mass preventable death in their wake, then Trump’s health officials should look to the convergence of their own criticisms with parallel critiques of neoliberal health policy that have long emanated from the political left. In the process, they should embrace a genuinely populist model of public health. This approach would prioritize providing immediate, tangible benefits to working people and empower them as both recipients and providers of care rather than simply consumers inside a perverse system that serves the rich by abandoning the poor.","summary":"Editors note: As The New Republic reported on Friday, the Los Angeles Times—currently in a race to the bottom with The Washington Post to determine which of the two venerable institutions can sell out to Donald Trump the hardest—found itself in a fresh controversy after contributor Eric Reinhart accused the paper of making significant edits to a piece of his that was largely critical of Robert F.

Yet network exit polls tell us Trump's share of the popular vote in 2024 was higher among those with household income of less than $50,000 than among those whose households made more. Among voters with household income above $100,000 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won rather easily.\n\nHistorically, this is beyond anomalous. Household income has been strongly correlated with party preference for generations with the higher income groups tending to be more Republican. \"Rich versus poor\" has been as common a narrative as North versus South, Protestant versus Catholic or urban versus rural.\n\nBut today we are confronted with an alliance between those whom political scientists might call plutocrats and those who are increasingly labeled populists. The contrast is stark, but the symbiosis is unmistakable. And we all await the outcome as the populist in Trump tries to co-exist with his newfound ally Musk, the world's richest man with abundant clout in the new administration.\n\nGoing back to even during colonial times, some writers used plutocrat to describe wealthy men who entered politics to protect their fortunes and those of their class. Where their influence prevailed, the result was sometimes called plutocracy, or the rule of the rich. (Today, it might be closer to rule by the richest.) It comes from the Roman god Pluto, lord of the underworld and the hidden wealth of the Earth, and as that derivation suggests, it has been an epithet associated not just with privilege but with unfair advantage and exploitation.\n\nFar more common and more eagerly embraced is the term populist, which has historically attached to advocates for ordinary farmers and wage earners. Populism has pressed the claims of the less powerful against those of the landowners, the financiers, the industrialists and other species of elite. In successive eras of cartoons and caricature, it has been the \"little guy\" against the \"fat cats.\"\n\nTrump has shown a certain affinity with, and owes a clear debt to, many of the little guys — what he called in 2017 \"the forgotten men and women.\" But he also has shown a certain affinity with and owes an enormous debt to some of the fattest cats of all. Musk alone has been reported to have directed $250 million to the Trump cause during the campaign. How will he and other ultra-wealthy business figures mesh with the Trump who made a show of working a shift at a McDonald's last fall?\n\nBig names from class struggles past\n\nPresidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, both scions of an old and prosperous Dutch dynasty in New York, enlarged their vision and political prospects by transcending allegiance to their economic caste. The former Roosevelt warned of \"malefactors of great wealth\" and the latter drove the moneyed classes to distraction with his Depression-era New Deal and his challenge to their hegemony. (\"I welcome their hatred,\" he proclaimed to the Democratic National Convention that renominated him in 1936.)\n\nNeither Roosevelt cared that much for the term populist, associated as it was in the early 1900s with smaller and primarily rural movements. The high point for those movements had come in 1896, when an orator named William Jennings Bryan gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention condemning the gold standard for setting the value of the currency. Bryan and like-minded figures wanted to use silver as well, making it easier for farmers and others to pay their debts to banks.\n\nThat \"Cross of Gold\" speech carried him to the Democratic nomination that year and again in 1900 and 1908. But he lost each time. Bryan had briefly been a congressman from Nebraska but was far better known as a newspaper editorialist and a spell-binding speaker who addressed numerous crowds from makeshift stages on railroad cars.\n\nTrump, too, entered politics from a background in the news and entertainment media of his era. And with his small town, egalitarian rallies and appeals to \"the forgotten man and woman,\" he has revived the term populism in the political lexicon and gone further with it than anyone since Bryan's heyday.\n\nWhen Trump won his first nomination in 2016, he was competing for crossover voters with a candidate on the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wowed big crowds by vowing to govern for \"all the people\" and \"not just the 1%.\" Sanders did well among working-class voters and in the most populous states but ultimately had fewer delegates at the 2016 national convention than Hillary Clinton. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump humbled a huge field of rivals on the Republican side that year, winning primaries and caucuses largely by energizing those who had not voted in recent election cycles. He was not another establishment-credentialed Republican and that was his secret weapon. When he won, his campaign strategist Steve Bannon compared it to Andrew Jackson's frontier-bred uprising in 1828. Trump went on to hang a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump in his first term\n\nBut if Trump's rapid rise as a Washington outsider recalled those of 19th century populists, Trump's actual performance as president was quite different. In fact it had more in common with the record of President William McKinley, the Ohio Republican who defeated Bryan in 1896 and again in 1900 while defending the gold standard and representing the interests of business and industry.\n\nTrump may recall Bryan's magnetic power over his followers, but his policies seem quite consciously modeled on McKinley. In his most recent campaign, Trump lavished explicit praise on the \"great\" William McKinley and his protective tariffs, which Trump insists dictated terms to U.S. trading partners and made America rich.\n\n Although long out of fashion with most economists and blamed for trade wars and depressions, tariffs have retained a strong fascination for Trump.\n\nMcKinley was quite popular with the Republican Party of his day, dominated as it was by the ultra-rich railroad, financial and manufacturing interests of the \"Gilded Age.\" So it was almost eerie when Trump in his second inaugural address decreed that Alaska's Mount Denali would again be officially Mount McKinley. The tallest peak in the U.S. had been Mount McKinley before President Obama changed the name to the one preferred by most Alaska native tribes. The timing of this latest switch is certainly notable given Trump wants to restore McKinley's reliance on protective tariffs on imports as a means to replace income taxes and help make America great again.\n\nMcKinley's time in office also included the Spanish-American War and the acquisition of colonial territories such as the Philippines and other islands. Trump referred to this idea in his second inaugural address as well, saying the U.S. \"will once again consider itself a growing nation,\" one that \"expands our territory.\" Trump has proposed such an expansion: adding Greenland and perhaps Canada – and part of Panama as well.\n\nTrump improvises his own populist narrative\n\nTrump had built his political following over a quarter century not as a champion of the economic elite from which he came – the son of a real estate mogul and product of private schools – but rather on familiarity to a media audience. He was a high-profile businessman and tabloid celebrity in Manhattan in the 1980s and 1990s. His first foray into presidential politics was made early in the 2000 cycle in what was called the Reform Party.\n\nIt was the creation of another businessman-candidate named Ross Perot, who ran two presidential campaigns in the 1990s. Perot was a billionaire when that term still inspired awe. But he campaigned as the independent voice of the common folk, stressing his plain Texan talk. He soared in the early polls in 1992, bringing out voters who made modest livings with less than a college degree and had felt unseen by most convention candidates for president.\n\nWhen Perot decided not to run a third time in 2000 he turned over his movement to a wide assortment of unconventional candidates competing for his mantle. They included pro wrestler and Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura and, for a while, Trump himself. But it was not yet Trump's time. He stepped back and conceded the field to Pat Buchanan, a former speechwriter for Richard Nixon who had become a media star on TV talk shows and then challenged the first President Bush for the GOP nomination in 1992. Buchanan's campaign motto in 2000 was \"America First.\"\n\nTrump became a media star in his own right with a primetime hit – the network TV \"reality show\" The Apprentice (and later The Celebrity Apprentice). Now known to a far wider audience, he used his fame and Twitter account to popularize a fringe theory about then-President Obama being foreign born and thus ineligible to be president. Even after Obama had released his official long-form birth certificate from Hawaii, Trump persisted in promoting the \"birther\" myth. He did not back off that claim until after he had become the official GOP nominee in the late summer of 2016, at which time he took credit for settling the controversy.\n\nBut Trump's willingness to champion this and other fringe theories connected him to a hardcore of voters such as those who told pollsters they believed Obama was a Muslim throughout his tenure as president. Trump first broke out from the GOP pack late in 2015 after calling for a \"complete ban\" on Muslims entering the U.S.\n\nThe governing philosophy\n\nOnce in office, having surprised most political prognosticators and perhaps even himself, Trump in his first term pursued a relatively familiar list of Republican priorities. His main legislative achievement came in his first year with the passage of an enormous tax cut that was popular among Republicans generally but that greatly benefited high-income earners and holders of wealth. Of at least equal importance was his appointment of more than 300 federal judges, including three members of the Supreme Court. Joining with three conservatives already in place, these three were able to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that established a right to abortion nationwide.\n\nAs Trump's second term unfolds, the issues most likely to be vigorously pursued may be those where the interests of his populist base can be braided with those who sat in billionaire's row on Inauguration Day. Here the renewal of the 2017 tax cuts is an area of commonality, as is the promise to shrink government. But conflicts could arise over other potent parts of the 2024 agenda. There was friction over H1-B work visas that Trump's core populists consider anathema but that his backers in the tech world depend on. It was a battle between the Bannon and Musk wings of Trump's movement.\n\nBut in a sense Trump needs both wings in order to accomplish not only the government changes he has proposed but the full measure of retribution he seems to want. Musk may have already made his main contribution with the super PAC that pumped a reported $250 million into the Republican effort in 2024. Or he may be a war chest unto himself as the next phases of political wars arrive.\n\nWe may only be at the beginning of an era in which certain political figures can serve what are plausibly called populist causes by calling on the resources of the ultra-rich.","summary":"Trump has shown an affinity with many of the little guys — what he called in 2017 \"the forgotten men and women.\" But he also has shown an affinity with some of the fattest cats of all.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/01/nx-s1-5280377/can-trumps-2nd-act-work-for-the-working-class-while-giving-back-to-his-super-donors","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7413x4170+0+387/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F11%2F73%2Fb3b7aa3c49189955bb90c46bb326%2Fgettyimages-2194362705.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 10:00:00","author":"Ron Elving","authors":["Ron Elving"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.187},{"id":286005214,"title":"Dealing with our Dickensian long-term care system","text":"“If they would rather die,” Charles Dickens’ most famous curmudgeon Ebenezer Scrooge asserts, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.” When it comes to long-term care, it seems as if our nation has adopted Scrooge’s pre-enlightenment perspective. Without the infamous “Medicaid spend-down” that elder care attorneys help orchestrate in order to qualify seniors for benefits beyond what Medicare offers, many families would face financial collapse or life-threatening failures of critical care.\n\nThe latest U.S. Census Bureau estimates indicate nearly 17 percent of Americans are senior citizens. That number is expected to reach 22 percent by midcentury. Maine already has nearly reached that 2050 number with seniors making up 21.5 percent of the its population. This in a state facing a scarcity of health care workers, alleviated only by importing contract labor from out of state at higher cost. And Maine, as anyone who has ever driven it knows, has great driving distances. Six percent of Maine’s population lives in what is known as an “ambulance desert,” where it can take more than 25 minutes for an ambulance to arrive.\n\nAn AARP poll last September revealed that 78 percent of women over 50 years of age who are caring for older members of their family are also struggling financially. It is up to families to largely fund this care unless they get some services covered by Medicaid or place family members in Medicaid-covered nursing facilities. More than 1.1 million senior citizens are currently in nursing homes. For some, it is the right choice; for many more, it is the only one. An orphan among developed nations, America is Scrooge-like for home care.\n\nDuring her presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris proposed a significant Medicare expansion for in-home aid for seniors. Harris’ plan, dubbed “Medicare at Home,” would have cost a minimum of $40 billion annually, according to a Brookings Institute study. That is just to start. Whether it might have achieved some cost offsets, such as less payouts to nursing homes, is anyone’s guess. And of course such a social safety net expansion died with the election. Nevertheless, some costs, such as for pharmaceuticals, might go down if Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has his way and Big Pharma doesn’t derail him.\n\nFor those who attempt to afford in-home care, the costs can become daunting quickly. Typical rates run $25 to $30 per hour; where I looked into this recently in Florida, it pushed $40. In-home costs can quickly top $5,000 per month and, in the case of round-the-clock care, multiples of this. Home care agencies typically take 50 percent of the fee, so it is hard work and long shifts with low pay for agency caregivers who often hail from other countries. It is around minimum wage or slightly above, yet for such small remuneration it requires skill, dedication and empathy. Caregiver well-being is also fragile.\n\nIf you’re looking for better long-term care that is affordable and built into a national social safety net, you might want to consider becoming an expat. You can find much better care in the European Union, led by Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany or in Great Britain and, closer to home, Canada. For Francophiles, the nation of Napoleon also has substantial services for senior citizens. French income tax rates are not far different from ours — the average rate is 5 percent higher in the U.S. — but health services are far more extensive there, from the cradle to the grave. It isn’t higher-tax-rate countries that excel.\n\nI have met many highly competent and caring people working in nursing homes. I have also encountered decent administrations of these facilities. On the other hand, the cruel fist of private equity takeovers of nursing homes — a plague first visited upon Manor Care by infamous private equity slumlord the Carlyle Group — has squeezed the institutions acquired. Some of these facilities I have seen closeup make me think again of Dickens: “Are there no poorhouses?” Our long-term care system often forces senior citizens into substandard care.\n\nIn America, we are likely to come into and depart the world in a health care establishment. This can save lives and improve outcomes. It can also kill the soul and condemn us to weakened family, community and connection. Most people I know would prefer to breathe their last breaths at home, yet we seem to go out of our way to make that unaffordable. If it is socialism to seek equity between care at home and health care institutions with their lobbying might, bring it on. You may paint the scarlet “S” all you like.\n\nPerhaps in this century we will begin to practice what we preach of equality and a brotherhood of man. Maybe the dark of self-interest will slowly fade. The same sun rises on the poor and middle-class that warms those rich in worldly goods.","summary":"“If they would rather die,” Charles Dickens’ most famous curmudgeon Ebenezer Scrooge asserts, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.” When it comes to long-term care, it seems as if our nation has adopted Scrooge’s pre-enlightenment perspective.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/opinion/columnists/dalton-delan-dealing-with-our-dickensian-long-term-care-system/article_dab10ecc-de73-11ef-87d7-cba72b440e38.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/bf/3bf23c3e-e003-11ef-bb85-77eb334f5dc5/679d1a0c2dd3a.image.jpg?crop=1765%2C927%2C0%2C123&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 10:00:00","author":"By Dalton Delan","authors":["By Dalton Delan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":286008534,"title":"Paramount may reportedly settle Trump’s $10 billion lawsuit against CBS so his administration doesn’t try to block its planned merger with Skydance","text":"Kamala Harris participated in an interview with “60 Minutes,” which was broadcast on CBS in October, while she was running for president.

Then, claiming that CBS had engaged in dishonest editing, her opponent Donald Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the network. “60 Minutes” and CBS said the allegations were untrue. That was prior to Trump’s election victory and subsequent return to the White House.\nThe New York Times reports that CBS’s parent company, Paramount, is currently negotiating a settlement with Trump. Three persons with knowledge of the talks told the newspaper that their officials are now having discussions.\n\nAccording to multiple people with knowledge of the matter, Paramount executives believe that settling would prevent the Trump administration from thwarting or postponing its intended multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance. According to the New York Times, two persons with knowledge of Shari Redstone’s views, the chair and controlling shareholder of Paramount, are in favor of a settlement.

Driving comes with unique challenges, particularly due to the reckless behaviour of certain motorists.\n\nTo my surprise, a male passenger, who was considerably older than I am, questioned my need to praise the female driver, stating, “She is just doing a basic job.”\n\nAt that moment, I engaged the male passenger and asked him to explain why he categorized her job as basic. His jarring response was, “What you’re saying isn’t a big deal; she is just a woman.”\n\nI realized that this individual clearly does not value the roles women play in our society, which regrettably suffers from misogyny and similar biases. Despite my efforts to help him appreciate the honour associated with this woman’s role, it was ultimately an exercise in futility.\n\nIt is evident that both locally and in other parts of the world, particularly in certain Middle Eastern countries and regions of Asia such as India and Pakistan, women’s roles in society have been consistently disregarded and devalued. There is a pervasive belief that women shouldn’t pursue various male-dominated professions, and this mindset needs to be challenged.\n\nIn contemporary times, some men staunchly believe that women should be confined to the role of “caretakers of the home”. While this may work for some families, particularly in affluent cultures where the man is the primary breadwinner, I believe women should be financially empowered and liberated. This empowerment will enable them to be seen as assets to the development of the home rather than liabilities.\n\nWhile there are instances of women excelling in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, which are often considered male-dominated, I would like to see more women enter these fields to strike a better balance in the gender equality ratio. The notion that women shouldn’t become engineers, mechanics, bus drivers, or pilots must be dispelled, as times are changing, and our perceptions need to reflect this reality.\n\nLet us consider why the United States of America, the land of the free, has never had a female president, only consecutive female vice presidents. Does this imply that the country believes women are not capable of holding the leadership role of president?\n\nOn November 9, 2016, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost to Republican Donald Trump, who was re-elected in 2024 and took the oath of office on January 20, 2025. Former Vice President and Attorney General of the California Department of Justice, Kamala Harris, vied for the presidential leadership against Trump last year. While many believed she might be the first African American to lead the country, this unfortunately did not materialize.\n\nMany political scholars might conclude that the Democratic Party’s policies contributed to their failure in the elections, highlighting inconsistencies in key issues such as border regulations and the proliferation of illegal immigration in the country.\n\nIn the electoral college, Trump secured 312 votes while Harris received 226. According to a database from the latest exit polls, 42% of the male population voted for Harris, while 55% voted for Trump.\n\nNotably 53 % of the female population voted for Harris while 45% voted for Trump.\n\nWhile this is just an 8% gap, evidently must continue to challenge these perceptions and advocate for the empowerment of women in all areas of society especially in the arena of politics.\n\nIn the case of Guyana the late Janet Rosenberg Jagan, O.E. briefly served as the first female president of the republic country from December 19, 1997, to August 11, 1999, under the People’s Progressive Party Civic (PPP/C).\n\nWhile I won’t delve into the reasons for Jagan’s brief term in office, it’s important to note that since then, Guyana has not had any other female President or Prime Minister.\n\nWhat does this indicate? While legal philomaths may argue that significant amendments to Guyana’s Westminster Constitution are necessary to allow for such provisions, there is still much work to be done in terms of inculcating in the psyche of males that women too can lead.\n\nIt will be remiss not to acknowledge University of Guyana’s Students Society’s current President Madam Tirishata Semple for her exemplary work. We all must throw our support behind her, especially our male counterparts, for the university to continue along a trajectory of success and prosperity.\n\nRoman Philosopher Seneca believed that we must support each other “because we are all connected and have a social duty to help others”.\n\nIt is time for us to support more women in leadership and encourage them to pursue male-dominant careers, instead of being intimidated by their capabilities.\n\nWhy feel intimidated when you can do better and encourage other women to succeed as well?\n\nAntonio Dey\n\nFinal Year Student\n\nUniversity of Guyana\n\n and Mathematics, engineering, Middle Eastern countries, motorists, Science, society, technology, Women","summary":"Dear Editor, I would like to draw attention to the perception and treatment of women in our society.

When I asked him how that could be true when half the country had voted against the party touting DEI programmes, his answer epitomised the Democrats’ post-election confusion.\n\n“It’s not my understanding, based on anything that I’ve seen, that support for diversity, equity and inclusion had anything to do with the results in November,” he began, blaming the “high cost of living” and the “[failure] of working together to secure the border”. “Diversity, equity and inclusion are American values,” he reiterated. “Perhaps I can explain. The motto of the United States of America is E pluribus unum – out of many, one. That’s diversity. The 14th amendment to the United States constitution, one of the most important amendments in our country, provides equal protection under the law. That’s equity. In this country, we pledge allegiance to the flag… in that pledge, we promise one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all – A-L-L – that’s inclusion. Not complicated.” And with that, he ended the press conference.\n\nIf only it were that simple. Jeffries’ sleight of hand was to talk about DEI as if these programmes represented timeless American values that all flag-wavers would extol. But diversity, equity and inclusion, the concepts, are different to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, the practice. Republicans have long railed against DEI initiatives as a form of discrimination which, in turn, corrupts meritocracy. Consider the US defence department’s Board on Diversity and Inclusion 2020 recommendation for the removal of “aptitude test barriers that adversely impact diversity”. These programmes and the infrastructure around them, such as federal diversity officers, pursue diversity as an end in itself.\n\nThe debate around DEI long ago floated free of a brief consensus and entered the gale of the cultural wars. It took President Trump only twelve hours to blame America’s most fatal plane incident in two decades on diversity programmes in the Federal Aviation Authority. (“I have common sense,” the President said, in lieu of supporting evidence.) The collision of a passenger plane and military helicopter over Washington’s Potomac River, and the death of 67 people, was a moment for Trump to unify the nation. He turned the disaster into a crass fable instead – a reminder that “anti-woke” politics can be more superficial than that which it sets out to oppose.\n\nBut Trump’s allusion to these programmes is a reflection of how useful they’ve been to the political right. If diversity trumps competence, then the risk for the Democrats is that an unquestioning belief in DEI indicates to voters that the party cares more about the appearance of progressivism than it does about issues such as wage growth, or labour protections, or confronting China. As the Democrats advance through the seven stages of political grief, they should examine their relationship with these “American values” – and ask why America rejected them so soundly last autumn.\n\nThe sociologist Musa al-Gharbi has argued that the language of DEI emerged as a way for elites to signal to other elites that they are worthy of professional managerial jobs, and therefore that those who don’t support DEI are not. In the economic precarity that marked the 2010s, DEI became a vehicle for elite competition over status and well-paid positions. He notes, for instance, that in 2018 one of Yale’s admissions directors said they expect incoming students “to be versed in issues of social justice”. The woke movement behind DEI which reached its peak in 2020 is relevant to the elites and few else. It has, al-Ghabir contends, no genuine connection with the civil rights movements it claims to champion. Hence Jeffries’ confidence that DEI is self-evident ignores that many voters find such ideas unintuitive.\n\nAsked after the election what they believed the Democrats’ top priority was, voters said the party cared most about abortion followed by “LGBT/trans[gender] policy”. Put that to Democratic staffers and they will say “but we campaigned on the economy!” Sure, but voters thought it was a front. To pretend everyone sees DEI as the embodiment of American values is denialism. At the very least, it is a curious strategy with which to reclaim power from a position of defeat.\n\nJeffries’ answer illustrates the messy way in which the Democrats are trying to understand what happened in November. Theories abound, but all are incomplete. Most can admit that the surge in illegal migration under Joe Biden was fatal. A crop of Democratic lawmakers, including freshmen like Senator Ruben Gallego, are fretting over the distance between the party and voters on immigration. Gallego has said there is a “misunderstanding about where Latinos are when it comes to border and border security”. But the message rarely goes beyond a vague promise to work with Republicans on border security. Few articulate an argument from the left about why illegal immigration should stop. If the Democrats don’t define why they want to close the border – is it the rule of law? A desire to protect American wages? Perhaps to foreclose the slavish conditions some illegal migrants must work in? – they will seem insincere.\n\nOthers, at least in private, recognise that the woke agenda, exemplified by the DEI programmes Donald Trump has cancelled, weighed them down. A consensus is building that Trump’s widespread election ad – “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for YOU” – made inroads with voters. Pronouns are surreptitiously dropping out of politicians’ bios, most notably those of congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But the vigour with which Jeffries defended DEI on principle suggests dissenters are still unwelcome.\n\nWhat about the economy – surely that mattered more than the third-person singular? This is the easiest explanation for Democrats, and so it is the most prevalent. All agree that the “economy”, by which most mean inflation, cost them the election. It’s true that the cost of living was voters’ primary concern. But that idea rarely builds into a comprehensive call for the party to expose Trump’s hollow economic populism and take on the discarded working-class mantle as Trump did in 2016. Or when Democrats do – Bernie Sanders attacked the party for abandoning the working class in favour of wealthy donors as Kamala Harris was on stage giving her concession speech – immigration and woke excess are absent from the analysis.\n\nThe diagnosis, therefore, is confused and fragmented. Without accounting for the unpopularity of DEI, disparate lines on the economy and immigration will not lead to a united message. You could go further: getting stuck defending DEI distracts from crafting a narrative that could win back wavering working-class voters. As the historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote in an essay arguing for the left to forget identity politics and return to universalism, “winning majorities is not the same as adding up minorities”.\n\nOne reason for the Democrats’ inertia on this issue is that no one has taken responsibility for the loss. Individual senators and representatives can claim they won their own races. Harris’s team blames Biden for not dropping out sooner. Biden insists he could’ve won if Nancy Pelosi and others hadn’t replaced him. Pelosi thinks the Democrats aren’t to blame for the defeat, at all. Well, if not them, then who?\n\nAt Harris’s final campaign rally at the Ellipse in Washington DC I walked around asking attendees why they thought people voted for Trump. Racism, invariably, was their answer. And this is part of how such thinking among American liberals has become a totalising explanation for the Democrats’ unpopularity. The election hasn’t changed that. Every single candidate for chair of the Democratic National Committee, who will set the strategy for next year’s mid-terms when the Democrats hope to reclaim the House of Representatives, raised their hand when asked at a hustings on 30 January whether racism and misogyny explained Harris’s election loss. “That’s good, you all passed!” the moderator Jonathan Capehart said. One frontrunner, Ben Wikler, the chair of Wisconsin’s Democratic Party, recently posted on X that as chair he would “lift up our full coalition—with Black, Latino, Native, AANHPI, LGBTQ, Youth, Interfaith, Ethnic, Rural, Veteran, and Disability representation”. As if a want of identity politics was what hobbled the Democrats over the past decade.\n\nDEI is not a straightforward gift to the right though. Missteps like Trump’s over the air disaster create opportunities for the Democrats. Much of their opposition to Trump over the past eight years has taken extra-political forms: they pursued him through litigation, special prosecutors and congressional committees. But that tactic proved fruitless and treated voters as spectators of politics, not participants. The only option left is to try to sway those who voted for Trump, critiquing his own lazy thinking when it matters – as at moments of national tragedy. His recent executive orders, which disrupted access to Medicaid and allowed officials to receive gifts from lobbyists, show how exposed he is to a populist attack which links these policies to ordinary people’s livelihoods. Ditto his decision to stack his government with oligarchs.\n\nBut any attack will remain limp unless the Democrats rebuild their credibility on immigration and reckon with progressive excess. The outgoing Democratic National Committee chief Jamie Harrison told CBS News yesterday (31 January) that he still believes Kamala Harris could win in 2028. “If I didn’t believe [she] could win, I wouldn’t have worked as hard as I did to help her win this last time around,” he said. Some Democrats are responding to Trump’s radical start to office by gripping on to disproven theories, such as that Harris makes a good presidential candidate. This is a mistake, reminiscent of the illusion in 2017 that Trump’s election could be explained away by foreign interference. Both are grounded in the anti-democratic instinct to disbelieve what elections show the electorate wants. Blaming voters for not hearing you rather than listening to what they say in the manner of Hakeem Jeffries is a well-trodden route to defeat. The Democrats will not win again until they understand why they lost.","summary":"Why has Diversity, Equity and Inclusion become Donald Trump’s favourite political weapon?","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/americas/north-america/us/2025/02/dei-democrats-opposition-blame","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/01/30/GettyImages-2194869482.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 06:00:00","author":"Freddie Hayward","authors":["Freddie Hayward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":285909820,"title":"CBS will provide ’60 Minutes’ Harris interview transcripts to FCC","text":"CBS says it will turn over an unedited transcript of its October interview with Kamala Harris to the Federal Communications Commission, part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing fight with the network over how it handled a story about his opponent.\n\nTrump sued CBS for $10 million over the “60 Minutes” interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good.

Mr Rocheleau is an Air Force veteran with 20 years’ experience at the FAA.\n\nHis predecessor, Michael Whitaker, who was unanimously confirmed as FAA administrator by the Senate in October 2023, resigned on the day of Mr Trump’s inauguration.\n\nMr Whitaker had announced his intention to resign after Mr Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris.\n\n“As I conclude my time at the FAA, my confidence in you to meet our safety mission has never been stronger,” Mr Whitaker wrote in an email to staff in December.\n\nPrior to the election, Mr Musk had called for him to quit.\n\n“He should resign,” the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive, and key Trump adviser, wrote on X in September.\n\nMr Musk had taken issue with the FAA under Mr Whitaker, alleging the safety regulator was slowing down his rocket launches with paperwork — and threatening SpaceX with fines of up to $600,000.\n\nMeanwhile a transgender soldier has said she is “alive and well” after false rumours spread online that she was the pilot of the military helicopter that collided with a passenger jet killing 67 people in Washington DC. \n\nJo Ellis, a Black Hawk pilot with the Virginia National Guard, posted a video online on Friday morning, US time, saying it was “insulting to the families to tie this to a political agenda”.\n\nThe soldier’s response follow comments on Thursday when US President Donald Trump tried to tie diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to the tragedy in Washington DC. \n\nCritics of DEI claim it places race, gender or disability, for instance, above merit for jobs. While DEI proponents have said it encourages unrepresented groups to apply for roles and recognises discrimination exists.\n\nMr Trump claimed that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had a “diversity push” that “focused on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities,” including for air traffic control roles.\n\nWhen Mr Trump was challenged by reporters as to why he was focusing on diversity, when there was no information to suggest that was the cause of the crash, he replied: “It could have been, we don’t know, but it shouldn’t have happened”.\n\nAsked to why he was blaming diversity, he added “I have common sense, OK, and unfortunately a lot of people don’t”.\n\nThe leading theories behind the crash are that the Black Hawk helicopter was flying too high and that the single air traffic controller on duty at the time was overworked. \n\nTrans pilot rumours\n\nSoon after, Ms Ellis’ picture and name began to be circulated online with scuttlebutt that a trans woman was at the helm of the Black Hawk helicopter. \n\nMs Ellis is a chief warrant officer and Black Hawk helicopter pilot who has served in the Virginia National Guard for 15 years.\n\nShe has also served in Iraq, reported Newsweek.\n\nOn social media, including Elon Musk’s X, there were suggestions she may have deliberately doomed the aircraft in anger at the Trump administration’s anti-trans policies. \n\nThe President seems likely to follow through on a plan to ban transgender people from the military. \n\nA trans pilot being blamed for the disaster would have fit neatly into Mr Trump’s claims that DEI may have been a cause behind it.\n\n‘Insulting’\n\nHowever, on Friday, a solemn looking Ms Ellis, 34, took to social media to show she was still well. \n\n“I understand some people have associated me with a crash in DC, and that is false,” she said. \n\n“It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some sort of political agenda. They don’t deserve that. I don’t deserve this. \n\n“And I hope that you all know that I am alive and well, and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumours.”\n\nTalking additionally to the Daily Mail, Ms Ellis said she was “shocked” by the online slander. \n\nThree people were on board the helicopter, two men and one woman. Chief warrant officers Andrew Eaves and Ryan O’Hara, both from Georgia, have been identified. The female co-pilot has not.\n\nFemale pilot’s name withheld\n\nThe Army has drawn scrutiny for refusing to release the name of the third crew member.\n\nOfficials have told US media outlets only that she was a female pilot who had 500 hours of flying experience.\n\nThe Army is withholding the pilot’s name at the request of her family, NPR reported.\n\n“The withholding of a name in instances like this is a highly unusual move,” the public broadcaster noted. “The identity of the third crew member has already drawn intense scrutiny online.”\n\nDemocrat Senator Tammy Duckworth, a former Black Hawk pilot, told NPR she understood the family’s decision.\n\n“We should be respecting the family’s wishes at a time when they have suffered an unbelievable loss,” she said. “I think it is a perfectly legitimate request the family would make. And I’m glad that the Army is honouring that request.”\n\nConservative commentator Matt Walsh said it was “totally unacceptable”.\n\n“The helicopter was involved in, and may have actually caused, one of the worst airline disasters in American history,” he wrote on X. “We have a right to know the names.”\n\n‘Disgusting’\n\nMr Trump had admitted the cause of the crash remains “unknown” but nonetheless signed a memorandum hours after his press briefing directing the FAA to examine all hirings in the last four years to see if standards had been compromised, a key claim of diversity critics. \n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, one of the most senior Democrats in the US, has slammed Mr Trump.\n\nHe said the President’s comments were “shameful”.\n\n“It’s a very irresponsible statement that was made by the President,” Mr Jeffries said during a press conference in Brooklyn, New York. \n\n“Bodies are still being pulled from the Potomac, children were killed, and future ice skating Olympians were killed, future leaders in Wichita, Kansas, and beyond were killed as a result of this tragedy.\n\n“We don’t need misdirection and we don’t need misinformation coming from the highest office in the land. We need integrity, we need decency, we need leadership,” Mr Jeffries said. “There is not a scintilla of evidence that exists to suggest that women and people of colour are to blame for the tragedy that took place”.\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy blasted Mr Trump’s comments about the FAA as “plain disgusting”.\n\n“Nobody’s going to know today what caused that crash,” he said in a video posted to X.\n\n“But what we absolutely know is that it is not women working at the FAA that caused that crash.

Smith has addressed the calls for him to run for President of the United States of America in 2028. \n\nA recent poll revealed that the ESPN personality would receive more support than several big-name Democrat presidential hopefuls in the nation's next presidential election. \n\nThe sports analyst has not shied away from delivering bold political takes in the aftermath of Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris in the polls last November. \n\nHis hot takes, which have gone viral, have generated a lot of support for potential presidential bid from Smith. \n\nAnd, while the 57-year-old played down the idea, he didn't completely rule out entering the race for the White House. \n\n'I doubt I'll ever run. It's not me,' Smith confessed on his eponymous YouTube show Friday. 'I live a pretty good life and I don't want to ruin it by getting involved in politics.' \n\nStephen A. Smith has addressed the calls for him to run for President of the USA in 2028\n\nSmith recently shocked TV viewers with his comments about why Trump won the election\n\nHowever, he went on to reveal that the abysmal showing from the Democrats at the ballot box last year could be enough to convince him to delve into the world of politics. \n\n'But I've got to tell y'all something, the Democratic Party looks so pathetic after this election, I might entertain running,' he continued. 'I just might change my mind one day. I doubt it, but I might. Cause how much would it take to beat y'all? \n\n'Trump can't run again. He's done, regardless of what some representatives want.'\n\nSmith then launched into a scathing attack on Trump's actions over the course of his first week back in the Oval Office, in particular calling out the President's handling of the FAA and the American Airlines flight that tragically crashed with a Black Hawk helicopter above Washington DC Wednesday night \n\n'I'm sick and tired of everybody acting like I'm some right-winger,' Smith added. 'I have conservative views, I have liberal views. Trust me, I have plenty of liberal views. but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna call it as I see it. I've been doing that for my entire career and dammit I'm not stopping. \n\n'Ladies and gentleman, I'm in the best health I've been in in 25 years. If you thought I wasn't going away before, you have no idea how the hell I'm not going away now. I'm just getting started. \n\n'President Trump, I don't like what I'm seeing in some cases. Democrats, pounce on him. If you don't, I'll find someone who will. Or I'll do it my damn self.'\n\nSmith's claims come after John McLaughlin - who was Trump's chief pollster - held a national survey of 1,000 general election voters.\n\nJohn McLaughlin - Trump's chief pollster - surveyed 1,000 people, several of whom had a positive response to the possibility of Smith running for president in 2028 \n\nSmith recently admitted to feeling like a 'damn fool' for supporting Kamala Harris and Tim Walz \n\nAmong the questions he asked was: 'Thinking ahead to the 2028 Democratic primary election for President, if that election were held today among the following candidates, for whom would you vote?'\n\nTwo percent said they would choose ESPN star Smith. That is more than the likes of Beto O'Rourke - who ran for the nomination in 2020 - and JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois (both one percent).\n\nRemarkably, Smith polled only one percentage point behind Tim Walz - Harris' vice-presidential pick - and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nHarris was overwhelmingly the No 1 choice, with a third of voters (33 percent) saying they would vote for the former vice president - despite her defeat by Trump in November.\n\nStephen A Smith floats theory about Justin Tucker massage misconduct allegations\n\n'First Take' host Smith, who made his name in sports media but has become increasingly vocal on political issues, shocked Bill Maher's audience with his blunt verdict on why Donald Trump won a second term in the White House - and why he feels like a 'damn fool' for supporting Kamala Harris.\n\nHowever, in response to Smith's shock endorsements, Jason Whitlock launched a blistering 45-minute attack on the ESPN host. \n\nWhitlock accused Smith of being a 'plant', citing the 'Building 7' 9/11 conspiracy theory and making the baseless claim that Disney, the NBA and 'the powerful elite' are conspiring to 'install their puppet' the Oval Office as part of a 'well-orchestrated... dangerous' plan.\n\nWhitlock claimed the system has been 'rigged' and warned 'naive' voters that there is a real possibility Smith - who he called a 'clown' a 'fraud' and an 'idiot' - could reach the nation's highest office. \n\nDonald TrumpDemocratsKamala Harris\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nStephen A.

For many of them, it’d be their first taste of what we do. I was surprised, it’s not something I had expected,” Li said.\nWhen the show was first staged in 2019, young viewers – from teenagers to those in their mid-30s – would ask for photos with him with their tickets, he recalled, and would enthusiastically clap and cheer “like crazy” during the performances.\n“At first, our veteran opera singers were flabbergasted. The audience used to be so quiet you could hear a pin drop,” he said. “But it’s no longer like that, the interactions now are very lively.”\nThe composition stands out within the repertoire of the classical art form on many levels, not least because it centres around an incumbent American president and is performed in modern-day costumes.\nThis contrasts with performances more conventionally focused on traditional Chinese folklore or historical figures dressed in stylised period costumes and which have garnered a loyal following among now older audiences.\n“Some of the young viewers had a renewed understanding of Cantonese opera after Trump on Show, and came back for some of our other productions,” he said.\nAfter its first performance in 2019, the show was restaged in 2021 and will run again for a third time between February 1 and 3, with tickets already sold out.\nLi categorised Trump on Show as “current affairs-infused Cantonese opera”, charting a new path for the art form in which he would update the narrative according to the latest news events to stay up-to-date.\nFor example, for the version of the show to be performed in February, characters such as Trump’s election rival Kamala Harris have been added, and the failed assassination attempt against him in July 2024 is a pivotal new scene, according to Li.\nIn another coming production in June this year at the West Kowloon Cultural District’s Xiqu Centre, Harris will no longer feature “because by then the election would be very old news”, but Elon Musk will be introduced to the plot.\nThe closure of the Sunbeam Theatre became imminent after Christian church Island ECC acquired several floors in Kiu Fai Mansion at 413-423 King’s Road in North Point, which houses the venue, for HK$750 million (US$95.8 million) in February last year.\n\nBut Li said the opera would continue to thrive beyond the theatre’s demise, and after the midyear performance at Xiqu Centre.\n“After the June performance, we are aiming to take Trump on Show on tour around the world. The first stops would be Macau and Southeast Asia,” he said.\n“The shutting of Sunbeam has given us the opportunity and time to bring this overseas.”\nLi, who took the helm of Sunbeam in 2012, said the closing of the venue would relieve him of the pressure of keeping it afloat.\n“It’s a new and exciting endeavour,” he said of taking Trump on Show on tour. “If successful, we will be elevating Hong Kong Cantonese opera productions to a new level.”\nLi said the theatre had not managed to reach a consensus with the new landlord to continue despite considering rescheduling options such as performing only on weekdays while the church used the space on weekends.\n“There is a vast chasm in our negotiations,” he said, adding that it would be a shame if the church fulfilled its plan to take down the professional sound system built for theatrical performances and installed a new one.\nLi said it would be difficult to stage Cantonese opera performances if the theatre – usually darker and with a pit for musicians – was turned into an ordinary hall with brighter lighting for religious worship.\nNonetheless, Li believed there was “no need to cry” over the theatre – the only commercial stage dedicated to Cantonese opera – finally closing for good.\n“We should be grateful for the contributions it has made to Hong Kong’s cultural landscape and congratulate it for completing its historical mission,” he said.\nThe days leading up to the closure would be the theatre’s most glorious, Li added.\n“Our closing told me about the special place Sunbeam holds in many fans’ hearts,” he said, adding that its open day on January 20 was packed with 600 people, without needing much promotion.\nAsked if any particular aspect or event meant most to him during his decade-long leadership of the theatre, Li said: “What I focus on now is not the past, but the present and the future.”\n\nThe composer was especially enthusiastic about future opportunities for staging Trump on Show beyond the shores of the city.\n“It would be so interesting if the show could make it out of Hong Kong to France, the UK and the US,” he said. “These would no doubt surpass any past events at Sunbeam for me.”","summary":"Sunbeam Theatre in North Point to revive popular show as swansong ahead of March closure.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3296986/trump-show-hit-opera-young-hongkongers-rerun-eye-global-stage","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/31/35f20310-822a-452f-8ad5-ef9d3471656f_e7630289.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-01 01:00:17","author":"Ambrose Li","authors":["Ambrose Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.273},{"id":285893756,"title":"CBS agrees to hand over '60 Minutes' Harris interview transcripts to FCC","text":"CBS says it will turn over an unedited transcript of its October interview with Kamala Harris to the Federal Communications Commission, part of President Donald Trump's ongoing fight with the network over how it handled a story about his opponent.\n\nTrump sued CBS for $10 million over the “60 Minutes” interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good. Published reports said that CBS' parent company, Paramount, has been talking to Trump's lawyers about a settlement.\n\nThe network said Friday that it was compelled by Brendan Carr, Trump's appointee as FCC chairman, to turn over the transcripts and camera feeds of the interview for a parallel investigation by the commission. “60 Minutes” has resisted releasing transcripts for this and all of its interviews, to avoid second-guessing of its editing process.\n\nThe case, particularly a potential settlement, is being closely watched by advocates for press freedom and by journalists within CBS, whose lawyers called Trump's lawsuit “completely without merit” and promised to vigorously fight it after it was filed.\n\nThe Harris interview initially drew attention because CBS News showed Harris giving completely different responses to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker in clips that were aired on “Face the Nation” on Oct. 6 and the next night on “60 Minutes.” The network said each clip came from a lengthy response by Harris to Whitaker's question, but they were edited to fit time constraints on both broadcasts.\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in Texas on Nov. 1, Trump charged it was deceptive editing designed to benefit Harris and constituted “partisan and unlawful acts of voter interference.”\n\nTrump, who turned down a request to be interviewed by “60 Minutes” during the campaign, has continued his fight despite winning the election less than a week after the lawsuit was filed.\n\nThe network has not commented on talks about a potential settlement, reported by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Paramount executives are seeking Trump administration approval of a sale of the company to another entertainment firm, Skydance.\n\nABC News in December settled a defamation lawsuit by Trump over statements made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, agreeing to pay $15 million toward Trump's presidential library rather than engage in a public fight.

Trump has called it “unfair” and a “rip off”.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Samoa’s prime minister Fiame Naomi Mataʻafa described Trump’s move to pull out of the Paris agreement as “very disappointing,” saying it would undermine global climate action and put the survival of Pacific countries at greater risk.\n\n“We look to the US as a global leader, but they seem to not recognise this global issue, not only for Samoa but for the Pacific,” Fiame said.\n\n“It’s not surprising … nevertheless, it is very disappointing,” the prime minister said.\n\nA freeze on US foreign aid has deepened concerns that the Pacific region will suffer further as crucial assistance for climate adaptation, disaster management, extreme weather resilience is cut, or under threat. In addition, Fiame told the Guardian Pacific countries would be “seriously impacted” by the withdrawal from the World Health Organisation and other multilateral bodies.\n\n“These are the forums that small countries rely on; they are critical to our voices being heard and our causes being addressed,” she said.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, Washington increased its engagement with Pacific island nations, emphasising climate change as a central concern. In 2022, then-vice president Kamala Harris announced a substantial aid boost, pledging to triple US assistance to the region to $600m.\n\nDespite their minimal contribution, Pacific nations face severe and disproportionate climate impacts including rising sea levels, coastal erosion, loss of freshwater sources, and potential displacement. Additionally, extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, floods, and droughts continue to devastate infrastructure, homes, and economies across the region.\n\nThe Paris agreement is the first legally binding climate treaty to explicitly recognise loss and damage as a separate pillar of climate action, distinct from mitigation and adaptation. This marked a significant victory for Pacific island countries, which had long pushed for its recognition in global climate negotiations.\n\nPapua New Guinea’s prime minister, James Marape, told PNG media that the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement was “morally wrong.”\n\n“The United States has recently revitalised its relations with the Pacific, and it is very discouraging to see it backing down from climate talks, which have a direct impact on climate change mitigation for us in the Pacific,” Marape said.\n\n“We continue to be subjected to rising sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns that impact lives and economies.”\n\nFrom fiscal years 2017 through 2023, US agencies provided more than $420.3m to address climate risks in 14 Pacific Island countries and three US territories in the Pacific, according to the US government accountability office. US-funded projects include climate resilience initiatives and livelihood protection in Papua New Guinea’s rural highland communities, and the development of early warning systems for remote communities in Fiji.\n\nSamoa-based Sefanaia Nawadra is director-general of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), an organisation that works with Pacific governments on environmental protection. He described the US climate policy shifts as “disheartening” and said the Pacific must now “work harder and smarter, together and with all available partners to meet the needs of our people.”\n\n“Climate change represents the single greatest threat to our region,” he said.\n\nHowever, SPREP notes that other partners may step in to fill funding gaps left by the US. Pacific nations receive climate funding and support from a range of other governments – including Australia, the UK, China and Japan – and also access financial support from multilateral organisations.\n\nNawadra said Pacific countries “will continue to seek and receive support from existing partnerships” to address their adaptation and mitigation needs.\n\nPacific climate campaigner Jacynta Faʻamau of 350.org said the climate crisis was “the greatest security threat to the Pacific,” while emphasising the region’s resilience.\n\n“Island nations are committing to scaling up their own renewable energy plans and doing their part to secure our futures.\n\n“The government of the US and the rest of the global north have a lot to answer for in terms of historical responsibility for the climate crisis, but they are no longer who we are looking to for leadership,” she said.","summary":"Samoa’s prime minister says US withdrawal from Paris climate agreement is ‘very disappointing’ and puts the survival of Pacific countries at greater risk\n\nLeaders and environmental advocates in the Pacific have expressed alarm over Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and freeze foreign aid, warning the moves will accelerate the existential threats they face as nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis.\n\nThe Paris agreement is the world’s main effort to address the impacts of the climate crisis.

Mediaite founder Dan Abrams was interviewed for the Mediaite podcast and proclaimed that journalists should occasionally say something positive about Trump or give him credit for something. Perish the thought!\n\n“I do think there is a level of Trump Derangement Syndrome among some that they are completely incapable of giving him credit for anything,” Abrams said. “And you want to restore credibility? Try and call balls and strikes. Give him credit when it’s warranted, recognize successes. I think that allows you then the freedom to criticize as well.” \n\nOn the other side of that debate is ex-CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy. He was a logical guest for “On the Media,” a weekly radio show out of NPR affiliate WNYC in New York. In 2023, their host Brooke Gladstone warmly touted “The Communist Manifesto” as a “stalwart text” while that station draws millions of dollars each year from American taxpayers.\n\nWhen the Republicans in Washington consider defunding public broadcasting, they should always consider this: Government-funded NPR and PBS actively lobby their colleagues to trash Republicans relentlessly and agitate the media bosses against any backsliding into moderation, like refusing to endorse Kamala Harris for president.\n\nDarcy complained CNN’s Inauguration Day coverage was intolerably soft: “None of the CNN anchors pointed out that Donald Trump is the first convicted felon to take that office. They didn’t point out that he was twice impeached. You had a lot of right-wing extremists and a lot of right-wing conspiracy theorists stuffed in the Rotunda,” and it wasn’t “called out.”\n\nThis was compared to Jake Tapper speechifying after Trump’s defeat in 2020: “It must be said, to paraphrase President Ford, for tens of millions of our fellow Americans, their long national nightmare is over.”\n\nWNYC host Micah Loewinger added: “You argue that Jake Tapper’s limp coverage embodies a larger trend that we’re seeing in the news media, which is retreating from aggressive coverage of Donald Trump. You likened the phenomenon to ‘Invasion of the Body Snatchers,’ the 1956 horror film.”\n\nIn that movie, space aliens were the “pod people” who replaced humans with emotionless duplicates. This implied Darcy was missing the free-flowing Trump hatred that spews “convicted felon” and “twice-impeached” and “Jan. 6” in every other sentence.\n\nDarcy mourned CNN was no longer run by Jeff Zucker, who “really encouraged anchors to be relentless, to be vocal about the lies that Donald Trump was pushing.” The new boss, Mark Thompson, told anchors in a meeting “the network should be open-minded about Trump and showing a little deference.”\n\nLoewinger asked if he actually said “deference.” Darcy was gilding the lily.\n\nBut in Darcy’s brain space, it’s the “reality-dwelling public” that relies on the New York Times and the “MAGA base” that finds the Times to be insufferably leftist. The guardians of “reality” are the wokest ones crusading inside these newspapers and TV and radio networks to employ the most inflammatory (and self-congratulatory) language about resisting Trump as a fascist threat to democracy.\n\nThey don’t care about polls showing declining trust in media. They end up advocating a surefire path to bankruptcy for media businesses, admiring themselves like Jim Acosta in every inflammatory passage.","summary":"TDS sufferers advocate a surefire path to bankruptcy for their outlets","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/will-trump-derangement-keep-damaging-trust-in-media/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/media-news-reporters-fake-abc-cbs-nbc-cnn-msnbc-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:21:37","author":"Tim Graham","authors":["Tim Graham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":285954768,"title":"Who Can Stop Elon’s ‘Team’ Wilding Its Way Through the Federal Government?","text":"Over the course of the last two weeks, I’ve tried to drive home the point that the Democrats in Congress mostly can’t do anything to stop what the Trump administration is doing. That’s not a matter of weakness or bad strategy. Voters decided in November to put all federal power in the hands of Republicans. That’s done. It already happened. Many of the cries for Democrats to “do something” amount to thinking that if Democrats get energized and forceful enough they can undo the consequences of that election, as though there’s some “off” lever that if you reach really high you can grab ahold of and make all of this stop. You might as well demand Kamala Harris show some gumption and start issuing her own executive orders.\n\nThis emphatically does not mean Democrats are doing all they can or that there’s nothing they can do. But it is critical at every level to understand what the menu of actions includes. As much as this might seem pedantic, it’s critical to think very clearly about what an opposition does and what its tools are. Otherwise you’re just getting riled up demanding your fighters run at full speed, head first into the castle wall.\n\nFundamentally this is a battle over public opinion. And there are three areas of action to engage that battle.\n\nFirst, Democrats’ job is to make the case every day what a disaster Trump governance is and ask voters whether they’ve decided yet that they’d like to make a change. In a way any opposition must almost exalt it’s powerlessness. We’d love to stop these horrible things for you, voters. But you have to put us in power to do it. Second, there is the critical but highly compromised avenue of court action. It was blue states that brought the lawsuit which just put the budget freeze under a restraining order. Third, there’s the very limited but crucial moments when Democrats, even in the minority, can force the majority to come to them or simply delay or even stymie action. The debt ceiling, as I’ve been saying, is a key one of those moments.\n\nThis post is mainly about the point I am about to get to below. But for now, “making the case,” Item #1, really can’t be about press releases or even traditional press conferences. I’ve been watching press releases come in this evening. Those are meaningless. That’s simply not how people communicate today. It involves stunts; it involves making news happen in ways that require knowing how reporters decide what’s a story. Dogs biting men; men biting dogs; dogs and men teaming up to bite someone else. You’ve got to think how media works. It certainly involves actual politicians getting on social media and making cases in their own voices. It requires a lot more creativity than we are currently seeing. But we’ll get to that in subsequent posts.\n\nIn this post I want to focus on what is mostly a legal avenue. We still know much less than we should about who’s actually running this show. There’s mounting evidence that even more than we know is being directed by Elon Musk and his private-sector employees, who are now fanned out across the government. He appears to have taken control of the federal payment system which allows his operatives to stop checks to any private individual in the country and/or examine all their personal financial information. According to The New York Times, Musk has tasked engineers with figuring out how to cut off the flow of funds from the Treasury to programs and priorities he believes conflict with the brief he received from Donald Trump. He has also taken control of some portion of the federal agency computer systems, allowing his operatives to lock federal workers out of key computer systems. We need a lot more reporting on just how he is exerting this power, specifically under what authority and who the people are he’s installed at these government agencies. Some have simply been appointed to new roles the old-fashioned way. But the best information we have about how “DOGE” is working suggests many are employees from his private companies operating with no legal authority at all.\n\nThere’s a pretty developed law that you can’t do stuff in the federal government if you’re not an employee of the federal government, or a contractor who is placed under the rules of the federal government. If you do do those things you become a de facto government employee and the law says you come under all sorts of record-keeping and disclosure requirements. Those requirements turn out to be quite important and consequential. \n\nNow to be clear, I don’t expect a federal judge to start smacking Elon Musk around and I don’t expect a sad sack Musk to glumly apologize to the judge and go along his way back to Texas. But in a situation like this, when laws are being broken at such high velocity you’re looking more than anything else to get into court with a live argument. And this is a very live argument. As I noted above, this is fundamentally a battle over public opinion. But critical to a battle over public opinion in an onslaught such as this is slowing things down as much as possible, throwing as much sand in the gears as possible. That stretches out the amount of time people have to get an understanding of what’s happening. It increases their visibility into what’s happening. It also focuses attention, rightly, on Elon Musk who is much more unpopular than Donald Trump.\n\nGetting into court — getting into court on a lot of fronts — is one of the ways you do that. Public opinion only comes into play in a hard fashion at the next election. But as public opinion shifts, if it does, it starts impacting anyone planning on facing voters in the next election. The courts are fundamentally unfriendly to democracy today because they all report up to the Supreme Court. But the point isn’t “courts will save us” malarkey. (In any case, that’s now mainly the mocking phrase of wreckers and sad sacks.) It’s putting sand in the gears, slowing things down as one front in the battle for public opinion.\n\nThe legal status of what news orgs are now consistently calling “Musk’s team” is high on the list as one way to do this.","summary":"Over the course of the last two weeks, I&#8217;ve tried to drive home the point that the Democrats in Congress...","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/who-can-stop-elons-team-wilding-its-way-throuhg-the-federal-government","image":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2185631139.jpg?w=804","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:17:04","author":"Josh Marshall","authors":["Josh Marshall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":285929338,"title":"CBS agrees to hand over '60 Minutes' Harris interview transcripts to FCC","text":"CBS says it will turn over an unedited transcript of its October interview with Kamala Harris to the Federal Communications Commission, part of President Donald Trump's ongoing fight with the network over how it handled a story about his opponent.\n\nTrump sued CBS for $10 million over the “60 Minutes” interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good.

The Democratic Party has been engaged in a long period of introspection after former-Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to President Donald Trump in November. Now, with the DNC choosing a new chair on Saturday, Harrison reflected on the past campaign as he spoke to the Associated Press. One key aspect he noted to the AP was that Harris would have had a better chance to win if she had more time because the party had been so oriented towards \"building a race\" for Biden up to the last minute. Even after Biden's disastrous debate performance, Harrison was still \"riding with Biden\" and seemed surprised when the former president dropped out. TIM WALZ ADMITS HE WAS SURPRISED BY ELECTION DEFEAT: ‘THOUGHT THE COUNTRY WAS READY’ \"I went into this thinking, OK, you’ve got probably the most successful of my lifetime legislative president who has poured tons of money into making sure that … Democrats get elected,\" Harrison said, raving about how people said Biden's 2024 address \"was one of the best State of the Unions that we’ve ever seen.\" \"Then we move forward to the debate, and people were like, that was a horrible debate performance. And then my thought was: ‘Joe Biden secured the nomination. The primary was done, and so, I’m a loyal guy. We’re riding with Biden,’\" he said. When asked if Democrats should have stuck with Biden in the presidential race, he argued that it was in his nature to do so, but the party had other plans. \"That’s my normal default, is that you stick by your people, right, particularly people who have worked hard on behalf of the party,\" he said. \"And that is not always the mentality of everybody in my party. And so sometimes, people look on the sidelines, ready to call in the backup.\" Harrison contrasted how Democrats panicked about Biden while Republicans circled their wagons around Trump despite his controversies, suggesting, \"sometimes, I think, Democrats can learn something in terms of, let’s put a line of defense around our folks and defend them as well.\" Harrison seemed unprepared for Biden to drop out, having just a small group of staffers gaming out what would happen ahead of time, then making calls to Democratic leaders after the news to get a sense of how the party should move forward, only to find Harris had already beat him to it and wrapped up their support. \"And so I started making phone calls just asking, ‘I’m sure you’ve heard the news about the president,’ and to a person, they’re saying, ‘I just got off the phone with the vice president, and I’m pledging my support.’ I must have been chasing her calls, because literally, I’m calling, and everyone said, ‘Well, I’m supporting her,’\" he said. TIM WALZ THOUGHT HIS LACK OF WEALTH WAS ‘REAL FLEX’ AGAINST TRUMP: ‘HOW… DID WE LOSE TO A BILLIONAIRE?’ Now, observing the aftermath, Harrison said, \"The DNC shouldn’t just be a rubber stamp to whatever the campaign wants.\" \"You don’t always have a seat at the table, in terms of, you take all of the arrows and the responsibility,\" he said. \"People want to give you all the blame, but you don’t have the power to make those decisions, and I really think there needs to be reapportionment of a better, a greater balance.\" After the interview was released, Harrison objected to the headline, which read, \"The DNC’s outgoing chair says Democrats should have stuck with Joe Biden in 2024.\" \"This headline isn't right. Stuck ‘by’ and stuck ‘with’ are two different things,\" he argued in a post on X. \"Yes, I believed we should have stuck by and defended President Joe Biden when he was our nominee, and at the same time when Joe Biden stepped down I was damn proud to fight for Vice President Harris to be our next POTUS.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When reached for comment, the AP said it stood by the headline.","summary":"Jaime Harrison, the outgoing chair of the DNC, said that his nature was ultimately to stand by President Biden, but the party ultimately had other plans.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/outgoing-dnc-chair-says-democrats-should-have-stuck-by-biden-2024-election","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/12/931/523/dnc-chairman-jaime-harrison-president-joe-biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:04:13","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":285920176,"title":"Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish & More Perform at FireAid Benefit Concert | All Access | Billboard News","text":"L.A.’s wildfire benefit concert FireAid happened Thursday night, and we’re taking you inside the star-studded lineup.

Trump signed an executive order halting permitting of wind projects.Critics say Trump's energy policies will accelerate climate change, which many scientists say poses a major threat to people across the globe. Proponents of oil and gas, however, point to economic factors, saying it's more efficient and cheaper than alternate sources.Arthur Kill Terminal (AKT) in Staten Island, which was projected to bring hundreds of jobs to the borough, is one project with a less certain future following the executive order.What to KnowThe project was set to bring offshore wind turbines to Staten Island, the city's only borough Trump won in the 2024 presidential race. Construction was set to begin this year, supplying about 750 jobs. Atlantic Offshore Terminals describes the project as an \"offshore wind staging and assembly port\" that would be an \"essential part of the infrastructure that will bring offshore wind energy to New York and the region.\"However, its future has been called into question after Trump's order, according to a Thursday report from the Staten Island Advance, which wrote the project now has a \"progressively lower\" chance of being built.The project has received bipartisan support from local officials who view it as an economic boon to the borough.Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for Representative Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican who represents Staten Island in Congress, told the newspaper that the congresswoman was planning to meet with developers behind the project and that the impact on the project remained unknown as of Thursday.\"This executive order puts a pause on issuing new permits and leases and calls for the incoming interior secretary to review wind permitting practices. We still do not know the impact this will have on Staten Island's project but the congresswoman will be meeting with Arthur Kill Terminal operators,\" Baldassarre said.Trump easily carried Staten Island with 64 percent of the vote in last year's election against then-Vice President Kamala Harris. His next best borough was Queens where he won only 37 percent support, a notable rise from 2020 when he only won 27 percent.New York was among the states that saw the largest shifts toward Trump last year, and Republicans are hoping to duplicate those trends over the next few election cycles to make the Empire State more competitive.The executive order signed by Trump, a longtime opponent of wind energy, doesn't necessarily ban all wind construction. It requires a temporary pause on permitting to allow Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to review projects. The former North Dakota governor will look at questions surrounding economic and environmental factors.Still, Trump has indicated support for ending wind energy projects, telling reporters during a January 7 press conference that \"we're going to try and have a policy where no windmills are being built.\"What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity last week: \"We don't want windmills in this country. We're putting an order on it, we've already sort of done it. We don't want windmills. If you've got a house, and your house is in vision of a windmill, your house is worth half. It's a disaster. Nobody wants them, and they're the most expensive energy of any kind of energy.Former Interior Deb Haaland previously told Newsweek about the president's promise to halt future offshore wind projects:\"Quite frankly, I'd like to see him try. That ship has sailed. I think that offshore wind is here to stay.\"What Happens NextProjects across the country are in question following Trump's order, which may have a chilling effect on the wind energy sector.","summary":"The Arthur Kill Terminal is among the projects that could be affected by Trump's order on wind projects.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-order-leaves-staten-island-energy-borough-limbo-2024478","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2578710/wind-project-new-york-limbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 22:44:37","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.117}]}
