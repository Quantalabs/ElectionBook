It does not select candidates for office, establish the party’s platform or set legislative priorities at any level of government.\n\nThe national committee isn’t even the leading campaign-fundraising entity in presidential, federal or state races.\n\nWhile the DNC raised an impressive $652 million during the 2024 campaign cycle, the Kamala Harris campaign alone raised over $1 billion.\n\nThe race for DNC chair could matter if the party’s woes were purely a matter of campaign mechanics: The central party helps to maintain voter-contact databases and provides technological infrastructure that all its candidates can access.\n\nIf the Democrats’ November defeats were due to poorly maintained databases or outdated voter modeling software, the new chair could fix those and propel the party to victory.\n\nThat, however, is clearly not the case: Democrats are losing because of their message, not their tactics or techniques.\n\nConsider these facts:\n\nThe Gallup Organization’s annual polling found that more Americans have identified as or leaned toward Republicans for three straight years, the first time that has happened in the company’s history.\n\nThis movement is historic. Democrats led in party identification in nearly every year since the 1930s.\n\nThe 2024 FOX News/AP post-election voter survey found 49% of the electorate identified as or leaned Republican, compared to 44% identifying as or leaning Democrat. It was the first presidential election in the history of exit polling in which Republicans outnumbered Democrats.\n\nHarris won 95% of Democrats and beat Trump by 6 percentage points among pure independents. She would have won every other presidential election conducted since 1932 with these numbers.\n\nAnd the Democrats’ woes have only deepened since last November. President Trump started his second term with a positive net job-approval rating, something he was never able to achieve in his first term.\n\nThe Democrats’ long-term decline in voter registration has continued, too. Registered Republicans now outnumber Democrats in Nevada for the first time since 2007, and the GOP is also continuing to out-register Democrats in key states such as Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\n\nA recent Quinnipiac University poll reinforced the drumbeat of bad news. It found only 31% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, the lowest number ever in that poll’s history.\n\nRepublicans, in contrast, had their highest-ever favorable rating in that same poll (43%).\n\nThe message is the same everywhere you look: Democrats are at their lowest level of public support and favorability in nearly a century.\n\nA new party chair cannot turn such a precipitous decline around. That is the job of elected Democrats.\n\nA few of those are beginning to speak up. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, for example, has met with Trump and criticized many of his party’s left-wing stances. \n\nNew York Rep. Ritchie Torres has also lashed out at some of his party’s excesses.\n\nBut so far theirs are lonely voices of moderation in a large party that remains far to the left of the American electorate.\n\nThe party’s challenge is best depicted in the Senate’s recent vote on the Laken Riley Act, a no-brainer bill mandating the detention of illegal immigrant criminals.\n\nJust 12 Senate Democrats broke party lines to join all Republicans in backing the measure.\n\nIt’s notable, though, who those 12 were: nine of the 10 Senate Democrats representing states that Trump carried; both senators from New Hampshire, which Trump lost by less than three percentage points; and Virginia’s Mark Warner, who may be facing a challenge from popular term-limited Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin in 2026.\n\nEvery other Senate Democrat voted no.\n\nThey represent the party’s base, the people who will select the next Democratic presidential nominee — and they know the base remains committed to the sort of open-borders policies that helped cause the party’s decline.\n\nWhoever prevails this weekend can’t fix that. All that person can do is rearrange the deck chairs on the S.S. Democrat.\n\nIt will fall to the ship’s elected captains to determine if it comes home safely to port — or if it runs full-throttle into the iceberg of increasingly conservative public opinion.\n\nHenry Olsen, a political analyst and commentator, is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.","summary":"Democrats are losing because of their message, not their tactics or techniques — and the party is still in thrall to the left.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/30/opinion/democrats-new-party-leader-wont-be-able-to-right-the-ship/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/newspress-collage-wr17c5x5y-1738280247422.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1738262362&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 23:53:55","author":"Henry Olsen","authors":["Henry Olsen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":285549336,"title":"Gabbard Vows ‘to End the Weaponization, Politicization of Intelligence Community’","text":"Tulsi Gabbard faced hard questions on Thursday during her Senate committee confirmation hearing to be director of national intelligence. \n\nIn his opening remarks, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., chairman of the Intelligence Committee, issued a strong statement of support for Gabbard, who formerly served as a Democrat congresswoman representing Hawaii’s 2nd Congressional District. He highlighted how, just like Gabbard, he had opposed regime change in Egypt and Libya. \n\nCotton noted that Gabbard had undergone five FBI background checks, and that he had recently looked at all 300 pages of her most recent background check.\n\nHe also harshly criticized unsuccessful 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for calling Gabbard an asset of a foreign government, noting that Gabbard had faithfully served for two decades in the U.S. Army. Gabbard remains an officer in the Army Reserves.\n\n‘Weaponization, Politicization of Intelligence Community’\n\nIn her opening statement, Gabbard pledged to end what she viewed as instances of abuse by the intelligence agencies that she would oversee if confirmed.\n\nGabbard asserted that trust in the intelligence community was at an all-time low, and that the invasion of Iraq was based on a failure in intelligence. She also outlined how members of the Senate Intelligence Committee had expressed to her concern over recent failures of American intelligence-gathering and a lack of responsiveness to congressional requests for information. \n\nDiscussing the threat of “faulty, inadequate, or weaponized intelligence,” Gabbard decried the espionage against Carter Page, who was a campaign adviser to President Donald Trump during his first presidential campaign; the FBI’s surveillance of traditionalist Catholics as terrorist threats; and the mass collection of Americans’ internet records.\n\n“President Trump’s reelection is a clear mandate from the American people to break this cycle of failure, end the weaponization and politicization of the intelligence community, and begin to restore trust in those who’ve been charged with the critical task of securing our nation,” Gabbard said.\n\nShe added that she would “work to rebuild trust through transparency and accountability.”\n\n“This is a national security imperative,” Gabbard said. \n\nPressed on Snowden\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., went on offense early on in the hearing, criticizing Gabbard for what he saw as sympathy for Edward Snowden. In 2013, Snowden, who now has Russian citizenship and resides there, leaked a huge number of classified documents.\n\n“I’m making myself very clear,” Gabbard told Warner. “Edward Snowden broke the law. He released information about the United States government’s illegal activities.”\n\nGabbard also stated that Snowden had exposed unlawful and unconstitutional surveillance of Americans by the United States government. \n\nWhen Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine—who voted against Pete Hegseth’s confirmation as defense secretary—asked Gabbard if she would support clemency or a pardon for Snowden, the former Hawaiian congresswoman replied that she would not. \n\n“If confirmed as director of national intelligence, I will be tasked with protecting our nation’s secrets, and I have four immediate steps that I would take to prevent another Snowden-like leak.”\n\nReforming Intel Community, Removing Partisanship\n\nSen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., questioned Gabbard on the need to depoliticize the intel community’s briefing of the president and Congress.\n\nGabbard responded that her focus was “ensuring that politics, biases, or personal views are checked at the door.”\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Gabbard had suggested politicization of the intelligence community had affected her personally. The former congresswoman claimed that in July she had been placed on a secret domestic terrorist watchlist dubbed “Quiet Skies” just 24 hours after criticizing the nomination of Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate for president.\n\n“I would lead by example by doing it myself and ensuring that that intelligence analysis and reporting meets the objective that the president and Congress requires, which is no politics,” she said.\n\nGabbard also promised to reduce bloat and redundancies in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \n\nFISA and Surveillance Without Warrants\n\nConcerns about warrantless surveillance were a key topic Republicans questioned Gabbard on.\n\nSpecifically, Republican senators asked Gabbard about Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is used by the United States government to surveil foreign nationals outside the United States without a warrant.\n\nThere have been worries for several years that the section can be used to incidentally collect data on American citizens, and abuses of foreign surveillance data by employees of the FBI have been reported. Warrantless surveillance of Americans is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. As some senators mentioned during the hearing, about 60% of the information in the president’s daily briefing comes from intelligence derived from Section 702. \n\nWhile Gabbard was still serving in the House of Representatives in 2020, she had proposed legislation that would have repealed Section 702. At the hearing, Gabbard said her proposal in Congress was done to “draw attention to the egregious civil liberties violations that were occurring at that time.” She reiterated during the hearing that amendments to the law since 2020 had addressed her concerns. \n\nMeetings With Assad\n\nSome of the harshest attacks in the hearing related to Gabbard’s controversial meeting with then-Syrian strongman Bashar Assad, who used chemical weapons against his countrymen.\n\nGabbard stood strong, telling her detractors that the meeting was for diplomatic purposes, and that she did not think the current regime that replaced Assad in Syria was a preferable alternative.\n\n“I shed no tears for the fall of the Assad regime, but today we have an Islamist extremist who’s now in charge of Syria … who danced on the streets to celebrate the 9/11 attack,” said Gabbard.","summary":"Tulsi Gabbard faced hard questions on Thursday during her Senate committee confirmation hearing to be director of national intelligence.&#160; In his opening remarks, Sen.

The longshot candidate, who only entered the race in mid-January, spoke with Daily Kos about his vision for the Democratic Party, which includes turning it into a more working-class-oriented grassroots organization.\n\nOn Feb. 1, the DNC’s 448-person membership will choose a new leader. In addition to Shakir, the race includes former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chair Ken Martin, former Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler, and others. \n\nDaily Kos, which is not endorsing anyone in this race, has reached out to all candidates.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nDaily Kos: In November, you said, “I don’t think anybody wants me to be the DNC chair.” What changed?\n\nFaiz Shakir: I followed the race very closely, and I listened. There were at least two candidate forums I listened to before I got in—one hosted by the AFL-CIO and another focused on the southern region. \n\nAs I listened to them, I was pleased to find that so many folks are talking about wanting to make the Democratic Party a working-class party. But I was feeling let down by the lack of ambition of what they were going to do differently with the power of the Democratic National Committee, particularly in this moment where you would think that the DNC chair would play a big role in establishing what the brand of the party is.\n\nI remember at the AFL-CIO forum that, as candidates were talking to labor groups, it was as if they were treating them as a special interest group within the party. I don’t see it that way. If you’re a working-class party, labor is the ethos that governs all. It is how we orient ourselves as to what defines us. \n\nWe can’t just drift aimlessly through this election without forcing people to confront that question of what guides us and think about what we want to do differently. So while I was hesitant initially, I ultimately jumped in the race and said, ‘Fine, I’ll shake this up.’\n\nDK: You entered the race relatively late compared to some of your competitors. What did you think was missing from their candidacies that made you want to enter?\n\nShakir: I sensed the ideas they were putting on the table did not seem novel nor meet the moment of wanting to transform the Democratic Party into a working-class party. My vision for the party is pretty simple: We’re a grassroots body. We’re a Democratic Party that invites people in. Our power comes from people, not from big money. In this moment, the party needs to be of community and service to others beyond ourselves. \n\nDK: One thing that’s always struck me is that the electorate is fairly progressive on economic issues. Still, they’re somewhat more conservative on social issues (e.g., affirmative action, trans issues, and immigration). Given that these facts are not especially convenient for the party, how do Democrats win elections?\n\nShakir: The polling is reflecting the diversity of the electorate, even among Democrats. But the worst thing we could do at this moment is to react to that and say, ‘Let’s look at polling and determine what our posture should be.’ There are a lot of different views and nuances that are not captured in polls of how people might feel. I think voters want to know what our views are on these matters, regardless of what polls say, and they want us to stand by those convictions even when criticism comes.\n\nIn my view, the economic justice primacy of the Democratic Party has to come through. The common bond is the idea that we’re living in a society of massive wealth and income inequality, where people who have great power are those who are rewarded, and those who are struggling are made to feel as if they are suckers. Our job is to make sure our whole reason for being a Democratic Party is to fight for a common person. That is our historical lineage. \n\nDK: Some reporting suggests that everyday Democrats are mad about former President Joe Biden suddenly dropping out of the race and then what some believe was a lackluster campaign by former Vice President Kamala Harris. How do you rebuild trust and hope in the Democratic Party and its processes?\n\nShakir: In the past few years, there were confrontations Democrats took on against corporate power that, in my mind, never made their way into our national politics. As a result, the average voter doesn’t know about a lot of the things that the party likes to tout as victories. \n\nFor instance, did you know that Biden’s administration brought a major case against Google and is suing them to break up their monopoly? We could go down the list and these things would be enormously popular, but no one knows about them. Why? What’s the disconnect there? To me, the disconnect is that, on the political side, these issues the party took on against corporate America were never mobilized as major campaign fights. On top of that, unfortunately, President Donald Trump was able to sell a message to working-class people that sounded good because of his performance art.\n\nNow, because we’ve lost power so gravely, we’ve got to present a vision of what we would do differently. We can’t just say, ‘Everything that Trump is doing is terrible.’ That won’t do the job of persuasion for a lot of audiences. This is where Democrats need to lean into their desires to want [the] government to succeed.\n\nDK: How do you contend with the Democratic members of Congress who refuse to cease power and won’t let the younger, more progressive guard have much of a voice?\n\nShakir: Nothing is ever going to change if we don’t compel that change. That change may not happen immediately, but if you don’t force the issue, it may be the case that the status quo just continues forever. Somebody’s got to come along and posit a choice—a directional choice. The Democratic Party can’t miss these opportunities to seize the change that we see. This is the moment to consider that. \n\nIf you’re a Democrat who is frustrated, then step up, suit up, and fight. Whether you’re running for local office or want to be a DNC member. I’m following the lead of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Don’t be daunted by the fact that you might not win. It’s worth the fight.\n\nDK: Do you think some members of the Democratic establishment are scared of change?\n\nShakir: Yes. They just become used to and comfortable with a certain way of operating. And that way of operating is, in my mind, a little too cozy with people who have big money and who are large donors. Our elites are too interconnected with a lot of these people and don’t often feel the same passion of millions of working-class people who want starker confrontation in an age of great power imbalance in this country. \n\nDK: There’s a lot on the line with Saturday’s vote. If you lose, what might that tell you about the party’s direction?\n\nShakir: If I were not successful, I think that shows Democrats are comfortable with the way the club is currently organized. I understand that, in many ways, the DNC is a bureaucracy to manage. But we can’t be worried about that when the ship itself is going down. \n\nEven if I lose, I’ll still be involved with the party. I ain’t checking out. I’ll just keep pushing.\n\nAndrew Mangan contributed research to this article.","summary":"Faiz Shakir, former campaign manager for Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign, is among eight candidates running to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee.

The Harris campaign couldn’t agree on terms for an appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, and Trump went on to do his own successful sit-down with the podcaster.\n\n Worse, Beyoncé said she’d speak at the Houston rally, but would not perform. “No Rogan. No ‘Freedom.’ The campaign kept its poker face, but it had played out a losing hand,” Allen and Parnes wrote in the upcoming HarperCollins Publishers book, according to the excerpt.\n\n The failure of the gambit by the Harris campaign was a big blow precisely because Fight reveals the Texas rally was arranged precisely to get Harris to Rogan’s studio in Houston just as crunch, yet secret, negotiations closed in on a possible deal.\n\n And Beyoncé coming on stage in Houston, but not performing, had far less benefit for Harris and her campaign than a Rogan podcast appearance in offering access to white men, a demo the Democratic candidate urgently needed to reach during the waning stages of the presidential race. \n\n Harper Collins said Fight as a backstage story is based on interviews with over 150 insiders — from the Trump, Harris and Biden inner circles, and party leaders and campaign operatives.","summary":"“No Rogan.

The sponsorships, though similar to advertisements, face different FCC rules than typical TV or radio ads. Carr sent the letters Wednesday to NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger, according to the Times. He has been a member of the FCC since 2017, and was appointed by President Donald Trump to serve as the commission's chair under his second administration. TRUMP TAPS FCC MEMBER BRENDAN CARR TO LEAD AGENCY: 'WARRIOR FOR FREE SPEECH' Carr continued in his letter that he will alert Congress to the investigation, noting that lawmakers already are weighing whether NPR and PBS should receive taxpayer funds. \"In particular, Congress is actively considering whether to stop requiring taxpayers to subsidize NPR and PBS programming,\" he wrote, according to the Times. \"To the extent that these taxpayer dollars are being used to support a for profit endeavor or an entity that is airing commercial advertisements, then that would further undermine any case for continuing to fund NPR and PBS with taxpayer dollars,\" he continued. Fox News Digital reached out to the FCC regarding the letter and the Times' report, but did not immediately receive a response. GOP SENATOR EYES LEGISLATION TO DEFUND 'PROPAGANDIST' NPR AFTER SUSPENSION OF WHISTLEBLOWER NPR chief Maher said in response to the letter that NPR's sponsorship practices \"complies with federal regulations.\" \"NPR programming and underwriting messaging complies with federal regulations, including the FCC guidelines on underwriting messages for noncommercial educational broadcasters, and Member stations are expected to be in compliance as well,\" Maher said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital on Thursday. TRUMP FCC CHAIR PICK STRESSES NEED TO 'RESTORE' FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS \"We are confident any review of our programming and underwriting practices will confirm NPR’s adherence to these rules,\" Maher said. \"We have worked for decades with the FCC in support of noncommercial educational broadcasters who provide essential information, educational programming, and emergency alerts to local communities across the United States.\" PBS told Times it is proud of its \"noncommercial educational programming,\" and worked \"diligently to comply with the F.C.C.’s underwriting regulations.\" NPR and PBS are both public broadcasting organizations, and both are bracing to potentially lose public funding under the Trump administration. \"NO MORE FUNDING FOR NPR, A TOTAL SCAM!\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social in April 2024, potentially previewing their fate under his second administration. \"THEY ARE A LIBERAL DISINFORMATION MACHINE. NOT ONE DOLLAR!!!\" Republican members of Congress also have introduced bills that would defund the public broadcasting organizations, such as Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy and Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry introducing the No Propaganda Act in December 2024. \"The American Taxpayer is footing the bill for a woke media corporation that pretends to be impartial while pushing Chinese propaganda,\" Perry said when introducing the legislation. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting \"cannot be allowed to keep using your hard-earned tax dollars to push a biased and political agenda that goes against what’s best for Americans.\" Carr's name recognition grew large right ahead of the Nov. 5, 2024, election, when he lambasted NBC's decision to host former Vice President Kamala Harris on \"Saturday Night Live\" in the final episode ahead of Election Day, but did not offer equal time to Trump or other candidates in the presidential cycle. TRUMP'S CHOICE FOR FCC CHAIRMAN SAYS AGENCY 'WILL END ITS PROMOTION OF DEI' NEXT YEAR The FCC’s equal-time rule was established in 1934, and requires radio and television broadcast stations to provide the same amount of time for competing political candidates. There are exceptions to the rule, such as newscasts, documentaries and political debates. \"NBC has structured this in a way that's plainly designed to evade the FCC's rules. We're talking 50 hours before Election Day starts, without any notice to other candidates, as far as I can tell,\" Carr told Fox News Digital at the time. \"And after previously coming out and saying they weren't going to do this precisely because they did not believe that they could do this consistent with election laws and the FCC's equal time rule.\" NBC ultimately filed an equal time notice amid outrage over Harris' appearance. KAMALA HARRIS APPEARS ON ‘SNL’ IN FINAL EPISODE BEFORE ELECTION Trump appointed Carr to lead the FCC shortly after his November 2024 election win, with Carr taking the helm of the commission in January.

Every infuriating headline about an important shuttered federal division or series of petty comments about how Black folks couldn’t possibly be qualified to do the job they were hired for begs the question: Have we no Black leaders who can push back against Trump?\n\nDuring chattel slavery, Harriet Tubman escaped her chains and became a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Frederick Douglass, a former slave who learned to read and write, took a different approach and put pen to paper. He wrote and spoke forcefully against slavery. Everyone did their part to help people who looked like them.\n\nIn the years after slavery, Booker T. Washington wrote the book “Up From Slavery” and argued for what he thought would help former slaves. He thought that Black people needed economic independence the most. Time has proven that he was, in fact, wrong: W.E.B. Du Bois, a Black intellectual and a contemporary of Washington, passionately disagreed with the former slave and argued that what was most needed was civil rights.\n\nThe list could go on and on. There was Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X; Ida B. Wells and Mary Jane McLeod Bethune. There are the more controversial folks like Black Panther leader Bobby Seale and activist Marcus Garvey. These were all leaders who saw that Black people were in need, and, out of love, took it upon themselves to try to provide leadership. \n\nHopefully the point is clear: Any time there was a threat to Black America, there have always been Black leaders who stepped up and tried to provide a vision for the future. \n\nW.E.B. Du Bois was correct in his criticism of Washington, but we should never doubt for a second that Washington — who was the principal developer of Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, now Tuskegee University — loved Black people...flawed as his ideas were. The same is true of all I named above. Each in their own way loved us and sacrificed for us.\n\nSo where are our leaders now?\n\nTrump poses a real and present threat to America in general and Black people in particular. He opposes DEI initiatives and is working diligently to eradicate them from the country. On Wednesday (Jan. 29), he signed an executive order that he hopes will defund K-12 schools that teach Critical Race Theory. (Something most schools do not teach.) \n\nHe is doing all this to send a message: Do not teach the truth about American history. Teach only those parts that I approve.\n\nNow is a time for leaders. Many in America are disheartened that Trump is back in the White House, but Black people are not just sad —we are under attack. In the past, when we were treated like we are today, a leader would arise. They were never perfect. They were sometimes wrong, but at least they cared. \n\nSure, there are some who are trying to push back. There is Dr. Freddie Haynes III who leads Friendship-West Baptist Church in Dallas. There is Rev. Raphael Warnock, the first Black senator from Georgia. And, of course, Kamala Harris is still around…but let’s be honest...is she a Black leader?\n\nWe have no transcendent, earth-shattering Black leader like we did in years past. They just aren’t there. Maybe it’s because of social media, and everyone who would take that mantle has skeletons in their closet that they do not want to come to light. Perhaps it because we have become too cynical to follow any leader. \n\nWhatever the reason, we don’t have one. And we are all the worse for it.","summary":"It’s been less than two weeks and President Donald Trump is turning the White House, and by proxy the country, into his own fiefdom.

I Don’t Know Where to Begin.","text":"Before Trump loyalist Kash Patel, who has been nominated to lead the FBI, answered questions at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday, the New York Times’ David Fahrenthold examined Patel’s apparent use of his nonprofit Kash Foundation for self-promotion in the years between the two Donald Trump administrations. Among many things the foundation promoted—including Kash-branded T-shirts and scarves and a book for adults titled Government Gangsters—was a children’s book in which, Fahrenthold wrote, “a besieged King Donald is helped by a wizard named Kash.”\n\nThere are actually three Plot Against the King books, marketed as suitable for children “ages 3 and up.” They’re published by Brave Books, which was established in 2021, boasts celebrity authors like Kirk Cameron, Kevin Sorbo, and Bethany Hamilton, and describes itself as a “Christian publishing company that makes books for kids that reinforce biblically-based, foundational values.” Two of the Patel books are illustrated by James Scrawl and one by Laura Vincent, all in a colorful, derivative fantasy style. One book fictionalizes Russiagate and the Steele dossier, the second does the same with the 2020 election, and the third covers the Department of Justice’s lawsuits against Donald Trump. In each, the wizard Kash—all-knowing, all-discerning, bearing the sobriquet the “Distinguished Discoverer”—does battle against the enemies of the “merchant Donald,” who becomes “King Donald” after the people of the kingdom vote for him on “Choosing Day.”\n\nThese books read like someone fed storylines from the Trump era into an A.I. trained on MAGA posts on social media and gave it the command: “Tell this as a medieval story in a slightly funny way.” Democrat Adam Schiff plays a part in books one and three, first as “the shifty knight,” then a “shifty jester,” and then just as “Shifty.” The media are “heralds” who hate King Donald and accept any lie about him that Shifty tells. Hillary Clinton is “Hillary Queenton,” Biden is “Baron Von Biden,” Kamala Harris is “Comma-la-la-la,” and Mark Zuckerberg—who gets a cameo thanks to the Trumpworld idea that he participated in the 2020 election fraud—is “Mischievous Metamark.” The DOJ is a “Dragon of Jalapeños,” who gets small as a dog before eating hot peppers, then bigger when he’s fed some, until he breathes fire.\n\nIf I were a child reading these, and I were paying attention, I’d have questions. Why are people voting for a king? Why does Biden’s Choosing Day win result in a barony, rather than a kingship, like Donald got? Why is the “shifty knight” friends with the heralds? Why name Kamala “Comma-la-la-la” instead of “Commie-la,” which would make so much more sense, and be funnier, too? (OK, maybe a child wouldn’t trip up on that last one, but that seemed like a real missed opportunity to me.) Aren’t “heralds” usually working for the king, not just acting as freelance trumpeters of random news? Some of these murky bits could have used one more pass for a punch-up, but some of them are just the inevitable result of the comically transparent agenda here. Without a MAGA mindset, for example, you can’t explain why the heralds would hate King Donald so much that they’d lie about him, or why there are no “people of the Land of the Free” who have any genuine objections to Donald’s kingship.\n\nActually, MAGA-hardline ideas about Trump’s natural, never-ending popularity lend themselves well to a children’s story set in some nonspecific “olden times” location. One page in the second book in the series, the one about the 2020 election, shows people lining up by party to place ballots in boxes, like people used to do in the 19th-century United States. The line for the blue box has only Hillary Queenton, Comma-la-la-la, Shifty, and a few others in it, while the line for the red box stretches off into the distance. Of course Biden’s win was a fraud! You can see it with your own eyes.\n\nLiberals publish plenty of incomprehensible, politically motivated children’s books. In fact, I’d argue that liberals pioneered the genre. Many well-meaning social-justice-y books for kids under 5 assume previous knowledge of abstract concepts, histories, and tropes that actual children regard with utter confusion. That, contra Ted Cruz’s grandstanding about poor little babies being made to feel guilt for being white, was the real problem with Antiracist Baby, the board-book version of which contained such iconically toddler-pleasing lines as “Nothing disrupts racism more than when we confess/the racist ideas that we sometimes express” and “Some people get more, while others get less/because policies don’t always grant equal access.”\n\nJust as I doubt a 2-year-old would come away from that book feeling guilty (you have to engage and understand to feel guilt), I really doubt that the trio of Plot Against the King books, on the merits of their story or illustrations, will turn any children MAGA. The storylines don’t lend themselves very well to discussion, particularly the storyline of the first book, which is just as confusing as the Russiagate saga was to everyone but total news-hounds when it unfolded. But I don’t think that’s the point. It’s about sitting down and sharing your enthusiasm for political stories with your kid. And if people are doing that (thousands of five-star reviewers on Amazon say they are), the books are “working.”\n\nCredit where it’s due, though. The river of poop created by the 2,000 mules that flows through the city on Choosing Day in the second book in this series, causing townspeople to trip and fall on their butts in the middle of the street? That’s pretty funny. I bet my kid would like it.","summary":"The books’ hero? “King Donald.”","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2025/01/kash-patel-confirmation-hearing-donald-trump-fbi.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/53475a93-3dee-44fd-a0b3-cec89e03bfc1.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 19:32:49","author":"Rebecca Onion","authors":["Rebecca Onion"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.141},{"id":285525016,"title":"House GOP Floats Plan to Cut Taxes for Corporations and the Ultrawealthy","text":"One of the hallmarks of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was a promise of sweeping tax cuts, for the rich, for working people and for companies alike.\n\nNow congressional Republicans have the job of figuring out which of those cuts to propose into law. In order to pay for the cuts, they have started to eye some targets to raise money. Among them: cutting benefits for single mothers and poor people who rely on government health care.\n\nThe proposals are included in a menu of tax and spending cut options circulated this month by House Republicans. Whether or not Republicans enact any of the ideas remains to be seen. Some of the potential targets are popular tax breaks and cuts could be politically treacherous. And cutting taxes for the wealthy could risk damaging the populist image that Trump has cultivated.\n\nFor the ultrawealthy, the document floats eliminating the federal estate tax, at an estimated cost of $370 billion in revenue for the government over a decade. The tax, which charges a percentage of the value of a person’s fortune after they die, kicks in only for estates worth more than around $14 million.\n\nAmong those very few Americans who do get hit with the tax, nearly 30% of the tax is paid by the top 0.1% by income, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center think tank. (Many ultra-wealthy people already largely avoid the tax. Over the years, lawyers and accountants have devised ways to pass fortunes to heirs tax free, often by using complex trust structures, as ProPublica has previously reported.)\n\nAnother proposal aims to slash the top tax rate paid by corporations by almost a third.\n\nTrump promised such a cut during the campaign. But Vice President JD Vance came out against it before Trump picked him as his running mate. “We’re sort of in line with the OECD right now,” he said in an interview last year, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 38 wealthy developed nations. “I don’t think we need to be cutting the corporate tax rate further.”\n\nIn Trump’s first term, he brought the top corporate rate down from 35% to 21%, where it’s at now, taking the U.S. from a high rate compared to other OECD nations to about average. The proposed cut to 15% would make the United States’ rate among the lowest of such countries.\n\nTo pay for new tax cuts, the House Republicans’ proposal floats a series of potential overhauls of government programs. One major focus is possible cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for people with low incomes that is administered by the states. Medicaid expansion was a key tenet of the Affordable Care Act, passed under President Barack Obama. Many Republican governors initially chose not to take advantage of the new federal subsidies to expand the program. In the intervening years, several states reversed course, and the program has expanded the number of people enrolled in Medicaid by more than 20 million, as of last year.\n\nThe deep cuts to the program floated in the document include slashing reimbursements to the states. States would need to “raise new revenues or reduce Medicaid spending by eliminating coverage for some people, covering fewer services, and (or) cutting rates paid to physicians, hospitals, and nursing homes,” according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy organization.\n\nTrump has been inconsistent in his position on Medicaid over the years. He sought to slash the program in his first term. But he has also made statements about protecting it over the years.\n\nAs recently as a 2023 campaign event, Trump promised that “we’re not going to play around with Medicare, Medicaid.” But it’s not clear whether the comment was a throwaway: While preserving Medicare, the program that covers health care for the elderly, has been a focus for Trump, maintaining Medicaid has not. The official GOP platform rolled out by Trump last year, for example, promised not to cut “one penny” from Medicare but was silent on Medicaid. In separate remarks during the campaign last year, Trump appeared to endorse cuts to “entitlements,” after an interviewer asked about Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n\nOther proposals would eliminate tax breaks for families with children.\n\nCurrently, parents can get a tax credit of up to $2,100 for child care expenses. The House Republican plan floats the elimination of that break. The cut is estimated to save $55 billion over a decade.\n\nVance, in particular, had promised economic policies that would lessen the load on parents. “It is the task of our government to make it easier for young moms and dads to afford to have kids,” he said last week. (He campaigned on a proposal to more than double the child tax credit.)\n\nAnother proposal in the list of options takes aim squarely at parents raising children on their own. The provision would eliminate the “head of household” filing status to collect almost $200 billion more in taxes over a decade from single parents and other adults caring for dependents on their own.\n\nThe “head of household” status was created in the 1950s under the rationale that single parents should have a lighter tax burden. Eliminating it would affect millions of Americans, largely women. (The after-tax pay of people with incomes between the 20th and 80th percentiles, those making between about $14,000 and $100,000, would fall by the highest percentage, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.)\n\nDemocrats have criticized the proposals as a gift to the wealthy at the expense of the working class. “Republicans are gearing up for a class war against everyday families in America,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not respond to questions about the specifics in the House GOP document but said in an email that “This is an active negotiation and process one that the President and his team are working productively with congress. His visit to the House Retreat [Monday] was a sign that he wants to prioritize unity and a good deal for American that achieves his campaign promises.”\n\nA spokesperson for the House Budget Committee declined to answer specific questions but said “this is a menu of policy options for authorizing committees to consider as members navigate the reconciliation process.”\n\nSome of the proposals would fulfill Trump’s campaign promises geared toward the working class.\n\nThe document includes a plan to eliminate income taxes (but maintain payroll taxes) on tips, at a cost of $106 billion over a decade. The proposal is one Trump touted while campaigning in Las Vegas to win support from the city’s huge contingent of service workers. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, later pledged to do the same. Economists have criticized the idea as one that unfairly benefits one group of working-class employees over others who get paid the same but work in other industries that don’t deal in tips.\n\nAnother Trump campaign promise included in the document is ending taxes on overtime pay, at a price of $750 billion over a decade. That proposal has also been criticized by tax experts as an inefficient way to provide relief for lower-paid workers who are eligible for overtime because they’re paid hourly and perform repetitive tasks. The provision, critics say, would invite gaming and further complicate tax reporting by creating new reporting requirements about the hours a taxpayer worked.\n\nOne of the biggest-ticket proposals to raise new revenue in the House Republicans’ document would hit a tax break cherished by upper-income Americans: eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. The document estimates $1 trillion in savings over 10 years by eliminating the break.

The temporary ban was put in place following a string of of incendiary posts Trump made during and after the Capitol riot.\n\nAt the time, Zuckerberg said the risks of Trump’s activity on the social media platforms “are simply too great” and paused his accounts for two weeks, which was later extended. Trump’s accounts were restored in January 2023.\n\nMore recently, though, Zuckerberg has shown he wants to rebuild his fraught relationship with Trump and the federal government. And he’s not alone. Since Trump’s win this past November, tech executives have adopted a defensive stance toward their former enemy.\n\n“This is going to be a big year,” Zuckerberg said on an earnings call earlier this week, adding that Meta would be “redefining our relationship with governments” during Trump’s second term.\n\n“We now have a U.S. administration that is proud of our leading companies. That prioritizes American technology winning. And that will defend our values and interests abroad. And I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock. I think that this is the most exciting and dynamic that I have ever seen in our industry,” he said.\n\nThe settlement builds on Zuckerberg’s recent ring kissing, a culmination of moves that have earned him praise from Trump and other conservatives. Earlier this month, Meta announced plans to disband its third-party fact-checking team and replace it with a community notes-style system similar to the one currently used on Elon Musk’s X. Days later, Meta ended its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, effective immediately.\n\nZuckerberg also greenlit Meta’s eyebrow-raising $1 million donation to Trump’s inauguration fund and has sought to strengthen his personal relationship with the president. He visited Trump at his private Florida club in Mar-a-Lago this past November, during which Trump brought up the litigation and suggested that they attempt to resolve it. This kicked off two months of negotiation between the parties.\n\nIndeed, when asked what prompted the settlement, Trump lawyer John Coale told Politico, “I’ve been working to get people to the table for two years now. Of course, the election helped.”\n\nTrump first filed the lawsuit months after his first term ended, accusing Meta and Twitter—which was owned by Jack Dorsey at the time—of violating the First Amendment. He called the limitations on his online presence “illegal, shameful censorship of the American people.”\n\nMeta’s settlement comes after ABC News similarly caved to Trump. Last month, the network agreed to pay $15 million for his presidential library after anchor George Stephanopoulos incorrectly said on air that Trump was found “liable for rape.” He was actually found liable for sexual abuse.\n\nAnd ABC News isn’t the only outlet that Trump has targeted. \n\nIn December, Trump personally sued Iowa-based pollster Ann Selzer over a survey she released days before the election that predicted former Vice President Kamala Harris would carry Iowa by 3 percentage points. Trump went on to win the state by roughly 13 points. \n\nMore recently, he appointed a new chair for the Federal Communications Commission who revived three complaints levied against ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News.\n\nBetween corporate news outlets and social media conglomerates, it seems no one plans to stand up to Trump any time soon.","summary":"Meta has agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit President Donald Trump filed for suspending his Facebook and Instagram accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\n\n\nFirst reported by the Wall Street Journal, this news is the latest instance of a large corporation settling with Trump, who once threatened Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg with jail time.

Debbie Dingell (D-MI) and Whitmer, have said they will not seek a Senate run. \n\nEyes are on former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II to see whether they launch bids for the Democratic nomination, with sources confirming to multiple outlets Buttigieg is considering a campaign. Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Hillary Scholten are also eyeing a run, according to the Detroit News.\n\nOther Republican candidates who could potentially face Rogers include Rep. John James (R-MI), who represents Michigan’s 10th Congressional District and previously ran for Senate, Rep. Bill Huizenga, and Tony Dungy, a television football analyst.\n\nPeters announced on Tuesday that he would not seek reelection to a seat he’s held since 2015.

But several Democratic senators have shown a willingness to vote with the Republicans on immigration legislation, as well as in support of some of his Cabinet nominations, while still voicing opposition to other Trump priorities.What To KnowSenate Democrats from competitive states—those that Trump won or narrowly lost to Vice President Kamala Harris in November—have thus far been most inclined to vote with the president less than two weeks after he took office.Some of Trump's Cabinet nominees have garnered significant support from Democrats. None voted against the confirmation of Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy earned support from about half of Senate Democrats.The five Democratic Senators who have voted with Trump most often so far are Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania; Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire; Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, both of Arizona; and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.Trump narrowly won all of those states except New Hampshire, which backed Harris by less than 3 percentage points.All five senators voted for the Laken Riley Act, which allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain migrants charged with theft, burglary, shoplifting or larceny offenses, regardless of their immigration status. The bill was signed into law by Trump on Wednesday.Fetterman was the only Senate Democrat who voted in favor of a procedural vote to move forward with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's nomination, but he later joined all Democrats in opposing his confirmation.Fetterman, Shaheen and Slotkin voted to confirm Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. Fetterman, Gallego and Kelly voted to confirm Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin.Fetterman was also the only Democrat who voted to advance a bill to impose sanctions on International Criminal Court officials following the ICC's decision to bring war crime charges against Israeli officials amid the war with Hamas in Gaza.Newsweek reached out to each of these senators' offices for comment via email.Reached by Newsweek, a spokesperson for Slotkin cited a statement in which she explains her bipartisan voting record.What People Are SayingElissa Slotkin said in the statement: \"Every President has the right to choose their people for their Administration, and it's my Constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on those nominations. For me, that means assessing candidates' commitment to upholding the oath of office they will swear to the U.S. Constitution — not to any one person or political party.\"Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement: \"I voted in favor of the Laken Riley Act because it's critical we take action to keep dangerous people off the streets and crack down on criminal activity to prevent senseless tragedies. This bill is not a comprehensive effort, and let's be very clear: there is more work to do to fix our broken immigration system.\"John Fetterman said on The View: \"For me, engaging the president, when you're in this business, that's part of the job.\"What Happens NextThese Senate Democrats will be closely watched during the upcoming confirmation battles for some of Trump's nominees that have drawn the most criticism, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of health and human services and former Representative Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence.","summary":"In the early days of Trump's second term, a handful of Democratic senators have voted in line with him more often than not.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/senate-democrats-voting-trump-most-often-2023675","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2577473/senate-democrats-voting-most-trump.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 18:43:41","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":285472426,"title":"Meta Settles a $25 Million Trump Lawsuit Because It Had More to Lose by Winning","text":"The Wall Street Journal reported that most of the money will fund Trump’s presidential library, with the rest covering legal fees and other plaintiffs. Meta won’t admit wrongdoing, and experts widely agree Trump was unlikely to win: the judge in this case, like the one in a similar failed suit against Twitter, appeared openly skeptical of his arguments.\nBut Meta arguably had more to lose by winning this one. Tech and media companies, eager to avoid conflict with the new administration, have recently settled a string of Trump lawsuits they probably would have won in court. According to the Journal, this settlement, in particular, grew out of Zuckerberg’s efforts to cozy up to Trump last November. The paper’s sources said the then-president-elect signaled during a Mar-a-Lago dinner that the Meta boss would need to resolve the suit before he could ever be allowed “into the tent.”\nZuckerberg is not the only executive eager for that particular invitation. In late November, lawyers for X informed a California appeals court that they planned to settle a similar lawsuit they’d fought as recently as August. Weeks later, ABC News paid $15 million to settle a defamation case it seemed likely to win. And executives at Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, have reportedly discussed settling the lawsuit Trump filed last fall over 60 Minutes’ October interview with former vice president Kamala Harris.\nSome companies in Trump’s crosshairs are still vowing to fight back. Newspaper chain Gannett, which owns the Des Moines Register, is contesting Trump’s claim that the paper committed consumer fraud when it published an ultimately inaccurate poll ahead of the 2024 election. Meanwhile, the Pulitzer Board has asked a judge to pause a Trump defamation suit in connection with the prizes it awarded for 2016 election coverage—mirroring the president’s own legal delay tactics.\nRegardless of how these cases end, however, experts warn of lasting damage. Last week, the editorial board of the New Jersey Law Journal cautioned that the ABC settlement set a dangerous precedent and encouraged “more groundless legal actions” against media companies. In The Atlantic, Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, predicted that the settlements would “cow” the media and come to represent a type of extortion.\n“It looks like a bribe and a signal to every company that corruption is the name of the game,” Democratic Sen.

Smith In 2028","text":"The Democratic polling firm McLaughlin & Associates released updated polling numbers on which potential candidates primary voters would prefer in 2028. Former vice president Kamala Harris led all candidates, garnering 33% of the votes. The GOP can only hope. Harris is followed by familiar names like Buttigieg, Newsom, Ocasio-Cortez, Shapiro, Tampon Tim, and Stephen A. Smith. Come again? Stephen A. Smith? That's right. According to the poll, at least 2% of Democratic primary voters say they'd vote for Smith in 2028. For background, Smith has been hinting at an interest in running for president for months. Here is what he told the ladies on \"The View\" last November: \"I have no desire to be a congressional figure or a senator, but if you came to me, and you told me I had a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States of America, I would definitely consider it.\" Oh. Look, the Democratic primary has become such a farce that voters have little input in who ultimately wins out. In one way or another, the party has installed a candidate in three straight elections – from Hillary Clinton (sorry, Bernie) to Joe Biden (sorry, Bernie, again) to Harris (sorry, Joe). #Democracy. So, who knows? Maybe Smith, as someone who is easily manipulated and willing to play the race card, would impress the chieftains of the party. Then again, the race card proved to be a turnoff during the 2024 election. Nevertheless, it's quite laughable that even 2% of voters take Smith seriously as a potential candidate. It's not his lack of political experience that is the concern, but rather his lack of principled beliefs. He doesn't have any. People credit Stephen A. for appearing on Bill Maher's show last week and criticizing Kamala Harris. I don't. Here's why: it's all an act. What Smith tells Maher and other moderate or conservative hosts tends to directly contradict what he spews on his podcast and Disney-owned programs like \"The View.\" Last summer, Smith acknowledged to Sean Hannity a new study that found black males increasingly relating to Donald Trump, which Smith said he understood. Then Black Twitter came from him, and he quickly caved and apologized. Take a look: \"I’m fully aware that I have been in the news the last few days, paraded all over social media as well after comments I made on Fox News’ Hannity last week…A lot of folks in black America seem pretty pissed at me right now. \"Quite a few folks were offended as my words were interpreted as associating support for Trump by the black community with all the legal issues he’s facing. For that, I sincerely apologize. I’m stating right here for the record that I was taken out of context. \"Anywhere I appear, no matter my subjectivity relating to what I feel, is still going to be based on facts being presented into the stratosphere. That is who I’ve always been. It is who I’ll always continue to be. But it’s never exercised with malice on my heart and certainly never to assault or harm the black community, my community…Just because my intent was harmless, doesn’t mean my words were harmless, and I know that.\" Gutless. As I explained last week, I don’t believe that Stephen A. suddenly had a political awakening in which he came to regret his support for Kamala Harris. His newfound \"I am done with Democrats\" is a leverage play. His contract is up, and he admittedly wants to build an independent media company. He knows the woke grift doesn’t pay outside the corporate world. Put simply, Stephen A. says whatever the person/group signs his check wants him to say. Washington lobbyists would certainly appreciate his willingness to put his beliefs up for sale. Then again, seeing Smith debate JD Vance (the betting favorite for 2028) would be quite the scene. Vance is not weak like Max Kellerman or weak intellectually like Shannon Sharpe. Way too early prediction: Pete Buttigieg enters the first Democratic primary debate with frontrunner status, while Stephen A. milks the 2028 speculation until Disney gives him the salary he demands.","summary":"","url":"https://www.outkick.com/culture/2-democratic-primary-voters-say-theyd-vote-stephen-a-smith-2028","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/01/steven-a.-smith-e1655141433459-removebg-preview.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 18:24:08","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":285464362,"title":"After disastrous 2024 U.S elections, Democrats' unfavorability rating reaches new, 16-year high","text":"A new poll revealed that Americans don't like the Democratic Party, with a 57% unfavourable rating, according to a report.

Smith slammed both Republicans and Democrats for the nation's $36trillion debt but saved his sharpest rebukes for the American left and its focus on trans issues at an inopportune time.\n\nSpeaking on his eponymous YouTube show, the ESPN pundit lectured the Democratic Party for 'frivolous arguments in regards to identity politics.' In particular, he blasted the left for highlighting 'transgender issues, as opposed to LGBTQ-overall issues,' while reminding the party that Americans are more concerned with economics.\n\n'That's not what people care about when their wallets are being pinched, when eggs and milk and gas and bread and everything is expensive,' Smith said as egg prices reached record highs this week amid a deadly strain of avian flu. 'They don't care! They only care when they're comfortable. They don't care when they're suffering. Get used to it.'\n\nA recent poll revealed Smith may have more political support than many big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls, although he has yet to declare interest in any office, including the White House. He recently admitted to feeling like a 'damn fool' for supporting Kamala Harris and has ingratiated himself to conservatives as a frequent guest on right-wing pundit Sean Hannity's Fox News program.\n\nBut 57-year-old Bronx native isn't afraid to direct criticism at the right as well, particularly after the national debt rose by almost $8 trillion during Donald Trump's first term in office.\n\n'The Republicans' hands ain't clean in all of this, Trump spent,' Smith said before listing predecessors such as George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.\n\nStephen A. Smith has more support than several big-name Democratic presidential hopefuls\n\nSmith recently admitted to feeling like a 'damn fool' for supporting Kamala Harris and Tim Walz \n\nNBA star makes 'gun gesture' at rival team's bench after getting ejected in wild scenes\n\n'It's not about spending because they all spend,' Smith said. 'It's who'ya gonna spend on? What'chya gonna spend on? Democrats and Republicans, they're all guilty. All of their hands are filthy in this $36 trillion deficit that we operate under.'\n\nSmith also took issue with Trump and his followers' war on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, many of which have already lost funding or government approval in the new administration.\n\n'DEI, oh everybody's in an uproar about DEI,' Smith said. 'Know what my uproar was? I don't like the fact that you're acting like everything associated with DEI involves some incompetent people that weren't getting jobs based on their merit.\n\n'But you're forgetting why the need for DEI was necessary to begin with, similar to why the Rooney Rule in the National Football League was necessary to begin with, similar to why affirmative action was necessary,' Smith continued, listing hiring initiatives started by the NFL and federal government that have come under fire. 'If you hadn't been so insidious, so vicious, so inequitable in terms of how you treated other human beings that weren't white, those programs wouldn't have needed to be in existence.'\n\nOnce again, Smith then turned his attention to Democrats.\n\n'But that doesn't mean that the left didn't go overboard in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis by those police officers, mainly Derek Chauvin, and that they didn't use it as an opportunity to try to guilt the nation into voting for them regardless of the incompetence and the tone deafness that they operated under,' he said.\n\n'Everybody's hands are dirty. Everybody. The difference is Trump doesn't mind getting his hands dirty and dirtier.'\n\nJohn McLaughlin - Trump's chief pollster - surveyed 1,000 people, several of whom had a positive response to the possibility of Stephen A. Smith running for president in 2028 \n\nSmith then returned to the topic of the government spending freeze – something the White House has already rescinded amid widespread confusion over the initial memo that issued the directives.\n\n'So yeah, you're right,' Smith resumed. 'This whole thing with the federal freeze has been somewhat mishandled, particularly in the public eye. And he had to... backtrack a little bit to make sure that they dotted their Is and crossed their Ts appropriately before moving forward with it at a later date.\n\n'But make no mistake, he has sent the message: He ain't messing around.'\n\nThen Smith explained what he sees as the left's role during the second Trump administration.\n\n'Now the Democrats can get back to doing the job they were supposed to do: Legitimately pointing out the flaws in his vision,' he said.\n\nYouTubeSteve SmithRepublicansDemocrats\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nStephen A.

Trump and his incoming cabinet and administration attended the ball, which earned the first family “billions” of dollars, according to CNBC.\n\n Snoop lost over 571,000 Instagram followers and 20,000 X followers after the performance. The “Drop It Like It’s Hot” rapper responded to the controversy in an Instagram video on Jan. 26, saying, \"Y'all can't hate enough on me for me, I love too much. Get your life right, stop worrying about mine. I'm cool, I'm together. Still a Black man. Still a hundred percent Black. I ain't going nowhere, cuh! I'm right here.\"\n\n He expressed a similar sentiment on the R&B Money Podcast on Saturday, Jan. 25.\n\n “You ‘gon deal with hate when you get to the top, no matter who you are … Me, personally, I answer it with success and love,\" he said. \"That’s my answer to any hate and negativity that comes my way, ’cause it’s the strongest force that can beat it.\"\n\n Hughley did not agree with that response, suggesting on his podcast that Snoop is dealing with “an inner turmoil” after denouncing any Black artist who would perform for Trump in 2017.\n\n \"It isn't us that you have a problem with, it is you,” Hughley said. “The 2025 version of you is at odds with the 2017 version of you. So it ain't the us that gotta get it together, it's the you. You need to have a conversation with the man in the mirror. What is so different about the 2017 Snoop, and the 2025 Snoop? It ain't us. We ain't in it.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n The actor and comedian said he believes Trump and his administration have been the ones coming after the Black community with their legislation.\n\n “It is not us who are tearing down affirmative action. It is not us who is tearing down DEI. It is not who are tearing families apart. It is not us who have decided that affirmative action and rollbacks that precedent for 50, 60 years are gone,” Hughley said. “It is not us that is doing it. It is the man you decided to perform for.”\n\n Hughley suggested fans feel “disappointed because they saw you a specific way,” regarding Snoop.\n\n “You performed for a guy they knew would do what he’s doing,” he continued. “But it’s us that has the problem? It’s us that are wrong? It is us that can’t sick together?”\n\n The Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip star pointed out that 86% of Black voters voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, so Snoop should’ve known the majority of the Black community would not support Trump.\n\n “Every time somebody gets into a situation of their own doing, it is always 'a communal attack' or 'a community's attack.' I mean, no,” Hughley said. “People love you, but they dislike what you did. And there's nothing more loving than that.\"","summary":"The comedian and actor said on the Jan. 28 episode of his podcast that the rapper's fans are \"disappointed\" in him for taking the stage at the Crypto Ball","url":"https://people.com/d-l-hughley-calls-out-snoop-dogg-trump-inauguration-performance-8783117","image":"https://people.com/thmb/04BYYEFv9PSC1vmNNYGyS6NsMrY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(753x284:755x286)/DL-Hugley-and-Snoop-Dogg-013025-tout-79bef1f1cfa545a4b07ecc694822df6c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 17:46:18","author":"Dana Rose Falcone","authors":["Dana Rose Falcone"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":285458490,"title":"‘I keep getting the feeling that it’s an inside job’: Psychic seems to have predicted the American Airlines plane crash","text":"Did this psychic really predict the American Airlines plane crash? \n\nOn Wednesday, tragedy struck when a collision happened midair between a U.S. Army Blackhawk and an American Airlines jet.

She goes on to call it “a man-made disaster.”\n\nThe second prediction was that a plane crash in 2025 would involve a power couple. The psychic mentions, “This couple will have been a household name that have been quite successful.”\n\nRussian figure-skateing couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov was on the plane.\n\nJust how accurate was the psychic’s prediction?\n\nShe said she thought the tragedies would occur in February.

Those inquiries cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing, but court cases related to the videos are ongoing.\n\nDaleiden and Merritt pleaded no contest in San Francisco Superior Court and waived any right to appeal.

They must also obey all laws.\n\nDaleiden downplayed the felony conviction in a statement on his website, Center for Medical Progress, saying that the conviction comes with “zero punishment.”\n\nAt the time, then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris launched an investigation into Daleiden and Merritt’s actions after they published a series of videos showing covertly filmed conversations of Planned Parenthood executives discussing abortion procedures and how tissue is collected and exchanged with research companies.\n\nDonating fetal tissue to researchers and recouping expenses is legal under U.S. law and states may impose additional regulations.\n\nThe recordings sparked a firestorm of national outrage, particularly from conservative activists and lawmakers who oppose abortion, fueling calls to defund Planned Parenthood. The subjects of the recordings received death threats in the aftermath.\n\nPlanned Parenthood won a $2.2 million civil lawsuit in San Francisco against Daleiden and Merritt for violating fraud, trespassing and recording laws.\n\nIn an unsigned statement, Bonta’s office said it disagreed with Daleiden’s characterization of the plea deal.\n\n“Make no mistake: the defendants are now convicted felons. They are guilty of feloniously recording private communications.”\n\nUnder California law, Daleiden and Merritt are eligible to ask a judge to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor in 12 months if they adhere to the terms of the plea deal.\n\nSupported by the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), which works to ensure that people have access to the care they need, when they need it, at a price they can afford.

Too Bad the Rest of His Plans Undercut Them","text":"During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — vaccine conspiracy theorist, former presidential candidate, and Donald Trump’s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary — answered most questions about his past and his plans for the future by talking in circles about vaccines, Medicare, and abortion, and demonstrating that his loyalty to the president trumps his concern for public health. But this wasn’t the case when Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) asked Kennedy about Long Covid. \n\n At a time when no one wants to think or talk about the global pandemic that began five years ago, there are an estimated 15 to 20 million Americans living with the chronic condition and its more than 200 symptoms who can’t move on, and, as Young put, have “been largely ignored.” This was certainly the case during the 2024 presidential race, when — with the exception of Kamala Harris (inadequately) answering one question about Long Covid during a Univision town hall — neither candidate addressed the condition in any meaningful way.\n\n That’s why, as someone living with Long Covid for nearly five years, I was shocked to hear Young ask Kennedy if he would “collaborate with health care providers, researchers and effective communities to better understand and mitigate Long Covid’s impact,” and hear Kennedy’s answer: “Absolutely.” \n\n Surprisingly, Kennedy agreed to “commit to prioritizing Long Covid research and integrate this work in a broader healthcare policy,” and to working with Congress to ensure that Long Covid research funding “be directed primarily towards trial or novel research directions, and not replicating existing observational research.”\n\n For someone living with a condition that is still routinely dismissed or met with disbelief, having the presumptive head of the Department of Health and Human Services not only acknowledge Long Covid, but agree to promote research on it sounds too good to be true. But is this a meaningful step forward, or was Kennedy simply telling Young what he wanted to hear? \n\n Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis and Long Covid expert and researcher, says he’s “happily surprised” by Kennedy’s stance during the hearing. “If he is serious about prioritizing Long Covid — and I certainly hope he is — I stand ready to work with him to address the crisis,” he tells Rolling Stone. \n\n To be clear, Long Covid is absolutely a crisis. It has robbed millions of us of our physical, mental, and cognitive health. It has forced countless people out of the workforce, and caused some to lose their homes. It has ruined relationships, alienated us from families and friends, and made us question our place and purpose in the world. While there are ways to help us manage our symptoms, there is no known cure for Long Covid. For us, research into potential treatments is our best source of hope.\n\n As much as I want to take Kennedy’s commitment to Long Covid research at face value, it’s hard to reconcile his affirmative responses to Young’s questions with his views on vaccines — including the position that he’s held for two decades that some vaccines cause autism (a now disproven claim based on a fraudulent and since retracted 1998 study). He’s had endless opportunities to set the record straight — including in an exchange with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Thursday — but has failed to do so, in turn, giving credence to this dangerous myth. \n\n And then there was the time in November 2023, during his presidential campaign, when he told an audience at an anti-vaccine conference about his plan for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to take a long hiatus from studying infectious diseases, like Covid-19 and measles, and focus instead on chronic conditions, like diabetes and obesity. “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, God bless you all,” Kennedy said in 2023. “Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years.”\n\n On the one hand, Kennedy’s full-throated support of Long Covid research is in line with his pledge to combat chronic illness: one of the pillars of his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign. On the other, he has been laser-focused on obesity and diabetes, his solution invariably centering on changing American diets. He consistently and conveniently ignores the numerous chronic conditions that can begin with an infection — not just Long Covid, but myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), post-polio syndrome, and other post-viral syndromes. If he was genuinely interested in taking on chronic illness, his vaccine skepticism and call to abandon infectious disease research for eight years wouldn’t be an option. He can’t have it both ways.\n\n During the hearing, it was bizarre to hear the guy who, in May 2021, petitioned the Food and Drug Administration requesting that the agency revoke authorization for Covid vaccines, commit so readily to continuing Long Covid research, knowing that the Covid vaccine reduces the incidence of Long Covid. After all, the best way to avoid Long Covid is not to get infected in the first place.\n\n “Obviously he has stances on vaccines and deemphasizing infectious disease research for nearly a decade, which is counter to prioritizing Long Covid, so there’s some inconsistency there,” Al-Aly says of Kennedy’s position on the condition during the hearing. “But I’m not naive. We will use this as leverage to push him in the right direction for Long Covid.”","summary":"During his confirmation hearings, the nominee for HHS secretary said he'd focus on chronic conditions like Long Covid — but if confirmed, would he really follow through?","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/rfk-jr-long-covid-anti-vax-hearing-1235251407/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rfk-jr-hearing-op-ed-long-covid.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 17:29:37","author":"Elisabeth Garber-Paul,Elizabeth Yuko","authors":["Elisabeth Garber-Paul","Elizabeth Yuko"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041},{"id":285433708,"title":"Blunt book excerpt lays out how Kamala Harris campaign lost the Joe Rogan interview","text":"An excerpt from a new book about the 2024 presidential election shed new light on how former Vice President Kamala Harris’ proposed interview with podcast giant Joe Rogan fell apart. \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for The White House,\" from authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, provided a play-by-play of negotiations between the Rogan and Harris camps to secure Harris’ appearance on the podcast. The dialogue proved fruitless and cost the ex-vice president’s campaign, especially as then-candidate Donald Trump secured a Rogan interview that went viral. \"Trump spent three hours with Rogan in an interview that instantly went viral. The contrast amounted to a ‘traumatic event,’ said one Harris aide, ‘that I will never forget.’\" ROGAN REFLECTS ON PODCAST INTERVIEW WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: 'GOT THIS ABILITY TO JUST KEEP GOING' Rogan confirmed in late October – just after publishing his sit-down with Trump – that he had been in negotiations with the Harris team for an interview, noting that talks had come to stand still because of Harris’ demands. At the time, he expressed that he was still open to a future interview, and relayed that the Harris camp hadn’t canceled either. Following the Trump’s election victory, Harris’ team suggested that the president’s interview was the factor that killed negotiations. \"We were hoping to fit it in around that but ultimately weren’t able to do it,\" Harris campaign senior advisor Stephanie Cutter said on \"Pod Save America.\" \"As it turns out, that was the day that Trump was taping his Joe Rogan [appearance], which they had never confirmed to us. We just kind of figured that out in the lead-up to it.\" Rogan went on to endorse then-candidate Trump on the eve of the election. The section from \"Fight\" shed more light on what happened, alleging that initial negotiations held between Harris deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty and Rogan’s reps were rocky. According to the book, Rogan sent them his list of interview conditions on Oct. 11, which included, \"no staff in the studio, no topic restrictions, and Harris would have to sign a waiver.\" Additionally, \"Harris would have to come to Austin, Texas,\" according to the Rogan team, though they signaled there was some slight leeway on this condition. JOE ROGAN TELLS TRUMP THE 'WILD S---' HE SAYS FUELED HIS POPULARITY DURING THREE HOUR PODCAST INTERVIEW The Harris campaign responded, saying that \"Harris would be happy to talk about social media censorship, weed, and other issues they thought would be of most interest to his listeners.\" However, Rogan disagreed. As the book said, \"Joe just wants to talk about the economy, the border, and abortion.\" Then the dispute over where Harris would meet Rogan ensued. Flaherty proposed an interview in Michigan, where the then-vice president would be on the campaign trail. \"No-go, the Rogan team said after reaching the host on a weeklong hunting trip. Austin or nothing,\" Parnes and Allen wrote. According to their book, \"Harris had less than zero reason to be in Texas,\" as \"she was in battleground-or-bust mode.\" \"Plus, a detour to Texas might smell like desperation to the press and a waste of money to donors,\" the authors also noted. Apparently, Harris campaign chief Jennifer O’Malley Dillon found a solution, telling Rogan’s team that Harris would travel \"to Houston for a rally—under the cover of visiting a state with one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws—to put her in proximity to Austin\" where she could go on the show. OVER 10 MILLION VIEWERS WATCHED FOX NEWS' INAUGURATION COVERAGE, CRUSHING ALL OTHER NETWORKS Harris flew to the state under the auspices of fighting for reproductive rights, though Allen and Parnes wrote, \"Only a few people knew the real reason: the whole Houston rally was built to put her in proximity to Rogan.\" Despite Harris making this concession, Rogan’s team had more demands that seemed to doom the meeting. When Flaherty mentioned Harris going to Rogan’s studio on Oct. 25, they dodged again. \"Wish we had known about this sooner, because he has the 25th blocked out as a personal day,\" the Rogan team said. When Flaherty countered with Saturday morning, the podcast host’s people replied, \"Only if it’s before 8:30 a.m.\" The excerpt appeared to suggest that message all but killed the talks between the two camps. The book alleged that shortly afterward, the Harris camp found out that Rogan spoke with Trump on his \"personal day.\" The work mentioned that Harris aides \"made a final stab, offering to let Rogan talk with the vice president in Washington, D.C.\" However, \"Rogan’s team balked, citing the Austin-only condition.\" Allen and Parnes quoted Flaherty telling Rogan’s people, \"You get one trip to Texas within three weeks of the election. You don’t get two.\" Reps for Harris' campaign did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Maxwell Prince and Martin Morazzo's horror anthology Ice Cream Man has long been one of Image's most consistently daring comics, but of late it's become clear that it's a truly great one, too – see issue #39 and #40's heart-wrenching two-part 'Decompression in a Wreck.' That story was both a dazzling exercise in exploring how time works in graphic storytelling and an agonising moment-by-moment breakdown of a car crashing into a lorry that spanned just five seconds in the lives (and deaths) of its characters. But while the book has always been chilling (er, pun sort of intended, I guess), it's also always been blackly comic too.\n\nThis week's Ice Cream Man #43 moves between both these tones and more on any given page. It's a special issue which breaks from tradition by bringing onboard writers other than Prince for the first time. And what writers! Yer actual Grant Morrison! Kelly Sue DeConnick, Patton Oswalt, Matt Fraction, and more. It's a starry selection, with the contributors each delivering a horror story over the course of a single page.\n\nThat feels like a very tight constraint. Realistically, how much story can you fit into a single page? The answer to that, it turns out, is: much more than you think. Over the course of 22 individual tales, the contributors play with time, space, and format in a way that's genuinely dazzling.\n\nSome stories can be read in the blink of an eye: Deniz Camp's dialogue-free 'Real Page Turner' and Grant Morrison's closing 'At Home With The Colonel' all do their thing in just a few panels. Others, however, force the reader to slow down and absorb every last detail. Geoff Johns' 'Lickety Split' uses a rigid 16-panel grid, ending with a methodically-paced punchline. Prince's 'Who's In Charge?' is a simple concept, but one that engages the reader in some fourth-wall-breaking fun with the book's titular host. Matt Fraction's 'Life By Misadventure' manages to tell five stories in the space of its single page before uniting them satisfactorily. There's even a full-page prose piece – a witty extrapolation of one of the original ultra-short stories: \"For sale: baby shoes, never worn.\"\n\nThen there's 'For James' by Zoe Thorogood. This tale – the only one in the book also illustrated by its writer – appears to directly address the death of her brother. It's a touching and heartfelt piece, but also a devastating one. Partial proceeds from sales of the issue will go to charity on James' behalf, and the entire issue is dedicated to him. A beautiful piece of work, it reminds you just how flexible the horror genre really is.\n\nWith 22 stories here there are, of course, a couple that don't quite land. 'Horror, Cont'd' is simply a reprint of the New York Times cover declaring Trump's victory over Kamala Harris with a caption. That is a very real nightmare, I agree, but it adds little to the issue. And occasionally a story will feel like the sort of goofy idea you find on the Bad Two Sentence Horror subreddit.

But guess what? I opposed the disastrous interventions in Egypt and Libya as well,” Cotton said during his opening statement.\n\nThe highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), also raised Gabbard’s “unconventional” viewpoints and said he had “significant concerns about [her] judgment.”\n\n“For example, you blamed NATO for Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Tulsi Gabbard faced the Senate Intelligence Committee as she seeks to be confirmed as President Donald Trump's director of national intelligence.She was among three of President Trump's nominees to face Senate questioning on Thursday, all of whom could face significant Democratic opposition. The others who went before Senate committees were secretary of Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Kash Patel, President Trump's pick to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigations.One thing both Gabbard and Kennedy have in common is that they are former Democratic Party candidates for president. Gabbard vied for the Democratic nomination in 2020, and Kennedy ran for president as a Democrat in 2024 before becoming an independent.RELATED STORY | Former congressman Lee Zeldin confirmed to lead Environmental Protection AgencyIn her testimony, she accused the intelligence community of being \"weaponized\" against political opponents. She claimed that she was among those targeted by the intelligence community after she said she was placed on a terror watch list within 24 hours of criticizing the nomination of 2024 Democratic Party presidential candidate Kamala Harris.The New York Times reported that intelligence officials briefly subjected her to special scrutiny on airline flights after she attended an event at the Vatican organized by a European businessman who appeared on an FBI watch list.\"President Trump’s reelection is a clear mandate from the American people to break this cycle of failure, end the weaponization/politicization of the intelligence community, and begin to restore trust in those who have been charged with the critical task of securing our nation,\" she said.Gabbard also vowed to \"assess the global threat environment\" after so-called failures, including the October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack, the takeover of Syria, and failures to identify the source of COVID-19.RELATED STORY | Trump administration rescinds memo on federal funding freeze for grants, loans\"I will assess the global threat environment and where gaps in our intelligence exist, integrate intelligence elements and increase information sharing, and ensure unbiased, apolitical, objective collection and analysis to support the president and policymakers’ decision-making,\" she said.But some Democrats have expressed concern that she does not have the requisite experience to lead national intelligence.

We trusted in the word that he promised, as Latinos. \nThis is crazy that starting next week, multiple cities will be hit by immigration. It is so crazy that multiple people are scared to go to work. Where I work at, a lot of Latinos did not go to work and that’s crazy because we have a living, too. \n\nI hate that I voted for him, now I am so scared for my family.\n\nWe need to come together and do something about this.\n\nTrump made two consistent promises during this past election: that he would deport everyone, and impose tariffs. If she really “trusted in the word that he promised,” SHE WOULD’VE VOTED FOR KAMALA HARRIS. In a previous post, I featured another Latino who was shocked that Trump was anti-Mexican, with several people insisting it was a joke or satire. It is not. These clueless people actually exist. \n\nWhat did they hear that made them believe Trump would protect the Latino community or immigrants? It was certainly nothing he said, and not any of his speeches. \n\nIn a follow-up post, the crying woman insisted, “It doesn’t matter who you voted for, they both was full of shit” because both-sides blah blah. She also said, “We’re supposed to be here for each other, support each other.” That’s great, but if she really meant that, she wouldn’t have voted for Trump, the literal opposite of “being here for each other.” \n\nNom nom nom. Eat up, leopards. \n\nNext up is Republican Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida, who suddenly wants Donald Trump to deport people—just not her people. \n\nAs you know, on Monday, January 20, President Trump ended the program formerly known as the “Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV).” Following up on this, yesterday’s guidance expands expedited removal against these populations. Since many of these individuals currently reside in Miami, there are open questions on how exactly this will be implemented.\nIndividuals must be afforded due process. I strongly urge you to ensure that all Cubans paroled in under the CHNV program eligible for or with pending applications for the Cuban Adjustment Act are protected from deportation until their cases are fully resolved. Additionally, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians who arrived under the CHNV program, have no criminal record, and have applied for asylum through the proper legal channels, should also be protected until their cases are fully resolved.”\n\nThe CHNV program began under former President Joe Biden, so it’s not surprising that Trump is targeting the immigrants protected by it. What is surprising is that one of Trump’s first actions effectively goes after the reliably Republican Cuban community. \n\nBut it’s not as if Trump didn’t warn his voters with some very clear words: “I don’t care about you I just care about your vote.” \n\nNom nom nom. \n\nNext up, this masterpiece of a headline: “Chair of Arab election campaign for Trump blasts president’s ‘wild’ call to relocate Palestinians.”\n\nWas there anything more self-defeating than the pro-Gaza community’s support for Trump, as they screamed about Genocide Joe and Killer Kamala? But this guy who was in charge of getting the Arab community to vote for Trump literally had the gall to say, “This is not what we voted for as Arab Americans for Trump.” \n\nGet ready to hear a lot more of “That’s not what we voted for!” from Trump-supporting Gaza activists. And every single time, it will be exactly what they voted for. Because for all of Trump’s faults and bluster, he was mostly truthful about his agenda, and he was never anything but hostile to the Palestinian cause. Meanwhile, his son-in-law Jared Kushner was fantasizing about beachside condos in Gaza as recently as last year. \n\nHarris would’ve been an honest broker in the conflict, while Trump will be happy to see Palestinians swept out of Gaza in favor of that sweet seaside real estate. There’s a reason right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did his part to help Trump get elected. \n\nI’m going to admit surprise at this next item. Check out this headline: “Oil Executives Fume as Trump Shakes Up Climate Rules Again.” \n\nThe 47th president’s political agenda is nothing if not oil and gas friendly. In fact, oil and gas are among Trump’s top priorities, and he has wasted no time in making life easier for the industry players after four years of extra regulatory and political pressure under Biden. Yet oil executives' apparent frustration with Trump’s reversal of Biden policies is unlikely and perhaps surprising on the surface.\nBelow this surface sits all the money that Big Oil invested in its own transition, under pressure, indeed, but quite a lot of money. The projects this money has been invested in may well become stranded assets now, in an ironic twist of environmentalists’ warnings that oil and gas fields are about to become stranded assets in a transitional world.\n\n“Big U.S. oil companies, however, believe the withdrawal only limits Washington's ability to influence an ongoing global energy transition and exposes them to an uneven regulatory environment, according to Reuters interviews with industry representatives,” Reuters reported. \n\nIn other words, the U.S.’s ability to impact the climate frameworks, and the energy industry’s ability to lobby for its own interests, are all gone now. The world can proceed without the U.S., and create regulatory frameworks that transnational corporations will have to abide by anyway. \n\nOh well. Maybe they shouldn’t have put all their eggs in the Republican basket. \n\nHow about one more scrumptious headline? \n\n\"’He's talking to the wrong people’: Gays For Trump Founder's Message to the President.”\n\nI can’t even. The leopards must be in a food coma.\n\nThank you to the Daily Kos community who continues to fight so hard with Daily Kos. Your reader support means everything.

The president\u0019s assault on open borders, DEI, gender ideology, climate change mandates, and all the rest is receiving support or shrugs from most Americans. There are no riots or even peaceful protests. Democrat leaders are largely holding their powder as Trump reverses much of the Biden administration\u0019s agenda \u0013 just as Biden spent the first weeks of his tenure unraveling many of Trump\u0019s initiatives.\n\nIn a normal world, this would hardly be worth noticing. Trump won. Elections have consequences. He is merely doing what voters wanted him to. It\u0019s how our democracy is supposed to work.\n\nBut things, of course, haven\u0019t been normal since Trump emerged on the scene in 2015. If his first term, marked by phony scandals and scurrilous personal attacks, hovered near the fourth circle of hell, his second promised to be closer to the ninth after his opponents managed to ratchet up their damning rhetoric against him during the 2024 campaign. You don\u0019t play nice with Hitler.\n\nRemarkably, that has not happened so far. Instead of the vitriol of personal invective, most Democrats have responded to Trump\u0019s aggressive efforts to dismantle Biden\u0019s policies merely with fierce criticism, which is their right and proper role as the opposition in our two-party system. It feels like a return to normalcy.\n\nIf a single moment encompasses this happy change, it was that most unlikely scene at Jimmy Carter\u0019s funeral on Jan. 9. There was former president Obama, who many saw as the Wizard in Biden\u0019s progressive Oz, chatting and laughing with Trump, like two old friends. The pair even seemed to throw shade at Kamala Harris, who pointedly ignored them when she took her seat.\n\nCan anybody explain this? No one can doubt that Obama is a true believer who fiercely opposes Trump\u0019s agenda. But there he was, treating the president like, well, a normal human being. Given all that has transpired, it was downright transformative, signaling a sharp break from the ugly past.\n\nIt is too soon to tell if we are returning to a form of partisan politics based on disagreement rather than demonization. It is way too early to write the obituary for Trump Derangement Syndrome. But we, the people, and Trump himself, should savor and cultivate this inkling of hope.\n\nUnfortunately, one corner of American society \u0013 the legacy media \u0013 is unpersuaded. Where Democrats seem aware that many of Trump\u0019s actions are broadly popular, and they are probably hoping he will undermine his power through overreach, the folks at MSNBC, NPR, AP, and all the rest have no such restraint. Their dispatches continue to paint Trump in the darkest colors. Instead of Trump the Triumphant, they are continuing to churn out narratives featuring Trump the Destroyer.\n\nPeter Baker of the New York Times, for example, described Trump\u0019s actions as the \u001cnorm-shattering, democracy-testing assertions of personal power that defy the courts, the Congress and the ethical lines that constrained past presidents.\u001d\n\nSusan Glasser asserted in the New Yorker that Trump \u001cloves to drown us in outrage. The overwhelming volume is the point \u0013 too many simultaneous scandals and the system is so overloaded that it breaks down. It can\u0019t focus. It can\u0019t fight back. The distractions are just too damn distracting.\u001d\n\nDuring her ABC News interview with Politico\u0019s John Harris, Martha Raddatz sympathetically remarked, \u001cYou said he has everything his supporters hoped for and everything his adversaries feared.\u001d\n\nSuch claims illuminate the legacy media\u0019s central role in ginning up our partisan divide. For years, they were at the center of efforts to portray Trump as not just beyond the pale but an existential threat to our democracy. It worked for a while. Then, not so much. Simply put, nobody who has read and believed their coverage of Trump could possibly have voted for the man. And yet, here he is embarking on a second term. Their scorched-earth coverage wasn\u0019t just rejected by half the country that voted for Trump, but by many of those who opposed him but now seeming willing to give him a chance.\n\nYes, we are a divided country, but not as viciously and uncompromisingly as we once were and as the legacy media still claims we are. Most Americans appear to have rejected their calls to the barricades, embracing an attitude of let\u0019s see what happens. As a result, their stories read like dispatches from people caught in a fever that has broken for much of the country.\n\nGiven our recent history, it is hard to know if this movement toward normalcy will last. What does seem certain is that the legacy media will not change; they seem determined to go down with the ship. They will continue to cast every action of the Trump administration as a violent assault on our moral standing.\n\nThe good thing about life is that as much as we are shaped by stories, by our ability to interpret and make sense of the world through a variety of narratives, there is an underlying dynamic that corrals this power: reality. Ultimately, Trump will be judged by the results of his efforts \u0013 indeed, their conclusion that his first term was much better than Biden\u0019s powered his against-all-odds reelection. Despite the best efforts of legacy media, the American people seem willing to let the president write his own story. Here\u0019s hoping it\u0019s triumphant.","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2025/01/30/trump_the_triumphant_vs_trump_the_destroyer_152281.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 12:37:41","author":"Peder Zane","authors":["Peder Zane"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":285416072,"title":"'Grievance and animus': CEO explains how 'status anxiety' motivates Trump’s base","text":"After Democratic nominee Kamala Harris narrowly lost the United States' 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump, many pundits argued that Trump did a better job appealing to Americans' \"economic anxiety.\" The U.S. enjoyed record-low unemployment rates under former President Joe Biden, but Trump hammered Biden and Harris relentlessly on inflation — and it worked. \n\nOn Election Night 2024, Trump won the popular vote by roughly 1.5 percent (according to the Cook Political Report).\n\nHowever, in an article published by the conservative website The Bulwark on January 30, Alan Elrod (CEO of the think tank the Pulaski Institution) emphasizes that Trump's victories in 2016 and 2024 go beyond appealing to voters' \"economic anxiety.\" Trump, according to Elrod, resonates with his \"base\" because of his ability to exploit \"status anxiety.\"\n\nREAD MORE: DC insider has a special message for federal workers\n\nElrod explains, \"Every Trump-supporting boat parade and each positive jobs report or new Dow record set during the hated Biden Administration served as a reminder that the 'economic anxiety' thesis leaves too much out of its analytic viewfinder — namely, the real motive roots of Trump's appeal, especially to those who actually live quite high on the hog…. More useful for understanding what motivates Trump's base would be a relative measure — one that could conceivably affect people in a variety of economic circumstances. The best starting point, as some observers have been arguing for years, is status anxiety.\"\n\nThe Pulaski Institution CEO continues, \"That's because while 'status' comprises a number of signs of economic success — homes, jobs, bank accounts — it goes beyond them to include important intangibles.

In order to pay for the cuts, they have started to eye some targets to raise money. Among them: cutting benefits for single mothers and poor people who rely on government health care.\n\nThe proposals are included in a menu of tax and spending cut options circulated this month by House Republicans. Whether or not Republicans enact any of the ideas remains to be seen. Some of the potential targets are popular tax breaks and cuts could be politically treacherous. And cutting taxes for the wealthy could risk damaging the populist image that Trump has cultivated.\n\nFor the ultrawealthy, the document floats eliminating the federal estate tax, at an estimated cost of $370 billion in revenue for the government over a decade. The tax, which charges a percentage of the value of a person’s fortune after they die, kicks in only for estates worth more than around $14 million.\n\nAmong those very few Americans who do get hit with the tax, nearly 30% of the tax is paid by the top 0.1% by income, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center think tank. (Many ultra-wealthy people already largely avoid the tax. Over the years, lawyers and accountants have devised ways to pass fortunes to heirs tax free, often by using complex trust structures, as ProPublica has previously reported.)\n\nAnother proposal aims to slash the top tax rate paid by corporations by almost a third.\n\nTrump promised such a cut during the campaign. But Vice President JD Vance came out against it before Trump picked him as his running mate. “We’re sort of in line with the OECD right now,” he said in an interview last year, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 38 wealthy developed nations. “I don’t think we need to be cutting the corporate tax rate further.”\n\nIn Trump’s first term, he brought the top corporate rate down from 35% to 21%, where it’s at now, taking the U.S. from a high rate compared to other OECD nations to about average. The proposed cut to 15% would make the United States’ rate among the lowest of such countries.\n\nTo pay for new tax cuts, the House Republicans’ proposal floats a series of potential overhauls of government programs. One major focus is possible cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for people with low incomes that is administered by the states. Medicaid expansion was a key tenet of the Affordable Care Act, passed under President Barack Obama. Many Republican governors initially chose not to take advantage of the new federal subsidies to expand the program. In the intervening years, several states reversed course, and the program has expanded the number of people enrolled in Medicaid by more than 20 million, as of last year.\n\nThe deep cuts to the program floated in the document include slashing reimbursements to the states. States would need to “raise new revenues or reduce Medicaid spending by eliminating coverage for some people, covering fewer services, and (or) cutting rates paid to physicians, hospitals, and nursing homes,” according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy organization.\n\nTrump has been inconsistent in his position on Medicaid over the years. He sought to slash the program in his first term. But he has also made statements about protecting it over the years.\n\nAs recently as a 2023 campaign event, Trump promised that “we’re not going to play around with Medicare, Medicaid.” But it’s not clear whether the comment was a throwaway: While preserving Medicare, the program that covers health care for the elderly, has been a focus for Trump, maintaining Medicaid has not. The official GOP platform rolled out by Trump last year, for example, promised not to cut “one penny” from Medicare but was silent on Medicaid. In separate remarks during the campaign last year, Trump appeared to endorse cuts to \"entitlements,\" after an interviewer asked about Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n\nOther proposals would eliminate tax breaks for families with children.\n\nCurrently, parents can get a tax credit of up to $2,100 for child care expenses. The House Republican plan floats the elimination of that break. The cut is estimated to save $55 billion over a decade.\n\nVance, in particular, had promised economic policies that would lessen the load on parents. “It is the task of our government to make it easier for young moms and dads to afford to have kids,” he said last week. (He campaigned on a proposal to more than double the child tax credit.)\n\nAnother proposal in the list of options takes aim squarely at parents raising children on their own. The provision would eliminate the “head of household” filing status to collect almost $200 billion more in taxes over a decade from single parents and other adults caring for dependents on their own.\n\nThe “head of household” status was created in the 1950s under the rationale that single parents should have a lighter tax burden. Eliminating it would affect millions of Americans, largely women. (The after-tax pay of people with incomes between the 20th and 80th percentiles, those making between about $14,000 and $100,000, would fall by the highest percentage, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.)\n\nDemocrats have criticized the proposals as a gift to the wealthy at the expense of the working class. “Republicans are gearing up for a class war against everyday families in America,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not respond to questions about the specifics in the House GOP document but said in an email that “This is an active negotiation and process one that the President and his team are working productively with congress. His visit to the House Retreat [Monday] was a sign that he wants to prioritize unity and a good deal for American that achieves his campaign promises.”\n\nA spokesperson for the House Budget Committee declined to answer specific questions but said “this is a menu of policy options for authorizing committees to consider as members navigate the reconciliation process.”\n\nSome of the proposals would fulfill Trump’s campaign promises geared toward the working class.\n\nThe document includes a plan to eliminate income taxes (but maintain payroll taxes) on tips, at a cost of $106 billion over a decade. The proposal is one Trump touted while campaigning in Las Vegas to win support from the city’s huge contingent of service workers. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, later pledged to do the same. Economists have criticized the idea as one that unfairly benefits one group of working-class employees over others who get paid the same but work in other industries that don’t deal in tips.\n\nAnother Trump campaign promise included in the document is ending taxes on overtime pay, at a price of $750 billion over a decade. That proposal has also been criticized by tax experts as an inefficient way to provide relief for lower-paid workers who are eligible for overtime because they’re paid hourly and perform repetitive tasks. The provision, critics say, would invite gaming and further complicate tax reporting by creating new reporting requirements about the hours a taxpayer worked.\n\nOne of the biggest-ticket proposals to raise new revenue in the House Republicans’ document would hit a tax break cherished by upper-income Americans: eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. The document estimates $1 trillion in savings over 10 years by eliminating the break. Because of a complex interplay of different features of the tax code, an estimated 60% of the value of this deduction flows to Americans making over $200,000 per year, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nEliminating the mortgage interest deduction would have an uneven geographic impact: analyseshave found the tax break is more valuable to Americans in Democratic-dominated states such as California, Massachusetts and New Jersey.","summary":"One of the hallmarks of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was a promise of sweeping tax cuts, for the rich, for working people and for companies alike.\n\nNow congressional Republicans have the job of figuring out which of those cuts to propose into law.

Following suit, Trump’s cabinet has basically created the White House’s own cinematic universe.\nOnly a few days after her confirmation, Kristi Noem, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security secretary, was filmed alongside ICE agents conducting an operation. “I’m here in New York City,” Noem told the camera in a vertical video wearing a bulletproof vest and a fresh blowout. “We’re getting these dirtbags off these streets.”\n\nThis is an edition of the WIRED Politics Lab newsletter. Read previous newsletters here.\n\nBack in December, I wrote that we should not only expect the government to continue its work with influencers, but to become influencers themselves. This week, it became clear that this is what the Trump administration has been planning to do with its cabinet leaders all along. They’re not just leading the government, they’re making content while doing it.\nLook at who Trump nominated for cabinet positions. Nearly across the board, these nominees have experience playing it up for the camera. Noem is a MAGA media veteran, often appearing on networks like Newsmax to discuss topics of the day. Linda McMahon, wife to former WWE CEO Vince McMahon, has gotten in the wrestling ring a time or two herself. Over the course of his presidential campaign, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. couldn’t get enough of the media, appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast and anywhere else that would have him. And of course, Pete Hegseth is a former Fox News host. On Tuesday, CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter wrote that these ICE raids were crafted with television and the internet in mind.\nBefore his first week in office, Trump had played casting director. Now, we’re getting the pilot episodes.\nStill, it’s not like all that much has changed in terms of digital infrastructure at these agencies. It might just be that the GOP is doing it better—and giving their audience what it wants. Even under the Biden administration, DHS and ICE organized ride-alongs with the media, especially with MAGA-friendly broadcasters like Fox News. The agencies would often post photos of enforcement officers cuffing alleged migrants on platforms like X as well. Most of the multimedia staffers are career employees with few slots for political appointees, according to a source familiar with DHS’s public affairs office.\nBut as Stelter wrote yesterday, the tone of the content is different. And that’s likely a result of the onscreen talent. You’re going to get an entirely different product when working with media veterans like Dr. Phil and Noem. The only Biden cabinet secretary that could rival those two was Pete Buttigieg.\nWhile all of this is happening, the Democrats are waiting to elect a new director before they can even think about casting. On Saturday, Democrats will be voting on their next party chair. There are nearly a dozen people running to fill the spot, but the election is mainly seen as a two-man race between Wisconsin party chair Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, a DNC vice chair.\nWikler, Martin, and many other candidates appeared on a virtual forum Tuesday night specifically focused on the DNC’s future in tech and media. For about an hour, they were asked how they would revamp the party’s data infrastructure and tackle new media. Many of them appeared anxious to take it on.\nWhen I first started covering this beat, Wikler was constantly pitched to me as an example of a Democratic party official who was doing digital the right way. I spoke with him in December, where he reinforced that Democrats needed to respond to the changing media environment quickly if they planned to win elections in the near future. On Tuesday night, Wikler went on to suggest that the DNC create its own innovation lab focused on keeping up with their opposition.\n“You need to build a culture of curiosity, innovation, experimentation, and iteration, knowing that many things won’t work,” Wikler said Tuesday night. “So you need to try even more things.”\nMartin wants to do something similar by building an “Information War Room” more focused on fighting misinformation.\n“That Information War Room will become the hub for better, ongoing, constant digital communications with real-time analytics and also with social listening, so we understand where the misinformation and disinformation is being pumped out, and as part of that, we need to recruit trusted messengers, influencers, creators, and their networks to communicate over the long haul,” Martin said.\nThat war room already exists on the right. The Trump campaign hosted influencers for special debate war rooms, and the same person who ran the Trump campaign’s war room has now been appointed “War Room Director” for the White House.\nFaiz Shakir, a former Bernie Sanders adviser and the executive director of More Perfect Union, is also running for DNC chair, and he sees things differently. Instead of simply partnering with creators, he envisions a DNC that acts as its own media network. “You don't just sprinkle fairy dust on a Mobilize link or YouTube link,” he said. “We should be raising money right now for the national Meals on Wheels Association, Head Start for America, just raise money for them and build engagement. Do actions on the ground with people, send videographers. This is what I'm doing right now at More Perfect Union.”\nOn Saturday, Democrats will choose who they want leading the party and taking on what will likely be a massive digital rebrand. During Tuesday’s forum, many of the candidates promised to move past the “boom and bust” periods of investing in digital and then stripping programs down to the bones between election cycles.\nBut it’s hard to imagine they’ll be able to keep up. Republicans have invested in this for years, and Trump has clearly brought it all to the White House. Plus, season two has just begun.\nThe Chatroom\nEarlier this week, Ryan Broderick, who writes the fantastic Garbage Day newsletter, posted about how difficult it’s been to keep up with all of the news coming out of the White House.

Zoomers, we were told, championed wokeness; they would “save us” from the rise of the alt-right and inequality; they were engaged, ready to disrupt old systems and oppressive regimes. But cracks have emerged in the image. \n\nThe popularity of misogynistic influencers like Andrew Tate, the rise “tradwife” movement among under-30s, and the growing evidence that young people admire right-wing figures show that Gen-Z’s politics are something more complicated. \n\nGiven this, it shouldn’t have come as a surprise that so many supposed Trump critics celebrated his bid to save TikTok last week. A Supreme Court ruling on 17 January mandated TikTok to sell to an American buyer or shut down in the US entirely. Two days later the app went offline. But, by the end of that same day it returned, crediting its salvation to Donald Trump and his executive order halting the ban. “As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the US!” read a notification pushed by the app to American users. The response was overwhelming: influencers – and not just conservative ones – rejoiced at TikTok coming back online, thanking Trump for this 11th-hour intervention. Many popular creators who were once vehemently anti-Trump – and who even campaigned for Kamala Harris – were sincerely celebrating his executive-order promise. \n\n“Now I’m rooting for Trump?” one of these popular influencers posted, “Make America fucking Great Again, I guess!”\n\nTrump was aware that saving TikTok would play well with the younger demographic. At the inauguration the same strategy was on display: among the tech billionaires and right-wing talking heads, some of the most prominent attendees were podcasters and YouTubers, such as the brothers Logan and Jake Paul – who are consistently cited as some of the most well-liked influencers among teenagers – in both US and worldwide surveys – and Theo Von, a middle-aged podcaster who hosted both Trump and Vice-President JD Vance on his show during the election campaign. This is a conscious attempt to court the youth’s favour.\n\nOf course, there are some who won’t be moved by such gestures. Within Gen-Z there are swathes who push back against right-wing ideas about gender, class and work. These young leftists won’t fall for the obvious appeals to their demographic, whether it is rubbing shoulders with podcasters or “saving” TikTok, even if they are pleased to see the app back on their home screens.\n\nBut these people do not speak for Gen-Z as a whole. This mosaic generation increasingly accommodates right-wing views, and Trump has been gaining influence with them since 2020. According to post-election analysis by Tufts University, nearly two thirds of young white men (aged 18 to 29) who voted in November 2024 chose Trump, along with almost half of young white women. The same proportion (49 per cent) of young Latino men also gave Trump significant support. Compared with 2020, Tufts claims, “young voters in 2024 were more likely to identify as conservative and as Republican”. And, the analysis concludes, “the young moderates who cast ballots were more likely to vote for Trump”.\n\nAnd this is resonating in popular culture. Writer Brock Colyar described this new type of conservatism in an Intelligencer profile titled “The cruel kids’ table”. “They are not disenfranchised or working class or anti-elite or many of the other adjectives used to describe Trump supporters since 2016. Rather, they are young, imposingly well connected, urban and very online.” One crisis consultant who works with conservative podcasters told Colyar: “Maga is MTV for Gen Z. This isn’t the fringe. This is youth pop culture.” The piece also noted that the conservative Power 30 awards honouring influencers who advocated for Trump during the election – “the event to be at if you were under the age of 30 and very online” – the night before the inauguration was sponsored by TikTok.\n\nIt seems we are not at the peak of this rightward shift. And while millennials and some parts of Gen-Z will still have strong memories of how his anti-establishment populist bent played out during Trump’s first presidency, we shouldn’t forget that a lot of Gen-Z were too young to seriously remember politics pre-pandemic. This group will be encountering Trump’s shtick as adults (or even engaged teenagers) for the first time, without any of the understanding that Trump’s promises have failed to deliver meaningful changes for their social and economic prospects.\n\nThe TikTok story isn’t over – Trump’s executive order has merely halted the sale for 75 days, at which point the company may no longer have to sell or may have to contend with further legal battles. But the reality is that Trump doesn’t even need this friendly airtime to gain favour among young Americans. They are already lining up to support the causes he has become a willing mascot for. “Saving” TikTok may be a moment where Trump does manage to capture the attention of a previously untapped audience, but it is more likely to be remembered as a moment when he was simply pushing through an open door.\n\n[See more: DeepSeek has exposed America’s AI fiction]\n\nListen to the New Statesman podcast","summary":"Even before the election, the young US cohort was already shifting right.","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/society-international-politics/2025/01/trump-doesnt-need-tiktok-to-win-with-gen-z","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/01/29/GettyImages-2182296773.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 11:33:00","author":"Sarah Manavis","authors":["Sarah Manavis"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":285392252,"title":"Kash Patel’s attachment to Donald Trump is embarrassing. But it’s paying off.","text":"Throughout history, writers have tried to boil down the aura of presidential administrations by lavishing them with names. David Halberstam (somewhat sardonically) deemed President John F. Kennedy’s administration “the Best and the Brightest.” Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin noted Abraham Lincoln’s administration comprised a “Team of Rivals.” So what, then, to call President Donald Trump’s gaggle of nominees during his second term? “A Band of Bootlickers”? A “Squad of Suck-Ups”? A “Coterie of Simps”? Trump’s nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, is evidence that regardless of experience or judgment, a Trump loyalist can simply ride a wave of sycophancy into a cherished slot in the new administration. In the past, top posts were given to accomplished people who used their earned gravitas to work on behalf of the president. Now, unashamed love is the only qualification necessary, leading to a parade of laughingstocks’ being dragged before Congress. Amid a wave of ridiculous nominations, Patel’s nod to lead the FBI might be the most preposterous. Near the end of Trump’s first term, armed only with a singular devotion to Trump, Patel began his ascendance from the ranks of midlevel legal associate to a nomination to lead the nation’s most powerful legal entity. Former Attorney General William Barr wrote in his book that Patel “had virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world’s preeminent law enforcement agency,” saying Patel would join the leadership team at the FBI “over my dead body.” (Someone quickly check Barr’s pulse.) Yet Patel’s loyalty to Trump is unshakable and thus the only thing that matters. Since Trump’s unwilling exit from office in 2021, Patel has made himself the central cast member in virtually every one of the former president’s dramas, from pushing the claim the investigation into whether Russia tried to influence the results of the 2016 presidential election was a “hoax” (it wasn’t) to saying he personally saw Trump declassify documents he took with him to Mar-a-Lago (he didn’t). Patel is a steadfast supporter of the now-pardoned Jan. 6 rioters, believing the whole incident was provoked by undercover FBI agents (whom he would oversee as the agency’s director). He produced a song featuring the J6 rioters singing “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which Trump frequently played at his rallies, promising to support the rioters’ legal fees with proceeds from the song. Patel even authored a trilogy of children’s books called “The Plot Against the King,” which explains how “King Donald” had to be saved from the dastardly deeds of “Hillary Queenton,” who believed the king ascended to the throne through subterfuge. Naturally, King Donald is rescued by Kash, the wizard, who is known throughout the kingdom as the “Distinguished Discoverer.” Patel’s books are so explicitly amorous of Trump that they should be sold on newsstands encased in a brown paper wrapper. Clearly, Kash has a fever, and the only prescription is more Donald. But Patel’s unbridled bootlicking isn’t just a harmless personality quirk; it could significantly affect how he manages the most powerful law enforcement department on the planet. For one, Patel has frequently been dishonest about his past government roles; he claims to have been the lead prosecutor against individuals who attacked a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, but in fact, he wasn’t even part of the team that conducted those prosecutions. But even worse is Patel’s suggestion he will use the FBI to prosecute those on his “enemies list,” comprised of all manners of individuals who were mean to Donald Trump. In his book 2023, “Government Gangsters,” Patel lists 60 people he calls “Members of the Executive Branch Deep State,” a sizable chunk of whom Trump himself appointed during his first term. Among those on the list include Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, William Barr, Merrick Garland, Alyssa Farah (“The View” co-host and former Trump communications staffer), Sarah Isgur Flores (former Justice Department communications director) and Cassidy Hutchinson (former aide to onetime Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows). Patel has said he regrets leaving off people like now-U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican former House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as the “entire fake news mafia press corps.” So while Trump spent much of his campaign complaining about so-called political prosecutions, his aspiring FBI director may very well engage in just those types of investigations. Further, Patel has indicated he will use the power of the American legal system to mandate his level of sycophancy throughout the government. He won’t stop until the federal government is an orgy of obeisance to Donald Trump. “We’ve got to put in all-American patriots top to bottom,” Patel told Steve Bannon on his podcast. He added that the Justice Department under Trump “will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media.” Perhaps Patel will have the last laugh in all this, as he has tried to monetize his rise in name identification since his Trump embrace. He can be found selling “the official K$h wine!” and “JUSTICE FOR ALL #J6PC” T-shirts and Kash Krew golf shirts, all once available at his website. He can be found on Trump’s Truth Social website pushing drugs that claim to “reverse” the effects of the Covid-19 vaccines. So maybe in his world, he sees Trump as the mark. But the most likely scenario is one we have seen over and over; as soon as any Trump appointee with a modicum of character breaks with the president, Trump will trash them (often in racist ways), tarnishing their name to MAGA world. Perhaps if Kamala Harris remains free from prison, this is the life of disrepute that awaits Patel. But if it is, he can look at the bright side; there are undoubtedly still dozens of crates of K$h Wine available to help him dull the pain.","summary":"Kash Patel has a thin resume, but he has indicated he’d use the power of the federal government to attack President Donald Trump's perceived \"enemies.\"","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kash-patels-fbi-director-trump-confirmation-hearing-rcna189680","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250128-kash-patel-ch-1554-b596c2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 11:00:41","author":"Christian Schneider","authors":["Christian Schneider"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.066},{"id":285301168,"title":"More than half of women don't like Trump this time around, poll finds","text":"Hello and happy Thursday. The whirlwind continues. On Wednesday, the White House further backed away from its sweeping and potentially devastating freeze on federal funding for just about everything, rescinding a Monday memo that lead to a Tuesday court injunction after dozens of states sued. Are you lost yet? But also, just after rescinding that memo, the White House said it wasn't really stopping the freeze, just maybe trying to sidle around the court's injunction. “This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court’s injunction. The President’s EO’s on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented,” Karoline Leavitt, the new White House press secretary, said on formerly-Twitter. Which is basically, \"We're going to do it, just not tell you we're doing it, even though we did tell you, but now we've untold you — so you can't stop us.\" To which courts replied, \"That's not how that works,\" and put a restraining order on the whole mess. So here we are, 10 days in, with a president who apparently really wants to save a few dollars by slashing Meals on Wheels, domestic violence shelters, low-cost childcare and maybe even Medicaid. That doesn't even touch on his other actions, including: An internment camp for undocumented folks at Guantanamo Bay, which Trump announced WednesdayThe signing of the Laken Riley Act, also Wednesday, which allows undocumented people to be detained for simply being charged — not convicted — of crimes such as shoplifting The first day of confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where Sen. Bernie Sanders pointed out that if Kennedy is no longer anti-vax, maybe his old organization should stop selling anti-vax onesies for $26 a pop Elon Musk storming into the Office of Personnel Management (basically HR for the government) and seemingly taking over, and, Twitter-style, attempting to get rid of a large chunk of employees. Remind me what office we elected him to?Two executive orders restricting rights and care for transgender people, one trying to end gender-affirming care for minors and one banning transgender people from openly serving in the military And literally, before I could finish typing this, another order demanding \"patriotic education\" in public schools, and seeking to wipe civil rights from our history books by banning \"discriminatory equity ideology\" I have my opinions on all this, and you have yours. But what does America think? Unsurprisingly, Republicans are loving this stuff, and Democrats are hating it. In a new survey of the president's first few days in office, a Quinnipiac University Poll found that 85% of Republicans approve of the way Trump is handling things, while 86% of Democrats do not. Anyone who thinks there is a middle ground left in America is delusional. But I have to wonder if that split hasn't seeped into our households more than we think. The political division Quinnipiac found didn't interest me as much as the gender divide. Women do not like Trump. They do not like him in a house. They do not like him with a mouse, even one blended up by RFK Jr. The poll found that the majority of women — across party lines — don't approve of Trump or that litany of actions. While 55% of male registered voters (across parties) said they approve of the way Trump is handling his job, 53% of female registered voters do not. That same tilt was found when men and women were asked if their opinion of Trump was favorable or unfavorable. There, 57% of men held a favorable view, while 55% percent of women held an unfavorable impression of him. Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy told me there was a similar gender split during Trump's first term. But still, enough women — especially young women — voted for Trump to put him back in office. In fact, women supported Biden in 2020 more than they did Kamala Harris in 2024. An analysis of voting data from Navigator Research found \"women voted for Harris by 6 points (51% Harris to 45% Trump), a 4-point swing from 2020, when Biden won these voters by 10 points.\" Which — although Trump can't (yet) legally run for a third term — means women's votes do matter. Since Democrats seem entirely incapable of messaging anything coherent to voters these days, the political future of America is largely left not to whom they can pull away from Republicans, but whom Republicans alienate so badly that there's no going back. Which brings us back to that laundry list of Trump policies. Malloy, the analyst, said that those policies may be hurting Trump when it comes to women's opinions — because a lot of them hit on issues of family. For example, 55% of women Quinnipiac talked to disapprove of how Trump is handling immigration (57% of men approved). The J6 pardons? A full 67% of women disapproved. On birthright citizenship, 65% of women said we should keep it. Birthright citizenship in particular, Malloy said, \"has great resonance with women.\" And if women dislike Trump, they like even less some of the other men he's surrounding himself with. Take Mr. Musk. \"Elon Musk is deeply unpopular with women,\" Malloy said. Tell it to his baby mamas. When it comes to the tech titan turned government slayer, 64% of women in the poll didn't approve of him playing such a prominent role in the White House. \"Nobody else has gotten that low in number,\" Malloy said. \"Well, we haven't done all the Cabinet members yet, but that's a bad number.\" Trump has come into office doing exactly what he's promised to do, which has made his party, and apparently the majority of male voters, happy. But for women wondering if their elderly parent will be able to go to the doctor this month, or if their Head Start program is about to close, that bright, shiny object is looking a bit tarnished. Democrats spent a lot of time during the election cycle worrying about men, the young in particular, and if they were meeting their expectations. Now, it seems as if Democrats might want to start speaking to women. Because disrupters may seem great when they're crushing things you don't like, but it's entirely different when they take a club to things you need.

What changed?","text":"For decades, I could count on my native Orange County to act against immigrants, legal and not, as regularly as the swallows returned to Capistrano. It was like a civic version of the Broadway classic “Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better),” except not as clever and with more xenophobia. Cue the lowlight reel! In a 1986 article in Time magazine, Newport Beach resident Harold Ezell, then director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service’s Western region, criticized immigrants who use fraudulent papers. “If you catch ‘em, you ought to clean ‘em and fry ‘em yourself,\" he said.Republicans illegally posted uniformed security guards outside voting booths in Santa Ana in 1988 with signs stating noncitizens couldn’t vote.A group of residents — including Ezell — drafted Proposition 187, the 1994 California ballot measure that sought to make life miserable for \"illegal aliens\" and their children. After downing margaritas at El Torito, they named the initiative “Save Our State.\"In 1996, the Anaheim City Council allowed immigration authorities to screen the legal status of detainees in the city jail — the first program of its kind in California.Three years later, Anaheim Union High School District trustees passed a resolution to sue Mexico for $50 million for the cost of educating people like me, who were the children of unauthorized immigrants. Long before it became a GOP tradition, local Republican candidates and politicians took trips to the border to boast about how tough they were on the “invasion.”In 2005, Mission Viejo grandfather Jim Gilchrist created the Minuteman Project, which enlisted suburbanites to help the Border Patrol find migrants who illegally crossed into this country. That same year, Costa Mesa Mayor Allan Mansoor tried to get police officers to enforce federal immigration laws, which would have been a first in the nation.From theorizing about how to repeal birthright citizenship to suing California over its \"sanctuary\" state law and allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees in city and county jails, Orange County has shown the rest of the country how to be as punitive as possible toward the undocumented. With Donald Trump in the White House again, this Know Nothing legacy has its most powerful acolyte ever. If you’re against mass deportations and want to see some sort of amnesty, it’s easy to feel deflated and even easier to curse Orange County for its past. I’ve been doing the latter for nearly all of my adult life — first as a college activist, then as a columnist. It’s a subject I wish I could leave but — to paraphrase Michael Corleone — it keeps pulling me back in. Because I’ve covered Orange County for a quarter-century, though, I haven’t lost all hope. I know the result of O.C.’s scorched-earth campaigns against illegal immigration: initially shoving the national conversation rightward, but eventually, repeatedly, becoming the political equivalent of an exploding cigar. Though Proposition 187 passed, it famously made my generation of California Latinos vote Democratic for decades and permanently kneecapped the O.C. GOP. The local anger over the ballot initiative led to Loretta Sanchez’s historic 1996 win over incumbent Rep. Bob Dornan, as she became the first O.C. Latino elected to Congress. Her victory was so stunning that a House subcommittee investigated Dornan’s claims that immigrants illegally voted in the election and swung it for Sanchez (they didn’t). The Minuteman Project? It quickly fizzled out. John Eastman, the former dean of Chapman's law school who sparked Trump's interest in banning birthright citizenship with a cockamamie 2020 article claiming Kamala Harris wasn’t a “natural born citizen”? He faces disbarment for pushing Trump’s unfounded claims that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election. Costa Mesa? It now has a progressive, Latino-majority City Council that has loudly distanced itself from Mansoor’s actions. As the years went on, trashing immigrants for political gain in Orange County just wasn’t as popular or effective as before. Trump, despite his noxious rhetoric over three presidential campaigns, never won the county. A UC Irvine School of Social Ecology poll released this month showed that 28% of O.C. residents thought immigration was a “top problem” locally — compare that with a 1993 Times poll putting that number at 80%. Meanwhile, the UC Irvine poll found that 58% of people in O.C. favored some type of legal status for immigrants who have none, while 35% preferred deportation. This ain’t John Wayne’s Orange County anymore. Hell, it’s not mine. What changed? Demographics, for one. In 1990, as anger against illegal immigration was beginning to rage in Southern California, whites were 65% of the county. Fourteen years later, U.S. census figures showed they had become a minority in O.C. The latest stats put whites at just 37%. Nearly a third of residents are foreign-born, with immigrants living all across the county and occupying all rungs of the social ladder. It’s harder to trash them when they’re your neighbors, your children's friends, your in-laws or your co-workers, you know? Those changing demographics also led to the political purpling of the county. Few O.C. politicians outside of Huntington Beach's MAGA City Council have publicly praised Trump’s promises to clamp down on immigration. Even O.C. Sheriff Don Barnes — who’s about as liberal as a Winchester rifle and who has drastically increased the number of jail inmates his department turned over to immigration authorities — put out a news release this week asserting that his deputies \"remain focused on the enforcement of state and local laws,\" rather than joining Trump's deportation posse. Most of all, it's the activists who have had enough of the old Orange County. There’s always been pushback against anti-immigrant lunacy here. When I was a sophomore at Anaheim High, thousands of high school students walked out of class to protest Proposition 187. In 2006, there was a huge rally in Santa Ana — along with other marches in the rest of the country — to protest a congressional bill that would have made Proposition 187 seem as friendly as President Reagan’s amnesty. But most of those efforts were haphazard, devolved into infighting among Chicanosauruses and didn't develop into a full-fledged movement. Over the last 15 years, activists who grew up here — and not just Latinos — have organized rallies, staged sit-ins and formed nonprofits or community-based groups that coalesced into a multifront network standing up for people without papers. They campaigned to kick ICE out of local jails, aided various lawsuits seeking to change local policies and even helped pro-immigrant candidates populate school boards and city councils. If such a loud, successful resistance can happen in Orange County, it can happen anywhere. It’s not easy, but it’s possible — nay, necessary. One of the people fighting the good fight is Santa Ana native Sandra De Anda. She's a network coordinator for Orange County Rapid Response Network, which connects immigrants to legal help and runs a hotline to report ICE sightings. The 31-year-old grew up on Minnie Street in a historically Cambodian and Latino neighborhood where migra detained residents “all the time.\" When she returned to her hometown from Portland, Ore., in 2017, De Anda began to volunteer for pro-immigrant groups “and never looked back.” She’s proud of how far Orange County has come and is more committed than ever to her cause. Friends and family worry for her safety, but De Anda remains undeterred. “There’s such a nasty conservative tradition here, but our folks have still been here just as long,” she told me in a matter-of-fact tone after a long day of work. “We deserve to stay here. We’re going to have to fight together through any means necessary for the next four years.\"","summary":"If you’re against mass deportations and want to see some sort of amnesty, it’s easy to feel deflated right now and even easier to curse Orange County for its past.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-30/orange-county-anti-immigrant-history","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e4b54f5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1689x887+0+196/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5e%2F5f%2F4adb42c4439cab07c397990821bb%2Fharold-ezell.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 11:00:02","author":"Gustavo Arellano","authors":["Gustavo Arellano"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":285340766,"title":"Country-Club Etiquette Adjustments for Gen Z","text":"Skip to main content\n\nBooks & Culture\nFiction & Poetry\nHumor & Cartoons\n\nPuzzles & Games\n\nOpen Navigation Menu\n\nShouts & Murmurs\nCountry-Club Etiquette Adjustments for Gen Z\n\nBy Sarah SolomonJanuary 30, 2025\n\nSave this storySave this story\n\nSave this storySave this story\n\nMore Humor and Cartoons\n\nGrammar tips from a thirty-eighty-year-old with an English degree.\n\nTen types of neighbors you may encounter in an apartment complex.\n\nPlots of eighties movies had the protagonists been people of color.\n\nJobs you can add to your résumé as a single person.\n\nLearn to appreciate the small things.\n\nWhat I imagine strangers think about me when I read a book in public.\n\nEnter the Cartoon Caption Contest for a chance to appear in the magazine.\nFollow @newyorkercartoons on Instagram and sign up for the Daily Humor newsletter for more funny stuff.\n\nSarah Solomon is the author and illustrator of “Guac Is Extra but So Am I: The Reluctant Adult’s Handbook.” She has contributed humor to The New Yorker since 2018.\n\nA Reporter at Large\nHow Religious Schools Became a Billion-Dollar Drain on Public Education\n\nA nationwide movement has funnelled taxpayer money to private institutions, eroding the separation between church and state.\n\nBy Alec MacGillis\n\n“The St. Alwynn Girls at Sea”\n\nThe best thing about liking a boy was that it filled in all your time.

In order to pay for the cuts, they have started to eye some targets to raise money. Among them: cutting benefits for single mothers and poor people who rely on government health care.\n\nThe proposals are included in a menu of tax and spending cut options circulated this month by House Republicans. Whether or not Republicans enact any of the ideas remains to be seen. Some of the potential targets are popular tax breaks and cuts could be politically treacherous. And cutting taxes for the wealthy could risk damaging the populist image that Trump has cultivated.\n\nFor the ultrawealthy, the document floats eliminating the federal estate tax, at an estimated cost of $370 billion in revenue for the government over a decade. The tax, which charges a percentage of the value of a person’s fortune after they die, kicks in only for estates worth more than around $14 million.\n\nAmong those very few Americans who do get hit with the tax, nearly 30% of the tax is paid by the top 0.1% by income, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center think tank. (Many ultra-wealthy people already largely avoid the tax. Over the years, lawyers and accountants have devised ways to pass fortunes to heirs tax free, often by using complex trust structures, as ProPublica has previously reported.)\n\nAnother proposal aims to slash the top tax rate paid by corporations by almost a third.\n\nTrump promised such a cut during the campaign. But Vice President JD Vance came out against it before Trump picked him as his running mate. “We’re sort of in line with the OECD right now,” he said in an interview last year, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 38 wealthy developed nations. “I don’t think we need to be cutting the corporate tax rate further.”\n\nIn Trump’s first term, he brought the top corporate rate down from 35% to 21%, where it’s at now, taking the U.S. from a high rate compared to other OECD nations to about average. The proposed cut to 15% would make the United States’ rate among the lowest of such countries.\n\nTo pay for new tax cuts, the House Republicans’ proposal floats a series of potential overhauls of government programs. One major focus is possible cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for people with low incomes that is administered by the states. Medicaid expansion was a key tenet of the Affordable Care Act, passed under President Barack Obama. Many Republican governors initially chose not to take advantage of the new federal subsidies to expand the program. In the intervening years, several states reversed course, and the program has expanded the number of people enrolled in Medicaid by more than 20 million, as of last year.\n\nThe deep cuts to the program floated in the document include slashing reimbursements to the states. States would need to “raise new revenues or reduce Medicaid spending by eliminating coverage for some people, covering fewer services, and (or) cutting rates paid to physicians, hospitals, and nursing homes,” according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy organization.\n\nTrump has been inconsistent in his position on Medicaid over the years. He sought to slash the program in his first term. But he has also made statements about protecting it over the years.\n\nAs recently as a 2023 campaign event, Trump promised that “we’re not going to play around with Medicare, Medicaid.” But it’s not clear whether the comment was a throwaway: While preserving Medicare, the program that covers health care for the elderly, has been a focus for Trump, maintaining Medicaid has not. The official GOP platform rolled out by Trump last year, for example, promised not to cut “one penny” from Medicare but was silent on Medicaid. In separate remarks during the campaign last year, Trump appeared to endorse cuts to \"entitlements,\" after an interviewer asked about Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n\nOther proposals would eliminate tax breaks for families with children.\n\nCurrently, parents can get a tax credit of up to $2,100 for child care expenses. The House Republican plan floats the elimination of that break. The cut is estimated to save $55 billion over a decade.\n\nVance, in particular, had promised economic policies that would lessen the load on parents. “It is the task of our government to make it easier for young moms and dads to afford to have kids,” he said last week. (He campaigned on a proposal to more than double the child tax credit.)\n\nAnother proposal in the list of options takes aim squarely at parents raising children on their own. The provision would eliminate the “head of household” filing status to collect almost $200 billion more in taxes over a decade from single parents and other adults caring for dependents on their own.\n\nThe “head of household” status was created in the 1950s under the rationale that single parents should have a lighter tax burden. Eliminating it would affect millions of Americans, largely women. (The after-tax pay of people with incomes between the 20th and 80th percentiles, those making between about $14,000 and $100,000, would fall by the highest percentage, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.)\n\nDemocrats have criticized the proposals as a gift to the wealthy at the expense of the working class. “Republicans are gearing up for a class war against everyday families in America,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not respond to questions about the specifics in the House GOP document but said in an email that “This is an active negotiation and process one that the President and his team are working productively with congress. His visit to the House Retreat [Monday] was a sign that he wants to prioritize unity and a good deal for American that achieves his campaign promises.”\n\nA spokesperson for the House Budget Committee declined to answer specific questions but said “this is a menu of policy options for authorizing committees to consider as members navigate the reconciliation process.”\n\nSome of the proposals would fulfill Trump’s campaign promises geared toward the working class.\n\nThe document includes a plan to eliminate income taxes (but maintain payroll taxes) on tips, at a cost of $106 billion over a decade. The proposal is one Trump touted while campaigning in Las Vegas to win support from the city’s huge contingent of service workers. Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, later pledged to do the same. Economists have criticized the idea as one that unfairly benefits one group of working-class employees over others who get paid the same but work in other industries that don’t deal in tips.\n\nAnother Trump campaign promise included in the document is ending taxes on overtime pay, at a price of $750 billion over a decade. That proposal has also been criticized by tax experts as an inefficient way to provide relief for lower-paid workers who are eligible for overtime because they’re paid hourly and perform repetitive tasks. The provision, critics say, would invite gaming and further complicate tax reporting by creating new reporting requirements about the hours a taxpayer worked.\n\nOne of the biggest-ticket proposals to raise new revenue in the House Republicans’ document would hit a tax break cherished by upper-income Americans: eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. The document estimates $1 trillion in savings over 10 years by eliminating the break. Because of a complex interplay of different features of the tax code, an estimated 60% of the value of this deduction flows to Americans making over $200,000 per year, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nEliminating the mortgage interest deduction would have an uneven geographic impact: analyses have found the tax break is more valuable to Americans in Democratic-dominated states such as California, Massachusetts and New Jersey.","summary":"by Robert Faturechi and Justin Elliott                \n\n\n                                             \n\n                                                                    \n            \n                ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

The Trump administration’s move to allow federal tax dollars to be directed to school choice could supercharge the movement.\n\nBut public school advocates and public school teachers’ unions have long been against redirecting taxpayer dollars from public schools to private schools, saying it would harm poorer public schools. Districts have already been dealing with budget shortfalls, in addition to a dramatic reduction in the public school population, which is often a factor in determining how much funding a school district will receive. Public school advocates believe eventually school choice will mean the end of public schools and an increase in education inequity.\n\nAs CNN has reported, some of Trump’s education proposals — like eliminating the Department of Education and slashing federal funding for public schools — could hit areas that voted for him the hardest. A CNN analysis found that all of the 15 states that relied most heavily on federal support for their public schools in 2022 voted for Trump, while all but two of the 15 states that received the least federal dollars as a percentage of their overall revenue voted for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut one source with a teachers’ union expressed some skepticism on the overall impact this order would have, pointing to how unpopular school choice has been with some voters who have rejected these policies on a state level.\n\nThe additional school-related executive order is about protecting parental rights and ending discrimination.\n\nIt calls for government agencies to come up with a plan to end funding “for illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.”\n\nCombating antisemitism\n\nTrump is also calling on the federal government to cancel student visas for what he called “Hamas sympathizers” on college campuses, according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nHe later signed an executive order calling on government agencies to submit a report within 60 days to identify civil and criminal authorities to combat antisemitism and “containing an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump railed against pro-Palestinian student protests, which broke out in response to Israel’s military response in Gaza after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nThe Republican National Convention’s 2024 platform pledged to “Deport Pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again,” sparking uncertainty about the future among international students.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The dynamic, as five people in or close to the administration explained it to NBC News, reflects the trust that the term-limited Trump has in Vance, his 40-year-old understudy who is widely expected to run for president himself in 2028. All but two of the first 11 senior staffers Vance hired as vice president worked on his 2022 campaign for the Senate in Ohio, in his Senate office after he won that race or both. “The Trump team is an A-team in every sense of the word,” Jai Chabria, Vance’s longest-serving political adviser, said in an interview. “They had every opportunity to push people around or shove people around. They didn’t. They decided to build a team with JD’s team ... and in the process, they got a loyal bunch that’s ready to go through the wall for the president.” Jacob Reses, who was Vance’s chief of staff in the Senate, now holds that position in the vice president’s office. Bryan Gray, who held senior roles on Vance’s Senate campaign and staff, is in place as Reses’ deputy. Vance also installed his long-running communications team of William Martin, Luke Schroeder and Taylor Van Kirk in similar positions in his new office. Other Vance veterans who have followed him from his 2022 campaign or his Senate office include national security adviser Andy Baker, domestic policy director Ben Moss, operations director Abby Delahoyde and Patrick McAllister, his longtime personal aide. “I think that’s something that says a lot about JD and the people who work with JD,” said a Republican strategist who has worked closely with Trump and Vance and was granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. “It’s unique to have someone who retains staff the way JD has retained staff the last few years. I think JD at his core is a loyal guy, and that’s a lot of it. But he also has a very talented staff.” Also on staff are former Federal Election Commission Chair Sean Cooksey, as counsel to Vance, and Shannon Fisher, a former Republican National Committee aide who will be second lady Usha Vance’s chief of staff after having assisted her during the presidential campaign. Buckley Carlson, announced this week as Vance’s deputy press secretary, has no history with him. His father, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, is a Vance ally who pushed for Trump to select him as his running mate last summer. Vance’s core trio of political strategists — Chabria, Andy Surabian and Luke Thompson — are not on the vice presidential payroll, but they remain close as outside advisers. All three are expected to be key players in any moves Vance might make toward his own White House bid. Surabian, a senior adviser to Donald Trump Jr., one of Vance’s leading advocates for the vice presidency, has long been close to Trump world and was the chief strategist on the vice presidential campaign. Trump and Vance also have shared a pollster, Tony Fabrizio, who remains close to both. Meanwhile, Vance also has a key ally on Trump’s staff. James Braid, who was a deputy chief of staff in his Senate office, directs the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. “Vice President Vance has assembled a top notch team that works seamlessly with President Trump’s team, and that’s why the Administration has already been so successful,” White House communications director Steven Cheung wrote in a statement to NBC News. “There is complete synergy and trust on all levels.” Past presidents and their staffs have a history of micromanaging or undermining vice presidents and theirs. Former President Joe Biden’s advisers, for example, kept away some of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ longtime allies. Trump’s first term featured tensions with then-Vice President Mike Pence, who, unlike Vance, had no previous relationship with Trump. Pence brought aides with him from Indiana, where he had been governor, but he also made efforts to cultivate Trump advisers like Corey Lewandowski. Pence’s 2019 hiring of Katie Waldman, who soon afterward married Trump aide Stephen Miller, was viewed partly as a “strategic decision” to grow closer with Miller, a former Pence aide recalled. “It was a sign of good faith, and there was access there,” said the former aide, who was granted anonymity to share candid observations. “But that comes with its risks: that the Trump people could also learn what we were doing.” Trump and Pence had an irreconcilable split on Jan. 6, 2021, after Pence refused to interfere with the certification of Trump’s re-election loss to Biden. Rioters, egged on by Trump, chanted “Hang Mike Pence” as they stormed the Capitol. From the start, Trump’s relationship with Vance has been stronger than what he had with Pence. They have been close since the 2022 Senate race, which Vance won with Trump’s endorsement, and they bonded further in 2023 during Trump’s visit to the site of a toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. The fact that Vance was able to choose his staff, rather than have one chosen for him, “1,000%” illustrates that Trump and his team see no need to meddle in the vice president’s office, said the political strategist who has worked closely with both men. “I think a lot of that has to do with some of the interlocking relationships between both sides,” this person said. “The fact that JD and senior people around JD also had relationships with Team Trump and that JD himself built a relationship with Trump and the people around Trump — I think that allowed for them to have that type of trust in JD’s team.” The no-meddling approach dates to last year’s presidential campaign, which was an audition of sorts for Vance aides. Trump’s team was responsible for only one hire on the vice presidential campaign staff: director of operations Nick Luna, whose role was announced before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. Vance otherwise had wide latitude to bring along his own people, including Reses, Martin, Schroeder and Van Kirk. With Surabian at the helm, Chabria and Thompson also frequently traveled with Vance and dialed in for strategy sessions. Chabria directed Vance’s debate preparations, which Trump’s team made no effort to micromanage. Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, participated at the Vance team’s invitation, not at the Trump team’s insistence, two sources familiar with the effort said. The harmony surprised Chabria, who said he had researched past vice presidential campaigns to prepare himself for any tension points that might arise between the blended Trump and Vance staffs. “The fact that the senior staff had the trust in us — it was unbelievable to me, because I don’t know that any other campaign would have afforded that,” Chabria said. The former Pence aide observed that the relationships Vance’s team enjoys with Trump’s “are much deeper” than what Pence and Trump had at the start of their term. Vance, this person noted, also is operating on a different timeline with regard to his own political future, meaning strategists like Surabian have “way more value” outside the administration. Chabria, Surabian and other Vance advisers, for example, are already exercising their political muscles by assisting in Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy’s soon-to-launch campaign for governor in Ohio. While Pence had to concentrate on a re-election campaign with Trump before he began to fully entertain thoughts of a White House bid, Vance will most likely need to be ready to launch for 2028 soon after next year’s midterm elections if he plans to run for president. “The official office needs to be staffed with the best people that can help him effectuate those Capitol Hill goals and the communications goals,” the former Pence aide said. “And then the people on the outside are going to be important, from a planning and strategic perspective in conjunction with the chief of staff, to make sure Vance is traveling to the right places.”","summary":"Vice President JD Vance has earned a unique privilege inside the White House — free rein to hire whom he wants, with no interference from President Donald Trump or his top aides.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/vance-staffs-vp-office-allies-no-trump-objections-rcna189472","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250127-JD-Vance-aa-150-42b66c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-30 10:00:40","author":"Henry J.

That is more than the likes of Beto O'Rourke - who ran for the nomination in 2020 - and JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois (both one percent). \n\nStephen A.

He posted a meme of himself enjoying a smoothie alongside the results.\n\nIn fact, only eight other candidates - and the 'undecided' option - scored higher than the ESPN star. \n\nDuring his recent appearance on Real Time With Bill Maher, Smith revealed how he truly feels having cast his ballot for Harris.\n\n'Yes I voted for her, a lot of people voted for her, but in the end, we end up feeling like damn fools,' he said.\n\n'Because we supported it, we fell for the \"okiedoke\" as they say.

It also comes as Meta and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have joined other large technology companies trying to ingratiate themselves with the new Trump administration.The people familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity on Wednesday to discuss the agreement. Two of the people said terms of the agreement include $22 million (€21 million) going to the non-profit that will become Trump's future presidential library. The balance will go to legal fees and other litigants, they said.The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on the settlement.Zuckerberg visited Trump in November at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to try to mend fences with the incoming president, something other technology, business, and government officials have also done. At the dinner, Trump brought up the litigation and suggested they try to resolve it, kick-starting two months of negotiations between the parties, the people said.Trump's dispute over Meta 'censorship'Meta also made a $1 million (€959,000) donation to Trump’s inaugural committee, and Zuckerberg was among several billionaires granted prime seating during Trump’s swearing-in last week in the Capitol Rotunda, along with Google’s Sundar Pichai, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, who now owns the platform X, formerly known as Twitter.Before Trump's inauguration, Meta announced it was dropping fact-checking on its platform - a longtime priority of Trump and his allies.Trump filed the lawsuit months after his first term ended, calling the action by the social media companies \"illegal, shameful censorship of the American people\".Twitter, Facebook, and Google are all private companies, and users must agree to their terms of service to use their products. Under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are allowed to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services’ own standards, so long as they are acting in \"good faith\". The law also generally exempts internet companies from liability for the material that users post.But Trump and some other politicians have long argued that X, Facebook, and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity - or at least have it curtailed.Trump's legal battlesThe Meta settlement comes after ABC News agreed last month to pay $15 million (€14.3 million) toward Trump’s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.The network also agreed to pay $1 million (€959,000) in legal fees to the law firm of Trump’s attorney, Alejandro Brito.The settlement agreement describes ABC’s presidential library payment as a \"charitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organisation that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be-built library.The president has been litigious in arguing that he has been targeted with unfair coverage by legacy media companies.Trump has filed a lawsuit against CBS News over claims that the network aired a misleading interview with his 2024 opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, on the program '60 Minutes' that amounted to \"partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference\" intended to \"mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales.\" The programme denied the claims.And he has a lawsuit against The Des Moines Register, the news outlet's parent company, Gannett, and the Iowa newspaper's pollster Ann Selzer, alleging they violated the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act by releasing a poll days before the November election that significantly understated his support in the state. The newspaper and Selzer have denied wrongdoing.","summary":"Meta has agreed to settle a lawsuit with Donald Trump over account suspensions following the January 6 riots.

Our struggles and victories have affected this country for centuries, even though we don’t always receive our just due. With Black History Month right around the corner, The Root takes a look at the most unforgettable moments that have undoubtedly shaped us as a whole.\n\nMontgomery Bus Boycott\n\nThe Montgomery Bus Boycott began in 1955 and was a civil rights protest in which Black folks refused to ride city buses in Montgomery, Alabama, to protest segregated seating. Four days before the boycott, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man. The Montgomery Bus Boycott is seen as the first large-scale U.S. demonstration against segregation. It ended in 1956.\n\nSelma To Montgomery March\n\nThe Selma to Montgomery March took place in 1965 in Alabama. In March, protesters walked the 54-mile route in an effort to register Black voters in the South. However, they were met with violence from white vigilante groups as well as local authorities. Moments from the brutal confrontations were captured on television.\n\nHattie McDaniel Makes Oscars History\n\n Hattie McDaniel made history by becoming the first African American to win an Oscar for her supporting role as Mammy—Scarlett O’Hara’s house slave—in the 1939 movie “Gone with the Wind.” However, the ceremony was held at the segregated Ambassador Hotel which meant that McDaniel wasn’t allowed to sit with the cast of the film.\n\nBirmingham Church Bombing\n\nIn September 1963, white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. As a result, four young Black girls were killed. The church bombing happened 11 days after the federal government had ordered the integration of Alabama’s school system. Birmingham also had one of the most violent chapters of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nBrown V. Board Of Education\n\nIn 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools violated the 14th Amendment’s mandate of equal protection of the laws of the U.S. Constitution. In the Brown decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren famously stated that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” \n\nGeorge Floyd Protests\n\nIn May 2020, 46-year-old George Floyd died after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by police officer Derek Chauvin. Chauvin was recorded kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. The day after Floyd’s killing, protestors in Minneapolis took to the streets to express their outrage. These protests would quickly spread across the country.\n\nBarack Obama Becomes Nation’s First Black President\n\nOn January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was the Black first person to be inaugurated as President of the United States. He was also re-elected and served two consecutive terms, making him the 44th president. His father grew up in Kenya while his mother—who is white—hailed from Kansas.\n\nTulsa Race Massacre\n\nThe 1921 Tulsa massacre is considered the worst incident of racial violence in American history. From May 31 and June 1, 1921, more than one thousand homes and businesses were destroyed, with the death toll ranging from fifty to three hundred. Oklahoma’s second-largest Black community had been demolished.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” Speech\n\nIn 1963, around 250,000 people—both Black and white—took part in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Martin Luther King Jr. made an appearance and preached about nonviolent resistance. “I have a dream,” King said in his famous speech.\n\n “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” He ended one of the greatest speeches in American history with: “Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!’”\n\nShirley Chisholm Runs for President\n\nIn 1968, Shirley Chisholm became the first Black woman in Congress. In 1972, she tried her hand at the presidency. Though she didn’t win a primary, Chisholm received more than 150 votes at the Democratic National Convention. Chisholm made history by becoming the first Black woman to seek nomination for President of the United States from one of the two major political parties. \n\nRodney King Riots\n\nIn 1992, the four Los Angeles officers accused of using excessive force in the violent beating of Black motorist Rodney King were found not guilty after the case was tried. This injustice led to four days of the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. When they finally ended, 55 people were dead, more than 2,300 injured, and more than 1,000 buildings were burned to the ground. King ultimately received $3.8 million from the city in a settlement.\n\nMillion Man March\n\nIn 1995, hundreds of thousands of Black men participated in the Million Man March in Washington D.C. It was organized by minister Louis Farrakhan, who is known for his work with the Nation of Islam. The march was to dispel negative images and stereotypes of Black men. Its success inspired the Million Woman March, which took place two years later in Philadelphia.\n\nKamala Harris Becomes Nation’s First Black Vice President\n\nIn January 2021, Kamala Harris made history by becoming the first woman and first Black person to become Vice President of the United States. She was nominated by former President Joe Biden during the Democratic party’s “remote” national convention in 2020.

The teenager left people shocked and made headlines for his height. President Donald Trump previously spoke about the reason behind his son’s sudden growth.\n\nBarron Trump who has been kept away from the public eye, recently made an appearance at his father’s inauguration ceremony. Every move that the 18-year-old made was watched carefully by the media and people alike. His hair was another topic of discussion that was emphasised.\n\nNetizens could not help but notice the teenager’s hair loss. Several brutally trolled him on X. “It looks like Barron Trump’s hairline is already receding. It’s getting thin up there. Apple and tree?” one comment read comparing the President’s hairline to his son.\n\nBarron Trump already going bald. Nothing crueler in the world. pic.twitter.com/fDAfL4EqGL\n— Hempstead Tires (@HempsteadTirez) January 20, 2025\n\nA hair specialist, Dr Gizem Seymenoglu gave her opinion on the matter recently. The expert revealed that Barron might be suffering from a condition that is similar to Donald Trump‘s. “I believe Barron is indeed suffering from hair loss much like his own father,” she shared with Longevita Hair Transplant. She also added that it is likely a genetic condition “inherited from either parent.”\n\nBarron’s 6’7 stature is the second thing that caught attention. People even wondered if the teenager would grow even more given his age. Healthline.com notes that teenage boys could possibly grow a few inches taller even in their adulthood. So it wouldn’t come as a surprise if Barron were to grow to be 6’8. From a health perspective, there is currently no evidence that height growth in young adults will cause any health concerns.\n\nDonald Trump gave the credit to Barron’s height to his eating plenty of food that his grandmother makes. “That’s how he got so tall; he only ate her food,” the President shared.\n\nTRUMP ON BARRON: “He’s a little on the tall side. I will tell you, he’s a tall one, but he is a good-looking guy… And he does like politics. It’s sort of funny.”\n“He’ll tell me sometimes, ‘Dad, this is what you have to do.”pic.twitter.com/5mIIjcZJyB\n— Vertigo_Warrior (@VertigoWarrior) October 28, 2024\n\nThe Republican also shared how he suggested to his son that he should go into basketball. “He said, well, ‘I like soccer, Dad,’ actually. I thought… at your height, I like basketball better, but you can’t talk them into everything,” the President said. Barron reportedly has a keen interest in the English Premier League.\n\nThe teenager’s appearance at the Inauguration ceremony had Trump fans rallying in support. Republicans started talking about Barron Trump being a promising candidate for President.\n\n“This kid will be our President one day. Bet on it,” a user named Nick Sortor wrote on X. Another user noted that Barron is “born to lead.” Soon after the ceremony Trump started came up with the slogan, “Barron Trump President 2044.”\n\nSupporters of Donald Trump even went as far as making merch for Barron’s campaign. Badges of the same are now up on sale on eBay. The teenager was also praised and called a “class act” after his interaction with Democrat leaders.\n\nAfter Donald Trump was sworn in as the President of the United States, Barron caught everyone’s attention. The 18-year-old went over to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and wished them a “good day” while shaking their hands. This gesture earned Barron a lot of praise on social media. Netizens not only credited the teenager but also his parents for “raising him well.”","summary":"Barron Trump stood tall at his father’s inauguration ceremony quite literally.

Envy, perhaps? Or it could just be that they hate bold, confident Republican women.\n\n“Melania Trump is a portrait of beauty, style, elegance and power. She's a wife and a mother. She's a person who embraces her God-given pronoun,” he continued. “She's incredibly intelligent. She can speak fluently in five languages. And she has a terrific sense of humor. The Mean Girls who run the fashion magazines have an entirely different standard for style and beauty.” \n\nAuthor Scott Holleran agreed: “Dear @voguemagazine: The White House’s official portrait of First Lady Melania Trump, by Regine Malhaux, is rightly and radically emancipated, elegant and refined.\n\n“I love the reflection of herself—representing that First Lady Melania Trump is a hands-on president’s wife—ready,” he added. \n\nFox News anchor Martha MacCallum added: “Cmon Vogue. For decades you told us to know our power and be thin and well dressed when wielding it, and you diss this portrait of our most stunning FLOTUS since Jackie? You want her in a comfy blazer and pastels…I’m guessing she doesn’t care.”\n\nKathy Gyngell, editor of The Conservative Woman, wrote: “Oh look. A magazine for women tearing pieces out of ...women.”\n\nMany critics on X also pointed out that the magazine had featured Democrats Kamala Harris and Jill Biden on its covers in the past.\n\nVice President Harris was interviewed by the magazine in October 2024 in the midst of her bid for the White House just months after the former first lady appeared on the cover.\n\nAlready, the new FLOTUS has riled people with her statement outfits worn in the White House. For her husband’s second inauguration on January 20, Melania wore a long, silk-and-wool navy blue overcoat designed by Adam Lippes and a wide-brimmed hat by Eric Javits. \n\nFor the majority of the swearing-in ceremony, the top half of Melania’s face was shielded by the hat, spawning hundreds of memes online.","summary":"The First Lady’s portrait was shot by Belgian photographer Régine Mahaux","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/vogue-melania-trump-white-house-portrait-b2688912.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/29/17/46/Screenshot-2025-01-29-at-12-26-41-PM.png?trim=131,0,565,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/OPkwWTIx-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-30 04:43:40","author":"Kaleigh Werner","authors":["Kaleigh Werner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.31},{"id":285252758,"title":"Elon Musk says he might sue Gov.
