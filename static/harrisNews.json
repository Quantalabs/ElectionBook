This pioneering project aims to test the use of timber in lunar and Mars exploration.LignoSat, created by Kyoto University and Sumitomo Forestry, will be transported to the International Space Station on a SpaceX mission before being released into orbit approximately 400 km (250 miles) above the Earth.Named after the Latin word for \"wood,\" this palm-sized satellite will demonstrate the potential of renewable materials in space habitation.Once deployed, LignoSat will remain in orbit for six months, with its electronic components monitoring how wood withstands the harsh conditions of space, where temperatures can vary from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it moves between darkness and sunlight.","url":"https://www.news18.com/short-videos/world/world-s-first-wooden-satellite-lignosat-to-orbit-earth-for-six-months-9110377.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/11/1730824383_fbd4e7c7-a087-4679-9197-07d1ae240e93-16x9.jpeg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-05 16:30:06","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.153},{"id":262852244,"title":"Thai ‘Celebrity’ Baby Hippo Picks Trump Over Harris In US Election","text":"Thai ‘Celebrity’ Baby Hippo Picks Trump Over Harri...\n\nUS Election 2024: Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Oprah Win...\n\n5 Times Virat Kohli-Anushka Sharma Gave Us Couple ...\n\nTrump Draws Parallels to Lincoln, Finishes Campaig...\n\nTrump Calls for \"Death Penalty for Migrants\", Vows...\n\nTrump Warns He'll \"Impose Tariffs on Mexico, China...\n\nTrump Calls for \"Death Penalty for Migrants\", Vows...\n\nProtests As Pro Kurdish Mayors Stripped of Posts In Turkey\n\nIsraeli Settlers Torch Cars In West Bank\n\nIsrael Shows Soldiers And Tanks In Lebanon\n\nIran Will Attack Israel With ‘All Resources’\n\n‘Used For Survival’ Israeli Opposition Lashes Out ...\n\n“Murderers!”: Angry Crowds Throw Mud At Spain's Ki...\n\nHouthis ‘Will Continue To Hit Israeli Ships’ In Re...\n\nTrump Says He Wouldn't Mind If Someone ‘Shot Throu...\n\n“From Cursed Gaza…” Families of Hostages Call On N...\n\nUS Election 2024: ‘Want To See Me Knock...?’ Donal...\n\nKamala Harris Opens Saturday Night Live, Urges US ...\n\nIran: Female Student Arrested For Stripping To Pro...\n\n\"Not Giving Trump a Second Chance...\" Cardi B Endo...","summary":"Thailand’s beloved baby hippo, Moo Deng, predicted a victory for Republican Donald Trump in the US presidential election set for November 5.

DAILY POST recalls that Cardi B spoke at Harris’ rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Friday, where she formerly endorsed the Democratic Party's candidate for the presidential election. During the rally, Cardi B claimed that the Republican Party's candidate and Harri's main challenger, Donald Trump was promoting anti-women agendas. “Donald Trump is a hustler who is trying to hustle women out of their rights and hustle Americans out of their money…He’s selling more than watches and sneakers. He’s selling bigotry, misogyny, division, chaos, and confusion,\" she stated. The rapper also later debunked rumours that she was paid to endorse Kamala Harris via her X handle. Cardi denied receiving any monetary reward for her outing at Harris' rally.","summary":"American rapper, Cardi B has said she can&#8217;t contain her feelings ahead of the presidential election.

She claimed to the Daily Mail that she believes Democrats will try and stop him from being sworn in as commander in chief.\n\n“It will revolve mostly around lawfare and trying to get declarations that he’s an insurrectionist, something along those lines,” Kelly dished to the outlet.\n\nKelly also called out the media for “ignoring” the abuse allegations against second husband Doug Emhoff.\n\n“There’s only one reason this one didn’t get coverage, and it’s because it’s Kamala Harri’s husband… It totally undermines the story they’ve been trying to sell us about this guy being our new version of masculinity.”","summary":"Conservative firebrand Megyn Kelly issued a dire warning ahead of Tuesday’s Presidential Election — painting a grim picture of life under a Kamala Harris regime.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/02/us-news/megyn-kelly-paints-grim-picture-of-potential-kamala-harris-presidency/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/92857523.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/g0sQGent-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-02 04:19:58","author":"Shane Galvin","authors":["Shane Galvin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.401}]}
