Meanwhile, House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky, a Republican, requested transcribed interviews with five Biden aides, alleging they had participated in a “cover-up\" that amounted to “one of the greatest scandals in our nation's history.” “These five former senior advisors were eyewitnesses to President Biden's condition and operations within the Biden White House,” Comer said in a statement. “They must appear before the House Oversight Committee and provide truthful answers about President Biden's cognitive state and who was calling the shots.” Interviews were requested with White House senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn, former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, former deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti, a former counselor to the president.

Comer cited the book “Original Sin” by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson, which details concerns and debates inside the White House and Democratic Party over Biden's mental state and age. In the book, Tapper and Thompson wrote, “Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board.” Biden and members of his family have vigorously denied the book's claims. “This book is political fairy smut for the permanent, professional chattering class,” said Naomi Biden, the former president's granddaughter.

In its current form, it would cut taxes by an average of 2.4 percent, for middle-income households, according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center.\n\nWhile it is a significant tax cut, it is not the biggest in history. That was under Ronald Reagan in 1981 at 2.9 percent.\n\nIt is accurate that there will be a double-digit percentage decrease in tax bills, at least in the immediate term, at a little more than 11 percent across all tax brackets. It is also true that people earning between $30,000 and $80,000 will pay 15 percent less, according to the Non-Partisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n“They’re opposing NO TAX ON TIPS for the millions of Americans who work in the service industry and NO TAX ON OVERTIME for law enforcement, nurses, and more.”\n\nThis is true only in their opposition to Trump’s tax and spending bill.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have supported the concept of no tax on tips. Both Donald Trump and the Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris pledged to do so on the campaign trail. Senate Democrats backed the No Tax on Tips Act, passed by the US Senate on May 20. The bill, authored by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was co-sponsored by notable Democrats, including Jacky Rosen of Nevada and passed unanimously.\n\nOutside of the “big beautiful bill”, Democrats have generally not opposed tax cuts for seniors. Many Democrats have championed legislation that would expand tax cuts for seniors. California Democrat Jimmy Panetta co-sponsored a Republican led bill that would increase the standard deduction for adults over the age of 65 by $4,000.\n\nIn 2024, House Democrats introduced the “You Earned It, You Keep It Act”, which would effectively eliminate taxes on social security benefits. The bill, however, has never made it past committee.\n\nAgain, they are opposing Trump’s “big beautiful bill”, not objecting to the child tax credit.\n\nIn fact, Democrats have long pushed to expand the child tax credit. In April, Senate Democrats, including Georgia’s Raphael Warnock and Colorado’s Michael Bennett, introduced legislation that would expand the child tax credit. The bill would increase the tax credit, from $2,000 where it currently stands, to $6,360 for newborns, $4,320 for children ages one to six and $3,600 for children six to 17, permanently.\n\nWhile the “big beautiful bill” would also increase the child tax credit, it would do so only by $500. That temporary increase is meant to last through 2028 and will revert to $2,000 in 2029.\n\nIn the “big beautiful bill”, House Republicans introduced new savings accounts for children. The accounts would include a $1,000 handout for every child born between January 1, 2025 and January 1, 2029.\n\nDemocrats have not only been supporters of the idea for savings accounts for newborns, but prominent Democrats actually championed it.\n\nIn 2018, Cory Booker of New Jersey introduced the American Opportunity Accounts Act, which would also give $1,000 to newborns and up to $2000 in annual contributions. He reintroduced the bill again in 2023.\n\nThis appears to be false. The White House link refers to the Paid Family and Medical Leave Credit, not child care access. Trump’s bill offers up to 12 weeks of paid leave for employees who have worked a year and earn $57,600 or less.\n\nWhile that gives parents more time at home, Democrats have focused on expanding access to child care, including universal pre-K. In 2023, Republicans opposed a Democratic plan to keep child care centres open that struggled in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLast year, Trump pressured Republicans to vote against a bipartisan border security bill, a move that reportedly helped Trump’s chances of winning in November 2024. Democrats have opposed Republican plans to use US military bases for migrant detention, arguing that it misuses Department of Defense resources. Democrats have long opposed border wall funding, including during Trump’s first term.\n\nA 2018 Stanford University analysis estimated that a border wall would reduce migration by just 0.6 percent. Despite this, the “big beautiful bill” allocates more than $50bn to complete the wall and maritime crossings, $45bn for building and maintaining detention centres, and $14bn for transportation.\n\nThis is sort of true. Democrats have not been huge proponents of health savings accounts. The belief is that healthcare savings accounts do not help the socioeconomically disadvantaged, who may not have the financial resources to contribute to the accounts. Democrats have also objected to other cuts to healthcare in the bill, including the potential $880bn that could be cut from essential government programmes like Medicaid.\n\nIn the bill, the White House is conflating the longstanding debate on school choice with scholarships. Under school choice, funds otherwise allocated to the public school system can be re-allocated to private institutions, which Republicans argue will allow students to have potential access to a higher quality education.\n\nDemocrats have opposed school choice because it diverts funds from public school systems, many of which are already drastically underfunded. In Texas, Senator Ted Cruz, for example, pushed legislation that would expand school choice, even as three out of four school districts in the state are underfunded, according to a Kinder Institute analysis.","summary":"In a release, the White House said that Democrats opposed key measures party members actually championed.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/4/white-house-makes-misleading-claims-about-democratic-opposition-to-tax-bill?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25151050050281-1749071127.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 23:03:25","author":"Andy Hirschfeld,Apps Support","authors":["Andy Hirschfeld","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":328196986,"title":"Why I’m ending my donations to US Jewish groups and seeking new leadership to protect US Jews","text":"For decades, I’ve proudly supported Jewish organizations. \n\nI’ve written checks, attended galas and responded to fundraising calls from groups like the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nI did it because I believed in the mission: to safeguard the Jewish people, support Israel and protect our community from hatred.\n\nBut today, I say with sadness: These organizations have failed us. \n\nKathyrn Wolf made the case as plain as could be in Sunday’s Post.\n\nThat’s why I’ll be ending my donations to these groups and pushing for a new Jewish regime to emerge that I can support.\n\nFact is, the rise of antisemitism in America isn’t theoretical. \n\nIt’s happening now — on college campuses, in boardrooms, on the streets of Boulder and Washington, DC.\n\nJewish students are harassed. \n\nSynagogues are vandalized. \n\nThe Jewish state is demonized while terrorist groups are celebrated.\n\nAnd where are our leaders? \n\nThey’re overly silent, timid or worse: too afraid of offending progressive donors to speak the truth.\n\nFor too long, we’ve put our faith and our dollars into institutions that refuse to adapt.\n\nJewish Federations still pretend Jewish safety is a bipartisan, secular issue.\n\nThe ADL wins headlines for its important documentation of antisemitism but won’t defend Jews exclusively and without at least some moral equivalence.\n\nThis is not a partisan issue. \n\nThis is a survival issue: If you’re a Jew in America today, especially an openly Zionistic or religious one, your safety is far from assured.\n\nNor are strongly worded press releases and DEI panels remotely close to the solution.\n\nWe need new leadership. \n\nWe need an organization that tells the truth, fights back hard and unapologetically takes sides.\n\nThat says things others won’t, like: Radical Islam is a clear and present danger in America — and the left is often a part of the problem.\n\nBecause not rocking the boat in the face of evil isn’t a virtue.

From a vehicular accident claiming no fewer than 22 athletes returning from a national sports festival to almost 200 fatalities and dozens of others believed to have been swept away by devastating floods, it has been a period of mourning in Nigeria. Even at that, the official silence to the trending video of how CSP Baba Ali Muhammad was brutally murdered by street urchins is very telling on the value we place on the life of those we expect to protect us. \n\nBefore I proceed, let me state that crime fighting is a risky enterprise all over the world. For instance, according to the website of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 47 law enforcement officers were murdered in the first eight months of last year. “Firearms were used in 76.6 percent of the felonious deaths occurring in 2024. Among officers killed with firearms, four are confirmed to have been wearing body armour,” the FBI report reveals. “The leading circumstances surrounding the officers’ felonious deaths were related to investigative/enforcement (16), unprovoked attacks (8), and ambushes (entrapment/premeditation) (6).”\n\nHowever, what is different in the case of Nigeria is the growing rate at which criminals are targeting our law enforcement officers for extermination without fear. Not to mention the way we treat our policemen—alive or dead. That is not the case elsewhere. In March this year, President Donald Trump called for a mandatory death penalty for anyone convicted of killing an American law enforcement officer. After signing an executive order that would make the death penalty mandatory in such cases, Trump called on Congress to ensure it becomes a permanent law. He also honoured the widow of NYPD Officer, Jonathan Diller, who was shot during a traffic stop in March 2023. Meanwhile, I am yet to see a presidential response to the mob killing of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) for Rano in Kano State.\n\nI once referenced the response by Vivek Tulja, a satellite communication expert, to a question on why criminals, including members of the Mafia, avoid killing policemen unless they are cornered. “If you happen to kill a cop, you are best off using the last bullet in your magazine on yourself,” Tulja concluded. That appears not be the case in Nigeria given how the Rano DPO was executed in a most brutal manner by a mob not even afraid to record their own bestial action.\n\nIn recent days, I have had revealing exchanges with Mr Tunji Alapini, a retired Assistant Inspector General of Police, regarding this tragedy. “That an officer of the law left his home for the office and ended up being gruesomely murdered in a ‘sane’ society is beyond imagination,” said Alapini who admitted shedding tears after watching the gory video. “I am not in full picture of the incident that made those criminals believe they have a right to take the life of an officer on legitimate duty, but from the aftermath of the Police Interim Investigation report, the mob massacred the DPO because a suspect allegedly died in the cell at his station.”\n\nWhile advocating that the culprits (most of whom have been arrested by the police) be made to bear “the full consequences of their action,” Alapini also expressed concern about the lack of outrage from critical stakeholders in our country on the tragic incident. “While the Police cried out about what happened to the unfortunate officer, there was a deafening silence from the Governor of Kano State, traditional rulers, National Assembly members etc. It is almost as if the lives of our police and military personnel don’t matter. And that is both concerning and saddening.”\n\nI share Alapini’s sentiment. As the principal custodian of peace, order and security in a constitutional democracy, no institution is arguably more important than the police. But so abused is this law enforcement authority in Nigeria that both the government and society seem not to care about their personnel. Yet, given the strategic relationship between the well-being of the police and the security of citizens, we neglect this critical institution to our own peril. \n\nI have in the past recounted the October 2011 statement by a police officer’s wife at the Obalende barracks in Lagos which revealed the indignities to which their families had been exposed. It may be worth repeating at a time like this. “We have been suffering in silence. These barracks are like a refugee camp. We have no toilet facilities, no pipe-borne water and no electricity, and we are now being threatened by floods and reptiles,” the woman told the visiting Police Affairs Minister, Caleb Olubolade. “We live a little above animals. We are like sub-human beings here. This is a place of death; the mosquitoes here don’t surrender to insecticides…”\n\nHow do we expect the personnel of a Police force whose families live like ‘sub-human beings’ to perform optimally? Yes, I have written several columns on the excesses of the police, but we should also be fair. If the life of a divisional police officer could be taken by a mob in such a gruesome manner and authorities in Nigeria move on as if nothing happened, what justification do we have to hold them accountable when they misbehave?\n\nAlapini suggests that the Rano Police station be named after the deceased CSP. I agree. But I also hope those in authorities can understand that the manner in whichthe life of the Rano DPO was taken is a direct assault on social order and a grave threat to the foundation of any functioning society. And there must be severe consequences, if only to serve as a deterrence to others that when you kill a policeman in Nigeria, you are digging your own grave. It must never happen again!\n\nHealth of the PresidentLast Thursday, former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Deputy Governor in charge of economic policy, Kingsley Obiora, sent me an interesting message, followed by two lengthy posts. First, the message: “I asked two AI-powered search engines to comment on ‘Power, Politics and Death’ by Olusegun Adeniyi and ‘Original Sin’ by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson and see if there are any similarities. Below are the responses from Elon Musk’s Grok and Sam Altman’s ChatGPT.”\n\nThe first forwarded post by Kingsley was the response he received from Grok. “To address the query, I’ll compare the behaviors of key actors in Power, Politics and Death by Olusegun Adeniyi and Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, focusing on their actions, motivations, and the consequences as depicted in the books.” Both works, according to Grok, “delve into political intrigue, leadership challenges, and the handling of crises, offering a lens to examine how key figures navigate power, secrecy, and public perception.” \n\nIn both books, Grok continues, “key actors exhibited hubris by overestimating their ability to control outcomes and denying the reality of their leader’s incapacitation. This led to catastrophic political consequences—Nigeria’s constitutional crisis and the U.S. Democrats’ electoral defeat.” But Grok also admits that while there are striking similarities, contexts differ in the two countries: “Nigeria’s political system in Power, Politics and Death was marked by weaker institutions, allowing personalities to dominate over constitutional norms. In contrast, Original Sin operates in the U.S.’s more structured democratic system, where the cover-up faced greater scrutiny due to media and electoral pressures.” On the outcomes, “Yar’Adua’s death resolved the crisis by forcing a transition to Jonathan, whereas Biden’s withdrawal led to Kamala Harris’s candidacy, which still failed to prevent Trump’s victory, highlighting different stakes and timelines.”\n\nAfter a lengthy disquisition of various aspects of the two books, Grok concluded: “The key actors in both Power, Politics and Death and Original Sin exhibit remarkably similar behaviors: concealing their leader’s health issues, prioritizing loyalty over public interest, manipulating political processes, displaying hubris, and being influenced by family dynamics. These actions reflect a universal tendency among political elites to cling to power, even at the cost of transparency and democratic integrity. In both cases, the consequences were severe—a constitutional crisis in Nigeria and an electoral disaster for U.S. Democrats—underscoring the dangers of such behaviors in leadership.”\n\nThe second post was what ChatGPT had to say on both books, which is remarkably similar. “Power, Politics and Death by Olusegun Adeniyi and Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, though centered on different political landscapes—Nigeria and the United States respectively—both delve into the inner workings of presidential administrations during times of crisis. A comparative analysis reveals notable similarities in the behaviors of key actors in these narratives,” ChatGBT wrote.After also comparing different aspects of the books, ChatGBT concluded: “In summary, both books shed light on the complexities of political leadership during health crises, emphasizing how inner circles can influence decisions, manipulate information, and impact national stability. The parallels between the two administrations underscore the universal challenges of governance, transparency, and the human elements that shape political narratives.”\n\nReading through the posts by Grok and ChatGBT, I marveled at the incredible power of AI and the future of the knowledge industry. But the message from Kingsley also prompted me to get the book, ‘Original Sin (President Biden’s Decline, It’s Coverup, and his disastrous choice to run again’ which I read on the long flight from Boston to San Francisco enroute Dallas last Saturday. The Biden book has, of course, elicited several reactions. Even the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, waded in. “I think anybody looking again at the videos and photo evidence of Joe Biden with … a little bit of common sense can see that this was a clear coverup,” Leavitt responded to a question on revelations from the book. “And Jill Biden was certainly complicit in that coverup.”\n\nI agree that both books are similar in subject. But they diverge on thrust. The Biden book is about shielding an incumbent presidentseeking a second term from the eyes of a public whose confidence is likely to be shaken by greater knowledge of his physical and mental state. In a way, it is also about protecting the institution of the US presidency from perceptions that could imperil orderly transition. In the case ofYar’Adua, it is about sustaining a power incumbency during a crisis necessitated by ill health. In both books, what comes out clearly is the uncharted territory of how to deal with presidential health confidence in an accountable manner without exposing the principal to public ridicule.\n\nPerhaps because I was a participant observer in the narrative contained in the Yar’Adua book, I have sympathy for Mrs Jill Biden and MessrsMike Donilon, Steve Ricchetti, Bruce Reed and Hunter Biden—members of what was described by the authors as the ‘Politburo’—the Nigerian version of the ‘Cabal’. From my own experience, the assumption that people around a leader with health challenges are there only to preserve their own power and privileges is not necessarily true. Some may simply be helpless after weighing several factors on a problem over which they have no control.\n\nWhile this is an issue for another day, the ultimate lesson—which is evident in both ‘Original Sin’ and ‘Power, Politics and Death’—is the challenge that comes with the illness of a national leader. For those close to such a leader and the country over which he presides.\n\nThe Ghost of June 12\n\n‘Combining the techniques of a diarist, reporter and commentator, Olusegun Adeniyi reports the events as they unfolded under the late General Sani Abacha, he allows the actors of that drama to speak in their own words, he constructs the narrative in a chronological sequence and guides us to the climactic and sudden end of the Abacha misadventure. He provides strong entertainment in recording the statements of those willing agents of dictatorship who handed over the initiative to Abacha, but who ironically today are occupying positions of authority as democrats. The author mentions their names directly and confronts us with the fickleness of the human mind and the dangers of the personal factor in Nigerian politics…the characters in his account are either villains or charlatans, democrats or political mercenaries, men of principles or hired thugs. Without calling anyone names, he allows their deeds to place a judgment of history upon their heads…’\n\nThe foregoing, written by Dr Reuben Abati, is from the Foreword to ‘The Last 100 Days of Abacha’, first published in August 2005, but now part of the coming book, ‘The Ghost of June 12’. Meanwhile, I have received several messages on whether there will be a public presentation of the book. There will not be any such formal ceremony. But the book will be available for readers across the country from Monday, June 16. For pre-order, those interested should contact www.rhbooks.com.ng or Call/WhatsApp: +2349092158968; +2348028287089.\n\n• You can follow me on my X (formerly Twitter) handle, @Olusegunverdict and on www.olusegunadeniyi.com","summary":"By Olusegun Adeniyi In a nation where&#160;hardly a single day passes without&#160;tragedy, it can be overwhelming for public officials to respond to all the bad news.

It’s completely nuts to be more upset that the Party didn’t prioritize Joe Biden’s ego and keep him on the ticket than to thank god we averted complete and total disaster.'\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who launched a brief primary challenge citing his age long before he dropped out, took a shot a Jean-Pierre without naming her direction. 'I haven’t written a book or been paid for a speech and will never become a lobbyist. I just share my perspective and advocate for common sense without charging anyone for it,' he wrote.\n\nMany of those urging Biden to get out after his debate disaster argued it was the only way to avoid an electoral wipeout. As it turned out, Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in at the 11th Hour and lost to Donald Trump anyway. \n\nMost surprising to many is that Jean-Pierre announced she is leaving the Democratic Party, after a long career as an operative, at a time when Democrats are soul-searching to try to find a way to combat Donald Trump. Her new book, titled Independent, has a cover featuring shattered glass, and a PR release describes its substance as 'a look inside a broken White House, outside the party lines.'\n\nHer publisher Hachette describes an 'urgent, timely analysis' and urges Americans to 'vote their values and maintain individuality within party lines.'\n\nOne operative called it 'the most grift-y thing I’ve seen in a long time, and that’s saying something in Washington.' \n\n'A lot of group chats were revived today,' posted former White House official Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former advisor to VP Kamala Harris, on X, adding a smiling / crying emoji.\n\n'Counting 13 on my end,' chimed in former Biden State Department spokesman Vedant Patel. \n\n'Lol,' wrote former White House assistant press secretary Jeremy Edwads, reposting an article about Jean-Pierre penning the book and leaving the party. \n\nFormer officials contacted by DailyMail.com said they didn't know what kind of advance Jean-Pierre was coming in, after failing to land a high-profile TV gig as did her predecessor Jen Psaki, now an MSNBC host. \n\n'Probably best to purge the party of our most delusional and self-serving personalities,' the former official added. \n\n The slack-jawed responses came after news broke that Jean-Pierre, who spent years defending Biden from the White House podium on both substance and questions about his age, health, and mental fitness was writing the book.\n\nIt comes as her former boss has been hit by a round of tough press coverage with the release of Axios reporter Alex Thompson and CNN anchor Jake Tapper's new book, 'Original Sin,' which rakes the Biden White House for covering up signs of his decline. \n\n'In a country obsessed with blind loyalty to a two-party democratic system, Karine Jean-Pierre, former White House press secretary to the Biden-Harris administration, shares why Americans must step beyond party lines to embrace life as Independents,' according to an online release for the book.\n\n'Jean-Pierre didn’t come to her decision to be an Independent lightly,' it says – indicating she has leaving the party, after working in the Biden administration.\n\nShe worked as a political director for Obama. She also worked for liberal outside group MoveOn. Jean-Pierre didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on her new project.\n\nThe write-up for her forthcoming book indicates she'll take on people within the party who tried to force Biden to end his reelection campaign after his debate disaster.\n\n'She takes us through the three weeks that led to Biden’s abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic Party that led to his decision,' according to the release. \n\nIt calls it a 'hard-hitting yet hopeful critique.' \n\nThe tome runs 256 pages, and goes on sale October 21. \n\nAlthough she has been largely quiet since Biden left office following former Vice President Kamala Harris's defeat, Jean-Pierre referenced some of the scores she plans to settle during an interview in February at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\n\nShe said the 'toughest thing to see' was a 'firing squad' during the weeks after Biden's debate, when a series of party stalwarts pushed him to get out of the race, arguing he couldn't defeat Donald Trump with his lousy approval ratings.\n\n'I had never seen anything like it before,' she intoned.

Elise Stefanik's nomination to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, fearing that the GOP could lose her House seat, which Trump carried by nearly 21 points in 2024.\n\nPolling also suggests next November will be good for Democrats.

SAM is a new $20 million initiative aiming to study how Democrats can better connect with young male voters they lost in the 2024 election cycle, according to The New York Times.\n\nSome participants said they viewed the Democratic Party as cautious, but viewed the GOP as more confident, Politico reported.\n\nThe research “reaffirms what young men already think, that Democrats don’t want to invest in you,” Ilyse Hogue, a co-founder of the Speaking with American Men project, told Politico. Hogue is a well-known left-wing feminist activist who served as president of NARAL Pro-Choice America for eight years.\n\nHogue also told Politico that many young male voters believe the Democratic Party does not “care” about them.\n\n“Democrats are seen as weak, whereas Republicans are seen as strong,” Hogue told the outlet. “Young men also spoke of being invisible to the Democrat coalition, and so you’ve got this weak problem and then you’ve got this, ‘I don’t think they care about me’ problem, and I think the combination is kind of a killer.”\n\nOne focus group participant described Democrats as embracing “the fluid masculinity of being, like, empathetic and sensitive,” while “Republicans are more like, the traditional masculinity of a provider, strong, and the machismo type,” Politico reported.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, male voters significantly shifted toward the Republican Party. An analysis from Democrat firm Catalist found that while 55% of women continued to support former Vice President Kamala Harris at about the same levels that they supported former President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, male voters shifted toward President Donald Trump in 2024, from 48% support for Biden in 2020 to 42% support for Harris in 2024.\n\nHogue told Politico that Democrats will not be able to win over voters unless they are “speaking the language that young men are speaking.”\n\n“Democrats can’t win these folks over if they’re not speaking the language that young men are speaking,” Hogue told Politico.\n\nRepublicans have widely criticized SAM with House Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain in a May X post likening the expensive initiative to the Democrats lighting “$20 million on fire to study their unpopularity.”\n\nRepublican Arizona Rep. Abe Hamadeh similarly blasted SAM on X in May.\n\n“The Democrats declared war on masculinity and lost a generation of young men,” Hamadeh wrote. “Instead of doing any introspection as to what they did wrong, they’re going to invest $20 million studying ‘male Syntax’ to try to better communicate their radical message.”\n\nThe Democratic Party has been reportedly strategizing about the best way to reconnect with voters following the GOP winning control of the White House and both houses of Congress in November 2024.\n\nSome Democrats have recently criticized their own party’s brand. In May, Rahm Emanuel, an ex-Obama White House chief of staff criticized the Democratic Party brand as being “weak and woke.”\n\nStill, Ross Morales Rocketto, a Democrat strategist who is not involved in the SAM project, told Politico that part of Democrats’ current messaging problem is that many young men think that “the Democratic Party doesn’t really like or respect them.”\n\n“The Democratic Party is missing that we’re not going to be able to message our way out of these deep problems men are facing, starting with the fact that they know the Democratic Party doesn’t really like or respect them,” Rocketto said. “It’s really easy for Republicans to play off the politics of grievance.”\n\nSAM could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nOriginally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation","summary":"DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—New findings from the Democrats’ costly and widely panned Speaking with American Men (SAM) project found that many young men view the...

Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, had one answer: look no further than the re-election of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe congresswoman pointed to tech billionaire and former Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk pouring over $250 million into the president’s 2024 campaign and reaping the benefits — in power and new government contracts — when Trump took office. Meanwhile, she argued, Trump and the nation’s Republican-controlled Congress intend to cut billions of dollars from social services like Medicaid, Social Security and SNAP with no regard for the Americans it will hurt.\n\n“People saw the money being spent on the election, but I don't think that they connected the dots until now,” Crockett said. “And I don't think that there's ever been a clearer picture.”\n\nCrockett described the harmful connection between big money and politics alongside former Sen. Jon Tester, the three-term Montana Democrat unseated in the November election, during a virtual town hall hosted Tuesday by Democratic political action committee End Citizens United. The organization, which held the event to celebrate its 10th anniversary, supports candidates who champion campaign finance reform; it strives to overturn Citizens United, a 2010 Supreme Court decision that loosened restrictions on the amount of independent expenditure groups could contribute to candidates during elections. \n\nThroughout the event, Crockett and Tester drew connections between what they described as their Republican colleagues’ self-dealing, the political contributions that put them in office and the toll those actions ultimately have on Americans. Tester focused particularly on the House’s passage last month of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which would slash hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for Medicaid, SNAP and other social programs if enacted. \n\n“Are they taking up issues that really help regular folks, like making health care more affordable, or housing more affordable, or education more affordable?” Tester said. “No, they're taking up issues that really grease the pockets of the uber-rich in this country at the expense of the folks who need these programs the most.”\n\nThe former senator also criticized Musk, who has since blasted the spending bill, over his role in leading Trump’s effort to curtail federal bureaucracy and eliminate excess government spending. \n\n“As Elon Musk was running around trashing the government — cutting this, cutting that, cutting this — did he cut the $38 billion that he received from the federal government? Hell no, he didn't,” Tester added. “And the truth … is that’s the kind of stuff that's going on right now. You rip apart programs that have been around for generations. Why? To give the folks who paid for these campaigns big tax breaks.” \n\nCrockett rejected the notion that all politicians are corrupt regardless of party, arguing that Democrats' actions “have not come anywhere near” the “blatant lawlessness coming directly” from their Republican colleagues. But, she said, the distrust in politicians comes down to the amount of information the public takes in about the candidates they elect. \n\n“A lot of times we can't break through the noise if you have so much money that is pouring in, and it's literally sending out misinformation and disinformation,” Crockett said, pointing to Musk and other megadonors’ money going to ads spreading false claims about former Vice President Kamala Harris' proposed policy during her brief presidential bid. \n\nThat political noise is also why the Citizens United decision matters, she added. \n\nThe 5-4 ruling along ideological lines reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions, permitting corporations and other groups to spend money on elections without limits. The decision resulted in the emergence of wealthy megadonors and special interest groups increasingly exerting more influence over election outcomes — and the politicians they back — than before, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. \n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.

That is the difference. That is the stark difference in who it is that we are fighting for.”\n\nCrockett also left attendees with a call to action, asking that they remain “tuned in” to local elections every year in the face of voter suppression bills and special-interest spending at the federal level.

Oh, I got Lady Gaga on stage.” “It just kind of felt like, what does that have to do with me?

He's been at the bank for 35 years and has held numerous roles at the company.\n\nBy comparison, Lake has been at JPMorgan for 25 years, while Rohrbaugh has been there for 20 years.\n\nJenn Piepszak was a real possibility to become CEO several months ago. She effectively took herself out of the running when she accepted the COO job in January.\n\nPiepszak replaced former COO Daniel Pinto, who will serve as the company's president until he retires in 2026. \n\nPinto, too, was once considered someone who could step into the CEO role, as he previously assumed those responsibilities when Dimon had to undergo emergency heart surgery in 2020.\n\nMary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management, is considered a dark horse in the leadership race. She has been at the firm for nearly 30 years.\n\nJPMorgan could surprise everyone and go with an outside hire, but that is very unlikely. Daily Mail reached out to the bank for comment. \n\nIn April, the bank's Board of Directors identified potential successors to Dimon and all of them were internal candidates.\n\nDimon himself was an internal hire. In 2000, he became the CEO of Bank One, overseeing that firm's operations until it merged with JPMorgan in 2004. He was first selected to be COO at JPMorgan before being hired as CEO in December 2005.\n\nAll this jockeying at JPMorgan comes as Dimon made a headline-grabbing appearance Friday at the inaugural Regan National Economic Forum, where he talked with his usual brash candor about today's hot-button political issues.\n\nOn a panel with CNBC's Morgan Brennan, he sounded the alarm about the ballooning national debt and warned that if the United States doesn't take its role as the world's sole superpower seriously, the US dollar could cease being the world reserve currency.\n\nHe also advanced the idea that leaders at every level of government are bungling the country's future.\n\n'The amount of mismanagement is extraordinary - by state, by city, for pensions, and that stuff is going to kill us,' he said.\n\nAll these statements and more got Brennan to ask Dimon whether he'd consider running for office, a question that got many in the audience to gasp.\n\n'What would be the scenario that you would entertain to consider public service?' she asked.\n\nDimon paused for a beat, then said, 'Alright, ready? I'll tell you. If I thought I could really win, which I don't think I could.'\n\nThat response apparently caught the eye of Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, who wrote a lengthy article about why Dimon could be a dynamic choice to be the next president.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, a financier who served as White House communications director for 10 days in 2017 before being fired by Trump, posted about Sonnenfeld's Tuesday piece in Fortune Magazine, calling it 'spot on.' \n\nSonnenfeld argued that Dimon is a commanding presence and a sensible moderate who could, if he decided to run as a Democrat, unite a party that is in complete disarray.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are largely without a true leader after Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in November.\n\nA CNN/Gallup poll released on Sunday seems to bear that out, with just 16 percent of Americans believing the Democratic party has strong leaders.\n\nSonnenfeld also cast Dimon as an unapologetic truth-teller even when it doesn't suit him, writing that this is a 'rare quality found only in the best leaders.'\n\nAs an example, he pointed to a leaked recording of Dimon at a company town hall, where he launched into a foul-mouthed rant against employees who wanted to continue working from home.\n\nDimon also has a realistic claim to the centrist label, Sonnenfeld wrote, as he criticized both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAlthough Dimon, a registered Democrat, continues to praise Trump for growing the economy in his first term, he hasn't been shy to slam the president for his Liberation Day tariffs and his decision to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve.\n\nIn January 2024, he was far more conciliatory, saying, 'Take a step back, be honest. He was kind of right about NATO, kind of right on immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Trade tax reform worked. He was right about some of China.'\n\nBack then, he was warning that Democrats' incendiary rhetoric about Trump and MAGA could cost them the upcoming election.\n\nWhether or not the Democrats' approach to Trump supporters was the main factor in them losing, the fact is, Trump cruised to a second term relatively handily.\n\nSonnenfeld wrote that Dimon could be the antidote to Trumpism, essentially saying that while Trump plays the role of a titan of industry, Dimon is the real deal.\n\nHe pointed to Trump's multiple business bankruptcies, despite inheriting nearly half a billion from his father, Fred Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan stock has risen nearly 1,100 percent since Dimon became CEO.\n\nAdding to Dimon's potential as a leading political figure, he is not accustomed to having someone telling him what to do, very much like Trump.\n\nWhen speculation bubbled up last year that both the Harris and Trump campaigns were considering Dimon as Treasury Secretary, he had this to say: 'I’ve not had a boss in 25 years and I am not ready to start now.","summary":"JPMorgan Chase is preparing for a future without Jamie Dimon at the helm.

In California, they greeted the thought of her political future with impatience and weary sighs.\n\nSo Harris is pretty much unwanted in both South Carolina and California.\n\nThe former vice president has kept campaign junkies guessing as she contemplates running for California governor or taking another shot at the White House in 2028. But party members on opposite coasts, who gathered for simultaneous confabs this weekend, did not express much clamor for either iteration of a Harris candidacy.\n\nAnd as you can see above, the second paragraph remained in \"meh!\" mode on Harris' political paths in both states.\n\nSome Democrats in South Carolina, girding for battle to retain their favored status on the presidential primary calendar, went so far as to suggest that a run for California governor could offer a graceful exit from the national stage.\n\n“I think she should run for governor and be the best governor California has ever had,” said Amanda Loveday, a Democratic strategist and former executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party.\n\nThat sounds like a somewhat less than polite way of wanting to be rid of Kamala Harris in South Carolina.\n\nAnd in her home state, some Democrats openly fretted that California was simply a fallback option for Harris after her presidential ambitions were thwarted last year.\n\n“We haven’t really heard from her on California issues since Trump’s inauguration,” said Madison Zimmerman, a state party delegate from rural Shasta County. “I feel like California isn’t a consolation prize.”\n\nRight about now readers must be wondering how Politico came up with only 1, not 2 tepid views in the title since both political paths in both states look lousy for Kamala by Politico's own description. You have to wonder if Politico is pulling our collective legs when they promote California as viable option for Harris simultaneously with this distinctly downbeat analysis:\n\nThat was the immediate question that came to mind for Carol Weiss, a delegate from Sunnyvale, when assessing the potential governor’s race field at this weekend’s California Democratic Party convention.\n\n“My concern about Harris is that she would be using the position, if she won, as a placeholder for a second run at the presidency,” she said. “And that would make me feel like I’m wasting my vote. I want a strong governor for at least four years.”\n\nHarris, who was in Australia last week to speak at a real estate conference, did not appear at the convention. She sent in a brief video address which was greeted with warm, but not protracted, applause from the audience. A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt sure sounds as if Politico is presenting Harris' political future in either state as heads she loses, and tails she still loses.\n\nNow read this paragraph and try to remind yourself that California is supposed to be the non-tepid path for Harris, at least according to Politico.\n\nLorena Gonzalez, who leads the powerful California Labor Federation, said she has also not heard much desire for Harris to clear the field, and she’s detected a perceptible change among candidates the longer the vice president takes to declare her intentions. (Harris has given herself a deadline of late summer to make up her mind.)\n\nAnd now for this laughable show of \"support\" in which a vote for Harris for governor is presented as somewhat akin to tolerating an upset stomach:\n\n“I’m really on the fence,” said Minola Clark Manson, a delegate from eastern San Diego County. “I probably would vote for Kamala Harris but there would be an underlying discomfort.”\n\nOne has to wonder if Politico reporters laugh out loud while writing up stuff like this. Perhaps they are using this opportunity to audition as comedy writers as a refreshing career change. Comedy writing posing as political analysis.

London and Paris in Britain and France, obviously, with 16% to 20% of the nation’s population and practically all its elites. In the U.S., metro New York, Washington, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. In Canada, Toronto and Anglophone Montreal. In South Korea, Seoul. \n\nThe second M stands for Minorities, racial and ethnic. In Britain, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, Muslims in industrial cities. In the U.S., the various peoples, bracketed by the Census Bureau ukase, as blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. Francophone Canadians. Peoples whose experiences have set them apart as alien and potentially adversary to the dominant society.\n\nI first discerned the M+M vs. H patterns in June and November 2016. As I wrote in 2019, in the Brexit referendum, 60% or more of voters in metro London and Scotland voted against leaving the European Union, but Brexit won because 57% in England outside London voted for it. \n\nSimilarly, in the U.S, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump 65% to 30% in the NY/DC/LA/SF Metropole, which is 15% of the nation, but Trump won 49% to 45% in the Heartland in between. Key electoral votes came from 2012 Obama voters switching to Trump in the non-major metropolitan half of the Midwest.\n\nThe Heartland doesn’t always lose. Joe Biden’s November 2020 victory over Donald Trump is one example of that. The ouster of pro-Brexit Prime Minister Boris Johnson in summer 2022, and the Labour party victory in the July 2024 general election, is another. \n\n2022 saw incumbent French President Emanuel Macron, who in the first round ran behind a leftist in the Metropole and just 4 points ahead of the populist anti-mass-immigration Marine Le Pen in the Heartland, Macron won the runoff but by only half the margin of four years before. \n\nThe elites have fought back. Johnson was ousted following an ethics complaint, and a French court barred Le Pen from running for five years on a flimsy rationale. European Union elites removed the candidate who led the first ballot in Romania from the runoff and have threatened to bar Germany’s AfD, the second-place finisher in the February election, from future contests.\n\nYou can see the similarities with the lawfare attacks on Trump and the kangaroo court prosecution by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. \n\nElites justify these moves by invoking the tragic history of the first half of the twentieth century. But objecting to having economic policies set by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels is not undemocratic. And barring or limiting the uncontrolled influx of often culturally hostile immigrants is not the moral equivalent of murdering six million Jews. \n\nPreventing voters from exercising their free choice is a funny way of “saving democracy.” And not a very effective way. Le Pen’s deputy Jordan Bardella is running well in polls, and Labour in Britain polls way behind Nigel Farage’s Reform party by 362 to 136 seats at present, with nearly 40% of the party’s seats in metro London. \n\nAnd Donald Trump’s 2024 victory seems to have produced a realignment in his direction. The Metropole-Minorities alliance is fading, as Hispanics, Asians, and, to a lesser extent, blacks have trended Republican. Kamala Harris’s 61-36 margin in the NY/DC/LA/SF Metropole is notably less than Hillary Clinton’s 65-30, while in the Heartland beyond, Trump increased his 49-45 plurality in 2016 to a 52-46 majority in 2024. \n\nA brilliant New York Times graphic shows that Trump has gained percentages in each of the last three elections in 1,433 counties with 42 million people, while his Democratic opponents have gained percentages three times in only 57 counties with 8 million people. As Jewish Insider’s Josh Kraushaar noted on X: “For years, the belief was Democrats have had demographic destiny on our side. Now, the inverse is true.”\n\nOne corollary of this largely unpredicted movement of Minorities away from Metropole attitudes and toward the Heartland is that the young, for Minorities tend to be younger than average, are moving that way too. \n\nPerhaps that helps account for the victory of Karl Nawrocki, who was trailing in pre-election polling and even in the exit poll in Poland. There’s polling evidence that young voters switched from the center Left in 2020 to the Right this time. Nawrocki may have been helped, or at least wasn’t hurt, by his May 1 Oval Office visit or by elite efforts to disqualify populist candidates in Romania and Germany. \n\nAt the same time, the map of last weekend’s Polish election results looks almost identical to those from 2005 to 2020. And they’re correlated with historic patterns. The center-right party wins areas within the pre-1914 tsarist Russia empire, minus the large cities of Warsaw and Lodz. The center Left wins those areas within pre-1914 Germany. The strongest Right areas are in southeast Poland, along the Ukrainian border, which were in pre-1914 Austria, the only one of those multi-ethnic empires with a Catholic monarch.\n\nAll of which is to say that the Metropole plus Minority versus Heartland pattern does not apply everywhere, and history still has its claims on many voters. But we’re watching some new electoral history being made, with no clear end in sight.","summary":"You see the same pattern over much of the world.

Trump also called Leo a \"sleazebag.\"\"Why would President Trump turn his back on one of his greatest, if not his greatest achievements from the first term, appointing three justices,\" John Yoo told a Wall Street Journal Opinion podcast released Monday.Newsweek reached out to Yoo for comment via email and filed a contact request form with the Federalist Society on Wednesday.Why It Matters Last week Trump sharply criticized the influential legal group the Federalist Society and Leo, a co-chair of its board and former executive vice president, blaming them for court rulings that blocked his sweeping tariff agenda.During his first term, Trump took advice from the group in selecting judges, but in a social media post on Thursday, the president took a sharp turn against the group saying he used to trust them \"but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real 'sleazebag' named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.\"Trump has repeatedly targeted judges and lawyers who oppose him or impede his agenda, including calling for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg after he temporarily blocked deportation flights to El Salvador in March. At the same time, Trump has had a lasting impact on the judiciary, helping to shape a conservative-leaning bench through his appointments.What To Know In Monday's episode of the Wall Street Journal Opinion podcast, Potomac Watch, Yoo said it was \"truly outrageous to accuse Leonard Leo, one of the stalwarts or the conservative movement, of being something like a traitor and using judicial appointments to advance his own personal agenda.\"The University of California at Berkeley law professor and constitutional scholar who authored the 2020 book Defender in Chief: Donald Trump's Fight for Presidential Power, reiterated that not only did he find Trump's decision to call out Leo and the Federalist Society \"outrageous,\" but noted that \"on a larger political and legal level, I don't understand it.\"Trump's Truth Social post calling out Leo and the group, read, \"I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations,\" followed a ruling on Wednesday from the U.S. Court of International Trade striking down many of his administration's sweeping tariffs. The three judges on the panel, which ruled that the tariffs went beyond the president's power, included one who was appointed by Trump during his first term—Judge Timothy Reif.However on Thursday, a federal appeals court temporarily suspended the lower court's order, allowing the White House to continue collecting import levies for now.Yoo continued: \"Why would President Trump turn his back on one of his greatest, if not his greatest achievements from the first term, appointing three justices. You named them, Paul, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, which reinforced Justices Alito and Thomas on the Supreme Court in building a really solid regionalist majority, not a conservative majority, not politically Republican majority, but a majority that believes in interpreting the Constitution based on its original meaning.\"The Supreme Court's conservative majority has played a pivotal role in recent decisions, most notably the 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that had protected abortion rights for nearly 50 years.Leo is a key financial backer of the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), which filed a legal challenge against Trump's tariffs. A longtime leader at the Federalist Society, Leo used his networks to help Trump nominate conservative Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Coney Barrett.Yoo has been outspoken against Democratic politicians including former President Joe Biden and spoken favorably about Trump, having previously called for Republican district attorneys to prosecute Democrat officials who had, in his opinion, wronged Trump and his allies, as well as saying Biden's suggested Supreme Court reforms were a \"political ploy\" that revealed \"how radical some of the ideas that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden now are pressing.\"What People Are Saying Mike Davis, founder of the Article III Project, told The Hill: \"They [the Federalist Society] abandoned President Trump during the lawfare against him. And not only did they abandon him — they had several FedSoc leaders who participated in the lawfare and threw gas on the fire.\"Leonard Leo told The New York Post in late May: \"I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved. There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy.\"Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, responded to last Wednesday's ruling on X: \"The judicial coup is out of control.\"Raúl Torrez, the attorney general of New Mexico—one of the states who sued over the tariffs—said in a statement to Newsweek after the ruling: \"This ruling is a major victory for our communities, our businesses, and our economy. The Court's decision confirms what we have long argued: these tariffs were imposed unlawfully and will cause real harm to working families, small businesses, and local industries.\"What Happens Next The plaintiffs in the case that led the Court of International Trade to strike down tariffs have to file their papers with a federal appellate court by June 5. The government must reply by June 9.In the meantime, the U.S. is expecting several final offers from trade partners over individually negotiated deals.","summary":"John Yoo reacts to the president turning on legal conservatives following a pivotal tariff ruling.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-clerk-warns-donald-trump-outrageous-2080860","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2656659/john-yoo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 15:22:46","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.063},{"id":328126626,"title":"Nolte: Dying CNN Crashes to 374K Viewers, Fox News Tops ABC, CBS, NBC","text":"CNN, a far-left propaganda outlet that spreads disinformation and promotes violence against Jews, hit an astonishing ratings low during the week of May 26 to June 1.\n\nCNNLOL averaged only 374,000 primetime viewers, which is six times — six times — lower than the Fox News Channel average of 2.3 million primetime viewers.\n\nFox News topped all three broadcast networks during the week of May 26-30.

The trial is currently in its fourth week.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan say that over two decades Combs coerced women, including his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, to take part in drug-fueled sexual acts.\n\nCombs' lawyers have acknowledged he was at times abusive in domestic relationships, but argue that women who took part in 'Freak Offs' did so consensually.\n\nInternet trolls have baselessly linked Diddy's alleged crimes to some America's biggest names including Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

The pair also worked together on an album.\n\nThe viral video showed the pair standing next to each other while Diddy stated: 'He's having 48 hours with Diddy, where we hanging out and what we're doing we can't really disclose. But it's definitely a 15-year-old's dream.' \n\nHe added: 'I have been given custody of him. He's signed to Usher and I had legal guardianship of Usher when he did his first album. \n\n'I don't have legal guardianship of him [Bieber] but for the next 48 hours he's with me and we're gonna go full crazy.' \n\nDuring the clip, Bieber offered simple responses to Combs - such as saying 'yeah' and also 'full crazy.' \n\nBut Bieber, 31, has insisted he wasn't targeted by the rapper.\n\nThe singer's spokesperson told TMZ last month: 'Although Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims, there are individuals who were genuinely harmed by him. Shifting focus away from this reality detracts from the justice these victims rightfully deserve.'\n\nIn regards to the videos of the pair together, insiders told the news outlet that the interactions were simply 'performative' - and explained Bieber was closer to the rapper's sons than to Sean. \n\nDIDDY'S MANSION SPARED FROM RAMPANT LA FIRES\n\nWhen a series of deadly wildfires tore through southern California in January, conspiracy theorists made baseless claims the infernos were started to 'cover up' Diddy's alleged sex crimes - and protect any allies he may have left\n\nDiddy's lavish house in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles, a few miles east of Beverly Hills, was untouched by the devastating fires\n\nWhen a series of deadly wildfires tore through southern California in January, conspiracy theorists made baseless claims the infernos were started to 'cover up' Diddy's alleged sex crimes - and protect any allies he may have left.\n\nDiddy's lavish house in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles, a few miles east of Beverly Hills, was untouched by the devastating fires.\n\nBut many celebrities who live in or near the Pacific Palisades area - anywhere from five to 50 miles away from Holmby Hills - did lose their homes.\n\nFormer government official Catherine Austin Fitts ramped up the theory by asking how many people connected to Diddy have avoided their homes being destroyed.\n\n'In situations like [the L.A. fires], I look at patterns,' Fitts said on her podcast. \n\n'I look at some of the communities involved. How many of the homeowners were on the P. Diddy list?'\n\nThe Diddy list is said to name all celebrities accused of attending parties hosted by the rapper where he is alleged to abused. The list has not been verified.\n\nThere are also wild claims about the fires being started to destroy evidence and even a network of tunnels from Diddy's home to other properties including the Playboy mansion and even Michael Jackson's home.\n\nThere are claims that this was a joke online.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS WENT TO DIDDY'S FREAK-OFFS\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris (pictured last month) was linked to Diddy in the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election\n\nPresident Donald Trump even shared a meme featuring a doctored image of Harris and Diddy to his Truth Social platform, saying: 'Madam vice president, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?'\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris was linked to Diddy in the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election thanks to a resurfaced tweet.\n\nHarris, during her run for the White House in 2019, praised Diddy for hosting a town hall on racial inequality for her campaign. \n\n'There's a lot at stake for our communities right now and it's critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities,' the tweet read. \n\nBut conservatives jumped at the opportunity to bring up the old tweet, with some pointing out 'this didn't age well...' \n\nPresident Donald Trump even shared a meme featuring a doctored image of Harris and Diddy to his Truth Social platform, saying: 'Madam vice president, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?'\n\nBEYONCE AND JAY-Z RAN CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE WITH DIDDY\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z were baselessly accused of being involved in a criminal enterprise with Diddy last year by a guest on Piers Morgan's Uncensored show. Beyonce is pictured with Combs and her husband Jay-Z in 2004\n\nJay-Z came under fire after he was accused in a lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old alongside Combs after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. The complaint was dismissed by the alleged victim's attorney in February this year. Diddy and Jay-Z are pictured in 2020\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z were baselessly accused of being involved in a criminal enterprise with Diddy last year.\n\nThe allegations surfaced on Piers Morgan's Uncensored show when singer Jaguar Wright, who appeared as a guest on the program, suggested the pair had committed crimes similar to those of which Diddy has been accused.\n\nWright told the media personality she had been 'screaming' that 'Diddy and Jay-Z are 'monsters' for four years.\n\nBut Morgan was forced to issue an apology to the famous couple after their lawyers contacted him, saying the allegations were 'totally false and have no basis in fact'.\n\nWright's claims, which Morgan said would 'have an audience with or without shows like mine', were edited out of the program, BBC reported.\n\nMorgan also apologized, saying: 'Editing interviews is not something we do lightly at a show called Uncensored. But like the proverbial cries of 'fire' in a crowded theatre, there are legal limits on us, too. And we apologize to Jay-Z and Beyoncé.'\n\nJay-Z also came under fire after he was accused in a lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old alongside Combs after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. \n\nThe complaint was dismissed by the alleged victim's attorney in February this year.\n\nThe 99 problems hitmaker released a statement after the suit was dropped, saying: 'Today is a victory. The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere. \n\n'The fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims. I would not wish this experience on anyone.' \n\nWILL SMITH SOLD HIS DAUGHTER TO DIDDY \n\nA fake news story, based on no evidence whatsoever, went viral in October last year, alleging that Will Smith sold his daughter Willow Smith to Diddy (pictured with Will in 2004)\n\nOne conspiracy theorist even peddled an allegation that the children's mother Jada Pinkett Smith sold Jaden Smith to the rapper. Pictured in 2022: Jada Pinkett Smith, Willow Smith, Will Smith, Jaden Smith and Trey Smith\n\nA fake news story, based on no evidence whatsoever, went viral in October last year, alleging that Will Smith sold his daughter Willow Smith to Diddy.\n\nThe article featured a doctored image of Willow, 23, and the rap mogul in bed together, prompting widespread speculation that she had been harmed by Diddy.\n\nInternet sleuths posted lengthy videos claiming that there was 'deeply unsettling' 'leaked footage' showing both Willow and her older brother Jaden, 26, in 'compromising situations' with Diddy.\n\nOne conspiracy theorist even peddled an allegation that the children's mother Jada Pinkett Smith sold Jaden to the rapper.\n\nThere is no evidence to support any of the allegations about the Smith family.\n\nDIDDY HAS FOOTAGE OF BARACK OBAMA \n\nConspiracy theorists quickly looped Former President Barack Obama into the Diddy dialogue after the disgraced rapper was arrested last year and footage of them together resurfaced\n\nObama first crossed paths with Diddy in 2004 when the music mogul rallied support for Democrats ahead of that year's DNC. This included Diddy interviewing Obama for MTV, (pictured) where the politician praised the rapper for encouraging people to get out the vote\n\nConspiracy theorists quickly looped Former President Barack Obama into the Diddy dialogue after the disgraced rapper was arrested last year and an image of them together resurfaced.\n\nConservative influencer Charlie Kirk discussed the pair's connection on his web show, even baselessly questioning: 'Maybe P. Diddy has footage of Barack Obama doing something he shouldn't have been doing?'\n\nObama first crossed paths with Diddy in 2004 when the music mogul rallied support for Democrats ahead of that year's DNC. This included Diddy interviewing Obama for MTV, where Obama praised the rapper for encouraging people to get out the vote.\n\nAs Diddy's wealth soared to over $700 million through the noughties, he became a top celebrity backer for the Democrats and used his platform to back the party in several election cycles.\n\nIn 2004, this saw Diddy interview both Obama - then a candidate for the senate in Illinois - and Hillary Clinton.\n\nFootage of Diddy's brief interview with Obama, which was widely circulated in wake of the rapper's arrest, saw the politician praised the Diddy's efforts 'because he doesn't have to do this.'\n\n'This is part of what is important about giving back,' the young Obama said.\n\nTheir exchange appeared jovial, as Diddy made fun of Obama sweating at the convention as he said he 'wanted to apologize for not sweating' while Obama jokingly padded his head with a napkin.\n\nDiddy would go on to support Obama's successful run for the White House in 2008, including hosting a 'Last Chance for Change' rally for the then-candidate in Florida days before the election.\n\nObama was bizarrely named in Diddy's ongoing federal trial in shocking testimony about drug-taking at the rapper's infamous 'freak off' parties.\n\nDiddy's former personal assistant David James testified that A-listers would pop pills including Percocet and ecstasy at the parties.\n\nHe did not say Obama was ever in attendance at the parties - but said celebrities would celebrate with 'various pills in the shape of the former president's face', the court heard.\n\nPRINCE'S SECRET RECORDING\n\nJust last month a rumor circulated online that federal prosecutors presented a secret recording of Prince exposing Diddy as evidence in the rapper's trial. Pictured are Prince and Diddy talking at the 2007 NBA All-Star Game\n\nJust last month a rumor circulated online that federal prosecutors presented a secret recording of Prince exposing Diddy as evidence in the rapper's trial.\n\nThe rumor alleged that Prince, before his death, divulged details of the alleged illicit activities from Diddy's parties.\n\nHe also warned 'if something happens to me, this recording needs to go to the press or the police, either one', according to the theory.\n\nBut the alleged video or audio recording never surfaced. \n\nAI-generated content claiming to be a 'Prince & 'Diddy' video' has been shared online, but factcheckers on sites like YouTube have added disclaimers that the footage is 'altered or synthetic content'.\n\nPrince was mentioned in the Diddy trial by Cassie Ventura who, in her testimony, said she fled a party at the musician's house just before Diddy assaulted her at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\nPrince died on April 21, 2016. The coroner ruled that the seven-time Grammy-winner died from an accidental fentanyl overdose.\n\nKIM PORTER'S LOST WORDS \n\nDiddy's ex-girlfriend Kimberly Porter was tied to the trial from beyond the grave after the publication of a fabricated salacious memoir that purported to tell the story of an abusive relationship between the pair\n\nDiddy's ex-girlfriend Kimberly Porter was tied to the trial from beyond the grave after the publication of a fabricated salacious memoir that purported to tell the story of an abusive relationship between the pair.\n\nPorter and Combs' children denounced the 59-page book - titled Kim's Lost Words: A journey for justice, from the other side... - as a complete fabrication after it became a bestseller on Amazon in September last year.\n\n'We were made aware of a dispute regarding this title and have notified the publisher,' an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. 'The book is not currently available for sale in our store.'\n\nThe independent publisher is Todd Christopher Guzze, who goes by the name Chris Todd and defines his occupation as an 'investigative producer, author and journalist.'\n\nTodd told The Associated Press in a phone interview in September that sources 'very close to Kim and Sean Combs' provided him with a 'flash drive, documents and tapes' from Porter that he eventually pieced together to create the memoir.\n\nTodd used the pseudonym Jamal T. Millwood when publishing the title. The name is an apparent reference to a conspiracy theory involving rapper Tupac Shakur, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996.\n\nThe theory baselessly claims that Tupac faked his death and was using the alias Jamal T. Millwood.\n\nDiddyKamala HarrisJay-ZObamaPrince\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nREVEALED: The wildest Diddy conspiracy theories to emerge from his trial as celebs fear they will be named next\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Internet trolls have baselessly tried to connect some of America's biggest names, from Barack Obama and Kamala Harris to Beyoncé and Jay-Z, to Diddy's alleged misconduct.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14777285/diddy-conspiracy-theories-sex-trafficking-trial.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/04/15/99037311-0-image-m-70_1749046074933.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/16/8906076064412287338/1024x576_MP4_8906076064412287338.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-04 14:29:21","author":"Editor,Natasha Anderson","authors":["Editor","Natasha Anderson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.032},{"id":328101618,"title":"Schumer Attacks Trump for Repeating Obama's Iran Diplomacy","text":"President Donald Trump wants a deal. The Iranian government wants a deal. The American and Iranian people all want a deal. And there's a deal on the table. But Sen. Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.) is not happy with it.\n\n\"When it comes to negotiating with the terrorist government of Iran, Trump's all over the lot. One day he sounds tough, the next day he's backing off,\" Schumer said in a video message posted to X on Monday night. He accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff of negotiating \"a secret side deal\" that \"lets Iran get away with everything\" and claimed that \"TACO Trump\"—an acronym for \"Trump Always Chickens Out\"—is \"already folding.\"\n\nSchumer clarified on Facebook that he was responding to a report in Axios, confirmed on Tuesday by The New York Times, that the Trump administration had proposed an interim deal to avoid a nuclear crisis. Under the reported terms of the offer, Iran would give up its domestic nuclear program in exchange for joining an international uranium enrichment consortium.\n\nIt's not even likely that Iran will accept the deal currently on the table. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei told an audience on Wednesday that \"the plan that the Americans have presented is 100 percent opposed to [the slogan] we can do it.\" But Schumer seems to oppose negotiations on a deeper level. His video sounded awfully similar to attacks levied by hawkish Republicans against the Obama and Biden administrations during their negotiations with Iran.\n\nWhen Iran diluted its enriched uranium and released American hostages in August 2023, three Republican members of Congress accused then-President Joe Biden of a \"secret agreement\" that \"threatens U.S. national security.\" And when former President Barack Obama reached his own deal to restrain the Iranian nuclear program, Republican lawmakers claimed that he was being \"fleeced\" in \"secret side-deals.\"\n\nTo be fair to Schumer, he has consistently been on Republicans' side, stating in 2015 that \"the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great.\" Some Republican opponents of the deal at the time insisted that they only wanted a better deal, only to come out in favor of war in later years.\n\nThe dilemma that Trump, Biden, and Obama all faced is the same. Iran has a nuclear program that could be used to build weapons in the future—it is the \"only non-nuclear-weapon state\" to produce large quantities of 60 percent enriched uranium, according to a recent report by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency—an outcome the United States has promised to stop by force. Getting Iran to voluntarily give up its nuclear capabilities would require offering serious incentives, and many members of Congress clearly prefer war over concessions.\n\nBut the American people prefer a deal over a war. A poll published by the University of Maryland last month shows that 69 percent of Americans, including 64 percent of Republicans, prefer to resolve the Iranian nuclear crisis with a negotiated deal, and only 14 percent of Americans want a war with Iran. So do Iranians, for that matter. Polling from last year shows that Iranians want a nuclear deal due to the economic cost of isolation.\n\nThe issue is partially self-inflicted for Trump. Obama had successfully negotiated a deal in 2015 that would put the Iranian nuclear program under international control in exchange for lifting the U.S. economic embargo against Iran. Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018, claiming that he could get a better deal through pressure. Instead, the U.S. and Iran escalated to the brink of war, and the Iranian nuclear program has continued with no limits for nearly a decade.\n\nUnlike in 2015, when congressional Republicans voted unanimously against the deal, a large part of the Republican coalition now seems to favor diplomacy. Conservative media personalities such as Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, and Charlie Kirk have been loudly warning against the threat of war.\n\n\"Didn't we learn our lesson when we went to war in Iraq and killed Saddam Hussein because of 'weapons of mass destruction?' Did we ever find any?\" asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R–Ga.) in a long screed on X last month.\n\nOn the other hand, some Democrats have taken up a strategy of trying to out-hawk Trump on foreign policy. During the 2024 election, Kamala Harris' campaign attacked Trump for failing to \"respond\" hard enough to Iran during his first term and criticizing economic sanctions. During the confirmation hearing for Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby in March, several Democrats joined Sen. Tom Cotton (R–Ark.) in attacking Trump's diplomatic \"capitulations.\"\n\nAnother wrinkle is that Iran's archenemy, Israel, has reportedly prepared to attack the Iranian nuclear program no matter what the U.S. does. The Iranian government has said that it would consider the U.S. a \"participant\" in any Israeli attack and respond accordingly. Trump publicly warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to attack Iran \"because we're very close to a solution.\"\n\nAttacking Trump's diplomacy makes sense for Schumer from both perspectives. On one hand, he's portraying Democrats as the tougher party on national security. On the other, he's shoring up his pro-Israel credentials. (\"My job is to keep the left pro-Israel,\" Schumer told The New York Times earlier this year.) Yet he's swimming against the tide of his own base—and overwhelming public opinion—to do so.\n\nHarris' former foreign policy adviser, Phil Gordon, had a slightly different view on how Democrats should approach the issue: \"We should focus our outrage on the many genuinely outrageous aspects of Trump's foreign policy, and if he happens to get a nuclear deal that is in our interest we should support it.\"","summary":"Democrats keep trying to out-hawk Republicans, even though the mood in America has shifted toward diplomacy.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/06/04/schumer-attacks-trump-for-repeating-obamas-iran-diplomacy/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/06/zumaglobalsixteen062278-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 14:17:48","author":"Autumn Billings,Matthew Petti","authors":["Autumn Billings","Matthew Petti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":328077364,"title":"JD Vance attacks Harvard University's ideological landscape","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n3 Play Sameday June 04, 2025 02:00 \n\n JD Vance attacks Harvard University's ideological landscape \n Vice President JD Vance predicted that 95% of Harvard's faculty voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris as he challenged the ideological diversity of the school while at the American Compass annual gala. \n Tags V-VIDEOPOLITICS","summary":"Vice President JD Vance predicted that 95% of Harvard&apos;s faculty voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris as he challenged the ideological diversity of the school while at the American Compass annual gala.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6373865537112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/fac088f7-df91-4d79-916c-e2226bae98af/a69f1bef-a1e6-472f-9cd9-e0a11768a1f4/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 14:00:35","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.267},{"id":328059338,"title":"Opinion | Why Is Anti-Semitism Cool Now?","text":"After 20 months of relentless demonisation of Israel, people in the West, especially mainstream media, are now feigning surprise at the rising number of attacks on Jewish events—and Jews—in US! If that is not egregious, what is? A majority of the student body across universities, besides sizeable section of the entire young cohort there today, has been convinced that it is cool, and righteous, to chant for the destruction of Israel and, by extension, Jews anywhere.\nIndian-American student Megha Vemuri using the platform of a commencement event last week to lash out at her alma mater Massachusetts Institute of Technology over its ties with Israel and praise the campus protests about Gaza, wearing a keffiyeh over her graduation gown, is just the latest example of the impact of this widespread indoctrination. It just goes to show that even education often has very little to do with common sense or powers of discernment.\nThis week, a Muslim Egyptian who came to the US as a tourist but stayed on after his visa expired, attacked people demonstrating at a mall demanding the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. He used a flamethrower to cause horrific burn injuries to 12 people and shouted, “Free Palestine”. Two weeks earlier, a 30-year-old man pumped 21 bullets into two people at the National Jewish Museum in Washington DC and also later screamed “Free Palestine”.\nIn April, a man set fire to the home of Democrat Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro (once considered as a running mate for Kamala Harris in 2024) with Molotov cocktails while the family was inside celebrating the Jewish ritual of Passover. The man admitted he targeted Shapiro because of his views on Gaza. Yet, incredibly, media reports averred that “law enforcement officials have not conclusively said his alleged attack was motivated by hate or anti-Semitism”!\nAnd to think that not even a century has elapsed since the murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazis made anti-Semitism verboten worldwide. This turnaround has been achieved by sustained slanted mainstream media reportage on Gaza. Apart from omitting context, gullible minds have been swayed via media and social media that Israel is not reacting to a murderous attack by Hamas, a known terror group, on its innocent citizens and sovereignty but is driven by Islamophobia.\n\nThis happens when obvious questions are deliberately not asked. The most long-standing of this ask-not-tell-not charade relates to death tolls and Israel’s choice of targets. “Reporters” (all Palestinians) reel off death tolls and show bodies (especially of children), but do not mention the extensive tunnels found under Gaza, including under hospitals, stocked with food, medicines and weapons. That begs the obvious unasked question: how did these items get there unaided?\n\nMoreover, why are Hamas-run ‘health ministry’ casualty numbers of Israeli Defence Force attacks taken as truth even though they do not specify how many are its own cadres? Foreign doctors shown on TV attending to injured children and women also minister to Hamas cadres who access hospitals through tunnel networks. Why are these doctors not asked about the health of the hostages who are still alive or how Hamas manages to get medical treatment for its men?\n\nThat points to another deliberate silence: on distribution of food and medicines in Gaza. The current refrain is that “civilians” are on the brink of starvation and a “humanitarian crisis” and that the US and Israeli-managed new distribution system there is an abject failure. Media is magnifying the assertion that unless the same entities who were dispensing aid there before, particularly the discredited UN Relief and Works Agency, are allowed to do so again, Gazans are doomed.\n\nThe questions never asked or probed include, what proof is there that aid was not being diverted to terrorists of Hamas, that runs Gaza? How did Hamas get supplies after Israeli attacks began, unless from UNRWA? Are the armed gangs waylaying food trucks really independents or Hamas proxies? No questions about the condition of the few Israeli hostages still alive, nor any media investigation into how the rest died, or why Hamas has refused to hand over their bodies.\n\nThe skewed rules have been set, of course, by the blatantly biased coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Hours were and still are devoted to the vilification of Vladimir Putin and hailing every speech of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with no nuances. The impression disseminated is that all Ukrainians support their president. Is such unanimity possible in a democracy? Dissent is taken as a given in Russia—a known autocracy—but none is assumed in “free” Ukraine?\n\nPhone surveys in Ukraine (including by The Economist, whose findings on India are invariably grim) claim Zelenskyy’s approval now stands at 67-70 per cent. Yet for Putin, whose popularity also hovers at 70-90 per cent, qualifiers are added, such as “His high approval ratings do not necessarily reflect genuine loyalty or agreement with his policies. Instead, they result from political apathy, symbolic allegiance, and lack of viable alternatives.” Why this Volod-Vlad double standard?\n\nZelenskyy’s unending demands for more and more sophisticated arms are not parsed as war mongering; in fact, he has attained a Nelson Mandela-like star status with front row seats at every world leaders’ jamboree. Realistic assessments of either Russia’s war effort or popular opinion there. For example. the Atlantic Council, in two reports 11 months apart in 2024, first contended that most Russians want the war to end but later recanted and said most support it. That raises serious doubts about the sources of western information on Russia.\n\nIndia has also been relegated to the Russia-Israel doghouse by the western media, which unleashed a similar biased coverage campaign on, first, the terror attack in Pahalgam and then India’s Operation Sindoor retaliatory strikes Pakistan’s terror camps and military launchpads. The western media has been seeking out dissenting voices in India—but not in Pakistan. They have questioned all of India’s statements, even when provided proof of veracity but not Pakistan’s.\n\nSo, if any people should understand the danger of this sort of one-sided coverage and biased opinion-mongering, it is Indians. In the past decade, India has been the target of charges of all kinds from data-fudging to genocide, in sync with its rising profile. India’s economic credentials have been the focus of criticism and scepticism from the west for over a decade; the recent uptick in western media attacks on its geo-political moves, including Op Sindoor are thus expected.\n\nBeing afraid of Islam—a less used definition of Islamophobia—and Islamists and therefore being chary of measures to counter terror groups and radicals lest they are accused of the better-known definition of Islamophobia has made the west cede far too much ground on anti-Semitism. How much longer will activists be allowed to propagate false or exaggerated narratives on Gaza—its roots, its reality and its goals under Hamas—to capture impressionable hearts and minds?\nThe author is a freelance writer.

The artwork invited visitors to 'express their choices through participation'.\n\nNames on display include Kamala Harris, Queen Elizabeth, Mary Berry, Tina Turner and Marie Curie. \n\nBut the controversial children's author's name was spotted stitched over with blue and pink thread to cross it out. It's not clear who stitched over Rowling's name and if it was a different person to who sewed it on.\n\nJean Hatchet, a women's rights activist, walked over rope blocking the artwork and cleared up JK Rowling's name so it could be clearly visible once again.\n\nIn a post on X that has been viewed close to 120,000 times, she said: 'Injustice to JK Rowling corrected. Don’t erase the names of women from art or life.\n\n'Your member of staff calls the artwork \"damaged\" by us. Have you lost your goddamn minds? Apologise to women immediately.'\n\nThe Trust said: 'We are deeply disappointed that visitors tampered with this piece of art on Saturday.\n\n'It has been closed to new contributions since the end of November last year. While the artwork encourages consideration, debate and discussion, we ask that this is carried out in a respectful way.'\n\nJust days after the activist 'corrected' the name, the charity had completely covered up the art with a white sheet and a sign that reads: 'Unfortunately, the artwork has been tampered with by a member of the public. Please bear with us while we assess the piece and decide on the best course of action.'\n\nThe activist added: 'So, there was no issue that someone “tampered” with the embroidering of a woman’s name. \n\n'By contrast a woman - me - very carefully removing that hateful stitching with the correct tool and taking great time and care as can be seen - is guilty of something they need to cover up.'\n\nThe Trust's response has been dubbed 'stitchgate' and has sparked outrage from members who have threatened to cancel their membership.\n\n'It was not respectful to deface JK Rowling's name in the first place. It was right for the defacement to be removed. We have been members for over 30 years. I will be cancelling my membership,' one took to X to say.\n\nAnother said: 'During the pandemic, I took out membership of @nationaltrust. I am now cancelling it. Stitching over @jk_rowling name because they disagree with her support of women’s rights is the last straw.'\n\n'And as such I have \"respectfully\" cancelled the family membership that I've had for the last decade. Honestly, how dare you?,' a third complained.\n\nOlympian silver medalist Sharron Davies weighed in on the debate: 'I cancelled my membership to the years ago when they started apologies for Britain’s history & achievements.'\n\nWorkers at the foundation have stormed out in protest too: 'You've managed to lose two volunteers in Devon this morning who have spent years helping preserve the holiday home of one of our most famous female authors - all because you have attempted to erase another of our most famous female authors.'\n\nDerbyshire and Staffordshire's Women's Rights Network, who the National Trust is a member of, said they were 'upset' her name was crossed out but when their member saw this stitch work they raised a verbal complaint with the Hall’s curator. \n\nThey were told 'because it was someone’s view they felt the stitching should stay to respect that one person’s view. When asked where the respect was for the person who originally stitched the name, she could not answer,' according to Gender Blog. \n\n'Why it is acceptable to erase the name of renowned charity donor and women’s refuge provider JK Rowling, but then to cover up this piece now that her name is fully visible to all? An explanation is needed,' the said on X, calling on the Trust.\n\nThe activist group protested at the site placing stitching over their mouths and holding up a poster that says 'National Trust strikes out JK Rowling'.\n\nThe National Trust have been contacted for comment.\n\nIt comes after a long history of rows involving the charity where tens of thousands of National Trust members have quit their memberships as the public have grown fed up of their 'woke' antics.\n\nIt lost a staggering 89,000 members last year which will set you back £96, after they increased its prices this year by nearly six per cent. \n\nIn April, members were 'appalled' by the decision to hand back the running of a Tudor mansion to its previous owners after a £3.3million restoration was carried out.\n\nIt had been owned by the charity since 1946 before the Throckmorton family had requested to take back the running of Coughton Court in Alcester, Warwickshire, from February 2026.\n\nBut the announcement sparked a furious backlash from members who have been told they would then no longer be able to visit the country estate for free.\n\nCustomers also complained when in 2023 its calendar excluded Christmas and Easter, while including other religions' festivals.\n\nThe 'inclusivity and wellbeing' calendar, which was provided for volunteers, includes Hinduism's Diwali, and Islam's Eid and Ramadan - with no sign of Christian holidays.\n\nThe National Trust's chairman even blasted the organisation's 'woke' direction and vowed to not get embroiled in political rows.\n\nIt follows the Trust's embroilment in controversy in 2020 when accusations from rebel members said it was 'trampling on our history' by publishing a report into the colonialist history of its houses that was 'littered with inaccuracies'.\n\nThe charity was in a battle with splinter group Restore Trust, whose members were enraged by the way some of its properties had been 'blacklisted' over alleged links to colonialism and slavery.\n\nThe homes of Winston Churchill and Rudyard Kipling are among almost 100 National Trust properties which the charity called out to have links to slavery and colonialism.\n\nHowever, the National Trust still remains one of the largest landowners in the UK, with more than 500 historic properties, gardens and nature reserves and celebrated 130 years in January.","summary":"The National Trust has enraged its members by covering up an art piece about female empowerment when an activist restored JK Rowling 's name after it had been stitched over.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14779017/National-Trust-woke-stitches-JK-Rowling-artwork-activist-corrects.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/04/12/99031439-0-image-m-24_1749036115070.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 13:42:43","author":"Editor,Jada Bas","authors":["Editor","Jada Bas"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":328045812,"title":"Charlamagne grills Eric Swalwell on why Dems should be trusted after they 'lied to us so long' about Biden","text":"Radio host Charlamagne tha God spoke to Rep.

Boldness. Intelligence. Poise. But at a recent off-site corporate retreat, Disney’s current leader, Bob Iger, offered another piece of advice for a top-level executive: “You need to be more selfish.”\n\n What Iger meant, according to the source who relayed the comment, was that the execs vying to succeed him must be willing to go to extraordinary lengths to beat out their competitors. It might seem like odd advice coming from a leader with a public image as a smooth strategist whose roughest edge is that he works so hard, he showers in his office (sometimes twice). But as Iger himself has noted, when he ran ABC in the early 1990s, he employed what he called “soft autocracy” to push through ideas that met resistance. More recently, after hand-selecting Bob Chapek as his successor back in 2020, he spent the next two years undermining and outmaneuvering him behind the scenes, setting the stage for his own triumphant comeback. When it comes to advice about taking power, the man clearly knows what he’s talking about.\n\n But for the execs battling to succeed Iger, like entertainment co-head Dana Walden and parks honcho Josh D’Amaro, not to mention the whole cadre of Hollywood strivers eager for top jobs throughout town, being overly aggressive comes at the risk of looking desperate. You must be auditioning constantly but never overtly. As any outlet that covers Hollywood machinations knows, angry PR people working for top lieutenants call in a fury not only when their boss slips a rung on an executive power list but also when they are mentioned as a potential heir apparent. Because no one wants to risk looking like they are gunning for the crown before the king is ready to give it up.\n\n Welcome to Hollywood’s modern Game of Thrones. All across the entertainment industry, there are pitched power struggles quietly being waged for the top gigs at CAA, Sony, Lucasfilm and other power centers that will determine the leadership of Hollywood’s top institutions for years to come. That these are happening at a moment of precariousness for the industry writ large makes the stakes that much higher. But to many, it’s a struggle long overdue. As THR reported in an October cover story, “The Big Squeeze: Why Everyone in Hollywood Feels Stuck,” as top-level execs have seemed frozen in place, those in their 30s, 40s and even 50s have been lamenting the existence of a “gray ceiling” that they say has cheated them out of their big moment. But in recent months, some cracks in that gray ceiling have started to appear.\n\n Last year, across the U.S. economy, a record 2,221 CEOs stepped down, the highest level of turnover since 2002. In Hollywood, too, a generational turnover is happening — if too slowly for some — and it’s prompting all sorts of questions: What will this new cadre of leaders look like? How will they emulate the leaders who came before? And what will the metrics of success be in a town that’s reinventing itself?\n\n Thanks to recent transitions, a few answers have begun to emerge. Some ascensions have been smooth, as when in September the 70-year-old Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra announced that he would be stepping down to be replaced by 53-year-old Ravi Ahuja. Some more complicated: In March, UTA co-founder Jeremy Zimmer, 66, stepped aside as CEO, choosing David Kramer as his successor — but not on his timeline. And a week later, Endeavor’s $25 billion go-private deal with Silver Lake officially concluded the era of Ari Emanuel, 64, and Patrick Whitesell, 60, running WME — their long partnership ended in acrimony but their influence still looms large.\n\n Meanwhile, some top jobs remain up for grabs — at Disney, of course, but also at subsidiary Lucasfilm, where accomplished-yet-controversial CEO Kathleen Kennedy is expected to end her reign shortly after Iger ends his. And then there’s the ongoing Trump-imperiled merger between Paramount and Skydance, which when consummated will see 71-year-old Shari Redstone pass the torch to 42-year-old David Ellison. That leadership team is set … if they only had a company to run.\n\n When it comes to leadership transitions, success (or failure) is often measured by the chaos that follows. “Right now, with all the chaos in the industry, stability is like a drug,” says Terry Press, president of strategy and communications at Amblin Partners. “You want to be around it and you want to be in business with it.”\n\n To that end, Universal and Netflix have both executed succession with little public drama. In November, NBCUniversal elevated Donna Langley — first hired way back in 2001 — to chairman (no big surprise after TV was added to her longtime gig running Universal Pictures). Netflix, meanwhile, executed two major succession maneuvers during the past 15 years: 2020’s announcement that Ted Sarandos would join founder Reed Hastings as co-CEO and then, when Hastings stepped aside in 2023, the ascension of COO Greg Peters as Sarandos’ co-CEO. (While media gossips speculated that Peters’ promotion irked Sarandos, insiders say the two men have such different fiefdoms — Sarandos lords over Hollywood, while product-focused Peters is in Silicon Valley — that actual evidence of tension is slim.)\n\n Few entities have been able to pass the torch as smoothly. CAA, for example, has struggled to articulate what the future will look like should the three principals — co-chairman and CEO Bryan Lourd, co-chairman Kevin Huvane and co-chairman Richard Lovett — choose to exit after 30 years of shaping the most powerful talent agency in the world.\n\n “It’s the defining issue for the industry today, and we need to be thoughtful about it because there are repercussions,” says Jeff Berg, who from his perch running ICM from 1985 to 2012 had a front-row seat to the previous power shifts that shaped the industry for a generation. He notes that the film and television industry might be shrinking but the companies that dominate it have gotten bigger thanks to acquisitions, consolidation, globalization and private equity. “If you get succession wrong,” he says, “you can’t unring that bell for a while.”\n\n David Kramer, 56, had been waiting — patiently — in the wings. Three years earlier, UTA laid out the road map for what a post-Jeremy Zimmer era would look like when it announced that Kramer would be assuming the title of sole president, a role he previously had shared with Jay Sures. The announcement effectively anointed Kramer as the heir apparent and made it clear that his friend and co-president Sures, who had clashed with Zimmer, would not be getting the top job. The question then became, when would Zimmer actually leave?\n\n A year passed. Then two. Then three, and still there was no clear timeline for Zimmer’s departure. Agents began to whisper about when, exactly, he would step down. Then came, quite literally, a conflagration. Like thousands of others, Kramer, who lives in Pacific Palisades, was forced to evacuate his home following the Palisades Fire in January. He and his family were taken in by Sures, and the two lived under the same roof for several weeks, according to a number of sources. Two months later, it was announced — seemingly out of nowhere — that Zimmer would be stepping down as CEO. “The [timeline] was executed from the bottom up,” says a UTA source who declined to speculate on whether Kramer and Sures had hastened Zimmer’s exit when the latter two were living together. At the agency, “There was utter unanimity about [the plan], and David is being celebrated. Is that a coup? I don’t know. But Jeremy didn’t get to choose the moment it happened,” says this source.\n\n Adds a top agent who is in his late 50s: “Power is not given. It’s seized. It’s not something that’s gently passed on, and that’s from time immemorial.” This agent contends that the generation that has run Hollywood for decades was hungrier and more aggressive than the one that followed. “To any of the 47-year-olds out there who are wondering what the fuck happened to their careers? My response to them is: Why didn’t you push harder? Maybe this group turned out to be ill-equipped to seize it.”\n\n Or maybe the Hollywood culture has just changed too much to make that kind of Machiavellian behavior viable. In recent years, Hollywood has lost some of its mojo. Decades of consolidation, a pandemic, two strikes and a pivot to streaming have resulted in a much smaller industry with fewer top jobs and less money sloshing around. The culture has changed, too. Algorithmic tech companies dominate. Data prevails over instinct and experience. Many of the much-caricatured qualities that used to be hallmarks of Hollywood power are now recognized as toxic. The personalities that now run this town are much different than the swashbuckling moguls who came before.\n\n Take Zimmer, for example. He came up at a time when the industry was full of swaggering personalities like the late Brad Grey, Barry Diller, Amy Pascal and Michael Ovitz. Like them, Zimmer is known as a tough and savvy operator who as a boss could be both condescending but also wildly charismatic. His successor, Kramer, meanwhile, is as close to a universally beloved figure as you can find in this town.\n\n A similar phenomenon has taken place at WME. Emanuel and Whitesell are larger-than-life. But agency co-chairmen Richard Weitz, 56, and Christian Muirhead, 45, who themselves report to the disciplined, operationally focused WME Group president Mark Shapiro, 56, are steady, calm, almost gentle (a term rarely associated with agents). They’re not exactly the dictatorial desk-pounding types, and some wonder if a softer style can work in a cutthroat industry: “If you want to stay in power for decades, you have to run an oppressive system, even if it’s subtle,” says a manager. “Power must be concentrated, and there has to be a level of fear. At WME, you did not cross Ari, and at CAA, you still do not cross Bryan, and there had to be repercussions for people who violated that.”\n\n (And here it’s worth noting that Emanuel and Whitesell, no longer on speaking terms, aren’t exactly relinquishing their industry clout. Emanuel, who still manages a few clients, is CEO of TKO Group Holdings, owner of WWE and the Ultimate Fighting Challenge. Whitesell launched WIN Sports Group, taking the NFL talent representation business of WME — and both men are walking away from the agency business several hundred million dollars richer.)\n\n “Richard and Christian are pursuing a different strategy,” says a WME source. “They’re more about the collective and trying to set people up for success. Previous leadership was much more self-interested, reflecting the era they were raised in — what was going to get them to the top. “\n\n Producer Amy Baer, who started her career at CAA before becoming president of CBS Films, says: “The film and TV business has changed so drastically that I don’t know the profile of the next generation of leaders. There are so many big open questions. It used to be easy to see who would get the top jobs because the way movies and television were made and distributed was predictable. Nothing is predictable anymore.”\n\n Maybe that unpredictability offers some small excuse as to how Disney botched things so badly on Iger’s first exit. Needless to say, the do-over is now the most watched succession game in town (and maybe the world). Wanting to avoid another debacle, in January the Disney board added James Gorman, chairman emeritus of Morgan Stanley, to oversee the search, which remains opaque even to high-level Disney insiders.\n\n Still, sources say that D’Amaro — the parks and experiences chief — is now in pole position. The 54-year-old already was overseeing a $60 billion expansion of the parks business before Abu Dhabi — Disney’s first new park since 2016 — was announced in May. He also is overseeing Disney’s expansion into video games via a billion-dollar deal with Epic (the maker of Fortnite), which Iger views as a legacy project.\n\n One hurdle for D’Amaro is the continuing fallout from Chapek’s disastrous run. Before his ascension, he also was the parks guy, and that showed in his inability to communicate with top Hollywood talent and their gatekeepers. D’Amaro has publicly tried to highlight the personal relationships he has with creatives to try to preempt that criticism. By contrast, Walden, the longtime television executive who has been rumored as a potential frontrunner since Iger returned, is a popular well-known figure within Hollywood’s talent community. As Disney’s first female CEO, her appointment also would carry major symbolic weight. One impediment for Walden, however, is her close friendship with Kamala Harris (which had been a boon just a few years ago). Given the vindictiveness of the Trump administration, it’s hard not to see the relationship as a potential liability, unfair as that may be.\n\n Rounding out the shortlist of top internal candidates are Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, and ESPN honcho Jimmy Pitaro. The 58-year-old Bergman is a company man, having joined back in 1996, and is regarded as sharp and skilled at overseeing a portfolio that includes Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney Animation and Lucasfilm. But replacing Iger — an unmatched brand ambassador who looks like talent — probably requires a magnetism that Bergman can’t match (a liability he’s said to be aware of).\n\n “This is the problem at Disney: How can you expect someone from theme parks to understand the process of making television and film? And how can you expect someone from television and film to understand how to work with the Chinese government?” says Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. “What’s the old saying — nobody knows anything. In this case, it’s nobody knows everything.”\n\n As much as Hollywood likes to celebrate its buccaneer spirit, random events have played just as big of a role in determining who gets to rule. The 1994 helicopter crash that killed former Disney president Frank Wells would shape the industry for decades. Michael Eisner, Wells’ No. 2 at the time, elevated himself to president, which led the then-43-year-old Jeffrey Katzenberg to leave Disney and later co-found DreamWorks. With Katzenberg gone, Eisner hired a 48-year-old Ovitz, who had co-founded CAA with Ron Meyer, to be his lieutenant. When Meyer left CAA to run Universal, it opened a leadership vacuum that was filled by a group of young agents that included Lourd, Huvane and Lovett.\n\n Rick Nicita was one of these so-called “Young Turks” who took over CAA. “It was an unwieldy succession plan, and I’m not quite sure how thought-out it was, but it was a plan,” he says. “And we were too young and naive at the time to think that we couldn’t do it.” Over time, the original nine were whittled down to three, leaving Lourd, Huvane and Lovett in charge. They have given no indication that they plan to step aside anytime soon.\n\n “The idea that there’s any succession plan at CAA is an illusion,” says a president of production at a major studio who is on the phone every day with at least one CAA agent. “You can sense it from everyone you talk to over there. Everything is in service of Bryan Lourd.” Another veteran questions why they should feel any pressure to leave: “The company is theirs so they can do what they want.”\n\n Some sources contend that the creation of internal boards within CAA spawned inflated titles for a handful of top agents, implying that a new batch of leaders was on the verge of taking the reins. That hasn’t happened. Others accuse Lourd and Huvane of playing one generation of top agents against the next. “They have done that for 31 years and it absolutely works,” says a former top agent.\n\n Not long ago, the shortlist of potential successors included mostly agents on the talent side: Maha Dakhil (Tom Cruise, Natalie Portman), Joel Lubin (Taylor Sheridan, Glen Powell) and Franklin Latt (Pedro Pascal, Zendaya), along with Ida Ziniti (Steven Spielberg, Margot Robbie) and her husband, John Garvey (Chris Hemsworth, Rian Johnson). But with scripted content contracting and their sports business on the ascent, one source speculates the co-heads of sports, Howie Nuchow and Michael Levine, are in the mix.\n\n Dakhil, who has one of the best client lists in town, was long considered a prime leader in waiting. But in 2023, she was suspended from her leadership roles within the agency after she posted a captioned photo on Instagram that accused Israel of “genocide,” which she promptly took down and apologized for. She since has regained her footing, but some insiders believe the episode bought the principals more time to maintain the status quo.\n\n “It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy,” says a source who recently left the agency. “If you don’t empower and help the next generation grow, it reinforces the idea in Bryan and Kevin’s head that they’re the only ones who can do the job. And so of course then they can’t leave.”\n\n When discussing the difficulty of selecting new leadership in an embattled industry, one name comes up often: Jason Kilar.\n\n Kilar was appointed Warner-Media’s CEO in May 2020, near the middle of AT&T’s brief three-year ownership of the studio. With his degree from Harvard Business School and a tech-heavy CV, the 48-year-old came in with a mandate to shake things up. Sure, he had worked at Hulu, which gave him streaming experience, but he did not come up within the traditional confines of the film and television industry. These days, his two-year tenure running WarnerMedia is mostly remembered for Project Popcorn, the pandemic-era decision to release WarnerMedia’s entire 2021 slate of films simultaneously in theaters and on streaming. The move was intended to boost subscriptions to then-fledgling HBO Max. And it did. But Project Popcorn came at a steep cost — and not just in the form of forfeited box office. It strained relations with the agencies and infuriated top talent like Christopher Nolan, who set up his next film (the massive hit Oppenheimer) at rival Universal. Warners is still dealing with Project Popcorn’s fallout.\n\n Kilar’s bold moves and harsh comeuppance beg the question: In an age of uncertainty, should Hollywood look to innovative but potentially disruptive outsiders or elevate from within?\n\n “Hollywood has always been much more tradition-bound than people think. It has its own rhythms,” says Nicita. “If the tenet now is to move fast and break things, that’s not exactly in sync with the famous phrase ‘the past is prologue,’ which still applies to the movie business.”\n\n Barry Diller concurs. “Hiring from the outside at the CEO level is an admission of failure,” says the IAC chairman and former Paramount boss. “Ideally, you bring someone in early in their career and they marinate in your enterprise, gain experience and succeed whoever is senior. That’s by far the better process. Bringing in a CEO whom you don’t know — and I don’t care how many hours you interview someone, you don’t know them — is a bad dice throw and rarely works.”\n\n Lucasfilm seems likely to follow that path in replacing Kennedy. Despite speculation about outside candidates, including former 20th Century head Emma Watts, insiders say the company seems most likely to promote from within. The current thinking is a scenario where chief creative officer Dave Filoni and production head Carrie Beck — both Lucasfilm vets — take co-head roles. Even as an arm of Disney, Lucasfilm remains, in many ways, a family business, and as a George Lucas protégé Filoni long has been considered a golden boy. But the knock against him is that he might be too steeped in Star Wars lore and risks steering a show into dense mythology that loses a broader audience. “He’s not the Andor guy, he’s the Ahsoka guy,” says one Disney insider. Beck, who joined the company in 2012, knows the ins and outs, but neither she nor Filoni has much film experience, which could be mitigated by Kennedy’s continued presence as a producer on certain Star Wars projects, ensuring quality control in the short term.\n\n Sony went the other way — looking outside. When Vinciquerra stepped down in January, he quietly executed his own succession plan, having recruited Ahuja in 2021, a year after he abruptly left Disney in the aftermath of the Disney-Fox merger. Now Ahuja has a succession saga to sort out himself — at Sony’s film studio.\n\n In May, he seemed to table the issue when he reupped 70-year-old movie boss Tom Rothman for several more years. According to insiders, Ahuja still believes in Rothman and wasn’t keen on a big shake-up, not when the studio has momentum, is profitable and is about to undertake the ambitious and risky move of releasing all four of Sam Mendes’ Beatles films in April 2028.\n\n The bigger question inside the studio is what Ahuja thinks of Rothman’s two top lieutenants, Motion Picture Group co-presidents Josh Greenstein, who focuses on marketing and distribution, and Sanford Panitch, who focuses on production. In the past year, Greenstein has told numerous people that he’d likely leave Sony if Rothman were reupped. One scenario that’s been floated is Greenstein reuniting with his friend and Skydance owner David Ellison after the Skydance-Paramount merger. Whether there’s a place for Greenstein remains to be seen. Ellison has selected former NBCUniversal bigwig Jeff Shell as president, Dana Goldberg to run the film side and former Netflix content chief Cindy Holland to run Paramount+.\n\n Of course, all of them will answer to Ellison. Because, even in Hollywood, the one sure way to own the throne is to buy the kingdom.\n\n Rebecca Keegan, Borys Kit, Pamela McClintock and Alex Weprin contributed to this report. \n\n This story appeared in the June 4 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

With all of the ballots counted, Lee won almost 50% of the vote, ahead of his conservative rival Kim Moon-soo on 41%. He takes over a country that is deeply divided along gender lines. \n\nLee’s campaign effectively channelled voter anger. He focused on resetting South Korea’s politics after impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was from the same party as Kim, unleashed chaos by declaring martial law in December 2024. \n\nHowever, gender conflict has continued, subtly but powerfully, to shape voter behaviour, campaign strategies and the national debate about who is to blame for the lack of opportunities in South Korea for young men.\n\nThe election took place three years after Yoon pipped Lee to the presidency by just a quarter of a million votes – the closest margin in the country’s history. Yoon’s victory was, as has been noted by researcher Kyungja Jung, “the epitome of the utilisation of gender wars”. \n\nA key part of Yoon’s strategy was fostering a sense among young Korean men that it was now them, rather than women, who were the victims of discrimination. He secured 59% of the vote from men in their 20s and 53% from men in their 30s. Just 34% of women in their 20s supported him.\n\nIn the latest election, gender was everywhere and nowhere all at once. On the one hand, not a single candidate put forward a meaningful policy to address structural gender discrimination in the workplace, domestic violence or public sexual harassment. \n\nNone even mentioned the gaping absence of women candidates, despite thousands of mostly young women having filled the streets demanding democracy after Yoon’s martial law declaration. It was the first time in nearly 20 years that not a single woman stood among the contenders for the highest role in the country.\n\nLee, positioning himself as the consensus candidate, attempted to neutralise gender as a campaign issue. When reporters asked him whether he would announce any women-related pledges, he said: “Why do you keep dividing men and women? They are all Koreans.” \n\nHis remark may sound inclusive. But it signals a strategy to declare the gender issue off-limits for the sake of the greater good, thus sidestepping the specific inequalities that continue to divide the country. It’s a form of unity by erasure. \n\nLee Jun-seok of the right-wing Reform party, on the other hand, tried to resurrect the same playbook that delivered Yoon to power in 2022. He attempted to provoke, polarise and win the loyalty of disaffected young men. \n\nAs Yoon had done three years ago, he called for the abolition of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. And during a televised debate, he asked: “If someone says they want to stick chopsticks into women’s genitals, would that count as misogyny?” The question was a nod to a controversial online remark Lee Jae-myung’s son had made years earlier. \n\nLee Jun-seok’s comment drew widespread condemnation and, ultimately, he only scraped about 7.7% of the total vote. This included over 37% of men in their 20s, while 58% of women in the same age group backed Lee Jae-myung. Gender is a highly political matter in South Korea whichever way you look at it.\n\nGender wars\n\nThis gender divide is now one of the most consistent features of South Korean politics. Women are vocal and visible in public to safeguard not just their own rights, but also South Korea’s democracy. \n\nYet populist politicians have cultivated a perception among young men – squeezed by stagnant wages, fierce competition over jobs and social expectations – that their diminishing opportunities are due to policies they see as favouring women. \n\nThis has resulted in many young South Korean men seeing feminism not as a movement for equality but as an obstacle to their own progress. In reality, their struggle has less to do with gender and more to do with structural inequalities in income and opportunity for all young Koreans.\n\nAs Kyungja Jung observed in a paper from 2024: “Misogyny becomes an outlet for their [South Korean men’s] frustration and masculinity crisis as they search for a scapegoat for their struggles in neoliberal society. They blame women rather than the neoliberal economy.”\n\nYoung people even from the best universities in Korea feel they cannot compete in the job market no matter what they do. South Korea now has one of the highest rates of young people not in education, employment or training among the OECD countries. This has given rise to the so-called “N-Po” generation, who feel so disadvantaged that they have given up on all future dreams of marriage, family and a career. \n\nSouth Korea isn’t alone in mobilising backlash against feminism and gender equality. Around the globe, gender has become one of the major fault lines in politics. In the November 2024 US election, Donald Trump led among young men by 14 points, while Kamala Harris had an 18-point edge with young women. \n\nMeanwhile, self-described misogynist Andrew Tate continues to shape young male attitudes online. And in Italy, Giorgia Meloni rose to power on a far-right platform that, despite being a woman herself, reduces women to their roles as mothers and homemakers.\n\nOne model for change in South Korea could be to introduce quotas for women in politics to make their voices heard. Women only occupy around 20% of the 300 seats in South Korea’s National Assembly, trailing well behind the global (27.2%) and Asian (22.1%) averages. If women are not in politics making decisions about themselves, then their voices will not be heard beyond the streets.\n\nLee Jae-myung’s win has given South Korea a moment to breathe. But the fault lines remain. When an entire demographic, be it young men or women, feels systematically unheard or structurally discriminated against, opportunistic voices can move in to fill the void. \n\nGender is political. Ignoring it may be just as risky as confronting it head-on.","summary":"Gender conflict subtly but powerfully shaped South Korea’s election.","url":"https://theconversation.com/south-korea-election-lee-jae-myung-takes-over-a-country-split-by-gender-politics-257923","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/672161/original/file-20250604-56-wuoinh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C7081%2C3540&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 12:24:47","author":"Associate Professor Korean Society and Culture,Curtin University,Director of Korea Research & Engagement Centre,Lund University; Joanna Elfving-Hwang,Ming Gao,Research Scholar of East Asia Studies","authors":["Associate Professor Korean Society and Culture","Curtin University","Director of Korea Research & Engagement Centre","Lund University; Joanna Elfving-Hwang","Ming Gao","Research Scholar of East Asia Studies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.119},{"id":327995756,"title":"Barabak: Yelling and finger-pointing at California Democratic Party convention","text":"It’s not easy being a Democrat in these Trumpian times, as each day brings fresh tales of conquest and pillage.\n\nStill, despite all that, 4,000 stiff-upper-lipped partisans showed up in Anaheim, California, over the weekend, seeking solace, inspiration and a winning way forward.\n\nAs mouse-eared pilgrims plied the sidewalks outside, the party faithful — meeting several long blocks from Disneyland — engaged in their own bit of escapism and magical thinking.\n\n“Joy is an act of resistance,” state party Chairman Rusty Hicks gamely suggested at a beer-and-wine reception, which opened the party’s annual three-day convention with as much conviviality as the downtrodden could muster.\n\nThat’s certainly one way to cope.\n\nBut the weekend gathering wasn’t all hand-wringing and liquid refreshment.\n\nThere were workshops on top of workshops, caucus meetings on top of caucus meetings and speaker after speaker, wielding various iterations of the words “fight” and “resist” and dropping enough f-bombs to blow decorum and restraint clear to kingdom come.\n\nPresident Trump — the devil himself, to those roiling inside the hall — was derided as a “punk,” “the orange oligarch,” a small-fisted bully, the “thing that sits in the White House” and assorted unprintable epithets.\n\nOut of the wilderness\n\n“My fellow Golden State Democrats, we are the party of FDR and JFK, of Pat Brown and the incomparable Nancy Pelosi,” said a not-so-mild-mannered Sen. Adam Schiff. “We do not capitulate. We do not concede. California does not cower. Not now, not ever. We say to bullies, you can go f— yourself.”\n\nThe road from political exile, many Democrats seemed to feel, is richly paved with four-letter words.\n\nTwo of the party’s 2028 presidential prospects were on hand. (Another of those — Gov. Gavin Newsom — has fallen out of favor with many of his fellow California Democrats and found it best to stay away.)\n\nA highly caffeinated New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, of 25-hour filibuster fame, summoned past glories and urged Democrats to find their way back to the party’s grounding principles, then fight from there.\n\n“We are here because of people who stood up when they were told to sit down. We’re here because of people who spoke up when they were told to be silent. We’re here because of people who marched in front of fire hoses and dogs,” Booker hollered in his best preacherly cadence. “We are here because of people who faced outrageous obstacles and still banded together and said we shall overcome.”\n\nTim Walz, the party’s 2024 vice presidential nominee and the weekend’s keynote speaker, was on hand after jetting from a morning appearance in South Carolina. He delivered the most thorough and substantive remarks.\n\nHe began with a brief acknowledgment and thanks to his 2024 running mate, Kamala Harris. (She, too, stayed away from the convention while pondering her political future. The former vice president’s sole presence was a three-minute video most noteworthy for its drab production and Harris’ passion-free delivery.)\n\nBy contrast, Walz gleefully tore into Trump, saying his only animating impulses were corruption and greed. He noted the callous hard-heartedness the president and his allies displayed during California’s horrific January firestorm.\n\n“They played a game, a blame game, and they put out misinformation about an incredibly tragic situation,” Minnesota’s governor said. “They didn’t have the backs of the firefighters. They didn’t hustle to get you the help you needed. They hung you out to dry.”\nKeeping with the weekend’s expletive-laden spirit, Walz blasted Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bull—” legislation and mocked congressional Republicans as the “merry band of dips—” who lend him their undying support.\n\nBut much of his 30-minute speech was devoted to flaying his own party — “like a deer … in goddamned headlights” — saying Democrats can blame only themselves for being so feckless and off-putting they made the odious Trump seem preferable by comparison.\n\n“There is an appetite out there across this country to govern with courage and competency, to call crap where it is, to not be afraid, to make a mistake about things, but to show people who you truly are and that they don’t have to wonder who the Democratic Party is,” Walz said to a roaring ovation.\n\nPrescriptions aplenty\n\n“Are you going to go to a cocktail party with somebody who’s super rich and then pass a law that benefits them?” he demanded. “[Or] are you going to work your ass off and make sure our kids get a good education?”\n\nAnd yet for all the cursing and swagger and bluster, there was an unmistakable air of anxiety pervading the glassy convention center. This is a party in need of repair and many, from the convention floor to the hospitality suites, acknowledged as much.\n\nAlex Dersh, a 27-year-old first-time delegate from San Jose, said his young peers — “shocked by Trump’s election” — were especially eager for change.\n\nThey just can’t agree, he said, on what that should be.\n\nIndeed, there were seemingly as many prescriptions on offer in Anaheim as there were delegates. (More than 3,500 by official count.)\n\nAnita Scuri, 75, a retired Sacramento attorney attending her third or fourth convention, suggested the party needs to get back to basics by speaking plainly — she said nothing about profanity — and focusing on people’s pocketbooks.\n\n“It’s the economy, stupid,” she said, recycling the message of Bill Clinton’s winning 1992 campaign. “It’s focusing on the lives people are living.”\n\nGary Borsos said Democrats need to stop dumbing-down their message and also quit harping on the president.\n\n“There’s a lot of ‘Trump is bad,’ ” said the 74-year-old retired software engineer, who rode eight hours by train from Arroyo Grande to attend his first convention.\n\n“What we’re doing is coming up with a lot of Band-Aid solutions to problems of the day,” Borsos said. “We’re not thinking long-term enough.”\n\nNeither, however, expressed great confidence in their party going forward.\n\n“I’m hopeful,” Scuri said. “Not optimistic.”\n\nMark Z.

Now She’s America’s Favorite Punch Line. What Happened?","text":"Nothing unites everyone on the internet quite like a shared villain, but the woman who sang “I Kissed a Girl” certainly seemed like an unlikely candidate. No longer! It’s pretty easy to make fun of Katy Perry lately, so much so that even the Wendy’s X account has been dunking on her. “Can we send her back,” Wendy’s replied to a post in April about Perry’s participation in a Jeff Bezos–funded minuteslong trip to space. Perry—net worth in the hundreds of millions, owner of a music catalog worth $225 million, recipient of countless platinum records, proprietor of a shoe line, and, these days, headliner of a worldwide tour—can’t catch a break even from the company that tried to make square patties happen.\n\nConsider, too, a typical scene from her new “Lifetimes” tour. Starting in Mexico, crisscrossing the United States, Canada, and Europe before finishing in Abu Dhabi, this is her first tour in seven years. In May, I attended one of her first U.S. stops, in Oklahoma City. The show was well attended and still undeniably awkward, like the part when Perry invited an 11-year-old onstage to perform with her. Perry presented the girl with her shoe, which looked as if it were trapped in a hurricane of cotton candy. “Want some?” she asked, pulling off a piece of what did seem to be real candy. The kid stared back at her, confused and overwhelmed, unsure if she was supposed to … eat this famous woman’s shoe? During the fan-choice portion of the show, a QR code flashed on the screen for audience members to pick which deep-cut track they wanted Perry to sing. The link didn’t work for me or for those around me. “Did you vote?” Perry asked the audience of thousands when she came back out onstage, her eyes wide with disappointment when we yelled back that we had not. “No? Why not? It was the Wi-Fi? Oh, it’s always that.”\n\nIt is a brutalizing thing to age as a pop star. For Britney Spears, it meant a public mental-health crisis and a rash of criticism about everything from her nails to her weight to her dancing. For Jennifer Lopez, it meant plenty of conjecture about her marriages, her plastic surgery, her authenticity. For Madonna, it meant years and years (ongoing) of scorn about her looks and sinewy arms and oversexualized stage performance. The over-40 pop star is a relatively new advancement in our cultural age, and so far, few manage it with grace—Beyoncé and Lady Gaga stand out as perhaps the rare exceptions, and only after one of them was accused of faking a pregnancy and the other of hiding a penis. But is anyone handling it worse than Katy Perry?\n\nHer latest album, 143, is her worst-performing record except for her Katy Hudson debut in 2001. It debuted at just sixth on the Billboard charts and slid off the charts after just two weeks. (2010’s Teenage Dream, her greatest critical and commercial success, spent 400 weeks on the charts.) “The material here is so devoid of anything distinguishing that it makes one suspicious it’s a troll or cynical attempt,” noted a 4.5/10 Pitchfork review. “143 is a spectacular flop, but it’s a strange one—like one of those restaurants that looks nice and has an expensive menu but serves food so mid as to be insulting.”\n\nPerry, now 40, is at a crossroads. Her albums have been mostly duds, her once ubiquitous videos are increasingly forgotten or just extremely regrettable (a fat girl eats a basketball in the “Swish Swish” video, Jesus Christ), and her time as an American Idol judge served only to make her less relevant. Nothing Perry has touched since Teenage Dream has hit the charts, our culture, or our consciousness in quite the same way.\n\nWell, except maybe her misguided venture into space. Even before the launch of her tour, she’s been the butt of an extended joke across the world and across the internet. TikTok in particular is a veritable graveyard of Perry gags about her unnecessary space adventure, mockery that her tickets aren’t selling very well, and jabs about how bad her dancing is. Perry is still a sellable act—at her recent sold-out Chicago stop, she told the thunderous crowd, “Well, I thought I was the most hated person on the internet!”—but as of this writing, there are still plentiful tickets to her Madison Square Garden show in August.\n\nHer real trouble, however, started earlier. For her new album, Perry chose to team back up with Dr. Luke, the very same producer sued by Kesha more than a decade ago for sexual assault, battery, and harassment. (They settled out of court in 2023, with Dr. Luke still denying Kesha’s original claims.) He was the same writer-producer she worked with for Teenage Dream, so you could almost see the logic, but the reunion was a particularly poor choice for this album’s theme: Perry’s contemporary songs about female empowerment were in part created with a man who has been accused of disempowering Perry’s female co-workers in one of the worst ways possible. Her support of Kamala Harris’ girlboss political campaign (and Hillary Clinton’s too) felt desultory as a result. While painting herself as a progressive in public, Perry has been palling around with people like Jeff Bezos in private (and, also, in public).\n\nSome pop stars live in dualities. Perry lives in contradictions. Lately, people are noticing. To be a pop star is to accept your position as too sincere, too sexy, too silly, too young, too old, just too much. For a while, Perry was able to sidestep this mortification with a deceptively simple trait: a sense of humor. What set 2010 Perry apart wasn’t her big blue eyes or her breasts or her voice, though they were all helpful in launching her into the stratosphere. What made her unique was her ability to make a joke—about herself, about the absurd world around all of us, and even about her audience. Her music was ironic, a jab in the side of men who wanted a pinup doll instead of a real woman, and a friendly wink to girls who knew that they could always be cute but wanted a little bit more than just that. We used to laugh with Perry, with her whipped cream–filled tits, her who, me? Betty Boop sexuality, her loose disdain for men in songs like “Ur So Gay,” a track that has otherwise aged horrendously. There have always been criticisms about whether Perry is a good singer or a good performer, but for a long time, she was undoubtedly a good pop star. She never took herself—or her stardom—too seriously.\n\nThe rub is that over time, that sense of humor has been misdirected, misfired, and, eventually, lost entirely. All the while, her audience has changed dramatically, no longer in need of this particular kind of escapist poptimism.\n\nIt’s all amounted to a world where there is no room—or need—for a star like Perry. Three years ago at her Las Vegas residency, Perry performed “California Gurls” while perched on man-sized toilet paper rolls as an anthropomorphic turd danced inside a pool-sized orange toilet. It was so, so stupid, but it was still funny, bizarre, and compelling enough to keep watching. These days, Perry is holding a flower in space and crying about it. Katy Perry used to be the one making the joke. Now? We’re laughing right in her face.\n\nBorn to Pentecostal pastors in Santa Barbara, Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson was carted around the country as a kid while her parents set up churches. The couple were notoriously strict, allowing the kids to watch only the Trinity Broadcasting Network or conservative news. According to their daughter, her parents’ religiosity bordered on the paranoid: “I was never allowed to call deviled eggs ‘deviled eggs,’ ” Perry told NPR in 2013. She started singing in her family’s church at 13, before releasing her debut as Katy Hudson with a self-titled gospel album. At 17, she moved to L.A. to work on more-secular tunes.\n\nWhen Perry started out, she was more like Alanis Morissette than Madonna. You can hear that in her 2008 song “Thinking of You,” which has recently gone viral on TikTok for the absolute meal Perry makes out of the words surprise center. Like a lot of pop acts, Perry started as more of a folk act, slowly finding an audience with a bright personality, a lively stage presence, and a public persona that was all about a good time, all the time.\n\nFootage of Perry’s contemporaneous show in her 2012 documentary Part of Me looks like a Kidz Bop concert rather than a show for grown-ups. Indeed, a lot of Perry’s audience has always been young girls, and so her performance always spoke to them first. Her clothes were candy-coated, her stage was splashed in neons, and she mastered adorkable when that meant something. This year’s “Lifetimes” tour is slightly more mature as a public performance, but only by virtue of being more choreographed, more controlled, and more expensive. Perry plays a futuristic warrior who has to battle through different levels of a video game to defeat an evil technological creature who’s trying to destroy the world. TikTok has posited that Perry seems sleepy and disengaged during her shows, but real fans know we were never here for the choreography. “She’s not a good dancer. She’s not a good singer,” said Levi Taylor, a 32-year-old Katy Kat. “It’s amazing she’s created a career out of not being either of those things because she’s just been herself. She’s a performer!”\n\nI heard Taylor wax poetic about Perry on the sidewalk outside the Paycom Center, in Oklahoma City, an hour before the show. He was giving his friend an impassioned speech about why Perry had brought a flower with her into space: “People don’t get it. It was for her daughter. Her daughter is named Daisy. What do people want?”\n\nTaylor, a local clad in psychedelic mushroom earrings and a T-shirt from Perry’s much-maligned and mostly forgotten Smile era (big stan behavior), thinks Perry has just become an easy target. “Katy’s been an artist for 25-plus years. It’s going to be messy,” Taylor told me. “All this shitty stuff aside, she’s an artist who always finds joy.”\n\nAt her peak, her songs were perfect summer earworms or propulsive, satisfying ballads. But what also made Perry so fun to watch back during her “I Kissed a Girl” era was how well she seemed to understand the internet outrage machine. She leaned into the agita around her queerbaiting with her lyrics, her music videos, and with her broader persona. In recent Trump-dominated years, the idea of “bimbofication” has gained traction, a kind of intersectional feminism itself in which women and girls reserve the right to be sexy, misandrist, and clever. Back in 2008, Perry’s success was a kind of response to the Paris Hiltons and Heidi Montags of the world, who were bimbo-influencers before it was widely embraced—Perry could be hot and sly. She wasn’t going full #GirlBoss, nor was she burning her bras and demanding equal pay. Not full bimbo, and not quite an intellectual, Perry occupied a complex third position of a guy’s girl and a girl’s girl. Later, her feud with Taylor Swift would obfuscate just how friendly she was to other women, but even they famously made up in a Swift music video while dressed up as a burger and fries. You can get away with a lot if you do it with a punch line.\n\nThe mistake Perry made was when she started trying to teach us a lesson. After a few years playing a ditzy but winking brunette, Perry started to pivot into message-first pop music. 2013’s Prism was still fun and flashy, but with an undertone of needless import. The debut single, “Roar,” was a fight anthem for girls who thought Sara Bareilles’ “Brave” was too aggressive. While still reviewed favorably by critics, Prism was also when fans started to notice some of Perry’s more offensive stunts, like how she shows up in cornrows in her video for “This Is How We Do” while smacking gum. Eventually, she embarked on a mini–apology tour: “I won’t ever understand some of those things because of who I am,” she told DeRay McKesson in 2017. “But I can educate myself, and that’s what I’m trying to do along the way.” It was another in a litany of Perry misfires, including when she dressed up as a geisha for the American Music Awards. Pop music with intention is a fine pursuit, but it falls flat if your history is riddled with myopia. Perry was faltering at the same time our culture was moving toward a demand for more accountability—from men, from the police, from the government, and even from our ignoble pop stars.\n\nBy 2017—during Trump’s first term—Perry tried again, with Witness. When she released “Chained to the Rhythm,” a dance-pop anthem that semi-chastises its audience for seeking distractions from modern-day pain, she dubbed it “purposeful pop.” Most people who listened to it deemed it merely condescending. Witness’ cover says it all: Perry, covering her eyes, her mouth open to reveal a bright blue eyeball in her mouth. Perry said that the record was inspired in part by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss. “There was a lot of noise about me taking a stand because I was a neutral girl for a while,” Perry said of Witness. “My friend DeRay says, ‘Don’t focus on the king—focus on the kingdom.’ ”\n\nPerry wanted to still be the funny girl, but she also wanted to be profound. While “Bigger Than Me” was a song supposedly inspired by one of the most devastating political losses in American history (until, well, you know), she was also yukking it up in her visuals. In “Bon Appétit,” Perry is placed in front of a bunch of pastry chefs kneading her ass and showering her in mirepoix. Meanwhile, the video for “Swish Swish” betrays someone who has lost the upper hand in her comedy: Perry and a host of D-list internet celebrities play basketball against a team of burly men, the video periodically interrupted by references to memes and celebrity cameos from Molly Shannon, Rob Gronkowski, and Terry Crews (as well as Nicki Minaj, seemingly green-screened in). The song sucks and the video is perplexing, but worse, it’s routinely cruel toward fat people—in 2017 Perry was still making the kinds of jokes you’d have rolled your eyes at in 2007. Most of the video’s crummiest gags revolve around Christine Sydelko, a viral TikTokker whose name in the video is “Shaquille O’Meals.” Sydelko allegedly didn’t know that her entire involvement in the video would be just a bunch of fat jokes.\n\nIt’s not that being a pop-star scold doesn’t work. (Perry’s earlier influence Alanis Morissette did it very well for a while there in the ’90s.) It’s also clear that Perry hasn’t totally lost her grip on what’s funny and campy. It’s that combining the two postures—funny girl, big thinker—means she alienated audiences seeking more substantial art and audiences who just want to laugh and dance. As the culture turned toward something more serious and heady, she wanted to make that pivot too. In hindsight, everything from 2017 seems so heavy and earnest and, frankly, pointless. No wonder Perry couldn’t quite get the tone right.\n\nIn the “Eterniti” pit at the “Lifetimes” show in Oklahoma City, the crowd seemed evenly split between 11-year-old girls with their very game parents and 45-year-old men with “Blue Lives Matter” hats. The disparity was confusing until you asked around: At this particular stop, the foundation Vet Tix had gifted more than 1,000 veterans discounted tickets to the show—around $4 a pop for many of them. “That usually means it’s not selling well,” a Vet Tix beneficiary serenely told me after Rebecca Black, Perry’s opener, left the stage. (He called her “discount Sabrina Carpenter,” which his wife evidently did not like. “You have daughters,” she said, scolding him and slapping him on the arm.)\n\nThe venue expected 10,000 attendees in its 15,000-person arena, and even though many of the concertgoers were adult men with no knowledge of the Perry catalog, the thousands of preteen and teenage girls in the crowd made for an earsplitting audience. Security winced through every teenage screech, even with earplugs.\n\nThroughout the Paycom Center, girls were dressed up either in Taylor Swift runoff clothes (white cowboy boots, bedazzled dresses, denim jackets, and friendship bracelets—I’m sure Perry would love that) or in Perry cosplay. Some arrived dressed as the candy dots Perry wore in the “California Gurls” video, or in grass skirts à la “Roar,” or as Kathy Beth, Perry’s loser alter ego in “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),” headgear and all.\n\nBut even those showing up in their Friday-night best couldn’t quite muster up much enthusiasm for Perry when asked. A group of eight work friends had come to the show together in matching “Lifetimes” shirts. They still wouldn’t admit to being big fans. “We just thought it was fun,” one of them told me while waiting in line to take a photo in front of a 6-foot-tall illuminated Katy Perry installation. Several attendees had gotten their tickets that day, citing the cheap price. A 17-year-old had come with her mom and sister, seemingly dressed up for the occasion in a sequin skirt and a sweep of blush. Despite being on her way to a Katy Perry concert, she rolled her eyes into oblivion at my idiotic questions about why she liked Katy Perry. “I don’t really,” she said. “It’s just, like, something to do.” Her mom had gotten their tickets that day, for around $60 each, up in the nosebleeds. A Katy Perry concert is certainly something to do, but unlike a Taylor Swift concert, it is not very cool to talk about it.\n\nNo one here, for example, was especially enamored of Perry’s space expedition. “My husband is a pilot, and I know how much work that takes,” one woman told me, walking toward the merch line for a $50 tank top. “She’s not an astronaut.” Two 11-year-old girls with front-row seats, vibrating with excitement over their first concert, were still unimpressed about the jaunt to space. “It was stupid,” one said, adjusting her baby-pink iridescent T-shirt. “She could have given that money to animals.”\n\nIt’s worth comparing the Perry we got in interviews from a decade ago with the Perry we got in her post–space exploration interview earlier this spring. Perry in 2015, when interviewed about her forthcoming Super Bowl appearance, cutely quoted Marshawn Lynch, saying, “I’m just here so I don’t get fined.” Meanwhile, postspace Perry was speaking in a word salad so impossible to understand that you have to read the whole thing to even wrap your head around its meaninglessness: “I feel super connected to love. This experience has shown me you never know how much love is inside of you, how much love you have to give, and how loved you are until the day you launch.” She thanked NBC News—with what seemed like genuine gratitude and humility—when it congratulated her for becoming an “astronaut,” an accomplishment that typically requires a master’s degree and 1,000 hours of aircraft experience. She was still holding on to the daisy she had brought for her daughter (to … space). She seemed almost like the kind of character that 2015 Perry might parody in a music video: a beautiful woman floating off into space, divorced from every single reality happening on Earth.\n\nGoing to space didn’t just betray Perry as a sincere dork—it also revealed her to be a hypocrite. While plenty of Democrats glad-hand with billionaires, Perry’s version of it—hanging out with Bezos on election night, taking him up on the offer to go skyward and framing it as a feminist cause—was at odds with her work for the Harris campaign. In October 2024, Bezos killed a Harris endorsement from the Washington Post, the paper he owns. In November, 24 hours before Harris would lose the election, Perry performed at her Pittsburgh rally. “I’ve always known her to fight for the most vulnerable, to speak up for the voiceless, to protect our rights as women to make decisions about our own bodies,” she said of Harris during her performance. “I know she will protect my daughter’s future and your children’s future and our families’ future.”\n\nBetween those two events? Perry’s Orient Express–themed 40th birthday party in Venice, where Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sánchez, were present. They actually hang out a lot; Sánchez’s 24-year-old model son, Nikko Gonzalez, goes skydiving with Orlando Bloom, Perry’s husband. Midtour, Perry flew to Paris for Sánchez’s bachelorette party.\n\nPerry isn’t the first or only or last celebrity to mingle with the uberrich while wearing the skin of a progressive. Beyoncé, too, campaigned for Harris while on the verge of billionairedom herself. (Her husband is already one, twice over.) But Perry has spent years staking her reputation on being a social renegade, someone who rebuffed her parents’ conservatism and religious fervor. She stumped for abortion and gay rights, she vacationed with the guy who killed a Harris endorsement in his own paper, and she has been entirely silent about Harris’ loss or Trump’s actions since he returned to office.\n\nIn truth, though, Perry’s progressive politics have always been flimsy. For the 2022 L.A. mayoral race, she proudly voted for Rick Caruso, a billionaire who spent more than $100 million (mostly of his own money) to lose to Karen Bass. Perry, despite her own staunchly pro-abortion stance (in public, at least), was backing a candidate who had donated to anti-abortion groups and who had plans to “end street homelessness” while also operating several luxury apartment complexes with no affordable housing.\n\nStill, Perry hasn’t handled anything as badly as she has handled her continued working relationship with Dr. Luke. In 2023 singer Kesha and Dr. Luke reached a settlement after almost 10 years of lawsuits between the two of them stemming from allegations she made that he drugged and raped her, and his consequential claim that she defamed him. A year later, Perry announced she would be working with Dr. Luke on 143. Kesha tweeted, seemingly in response, “lol.”\n\nIt’s already gauche to work with a producer accused of raping a fellow pop star, but it’s especially off-kilter considering that the first song that came from this Dr. Luke–produced record was “Woman’s World.” Released a few months before Harris would lose the election, Perry’s uninspired, insipid reheating of 2008 pop feminism met a political climate that seemed to disagree with the song’s very message. The Guardian gave it one star, writing, “It sounds less like a roar of triumph than the echoing cry of someone falling down a large ravine.” If you’re going to work with someone who’s been accused of harming women, it’s perhaps ill advised to have that work be a feminist anthem. But this kind of disjunction has become endemic to Perry’s career.\n\nIn Oklahoma City, plenty of her fans weren’t plugged in enough to know about Dr. Luke, or about the song’s production credits, or about Perry’s political and personal associations. The ones who were aware seemed downright pragmatic about it. “If every single dollar you had to spend had to be accountable to some social issue, you would not be able to spend one dollar in America,” 35-year-old Stephen Fitzsimmons said while walking into the concert. “I just want to see her sing ‘Firework.’ ”\n\nAnd Perry gave Fitzsimmons exactly what he wanted. When she emerged from the undercarriage of the stage, connected to futuristic-looking wires like an intergalactic science experiment, singing weakly into a microphone with a butterfly on the end of it, her audience was with her, screaming. Perry transmuted into exactly what she’s known for: not a singer, not a dancer, but a performer.\n\nThis crowd knew every word of all her classics, and when she played something more recent, attendees were still gamely dancing on their feet. Go to a Perry concert, bop along with little girls hyperventilating because they’re mere feet from her and adult men who have no fucking clue what’s going on, and it will feel impossible to reconcile this kind of enthusiasm with the culture’s dismissal of Perry and her power. Even as her message got muddled—which, to be clear, the show’s message certainly did—her audience still loves her. For these fans, it wasn’t necessarily ever about just being funny or quirky or sexy or clever or cute. She was so sincere, so truly and firmly herself, so willing to dance around like a dork onstage, that she’s still laudable. They believed, through and through, that Perry is just being herself, and facing consequences for it.\n\nPerry’s fans and detractors alike think they know her and see her clearly. Of all the footage that betrays Perry’s essence, one clip from her 2012 documentary comes up again and again among her supporters. Sitting in a makeup chair before a stadium show in Brazil, Perry weeps while her staff whispers around her. Her then husband, Russell Brand, now accused of sexual assault multiple times over, broke up with her over text right before she was set to perform. For true-blue Katy Kats, this moment is emblematic of what makes Perry worth rooting for: Despite her devastation, she pulls it together, sobbing all the way to the stage but then performing without missing a beat. She’s just like us, picking up the pieces of her heart and doing her job anyway.\n\nBut what feels even more emblematic of who Perry is as a performer is a recent pep talk she gave her team before one of her shows. It’s simple, it’s lightly disillusioned, and it’s exactly right. “You know this is just a fun game, right? Don’t be so serious. This is entertainment; this is show business; we’re storytelling. You’re having fun. You don’t have to be perfect,” she said. It’s another very 2025 lesson: Nothing is that important, because this is all for fun. There are real tragedies around. Perry knows exactly who she is and what she’s here for.\n\n“When you’re perfect, consider yourself dead,” she says, before guiding her team out onstage in front of thousands of excited fans, and even more strangers on the internet ready to call her a loser. “We are not dead tonight: We are living.”","summary":"It goes far deeper than a certain flight to “space.”","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2025/06/katy-perry-tour-concert-2025-space-blue-origin.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/0a2817b8-7963-446a-9b29-ae840f625fdc.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 09:45:00","author":"Scaachi Koul","authors":["Scaachi Koul"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":327955870,"title":"CBS anchor Margaret Brennan's latest dust-up with administration official adds to Trump lawsuit drama","text":"\"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan has repeatedly been shamed on-air by Republicans, generating negative attention for CBS as the company deals with a litany of other significant issues. Shari Redstone, CBS parent Paramount's controlling shareholder, has done everything in her power to clear a path for the Trump administration's FCC to approve a multibillion-dollar planned merger with Skydance Media. Redstone has given lawyers the green light to settle President Donald Trump’s election interference lawsuit, although a deal has not been made, and has kept tabs on CBS News’ reporting on the administration. But if Redstone wants CBS News journalists to avoid irking Trump officials ahead of the high-stakes merger, \"Face the Nation\" anchor Margaret Brennan appears to have missed the memo. TRUMP REJECTS PARAMOUNT'S $15 MILLION OFFER TO SETTLE CBS NEWS LAWSUIT, DEMANDS APOLOGY On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called out Brennan for warning in March that Trump administration tariffs on imported goods would raise prices for American consumers after inflation cooled to a four-year low in April. \"Margaret, when we were here in March, you said there was going to be big inflation. There hasn't been any inflation. Actually, the inflation numbers are the best in four years. So why don't we stop trying to say this could happen and wait and see what does happen,\" Bessent told Brennan in her latest viral clash with a Republican. Brennan tussled with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February after she suggested that free speech had been \"weaponized\" to bring about the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. After Vice President JD Vance criticized European allies for adopting a \"soviet\"-style approach to censorship at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Brennan made nefarious inferences. \"[Vance] was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide,\" Brennan said to Rubio. \"He met with the head of a political party that has far-right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that.\" \"Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime that happened to also be genocidal because they hated Jews, and they hated minorities, and they had a list of people they hated, but primarily the Jews,\" Rubio told Brennan. The \"Face the Nation\" anchor also had a testy exchange with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., over then-FBI director nominee Kash Patel on the day before Trump's inauguration. She clashed with Vance in January over unvetted refugees in the country. She specifically asked whether he stood by his past comments that the U.S. should not \"abandon anybody who's been properly vetted.\" \"Well, Margaret, I don't agree that all these immigrants, or all these refugees have been properly vetted,\" Vance said. \"In fact, we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks in our country. That happened during the campaign, if you may remember. So, clearly, not all of these foreign nationals have been properly vetted.\" CBS HOST BLASTED FOR ‘BONKERS’ CLAIM NAZI GERMANY ‘WEAPONIZED’ FREE SPEECH In March, Trump sat down with The Spectator’s Ben Domenech for a wide-ranging interview and was asked about the exchange Brennan had with Rubio. \"I call it ‘Deface the Nation,’\" Trump said. \"Brennan is like anybody on the street that you could take and say, ‘Go in and ask a few questions,’\" Trump added. \"That was so bad, I don’t get how you hire some of these people.\" While Brennan continues to irk Trump and his allies, her corporate overlords are looking to strike a deal with the president. Fox News Digital confirmed last week that Trump rejected a $15 million offer to settle his lawsuit. The talks are ongoing, but the president's legal team is demanding at least $25 million and an apology from CBS News. The ordeal began last October when Trump sued CBS News and Paramount over allegations of election interference involving the \"60 Minutes\" interview of then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired weeks before the presidential election. The lawsuit alleges CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker. Redstone, who recused herself from settlement discussions in February, isn’t thrilled with being tied up in litigation with the sitting president and wants to get things resolved. But not everyone from CBS News is on the same page. \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens abruptly resigned in April, saying he no longer had sufficient independence to run the program how he wanted. Last month, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon followed Owens out the door, citing tensions within the company. McMahon’s resignation fueled speculation that a settlement with Trump was looming, as she and Owens were both known to object to apologizing for what many media observers consider a typical editing decision at the heart of the lawsuit. CBS NEWS STAFFERS RATTLED BY CEO'S ABRUPT EXIT AS TRUMP LAWSUIT LOOMS OVER NETWORK \"60 Minutes\" correspondents have been speaking out, adding to the ongoing headache for Paramount Global. Scott Pelley took a not-so-subtle shot at Trump last month during a commencement address at Wake Forest University. \"Why attack universities? Why attack journalism? Because ignorance works for power,\" Pelley told Wake Forest graduates. \"First, make the truth seekers live in fear, sue the journalists and their companies for nothing. Then, send masked agents to abduct a college student who wrote an editorial in her college paper defending Palestinian rights and send her to a prison in Louisiana charged with nothing. Then move to destroy the law firms that stand up for the rights of others.\" On Friday, Lesley Stahl admitted she was bothered by the situation. \"To have a news organization come under corporate pressure—to have a news organization told by a corporation, ‘do this, do that with your story, change this, change that, don’t run that piece.' I mean, it steps on the First Amendment, it steps on the freedom of the press,\" Stahl said. PARAMOUNT FACING MOUNTING PRESSURE FROM CBS STARS, DEM LAWMAKERS AS COMPANY MULLS SETTLING TRUMP LAWSUIT \"It steps on what we stand for. It makes me question whether any corporation should own a news operation,\" she continued. \"It is very disconcerting.\" Meanwhile, Redstone is set for a significant windfall if she’s able to flip Paramount to Skydance. Bloomberg reported last year that she would receive $180 million in severance on top of the roughly $350 million she would pocket from the merger. Skydance Media CEO David Ellison, the son of billionaire Larry Ellison, would take control of CBS as head of the newly formed Paramount Skydance Corp. once Redstone exits. He would also inherit Brennan, whom Newsweek referred to as \"MAGA’s favorite punching bag\" in February.

I’m Jon Wiener. Later in the show: J. Hoberman, the long-time film critic for the Village Voice, talks about the 1960s New York Avant-Garde. But first: the elections coming up before the midterms in 2026 – John Nichols will explain. \n\nForget the midterms next year, at least for now; the fight against Trump runs through the elections this November — that’s what John Nichols says. Of course he’s national affairs correspondent for The Nation, the author or co-author of more than a dozen books. His latest, co-written with Bernie Sanders, is The New York Times bestseller, It’s OK to be Angry About Capitalism. We reached him today at home in Madison. John, welcome back.\n\nJohn Nichols: Jon, it’s great to be with you.\n\nJW: The Virginia elections on November 4th are the most important we have this year, and the Democrats really have to win this one. Right now, the Democrats have narrow majorities in both legislative chambers, but the governor is a Republican. Seems like this is probably going to be a close election. Virginia and New Jersey elect their governors and state legislators the first year after presidential elections. I think the original rationale was to decouple state politics from presidential politics. Seems like that isn’t going to work this November.\n\nJN: No, that plan fell apart. As we have developed a more nationalized politics, these odd year elections have become more and more significant as indicators, not just of the sentiment at the time of the election, but perhaps of where things are headed for critical midterms, when control of Congress can flip. The candidates now talk about it that way. They fully acknowledge that if you’re a Democrat, you’re running against Trump. If you’re a Republican, amazingly, even at this point, they’re still running with Trump.\n\nJW: We think of Virginia as kind of a purple state, trending blue, although not trending as much as we’d like. Kamala Harris won 52% of the vote there last year, four years before that, Biden had done better with the 54%. You point out in your new piece for The Nation magazine that last time they had elections for governor in the state legislature, which of course, four years ago, the Democrats lost every statewide office. Glenn Youngkin won governor. That makes us worry. The Democratic candidate this year for governor is Abigail Spanberger. Tell us about her.\n\nJN: She sort of fits the template of a lot of Democratic candidates at this point. She’s pretty moderate, to be honest, not a big lefty, worked in the federal government in the case of span in national security areas, came back to Virginia at a critical point, won a big congressional race in a competitive district, and that was her sort of breakthrough politically. She came on not just to the Virginia stage but the national stage. Because of that victory, she’s seen as somebody who could appeal not just to Democratic voters, but to swing voters and others. She got in the governor’s race very early in Virginia – there’s a real, there is a fight for the soul of the Democratic Party in Virginia. You have a centrist grouping and then you have a more progressive grouping and the progressive grouping, especially concentrated around the Washington DC suburbs, which are a big generator of democratic votes.\n\nAnd often there’s a split in Virginia, there are often primaries where you have a more liberal candidate, a more conservative or more centrist candidate for governor. In this case, there wasn’t a split. There isn’t a primary. Spanberger has the nomination locked up, and she’s done it with messaging that is overtly critical of Trump. And the other thing is that she has focused in on some issues. Remember, the Republicans in Congress are talking about deep, deep cuts to Medicaid and to other social safety net programs. What Spanberger has done and what the Democrats running in New Jersey have done and other places is simply say at this point, you really need a Democratic governor who’s going to push back.\n\nJW: The Republicans in Virginia are running a Black woman for governor and a gay white guy for Lieutenant Governor. The Democrats have never done that. Let’s start with a Republican candidate for governor, the current Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, hyphenated last name. If she won, she’d become the first Black female governor in American history.\n\nJN: This is a subtlety here. Back in the late sixties, early seventies, the Virginia Republican party was actually way ahead of the National Republican Party on a lot of civil rights issues and social justice issues. It moved more to the right in the seventies, and that’s – the reality is that this ticket, which has obviously candidates who bring diversity still stands very, very much to the hard right. At this point, voters want to find ways to protect themselves, especially in Northern Virginia, against Trump’s assault on the federal government and on aid to states. And I think that the dominant issue in this race, one will be the defense against Trump’s assault on federal employees. Remember Northern Virginia is a huge number of federal employees, and the second is one that we keep seeing cycle after cycle as a vital issue, and that is abortion rights.\n\nJW: Yeah, let me underline that. Virginia is the only state in the American south without a strict abortion ban. Abortion there is legal through the end of the second trimester, and the Black woman running for governor has an anti-abortion record. Virginians support abortion rights. 71% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. So the Democrats have a good issue here.\n\nJN: I think they do. And Virginia has become a state that’s socially liberal, and I mean, it isn’t the whole of Virginia. Virginia is a diverse state geographically and ideologically and socially. You’ve got parts of Virginia that really do align much more with traditional southern voting patterns. But Northern Virginia, these vote-rich counties around Washington, DC is a very liberal place. What you’re going to see this year, I think turnout’s going to be up. People draw to the polls, especially out of concern about what Trump’s doing and the impact he’s having. But then when they’re making their choice, I think that abortion rights, LGBTQ rights become a real factor in this. These issues have been battled out in the legislature in recent months and years.\n\nJW: The polls have Democrat Abigail Spanberger ahead by maybe seven points. Seems like a lot. Is this really going to be a contest?\n\nJN: Yeah, it certainly can be. Remember in 2021, there was a sense that the Democrats had a very strong candidate for governor and Terry McAuliffe, who’s somebody very well established in that. And it just fell apart. The Democratic initiative in Virginia fell apart. And it was a real reminder that while Virginia has trended Democratic in recent cycles, recent presidential cycles, it’s still a very competitive state. But Virginia could send a very powerful signal similar to what we saw from Wisconsin, similar to what we saw in the race for mayor of Omaha, where a Republican incumbent was turned out. Similar to what we’ve seen in legislative special elections across the country, Democratic voters seem to be very energized to come to the polls and Republicans seem to be responding not by shifting over, not by crossing the partisan line and backing Democratic candidates, but simply by at a higher percentage than usual, staying home. It’s not showing up.\n\nJW: So that’s Virginia. It’s the only state with a Republican governor that has an election this year. New Jersey is the other state with statewide elections, a long time blue state, we expect the Democrats to continue to win there. But I have to note that last year Kamala Harris got quite a bit less of the New Jersey vote, 52% than Biden had gotten. Biden got 57%. There’s a primary coming up in New Jersey, June 10th, that’s what next week. So we don’t know for sure who the candidates are. Let’s just talk briefly. It looks like the leading Democratic candidate in the polls is a Mikie Sherrill, a woman, member of Congress, a lot like Abigail Spanberger actually in her profile, a moderate, not a member of the Progressive Caucus. Her background is as a Navy helicopter pilot, federal prosecutor. She’s kind of got all the important people behind her and the Republicans are running the guy who ran last time, who’s endorsed by Trump. So that makes it very clear what this one is going to be about.\n\nJN: I think so, although I will counsel, having been in New Jersey that Democratic governor’s race is a really competitive race. I mean there’s a serious fight going on there. You’re right that Sherrill is ahead in the polls, but you have other candidates there. I think somewhat more progressive candidates, Baraka especially, who are competing and doing well. I am going to keep an eye on that primary. I’m also going to keep an eye on the Republican primary, although you’re right, it looks like the candidate they ran last time, is likely to get the nominee again. He has does seem to have Trump’s imprimatur. Here’s where I would counsel to keep a closer eye on New Jersey than some people might expect. In New Jersey, again, we are reminded this is a state that not that long ago elected Chris Christie as its governor. This is a state that can elect Republicans.And it is a state where last year when Biden really got in trouble after that debate and was looking weak, you started to see polling that suggested that New Jersey could potentially have even crossed the line there on the presidential race. It didn’t. But the Republicans are likely to have a candidate who’s well known, who’s run before. I expect there will be plenty of money on both sides. And so, my argument is watch both Virginia and New Jersey closely, treat them seriously as real contests. And we will see in November whether they produce a clear united message. If they do, I think that will be one of the biggest headlines from an odd year election cycle that we’ve ever had in this country.\n\nJW: So big picture here, Trump’s approval ratings are really bad right now, but that does not mean that Democrats approval ratings are good. Please explain.\n\nJN: Well, it’s not hard to explain. The Democrats in Washington have done an incredibly lousy job of pushing back against Trump and getting organized to do so. Look, in the House of Representatives, the margin is one of the narrowest in history. In the Senate. It’s a little wider, but it’s still a relatively closely divided place. There’s a handful of reasonable conservative Republicans in the House, in the Senate, and if the Democrats were at peak performance level, they might well have been able to block a couple of the cabinet nominees, they might be able to achieve a greater clarity of their pushback against Trump. But that just hasn’t happened, at least not at the level that it should. And so you see across the country, at town meetings for Democratic members of Congress, people in the crowd saying, why aren’t you fighting harder? Why aren’t you doing everything you possibly can to stop what’s going on? \n\nAnd I do think sometimes from the Washington Democrats, there’s too many excuses, not enough energy. It’s an interesting relationship between the grassroots and the party. People are very critical of a lot of the national Democrats. They like Bernie Sanders, they like AOC. They like some of the people who are really fighting. They liked it when Cory Booker did his long filibuster or semi-filibuster. So they like a fight. They are disappointed in a lot of the Democratic leadership. They’re disappointed on issues, often. Gaza remains a real issue out there, and yet even amidst this disappointment, they’re still willing to show up for a lot – grassroots Democrats are able to carry two thoughts in their head at the same time. One is that they would like their party to be a far more aggressive, far bolder party, far more effective in fighting back against Trump at this point.At the same time, they still want their party to win. Why this all matters, is that we are at this point now in 2025 when Democrats are recruiting candidates, fundraising starting to get organized for that 2026 midterm election. This is the bottom line, Jon. The midterm election of 2026 will be the most important midterm election in the modern history of the United States. I know we always say every election is important, but I mean, look, here’s what we’re talking about. Does Donald Trump continue to have a Congress that is on his side? Or is it a Congress that will push back? I mean, that’s a critical question of 2026, and 2025 will give us a lot of indication of where we’re headed.\n\nJW: John Nichols—his article on the elections of 2025 appears in the July issue of The Nation Magazine. Thank you, John.\n\nJN: Thank you, Jon. It’s an honor to be with you.\n\nJon Wiener: Now it’s time to talk with J. Hoberman about the 1960s New York avant-garde. He worked for 40 years as a film critic for The Village Voice, and he’s written many books; I think my favorite is An Army of Phantoms: American Movies in the Making of the Cold War. He also has written for Artforum, The LRB, The New York Times, The New York Review, and The Nation. Last time he was here, we talked about ‘The Secret History of Comic Book Imperialism.’ His new book is called Everything is Now: the 1960s New York Avant-Garde—Primal Happenings, Underground Movies, Radical Pop. Jim Hoberman, welcome back.\n\nJ. Hoberman: Very glad to be here.\n\nJW: Your new book is about pretty much everything that happened below 14th Street between 1959 and 1971 – in the world of art, music, theater, movies. You call it quote “a memoir, but not mine.” I guess that’s because you’re sort of too young for most of this to be your own story. Where were you in ‘62?\n\nJH: In ‘62, I was not getting my bar mitzvah.\n\nJW: [Laughter] And where in the landscape of Greater New York were you?\n\nJH: I lived in Central Queens, which was, at that point, land of the baby boom. I mean, every year I was in high school, a new high school opened up. It was just phenomenal. So, a lot of kids.\n\nJW: And while you were a young teenager in Central Queens in 1962, Bob Dylan was living in a friend’s basement apartment on Bleecker Street and released his first album. Yoko Ono had left her loft on Chamber Street to go back to Tokyo for a while. Andy Warhol showed his Campbell Soup Can paintings, and had his studio, the Factory, on East 47th Street. And Jonas Mekas was living in poverty with his brother on Avenue B. He looms large in your story. Tell us about Jonas Mekas – not exactly a teenager in Central Queens.\n\nJH: No, Jonas was at that time in his late thirties. He has a fantastic life story. I mean, he was a displaced person from Lithuania who made his way to New York, was a poet and a movie buff, and he was working in a factory, and he managed to buy a used 16-millimeter Bolex. He and his brother began trying to make movies. But before that, they founded a magazine, Film Culture, which was at the time the closest thing that the US had to a Cahiers du Cinéma. It was a serious film magazine that was concerned with what was going on everywhere the world. And he got this gig as the film critic for The Village Voice, and he was kind of like a blogger. I mean, he wrote about whatever the hell he wanted to write about, and he was very opinionated, and he found people and causes to defend. So he was an amazingly influential character in New York in the sixties in creating this underground film scene.\n\nJW: So Jonas Mekas was on Avenue B, the East Village, the Lower East Side. That was a world of old Jews and young Puerto Ricans, basically, where Claes Oldenberg opened a store on East Second Street in 1961. What did he call it?\n\nJH: ‘The Store.’ But he did these happenings. He didn’t like the word “happenings” because those were associated with Alan Kaprow, another artist who was doing them, but he staged these theater pieces in the back room that were called X-Ray Specs. So it was both a store and a kind of storefront theater. For all I know, he might’ve been living in the back of the store too.\n\nJW: Oldenberg had gone to Yale and then the art school of the Chicago Art Institute. So this is really the elite of the American art world in 1960.\n\nJH: Well, yes and no. I mean because for every Oldenberg who was not just middle class, but upper middle class, I mean, his father was a Swedish diplomat. He escaped the war in Europe altogether. There were people like Boris Lurie, who was another DP who survived three concentration camps and wound up in New York and was doing this very brutal kind of collages, which he called “NO!Art.” And Jonas, of course, was a refugee of sorts. Tuli Kupferberg of the Fugs, and the poet who named the Fugs, also grew up in the poorest district of the Lower East Side, I mean practically in the East River, and his parents were Yiddish-speaking communists. So Oldenberg was, I think, the exception rather than the rule.\n\nJW: And at the store, he sold stuff, didn’t he?\n\nJH: Yeah. If you bought stuff from his store now, you’d be sitting pretty, I mean, yeah, he charged, some of the things were less than a hundred dollars. I think the most expensive might’ve been about $400.\n\nJW: And what were these things?\n\nJH: It was plaster representations of food, but also other things that you might find in a store, cheap appliances and so on, but all handmade–largely by his wife, Patty Oldenberg–and he sold them. It was kind of a ma-and-pa operation.\n\nJW: 1960 and ‘61, of course was a crucial period for the Civil Rights movement in the South. The Freedom Rides organized by CORE, the sit-ins organized by SNCC — and in the Village, jazz drummer Max Roach premiered his “Freedom Now Suite” – this was an album, also a live performance as a benefit for CORE at The Village Gate. Tell us about Max Roach and the Freedom Now Suite.\n\nJH: The Freedom Now Suite was an early example of what would’ve been thought of as protest music. It was jazz, but it was so political that a lot of other jazz musicians, Miles Davis and others, they thought it was crazy what Max Roach was doing. And of course, he was, in jazz terms, part of the bebop elite, had played with all of the – with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. And he and his wife, Abby Lincoln, put together this kind of piece. Actually, when it was staged, it had dance and lighting and everything. It was a real performance, and it was steeped in issues of racial justice, both in the United States and also in South Africa. I mean, there’s a very painful piece, “Elegy for Sharpeville,” which had been this massacre, which happened then. Roach and Lincoln weren’t Black nationalists so much as they were Black internationalists.There was that kind of protest music, and at the same time, you had something happening a few blocks west in Greenwich Village with various so-called folk singers.\n\nJW: Yeah, the Beatnik Riot, April 9th, 1961, in Washington Square Park. I didn’t know about this. What was the Beatnik Riot?\n\nJH: “The Beatnik Riot” – that’s the name that the tabloids gave it. What had happened was, ever since World War II, there had been sort of impromptu hootenannies in Washington Square around the fountains. This was a kind of Sunday afternoon ritual, and it ceased to be explicitly political. These guys were coming down with their banjos, and anyway, at a certain point, the new Commissioner of Parks, possibly pressured by Robert Moses, who was the guy who redesigned, wanted to completely remake in New York, they decided to ban the singing in the square. The neighborhood had grown somewhat more middle class, there were all sorts of other things: there were gay guys cruising. There were a lot of African Americans coming down to the village. Many; I talk about that. The Village was really a kind of flashpoint. So, incredibly, they tried to ban the singing in the park, and what had happened was organized among the folks. They came in there into the park silently with their instruments, and then at a given signal from Izzy Young, the proprietor of the Folklore Center, kind of a crucial meeting place in the Village, they began to play, and the cops broke it up, and it turned into this incredible brawl, and there were tourists there, and so it was on the front page of all the tabloids, and that’s how it got to be “the beatnik riot.” And the incredible thing is, it worked. The mayor, Robert Wagner, who was running for reelection, suddenly reversed course, and in the end, the music went on.\n\nJW: I want to talk about “The Connection.” “The Connection” is known to people like me as a movie by Shirley Clarke, which opened in 1962. Originally, it opened, not downtown, but at a theater on East 59th Street. It had been a play put on by Julian Beck and Judith Malina at The Living Theater, which was on, they had moved to 14th Street at Sixth Avenue. Some people loved the play, some people hated it, but the movie ran into trouble. The projectionist was arrested, the print was impounded. What was the play, “The Connection,” and what was the problem with the movie of the play?\n\nJH: “The Connection” was billed as a jazz play. When the Becks put it on, various people, Freddie Hubbard, Jackie McLean, there were actual jazz musicians involved, and it purported to be a bunch of junkies and users waiting around somebody’s loft. They’re rehearsing and they’re waiting for their connection to show up with the dope — or as they refer to it many times, in the play, ‘he brings the sh*t.’ And it was dramatized in such a way as that it seemed almost that they had had broken the fourth wall. I mean, it seemed very real to people who came up to that loft; there were rumors, ‘Oh, they’re really shooting up with real drugs,’ and so on. That was part of the mystique, but it was radical in a number of ways. I mean, the use of jazz that the new naturalism and the subject matter.Anyway, when it was made into a movie a few years later by Shirley Clarke, she took it to Cannes. It was an incredible sensation. First of all. They also thought it was sort of a documentary, although it wasn’t, but this was really the movie, more than Cassavetes, that created the idea of a new American cinema. But when she came back with the movie to New York, it couldn’t be shown. I mean, it was shown somewhere in Arizona, but they couldn’t show it in New York — because in those days, there was still this very, very strict censorship of the movies that came from the State Department of Education, and they wouldn’t allow this movie to be shown for two reasons. One was there’s a brief moment where somebody’s looking at a cheesecake magazine or something, and then there’s the word ‘sh*t,’ which is used many times in this prudish climate. It was enough to get the movie censored, and by the time they worked through it got it shown. This was no longer such a shocking thing. More was to come.\n\nJW: We’ve talked here about the early sixties. Now we have to talk about the late sixties. December 15th, 1969, a billboard went up in Times Square with giant letters that said, “War is over.” This was the height of the Vietnam War. And in small letters underneath it said, “if you want it. Happy Christmas from John and Yoko.”A lot of people thought this was ridiculous, including John Sinclair. You call him “Detroit’s biggest beatnik.” John Sinclair said, quote, “you are going to sound awfully stupid trying to tell the heroic Vietnamese people that ‘the war is over if you want it,’ while they are being burned and bombed and blown out of their pitiful little huts and fields.”What did you think about “The war is over”?\n\nJH: You mean, what did I think about it as a 20-year-old?\n\nJW: That, and today — both.\n\nJH: Well, as a 20-year-old, I think I probably would’ve been kind of a cynic, although I don’t think I would’ve taken the hard line that John Sinclair did. I certainly wouldn’t have understood it at that time as of a piece with Yoko Ono’s art. I mean, she really was an early conceptual artist, and she was connected with the Fluxus group, and a lot of what they did was conceptual in that it sort of played out in your head, proposing ideas or images. And it’s not just that the billboard went up in Times Square. It went up in probably a dozen other cities.\n\nJW: Around the world.\n\nJH: Around the world. The book has a kind of trajectory where happenings begin in artists’ lofts and out of the way places, and sort of work their way into the center of what came to be called a counterculture, and then finally, in the late sixties, you have happenings just with all political demonstrations. I mean, you have somebody like Abby Hoffman. He’s basically a happenings artist. I mean, he’s learned how to do this on a much greater scale. And so I think that this is part of that too.\n\nJW: Yeah, I would just emphasize what’s important to John and Yoko about this is the line “if you want it.” This is in New York City. It’s not in Hanoi, it’s in New York City. ‘If you want this war to be over, it can be over’–they are telling Americans. There’s where I disagree with John Sinclair.Meanwhile, the great offense against the New York art world came in the galleries in the fall season of 1970, and the offender was Philip Guston. Guston was a 57-year-old hero of the New York School of Abstract Expressionism who showed new paintings that outraged the art world. You point out something I don’t think anyone else has ever noticed about Guston. His show opened the same day The Beatles’ White album was introduced as evidence in the Manson trial.\n\nJH: [Laughter] Yes.\n\nJW: Right. It’s the kind of thing you learn in this book. So who was Philip Guston and what did these new paintings look like, and why did they outrage Hilton Kramer so much?\n\nJH: Yeah, well, Guston was one of the elite painters of the New York School. People thought that, as a pure painter, he was the only rival to Willam de Kooning. And Guston and all of those guys came out of the thirties. They all had worked for the WPA and so on, and Guston had been, I think, even more of a leftist maybe than Pollock, and de Kooning in any case. In a way he reverted to the style that he had been using in the 1930s when he was very much influenced by the Mexican muralists and by a kind of American surrealism and so on. But his style was pared down. The guy is such a great painter. He’s able to sort of pare this stuff down. It’s very cartoony. It looked like Krazy Kat or something. It’s been pointed out also that it was very similar to R. Crumb, which was who had just started then.Was he aware of this? Who knows? But in any case, he took, as his subject matter, these kinds of Ku Klux Klansmen, which is something that he painted back in the thirties. They’re both menacing and comical at the same time, and also weirdly universal, as if he identifies with them. I mean, these paintings had a lot to trouble the mind of somebody like Hilton Kramer. And this was also part of the fact the art world was getting tremendously politicized at this point, and it was easy enough to dismiss like a lot of these other painters, Faith Ringgold for one, to take another, painting her American flags that were not like Jasper John’s American flags. Her American flags had skulls. And other painters also were much more political. So it was really ghastly that somebody like Philip Guston seemed to abdicate his role as the epitome of high art painting.\n\nJW: I think we should say a word about your sources, because the critics are an important part of the story, and the work of critics was transformed in this decade, starting of course, with The Voice. The Voice was kind of the éminence grise of the downtown counterculture. Tell us a little bit about the other publications that you read for this book.\n\nJH: Well, let me say that it’s not just critics, it’s journalists. I mean, this book could not have been written without the work of all the journalists who were covering this scene in various ways, and even in The Times. I mean, I think The Times had some very shrewd writers, Grace Gluek comes to mind. The Voice, of course, was central because that was the closest thing to the downtown paper of record, and it had some very committed writers. I mean, not just Jonas Mekas, but also Jill Johnston, who was the dance critic and the theater critics, Michael Smith, and others, and so they were reporting on this stuff, and the only way that performances come down to us, there was no videotape then, is by the descriptions, either the scripts or the descriptions. A lot of these things didn’t have scripts, so I felt very indebted to and grateful to all these journalists.Even Hilton Kramer was out there looking at stuff and thinking about it. I mean, it’s fun for me when people got indignant and so on. I enjoy that, but by the late sixties, The Voice had competition. There was the East Village Other, known as EVO, which was actually founded by poets and was not particularly political. I mean, it was in a sense, it certainly was anti-authoritarian, but it wasn’t political. There was a third paper called RAT, or sometimes referred to as the RAT but RAT was the title, which was founded by Jeff Shero, who had been active in SDS that had the great good fortune to appear just before the Columbia occupation. It took that as its material, and it was very political, and it was staffed largely by high school kids. I mean, it was an incredible paper, and so that pushed, and EVO had to sort of become more political as a result of that. EVO had the underground comics, which that was its great thing, and also some writers who I actually learned to love while I was working on this book – because, Jon, I sat there in the library with the microfilm and went through every issue of these publications, and the crazy thing is that this is a library. I would be the only person using the microfilm. It’s as if ‘it’s not online, so it didn’t happen.’ No. Somebody had the foresight to commit these papers to microfilm, and so I couldn’t have written the book without that.\n\nJW: The book is, Everything is Now: The 1960s New York, and somehow everything is here. It’s overwhelming, it’s exhilarating. Jim Hoberman, thank you for this book, and thanks for talking with us today.\n\nJH: It was my pleasure – really, Jon.","summary":"Jon Wiener\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this episode of Start Making Sense, John Nichols talks about key races this November, and J.

Almost every hand went up. It’s the same question Democrats have been grappling with nationally: How does the party win again after a stunning loss to Donald Trump last year, when Trump made gains across the country — including in blue states like New Jersey? Democratic voters in the state will have the party's first big opportunity to weigh in on that question next week. New Jersey is one of two states this year with governor's races, and it’s the only state with contested primaries, with voters heading to the polls next Tuesday to pick their nominees. The six Democratic candidates embody different paths for the party. There's a rabble-rousing progressive, a military veteran leveraging the party’s 2018 playbook, a self-described “pragmatic progressive” taking on the party establishment, a moderate laser-focused on affordability, a longtime legislator stressing his blue-collar roots and a union leader rallying teachers. And they are often quick to note that the country is watching. “I think it’s going to set the pace for what happens nationally,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who pitches himself as the true progressive in the race, said of the primary. Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, one of the more moderate candidates, also described the primary as a “bellwether” for the party. “We can’t go down the same path,” Gottheimer said Saturday after a rally with supporters in Woodcliff Lake. “We’ve got to do things differently.” Many of the Democratic voters the candidates are chasing are prioritizing electability as they weigh their options, according to conversations with nearly 40 New Jersey Democratic voters in recent days. “We do not want MAGA to take over New Jersey,” said Cheryl Ashcroft of Point Pleasant, who is supporting Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill because she believes Sherrill has the best chance of defeating former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, the GOP primary front-runner, who has Trump’s endorsement. ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ Gottheimer is among the candidates who believe Trump was able to make gains in the state last year, particularly among working-class voters and voters of color, by focusing on the economy and public safety. Trump lost New Jersey by 6 percentage points, a 10-point improvement on his margin in 2020. That was the second-largest swing toward Trump of any state. “My lawn signs all say, ‘Lower taxes, Jersey values,’ and they’ve said that since I first ran for Congress,” Gottheimer said. “I’m a very heavily economic, lower-taxes, jobs message, and I think that’s where the party needs to go,” he added later. “If families can’t afford to feed their kids or put clothes on their back or pay their rent or their mortgage, everything else, while critically important, becomes secondary.” A Woodcliff Lake resident backing Gottheimer named Nicole, who declined to share her last name, said she views Gottheimer as Democrats’ best chance to win in November and as the kind of candidate her party should elevate. “I think that it is important for our party to get away from the fringes,” she said. Steve Sweeney, a self-described moderate and former state Senate president who is also running for governor, said Democrats have lost their way with voters like him — a former ironworker who does not have a college degree. “They don’t vote Democrat anymore because we, we’re not talking what they want to hear, which is ‘It’s the economy, stupid,’” Sweeney told NBC News after a news conference in Camden, referring to Democratic strategist James Carville’s mantra from the 1992 presidential campaign. ‘Effectively govern’ Sherrill, whom some consider the Democratic primary front-runner, has stressed her service as a Navy helicopter pilot and a federal prosecutor as she runs for governor. She is looking to leverage Democrats’ successful playbook from the midterms in 2018, when she and other candidates with public service backgrounds took back the House. The “obvious” path forward for the party, Sherrill said, is to “effectively govern.” “Ruthless competence is what people in New Jersey want to see in government,” Sherrill told NBC News before she marched in the Asbury Park Pride parade. “And that’s what I’ve always provided, and that’s what I think stands in stark contrast to the most incompetent federal government we’ve probably ever seen in this nation.” Ken Urgo, 68, a retired food service worker from Galloway, said he is aligned with the far left but is supporting Sherrill because he believes she is the most electable candidate. “I think Mikie Sherrill is a little too much of a centrist for me, but I think it’s going to take a centrist to win this state,” Urgo said, noting that Sherrill was once a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, which she left in 2023 “to work with a broader coalition of leaders.” “I have the best track record of anyone in the race of building the types of teams and coalitions and elections that win,” Sherrill told Donald J. Carroll Jr. of Fanwood, another voter who pressed her about her path to victory at a meet-and-greet in Watchung on Sunday evening. Carroll later told NBC News that electability is “really, really important” to him. Sherrill noted that the three mayors in the Democratic race — Fulop, Baraka and former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller — have never faced Republican opponents. She said the key is to lay out “why the Republican candidate is not serving people well and why my candidacy will be so effective.” Carroll was satisfied with Sherrill’s answer and plans to support her in the race. But he is still concerned that some voters may be hesitant to back a female candidate, pointing to Vice President Kamala Harris’ struggles against Trump last year. While Trump gained 84,000 additional votes in New Jersey compared with 2020, Harris won 388,000 fewer votes than Joe Biden did four years earlier. Anti-establishment angst After Harris’ struggles last year, other Democratic candidates in New Jersey are pushing anti-establishment messages. Fulop, the Jersey City mayor, told the voters gathered at the Cranford Community Center that Harris ultimately lost because “she was unable to articulate a clear vision of what the United States of America would look like that was different than Joe Biden, or with any authenticity and conviction.” “I do believe that if you’re an establishment candidate, you’re going to lose,” Fulop told NBC News after the event. “I think the mood of the country has been clearly antiestablishment with both Democratic [and] Republican for some time.” Fulop has been pitching himself as the candidate taking on the party’s political machine, and he said he appeals to \"pragmatic progressive\" voters. He has suggested that Democrats should distance themselves from Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, since Republicans will look to make the race a referendum on Murphy's administration. Baraka, of Newark, another top candidate in the primary, also said Democrats need to take a more aggressive approach and push for progressive policies, though he acknowledged in a recent debate that some have suggested he cannot win in November because he is from Newark, he is “too progressive,” and he is “too Black.” “New Jersey is ready for something different,” he said during the debate, “not the weak playbook of the Democratic Party.” Baraka said Monday in an interview that voters “want to see Democrats be bold and exhibit some form of leadership.” “Even the term ‘liberal’ makes people believe that we’re just soft, that we’ll do anything, we don’t have any position, we don’t have any plans, we don’t have any direction. I think we need to be, we need to show something different,” said Baraka, who was recently arrested at a federal immigration detention facility, though the trespassing charges were later dropped. Chioma Nwankwo, 29, of Newark, who works in marketing, said she is leaning toward supporting Baraka. She said Democratic leaders in Congress are “out of touch,” adding that she wants her party to be younger and “more responsive” and to focus on appealing to working-class voters and racial minorities. Spiller, the president of the New Jersey teachers union and a former mayor of Montclair, is also pitching himself as a candidate willing to take on entrenched interests — and comfortable criticizing his own party in the process. “I truly think this our chance to do something different, and what that different looks like is finally electing somebody who’s not put there by big corporations, Wall Street, venture capitalists, big developers,” Spiller told NBC News after he took part in the Asbury Park Pride parade, adding later, “If we truly want to change it, not just have politicians who make promises that can’t keep them, we’ve got to change the way the system works.” Spiller did not meet the fundraising threshold to qualify for the recent debates, but his campaign has been boosted by millions of dollars from a super PAC funded by the New Jersey Education Association, which he leads. He pushed back against criticism that teachers union dues are being used to support his campaign, noting that the union unanimously voted to endorse him and that it has historically supported its endorsed candidates. The electability question The persistent questions about which candidate can win underscore how Democrats expect a competitive race in November, despite the state’s typically blue hue. Murphy’s 2021 re-election race was closer than expected, which he said later was a “canary in the coal mine” three years ahead of Democrats’ presidential loss last year. Murphy defeated Ciattarelli by 3 points then, though he did buck a historical trend of New Jersey’s electing a governor of the opposite party of the president. While Democrats now have that precedent on their side with a Republican in the White House, they face another historical headwind: It has been more than 60 years since the same party won three consecutive governor’s races in New Jersey. And Democrats expect to face Ciattarelli again, though he first has to win a contested primary Tuesday. “This thing could be razor thin in November, and Jack Ciattarelli is a tough candidate,” Gottheimer said. “This is not going to be a walk in the park for anybody.”","summary":"CRANFORD, N.J. — Steve Fulop was almost done answering questions about his campaign for governor Saturday afternoon when he decided to pose a question of his own.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/new-jersey-primary-sets-first-major-fight-democratic-partys-future-rcna210418","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250602-new-jersey-governor-election-vl-506p-e9b008.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 09:00:00","author":"Bridget Bowman","authors":["Bridget Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":327894816,"title":"These Americans are done with Trump. So they’re leaving America","text":"Kevin and Jessica Cellura had just 48 hours in December to make an enormous family decision.\n\nThe couple, who both work as teachers, had to decide if they should take a job offer to teach in Morocco and leave Asheville, North Carolina, with their two youngest children.\n\nBut the Celluras say their decision was made easier by the presidential election results just weeks earlier.\n\n“We will get away from the chaos … I feel like the America as we knew it growing up is slipping away pretty fast,” Jessica Cellura told CNN.\n\nThe Celluras are part of a growing stampede of Americans moving or making serious efforts to move abroad, or to obtain the citizenship rights that would allow them to do so.\n\nTax lawyers and immigration advisers told CNN they have seen an uptick in requests from Americans seeking help with navigating the complex web of guidelines needed to relocate since Donald Trump’s election win.\n\nJessica, 40, and Kevin, 52, told CNN they are unaffiliated voters. They cast their ballots for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election, though Kevin voted Republican in the 1990s.\n\nTheir problems with the second Trump administration go well beyond the usual policy tussles and fierce disputes.\n\n“I feel like the government that we have is not based in reality. It is based on propaganda,” said Kevin Cellura, citing the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol inspired by Trump’s repeated, false claims that former President Joe Biden had rigged the preceding presidential election.\n\nTrump’s reascension provided the “spark” the couple needed to fulfil a long-standing desire to move overseas, Kevin said. They are set to teach at a school in Morocco’s capital Rabat, that follows the American model of education. They have one-way plane tickets on August 10.\n\nThey have one-way plane tickets on August 10.\n\nOfficial data from the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada show a surge in the number of Americans applying to become citizens in recent months.\n\nMore than 1,900 applied for a British passport during the first quarter of 2025, the most since the UK’s Home Office began keeping records in 2004. In Ireland, too, around 4,700 people residing in the United States applied for Irish citizenship based on their ancestry during the same period, according to the country’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade — the highest quarterly figure in a decade.\n\nIt is impossible to know the personal stories behind thousands of data points, and the extent to which politics has played a role, if at all. Very often, people can only apply for citizenship after several years living in a country.\n\nDina Modi, an immigration casework supervisor at Immigration Advice Service, a British firm providing legal assistance to people hoping to move to and from the UK, said her clients rarely relocate over a single reason like politics. She partly attributes the recent rush of Americans seeking British passports to changes in UK tax and immigration laws.\n\nA chunk of people simply need options, according to Modi. They have no concrete plans to move but want the ability to do so quickly. Other immigration advisers have witnessed the same impulse, telling CNN that some Americans view dual citizenship as a sort of insurance against what they perceive to be a deteriorating political landscape at home.\n\nThe Celluras, though, are not hesitating to leave. “I’m not going to be a sitting duck. I’m going to figure out our exit strategy,” Jessica recalls thinking after November’s votes were tallied.\n\n‘Political wildfire’\n\nBefore the build-up to the election, David Lesperance reckons he received a maximum of two inquiries per week from Americans wanting to relocate. Now, the head of Lesperance & Associates, a tax and immigration advisory firm, he fields as many as five per day.\n\n“(The) people who seek me out tend to be the people who feel they’re targets,” he said, noting that his clients tended to be wealthy, with the means to move abroad.\n\nIn the days following Trump’s January executive order restricting gender-affirming medical care for young people, Lesperance said he received seven inquiries from parents with a trans child. \n\nFor these families, he said, America represents a “political wildfire zone,” and “they can smell the smoke more than the average white heterosexual male with a MAGA hat on.”\n\nMelvin Warshaw, an international tax lawyer who sometimes works with Lesperance, said he has also received more inquiries from members of the LGBTQ+ community since the election. Another cadre of his clients are those who worry that America is “fast approaching an oligarchy or an autocracy.”\n\nFundamentally, both groups believe “their rights are being deprived if they continue to live in the US,” according to Warshaw.\n\nComedian Rosie O’Donnell offers one high-profile example. O’Donnell, who has traded public jibes with Trump for almost two decades, decamped to Ireland in January with her non-binary child, and is seeking citizenship based on her ancestry.\n\n“When it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,” she explained in a March posting on TikTok.\n\n‘Ideological civil war’\n\nErik Lindsay did not leave America because of Trump per se, but he found that he could no longer stand the country’s deep political divisions.\n\nThe 50-year-old screenwriter and novelist said the coronavirus pandemic provided the “catalyst” for his move from Manhattan Beach, California, to Italy in 2020 — a time in America he likened to an “ideological civil war” where people dying “had become politicised.”\n\nBut Lindsay’s desire to relocate to his great-grandparents’ birthplace — and where he thus had a claim to citizenship — had been percolating since Trump’s first election in 2016 when he felt his friend group fracturing over politics.\n\nLindsay has never voted for Trump, but he remembers the vitriolic reaction he received after posting a message on his Instagram account soon after the 2016 election imploring his anti-Trump friends to stay calm and take the long view of American history. “It just got venomous,” he said.\n\nLindsay recently became an Italian citizen — though only just before the rules changed. Italy, like Britain, has started to tighten rules on who can claim passports and visas. In May, Rome enacted a law removing the route to citizenship through great-grandparents.\n\nLindsay was lucky with his timing. Now, he can choose to live in Italy, or between Italy and America, at a whim. But life feels lighter in Italy.\n\n“To have any nuance in a conversation with anybody regarding politics that’s an American is impossible,” Lindsay said. “You can do it here.”","summary":"The Celluras are part of a growing stampede of Americans moving or making serious efforts to move abroad, or to obtain the citizenship rights that would allow them to do so.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/these-americans-are-done-with-trump-so-theyre-leaving-america/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-173.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-04 05:22:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Cnn 22am","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Cnn 22am"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.159}]}
