It’s the latest election prophecy from Allan Lichtman, an American University distinguished professor who boasts of having successfully predicted the results of every U.S. presidential race since 1984. Lichtman revealed his decision Thursday morning in an op-ed video for The New York Times. “The Democrats will hold on to the White House, and Kamala Harris will be the next president of the United States,” Lichtman said in the video. “At least, that’s my prediction for this race.” His forecasts are based on a historical index model he dubs the “Keys to the White House.” The unique system, which he developed in the early 1980s with the Russian geophysicist Vladimir Keilis-Borok, analyzes the political landscape through the lens of 13 true-false statements focused on the incumbent president’s party. If six or more of the statements are false, then the challenger — in this case, Trump — is predicted to win. Here are the keys, and Lichtman’s determinations for each: On the final two keys, Lichtman said, “Foreign policy is tricky, and these keys could flip.” He noted that the Biden administration is deeply involved in Israel’s war in Gaza, which he called a “humanitarian disaster with no end in sight.” “But even if both foreign policy keys flipped false, that would mean that there were only five negative keys, which would not be enough for Donald Trump to regain the White House,” Lichtman told the Times. Lichtman’s analysis largely eschews poll results, campaign strategies, sound bites, policy plans and other factors that most political commentators and analysts tend to lean on. But his system has yielded results. Lichtman was one of the few political analysts to accurately predict ahead of the 2016 election that Trump would defeat then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. However, Lichtman’s model indicated that Trump would win the popular vote, which he lost despite securing the Electoral College. Lichtman accurately predicted that President Joe Biden would beat Trump in the 2020 race.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris, left, at the White House, Washington, July 22, 2024, and former President Donald Trump in Bedminster, New Jersey, Aug. 15, 2024.

Business groups were quick to express their frustration with the proposal. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, America’s largest business organization, thinks whatever the policy is called will exacerbate price inflation. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who served under President Bill Clinton, however, says the vice president’s plan does not advocate price controls. “Prices are already being controlled in America by big corporations that have gobbled up markets and don’t have to compete.” Lindsay Owens, an economist at Groundwork Collaborative, stated that the government can intervene to combat what she says is “price gouging, price fixing, and just plain profiteering” in the food and grocery industry. Some pundits also note that government control over prices is not a new thing, pointing out that some 40 states already have anti-price-gouging laws in place. They typically involve restricting price increases above a pre-determined threshold or banning what officials view as egregious price hikes. The government, be it state attorneys general or local district attorneys, will take action if a company is found in violation of the law. Joel Griffith, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, stated in a recent report that Harris’s idea “would more likely function as a price freeze or command pricing.” Command pricing would involve the government determining the price to sell a good or a service. However, there are varying degrees of command pricing, such as mandating companies set prices at certain levels, ordering industries to produce more of something without sufficient demand, or setting quotas. A price freeze would involve a temporary ban on price increases for a product, comparable to what former President Richard Nixon employed in the 1970s. “Of course, even these state laws may result in the unintended consequence of shortages—but these temporary interventions in the market are rarely activated,” he said. Vance Ginn, the chief economist at the Pelican Institute for Public Policy, recently told NTD News that the price gouging argument is a “political term, not an economic term.” “What really comes in the marketplace is where consumers want to buy something at a certain price and producers want to provide it at a certain price,” Ginn said. “What we should be looking at is deregulation and finding ways to get the government out of the way instead of putting more government in place, like price controls, which haven’t worked throughout history.” A common question is: Are corporations price gouging? Supermarkets generally have extremely low profit margins in the 1 to 3 percent range. In the last quarter, Kroger and Albertsons, two of the largest U.S. grocery store chains, reported net profit margins of around 2 percent. By comparison, businesses like Apple and Nvidia report net profits of 25 percent and 55 percent, respectively. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco say supposed corporate greed has not been to blame for price pressures. Many empires have tested these economic prescriptions, from Roman Emperor Diocletian to the Soviet-controlled economies in Eastern Europe. The United States has been no exception. Over the past century, the U.S. government has imposed broad price controls in various schemes targeting different goods and services. In 1906, Congress passed the Hepburn Act, and President Theodore Roosevelt signed it. The act allowed the federal government to establish maximum freight rates for railroads. Congress later passed the Lever Food Control Act of 1917, which became law in August of that year. The bill granted President Woodrow Wilson to regulate the price, transportation, production, and distribution of food and beverages, fuel, and feeds for the remainder of World War I. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) took a different approach to price controls, signing various pieces of price-fixing legislation before World War II that established price minimums. Some of these New Deal-era laws effectively prohibited companies, be it in agriculture or brand merchandise, from offering consumers discounts. Conversely, by 1942, as the U.S. economy was grappling with a bout of inflation, Roosevelt dipped into an arsenal of government interventionist tools in the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. The “Seven-Point Economic Stabilization Program” consisted of price controls, tax hikes, rationing, and less consumer credit. The New Economic Policy, Nixon stated, was designed “to create a new prosperity without war.” Nixon opposed price controls in the months before the announcement, calling these efforts “a scheme to socialize America.” “They didn’t work even at the end of World War II. They will never work in peacetime.” Nixon was also interested in Keynesian economic principles—government intervention in the economy through public policy pursuits aimed at achieving maximum employment and price stability—and was quoted by the American Broadcasting Company as saying he was “now a Keynesian in economics.” “I knew I had opened myself to the charge that I had either betrayed my own principles or concealed my real intentions,” he wrote in his memoirs. Several years later, President Jimmy Carter extended this anti-inflation initiative, which, according to various economic observers, was a continuation of his predecessors’ price and wage controls. The difference? Voluntary compliance. “Because this is not a mandatory control plan, I cannot stop an irresponsible corporation from raising its prices or a selfish group of employees from using its power to demand excessive wages,” Carter stated. “But then if that happens, the government will respond, using the tools of government authority and public opinion.” There has been debate as to whether the current administration has been experimenting with price controls relating to the prescription drug industry. As part of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted 2022, the federal government imposes a 95 percent excise tax on drugmakers if they do not heed the federal government’s price demands. According to a chorus of economists—past and present—the reason might be simple: It is hard for the government to make this inflation-fighting—or, partially in FDR’s case, deflation-fighting—scheme work. “Although economists accept that there are certain limited circumstances in which price controls can improve outcomes, economic theory and analysis of history show that broad price controls would be costly and of limited effectiveness.” The late conservative economist Milton Friedman said “Price and wage controls are counterproductive for this purpose,” in his popular book, “Money Mischief.” “Recently, as it has become clear that such controls are not a cure, they have been urged as a device for mitigating the side effects of a cure,” Friedman wrote. While many economists have understood the necessity to impose temporary price controls in times of crises—natural disasters or war—the economic literature asserts that price controls distort market signals, causing supply disruptions, and misallocating investment. “Anyone who studies the history of economics knows that price controls have never worked for more than a very short (days maybe a week or two) period,” Rod Skyles, author of the blog The Unconventional Economist, told The Epoch Times. “Price controls skew markets, create shortages, and always lead to a thriving black market.” “Anytime government attempts to allocate goods or services over a wide range, it fails, and it fails spectacularly,” he said. He used milk as an example of how price controls are not feasible in a market economy, saying that the government would need to impose price controls on not only the end product itself but all the inputs necessary to produce a carton of milk, be it labor or raw materials. “The government is forced to go further and further, fixing step by step the prices of all consumers’ goods and of all factors of production,” Mises wrote. Despite the plethora of unsuccessful results throughout history, many countries have continued to institute price controls, most recently Argentina (pre-President Javier Milei), Cuba, and Venezuela. Skyles said the issue is that the government doesn’t have the same incentive as the private marketplace to make sound pricing decisions. “Price controls don’t work because the government does not have the correct, up-to-date information to make such decisions, and there is no accountability when they are wrong,” he said.","summary":"Price controls have a long history.

The fundraising event, billed as an “evening reception” with Trump, is scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 12, according to an RSVP page posted by the Trump 47 Committee. The time and location of the event were not divulged. And it won’t be cheap to get in. Tickets range from $3,300 to $250,000. The deadline to RSVP is Tuesday, Sept. 10 — the same day Trump will be in Philadelphia for the debate. That debate will be the first time Trump and Harris will square off in person since the vice president moved to the top of the Democratic ticket after President Joe Biden, politically wounded by a lackluster performance in his debate against Trump, dropped out of the race. Trump this week has sought to discredit that debate, calling ABC News “dishonest” and doubting that tete-a-tete would be fair. Yet, Trump, during a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity in Pennsylvania this week, also tried to present himself as unconcerned about his first head-to-head confrontation with Harris. While the debate will be the first time voters get to compare the two candidates side by side, Thursday’s Los Angeles event will be a chance for Trump to mingle with supporters — and raise campaign cash. Currently, Harris has the advantage when it comes to campaign contributions. The Harris campaign had more than $219 million in cash on hand, as of July 31, according to the documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission. Trump had about $151 million, according to campaign finance documents.

'We went to the soft play this morning and then Tommy picked Bambi up this afternoon, spent the afternoon with her, so things are going well. 'I've not been feeling too bad so I feel like that is a positive.' Molly-Mae said in her break-up announcement: 'Never in a million years did I think I'd ever have to write this... after five years of being together I never imagined our story would end, especially not this way.' She added: 'I will forever be grateful for the most important thing to me now and always, my beautiful daughter. 'Without us there would be no her, she will always be my priority.' It comes after Molly-Mae admitted that she's lonely and bed bound in the wake of her split. In another vlog shared last week, Molly-Mae opened up on life after the break-up, confessing to her fans that weekends are 'horrendous' because it's 'freaking lonely' without her former love. In another video she shared that she had booked a spa day and was looking forward to getting out of the house. She explained: 'I couldn't think of anything worse than just sitting at home all day, especially as that's what I've done for so many days now. 'I've just been sort of house bound, bed bound, Zoe's been coming around to help me a lot with Bambi and also Tommy's been having Bambi as well.'

That’s karma,” Kimmel admitted. In his opening remarks during Wednesday’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, the television host mocked Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for saying Vice President Kamala Harris cannot “put together an English sentence,” and then proceeded to claim that President Trump slurs his words. “You know what, the human flehm ball is right, we do need a president who can put together an English sentence. We need a president who can put together an English sentence like this guy,” Kimmel said, before playing clips of Trump appearing to become tongue-tied while delivering remarks. The television host then made a joke about the government weaponizing the law against the 45th president, saying, “The only sentence Donald Trump can put together is a prison sentence.” Amusingly, karma struck Kimmel just moments later as delivered his own unintelligible remarks while telling a story about Trump’s family members getting their X accounts hacked. “They want you to know, do not be fooled by hackers! The only official sancted-shened crypto scams–” Kimmel said, before cutting himself off and saying, “Now I’m like him.” “You know what? That’s karma,” the TV host acknowledged. “That’s why I’m not gonna be president.” Kimmel then bizarrely began praising President Joe Biden — who at this point is widely known for being unable to string a sentence together — saying his “approval ratings are skyrocketing.” “The president’s approval rating is up seven points to 48 percent,” Kimmel said, before joking, “The last time Joe had an approval rating this high was when he signed the Declaration of Independence.” Alana Mastrangelo is a reporter for Breitbart News.

At a time when such rewards programs have become a vital asset for the traveling public, new efforts are needed to ensure that American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines are providing the promised value for customers, Buttigieg said. \"Points systems like frequent flyer miles and credit card rewards have become such a meaningful part of our economy that many Americans view their rewards points balances as part of their savings,\" he said in a statement. \"These programs bring real value to consumers, with families often counting on airline rewards to fund a vacation or to pay for a trip to visit loved ones. But unlike a traditional savings account, these rewards are controlled by a company that can unilaterally change their value. \"Our goal is to ensure consumers are getting the value that was promised to them, which means validating that these programs are transparent and fair,\" he added. Under the effort, the Department of Transportation is demanding company documents and information covering four categories: devaluation of earned rewards, hidden and dynamic pricing, extra fees and reduction in competition and choice. For instance, the DOT is asking the four airlines to provide documentation on if they reduce the actual dollar value of the points by \"moving the goal posts,\" such as by increasing the number of points needed for redemption, changing an expiration date or adding new hurdles to qualify for status upgrades. Similarly, Buttigieg is demanding airlines provide the average dollar value of one reward point, the value of a point when it is redeemed for various services, and the price to purchase a point directly from the airline. The DOT also seeks to shed light on the \"opaque\" dynamic pricing of frequent flyer points, under which the number of points needed for redemption change \"frequently and unpredictably.\" Extra fees are targeted as well, with the DOT demanding the four airlines \"identify and describe ... each fee associated with their rewards program that is charged to consumers\" and to provide \"the rationale for charging the fee.\" The airlines issued responses on Thursday indicating they are willing cooperate with the probe. \"Our Members' loyalty means everything to us, and providing a meaningful rewards experience is the top priority within Delta's SkyMiles Program,\" Delta Air Lines said in a statement issued to media outlets. \"We received the DOT's inquiry and will respond accordingly.\" The new probe comes as President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, are focusing on consumer protection as a key campaign theme. Last month, the White House announced proposed rule changes across several departments to streamline customer service experiences and prevent companies from saddling consumers with cumbersome waits and processes to cancel services or get refunds. As part of that initiative, the DOT presented a rule that would require airlines to give automatic cash refunds to customers instead of leaving the burden to customers to navigate a series of steps to receive the funds back.","summary":"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Thursday announced the launch of wide ranging probe into the \"fairness and transparency\" of the four biggest U.S. airlines' frequent flyer rewards programs.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/09/05/Buttigieg-launches-investigation-big-airlines-rewards-programs/7361725577573/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7361725577573/2024/upi/785126b7a8560c47e05c9bba55329b0a/v1.2/Buttigieg-launches-investigation-of-big-airlines-rewards-programs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 23:54:03","author":"Don Jacobson","authors":["Don Jacobson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":255750782,"title":"How Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' Child Care and Family Policies Differ","text":"The rising cost of child care is a core issue for some American families already grappling with inflation and the cost of living, but where do the presidential candidates stand on lessening the burden for voters?Former President Donald Trump was pressed on his plans to address child care costs during an appearance before the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, during which the Republican nominee promoted his fiscal policy as a solution to the rising prices of everyday necessities. When asked by Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani if he would \"commit to prioritizing legislation to make child care affordable\" if reelected to office, Trump told the panel of business leaders that his plans to increase taxes on imports could \"take care\" of rising costs like child care.\"Child care is child care, it's something you have to have in this country,\" Trump said, who also touted efforts by his daughter, Ivanka, to address child care costs during his first presidency.\"It's a very important issue,\" Trump continued. \"But I think when you talk about the kind of numbers that I'm talking about ... child care is child care—you know, you have to have it in this country, you have to have it.\"\"But when you talk about those numbers compared to the kind of numbers that I'm talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they're not used to ... Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that we're talking about, including child care, that it's going to take care [of it],\" he added.Newsweek reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment on Trump's statements.The former president's comments arrived a day after his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, was asked about his plans to address child care costs, during a discussion with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.Vance suggested that one way to \"relieve a little bit of pressure\" on families is by making it easier for a family member to stay home with a child rather than having to pay for day care, telling Kirk: \"Maybe Grandma or Grandpa wants to help out a little bit more, or maybe there's an aunt or uncle that wants to help out a little bit more. If that happens, you relieve some of the pressure on all the resources that we're spending on day care.\"The Democratic ticket has offered more specific examples of how they plan to slash the cost of child care and other familial expenses. While on the campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris has touted her work under the Biden administration to establish a national paid family leave, plans for universal preschool programs and efforts to invest billions in federal money to assist in child care costs.She has also outlined plans to increase the child tax credit, which sits at $2,000 per child, up to $3,600, and offer families with newborns up to $6,000 in the first year of the child's life. Speaking to supporters at a rally in North Carolina last month, Harris said that a child's first year is a \"vital year of critical development of a child, and the costs can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else.\"Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, has also made familial expenses a priority in his administration. His state has one of the largest child tax credits in the nation, offering up to $1,750 per child. Walz also signed a bill last year that provided partial wage replacement for up to 20 weeks of leave for parents or others who have to take time off to care for a family member.Trump and Vance have also supported increasing the child tax credit. The Republican vice presidential candidate, for example, has suggested that families get up to $5,000 in relief per child, and the plan would not include income restrictions. Under current federal guidelines, the tax credit is available to couples who make $400,00 or less or individuals making $200,000 or less.A bill that would have expanded the child tax credit to the same levels as during the COVID-19 pandemic—where eligible families got $3,600 per child—was struck down in the Senate at the beginning of last month due to Republican opposition. Vance was not present to vote on the measure, and was pressed by Senate Democrats for his lack of support.\"If JD Vance sincerely gave a whit about working families in America, he would have shown up in the Senate a week and a half ago and voted for my proposal to expand the child tax credit and help 16 million low-income kids get ahead,\" Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement last month.","summary":"Newsweek examined the presidential candidates' positions on lowering costs for American families.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-donald-trump-kamala-harris-child-care-family-policies-differ-1949664","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2465493/how-trump-harris-child-care-polices-differ.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 23:49:14","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":255750842,"title":"Trump rips ‘deeply sick’ Dems for sympathizing with terrorists during virtual Republican Jewish Coalition appearance","text":"LAS VEGAS — Donald Trump wasn’t in the room Thursday at the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) in the swing state’s Sin City, but he still had the crowd of hundreds on their feet cheering on his pro-Israel message. “Kamala Harris is the candidate of the forces who want to destroy Western Civilization and Israel,” Trump told attendees via video link. “I am the candidate of those who want to defend Western Civilization, defend Israel.” “You’re not going to have an Israel if she becomes president,” Trump warned. “Israel will no longer exist.” Trump was met with cheers and roaring applause from his eager audience when he pledged that his administration would “keep America safe, and make sure that Israel is with us for thousands of years.” The ex-prez decried the Hamas terrorists who last weekend killed six Jewish hostages, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin “Only an evil and inhuman, really inhuman ideology, kidnaps, tortures and murders innocent men, women and children,” Trump said of the terrorists. “Likewise,” he said, addressing Democrats, “only a deeply sick political party here in America would make common cause with those who sympathize with such evil and they are.” Trump then touted his foreign policy record to the audience. “When I left office, America was safe. Israel was safe. The Jewish people were safe, and the whole world was at peace,” he said. “American Jews felt safe on our streets and college campuses when I was president and we kept radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.” The Republican Jewish Coalition has been dependably pro-Trump in recent years, and this one was no exception. Attendees hoisted placards with “Trump” in Hebrew and English lettering, and cards reading “Kamala … Oy Vey!” a Yiddish expression conveying dismay or grief. Matt Brooks, the coalition’s chief executive, said the RJC is spending $15 million this cycle to get out the vote and reach “persuadable” Jewish voters in swing states, including Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania. One of the persuaded Thursday was Harvard University grad student Shabbos Kestenbaum, who said he remains a registered Democrat but will vote for Trump because of the anti-Jewish positions expressed by President Biden and Veep Harris.","summary":"Trump was met with cheers and roaring applause from his eager audience when he pledged that his administration would \"keep America safe, and make sure that Israel is with us for thousands of years.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/us-news/trump-rips-antisemitic-dems-on-siding-with-terrorists/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-lncp8wbpk-1725579875502.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725565493&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UOX2eR0w-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-05 23:47:00","author":"Mark A.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said a federal indictment alleges that a Tennessee company got millions in funding to spread Russian propaganda across social media. The effort has been at the direction of Russian leader Vladimir Putin since at least 2022. It involves a slew of fake news sites and a host of popular rightwing commentators. The Tennessee company is not named in the indictment but it’s been identified as Tenet Media. It describes itself as “a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.” Its roster includes high-profile rightwingers Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, Dave Rubin, Lauren Southern, Taylor Hansen and Matt Christiansen. According to court filings, the objectives of the Russian dictator include reducing “international support for Ukraine,” bolstering “pro-Russian policies and interests” and influencing “voters in the US and foreign elections.” CBS News said Putin also wanted to conceal “the Russian government and its agents as the source of the content.” The Justice Department said one of Putin’s goals is \"securing Russia's preferred outcome in the election.” But I don’t think he could have imagined his actual accomplishment. What happens when you brainwash Republicans with years of Russian propaganda? You make them weird. To illustrate, let me take you back to February. Joe Biden was still running for reelection. He was recording a segment with late-night host Seth Meyers. They stopped at a popular ice cream spot in Manhattan. In front of TV cameras, Biden ordered a cone and ate it. I don’t understand the arcana of the rightwing media apparatus. What I do know is Joe Biden eating an ice cream cone triggered his most extreme critics. They used it to infantilize the president, as if eating an ice cream cone made him less manly. Or they alleged that Biden was in the throes of dementia. Ice cream is soft and sweet. People with dementia like to eat soft and sweet things. Ergo, Biden had dementia. What’s important here is that the full spectrum of the rightwing media apparatus pounced on him for eating an ice cream cone. Everyone from Jeanine Pirro and Jesse Watters on Fox to Clay Travis on talk radio to Benny Johnson and Dave Rubin worked to amplify their criticism. It was so loud even people outside their normal reach could hear it. “All of which makes me wonder,” said Slate’s Fred Kaplan. “Have any of these people ever tasted ice cream?” He added: “It is well known that Biden has a penchant for Corvette sports cars, Ray-Ban sunglasses, Amtrak train rides, and now, yes, ice cream cones. These are all-American tastes. It’s this election season that’s getting very weird.” It wasn’t the election season that was getting weird. It was the Republicans and their allies. That wasn’t clear in February, but by August it was. That’s when Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, before he became Kamala Harris’ running mate, said in an interview on “Morning Joe”: “We do not like what has happened where we can’t even go to Thanksgiving dinner because you end up in some weird fight that is unnecessary. “Well, it’s true. These guys are just weird.” But that was just the Democratic Party’s opinion. There still wasn’t something out there with the authority of the Justice Department to suggest an empirical reason why the Republicans turned weird. Why do they stand against ice cream cones and other “all-American tastes”? (These include in vitro fertilization, recreational sex, Taylor Swift and the NFL, according to James Surowiecki.) Why would they field a nominee who’s a fraud, convicted felon, proven rapist and insurrectionist? Why would they pick a vice presidential nominee who can’t order a dozen donuts without looking like a humanoid robot? Why? Because they eat Russian propaganda all day long. They are so far outside the American mainstream they seem practically foreign. I don’t mean to understate the home-grown weirdness of the Republicans. There’s plenty that’s strange about them without me bringing Russian propaganda into it. But I think it’s important to acknowledge how much weirder they are after nearly a decade of nonstop information warfare by the Kremlin. They are so weird that an old man couldn’t enjoy an ice cream cone without it being polarizing. Pointing a finger at the Kremlin also blunts Donald Trump’s attempts to turn the tables. In a talk with Clay Travis, he said the Democrats are “the weird ones. Nobody’s ever called me weird. I’m a lot of things, but weird I’m not.” That could work, but not if people understand that the problem isn’t one party being as good or bad as the other. The problem is one party’s weirdness being made that much weirder by a nation that stands against all Americans and our “all-American tastes.” Putin hoped to rig the election in his and Trump’s favor. But the effort may have backfired. Instead of turning us against each other, Putin is turning Americans against those of us who no longer look and sound all American.","summary":"The US Department of Justice said yesterday that Russia is once again attacking the sovereignty of the United States by mounting yet another campaign to influence the outcome of a presidential election. \n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said a federal indictment alleges that a Tennessee company got millions in funding to spread Russian propaganda across social media.

Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who has made it a mission to make sure Donald Trump never again is president, endorsed Kamala Harris on Wednesday with a specific instruction: Swing state voters who are against Trump but gag at the thought of voting for a Democrat don’t have the “luxury” this time around to merely write in someone else. To block Trump, they have to vote for Harris. Cheney sacrificed her House seat when she became one of the nation’s leading Trump critics — serving as co-chair of the committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by Trump followers trying to block Joe Biden from becoming president. She is now going on the road to amplify her message, independent of the Harris-Walz campaign. On Friday, Cheney will be in Austin for the Texas Tribune Festival. She will talk about “defending democracy” with Mark Leibovich, a writer for The Atlantic. While in Texas, Cheney will keep hammering home the message that just not voting for Trump isn’t enough. Harris needs votes to win. Cheney also is likely to be booked on one of the Sunday national news programs. All this comes as Harris and Trump debate for the first time on Tuesday, in Philadelphia. I’ve done some reporting. Here’s what else I know: Why Cheney chose not to endorse Harris at the DNC The Harris-Walz campaign would have welcomed her. Former Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican member of the Jan. 6 committee and a fierce Trump critic, was among the Republicans speaking at the United Center. “Tonight, as a Republican speaking before you, I’m putting our country first,” said Kinzinger. Cheney skipped the Democratic convention in order to maximize her appeal to very specific voter segments — independents, people in the middle, Republicans on the center-right or right-leaning. Delivering her endorsement to an arena packed full of Democrats cheering her on may not have helped her persuade the people Harris needs in order to win. Anyway, Cheney is her own woman, with her own timeline. As the saying goes, she marches to the beat of her own drummer. And the Harris-Walz campaign can still use their resources to maximize the Cheney endorsement. What Cheney said on Wednesday Cheney got a standing ovation after delivering her Harris endorsement at a Duke University forum in the swing state of North Carolina. Asked if she wanted to announce who she is endorsing in 2024, Cheney said, “Because we are here in North Carolina, I think it is crucially important for people to recognize not only is what I’ve just said about the danger that Trump poses, something that should prevent people from voting for him, but I don’t believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates’ names, particularly in swing states. “And, as a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.” Speaking to “fellow conservatives,” she said given the stakes of the election, “we have a duty, a duty, to put our country and our Constitution above partisanship. We all have that duty and responsibility.” What’s next for Cheney Cheney wants to be visible and engaged in the weeks leading up to the election. I don’t expect her to be showing up at rallies for now — her preferred platform is the speaker series, whether sponsored by media outlets or universities, or the like. After North Carolina and Texas, Cheney hits Madison in the swing state of Wisconsin for the Cap Times Idea Fest on Sept. 20. By the way…Mayor Brandon Johnson will speak at the festival on Sept. 16. Cheney appears at the Philadelphia Speakers Series, in the swing state of Pennsylvania, on Sept. 23. She’s in Boston for speakers series events on Sept. 24 and 25 – in a media market that bleeds into New Hampshire — a state in play, though not one of the very top battlegrounds. After that she is booked at Stevenson University in Baltimore on Oct. 10; the Pittsburgh Speakers series on Oct. 16; Drew University in New Jersey on Oct. 23, among other stops. Cheney has vowed to do everything in her power to prevent another Trump presidency. With this close race, Cheney is poised, in her own independent way, to go all in.

Biden had been set to stand trial in a Los Angeles federal courthouse on criminal charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes while spending lavishly on drugs, sex workers and luxury items. Instead, he pleaded guilty to all nine counts he faced. Judge Mark Scarsi told Biden he faces up to 17 years in prison and up to $450,000 in penalties. He set sentencing for Dec. 16. Defendants who plead guilty in criminal cases typically work out an agreement with prosecutors beforehand, hoping to receive a lower sentence in exchange for avoiding trial. That did not appear to be the case here. Earlier in the day, Biden had offered to plead guilty to the charges but avoid admitting wrongdoing, an unusual legal maneuver called an \"Alford plea.\" Prosecutors opposed that move. After a break, Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell told the judge that he would plead guilty, despite having no prior agreement with prosecutors that would ease his sentence. In a statement after the hearing, Biden said he pleaded guilty to spare his family from having to sit through a trial that would have aired messy details from a period of his life where he was suffering from drug addiction. \"For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this,\" he said. He added that he had paid back his taxes. Lowell told reporters afterward that Biden might appeal his sentence. He did not answer when asked why Biden waited until the trial's opening day to plead guilty. The guilty plea heads off a weeks-long trial that would have taken place at the height of the election campaign. Voters will choose on Nov. 5 between Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, and Republican former President Donald Trump. Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid in July under pressure from his fellow Democrats. Hunter Biden, who has been open about his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction, is accused of failing to pay taxes from 2016 to 2019 while spending huge sums \"on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature,” according to an indictment. The trial could also have shed light on his work with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and other business dealings while his father was vice president. The president's Republican foes have claimed those activities by his son were corrupt. The indictment says Hunter Biden \"earned handsomely\" while serving on the boards of Burisma and a Chinese private equity fund. Hunter Biden has denied any improper business dealings and Republican-led investigations in Congress have not directly implicated his father in any wrongdoing. He is appealing a guilty verdict in a separate case in Delaware for illegally buying a gun while using drugs. That conviction means he could face a stiffer sentence for the tax case if convicted, because he would be a repeat offender.

Kathy Hochul doubles down on opposition to fracking — even after Kamala Harris said she backs it","text":"Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday insisted “we’re not fracking” in New York to boost the energy supply — despite Vice President Kamala Harris saying she now favors such drilling for natural gas. “We’re not fracking, we’re not burning coal. We’re not going backwards,” the Democratic governor said during a “future energy economy summit” in Syracuse. It came after Harris, her party’s nominee for the White House, said during her recent CNN interview that she would “not ban fracking” if elected president – a major reversal from her position during her first run for the Oval Office in 2020. “As vice president I did not ban fracking. As president I will not ban fracking,” Harris said in her first interview after replacing President Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Fracking is a jobs producer and popular in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state for the White House. But Hochul made it abundantly clear she doesn’t want to “frack, baby frack” along New York’s gas rich southern tier of the Marcellus Shale formation that borders Pennsylvania. During the tail end of her speech, Hochul said, “I’m so excited about the ‘all above approach’ — except for the fracking and coal.” Instead, she trumpeted carbon-free power generated by offshore wind, solar, geothermal or other types of energy. Some of her energy officials also talked up nuclear power during the summit. Fracking is the drilling procedure injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rock to force open existing fissures and extract oil or gas. A report by the Manhattan Institute think tank a decade ago estimated that 15,000 to 18,000 jobs could be created in the Southern Tier and Western New York if fracking were permitted, generating up to $11.4 billion in economic output and $1.4 billion in state and local tax revenue. After years of study and controversy, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo banned fracking in 2014 after a health department study cited public health risks because of the potential to contaminated groundwater. There’s little support in the Democratic-run legislature to revisit the issue. Fracking generated intense opposition from the environmental left and celebrities including Yoko and Sean Ono and actor Mark Ruffalo. Vintners from New York’s growing wine industry in the nearby Finger Lakes region also opposed fracking.","summary":"Gov.

'We weren’t really in it from day one,' she recalled to host, Alex Cooper. 'He was because he had just done a huge time of celibacy and he had set intentions.' Unlike Bloom, who had stayed abstinent for six months prior to fatefully meeting Perry at a Golden Globes afterparty, the mother-of-one said she was 'fresh out of a relationship' and not in the right mindset for something serious. 'I was like, \"I can’t do this anymore. I need to swim in a different pond.\" But, I had to do a lot real work,' she explained. Katy Perry detailed what led to her year-long split from her fiancé Orlando Bloom back in February 2017, after 10 months of dating (seen in April 2024) Read More Katy Perry enjoys rare family outing with fiancé Orlando Bloom in NYC Following Bloom's stay at a week-long retreat, called The Hoffman Experience, Perry remembers a shift between them that resulted in them amicably breaking up. 'He went there, and he wasn’t playing that cat-mouse game anymore,' she said. 'And I was like, \"This is boring. I’m moving on.\" I was so used to this push-pull. Because once you have it. I was playing games.' After a 'really tough year' apart from each other, she decided to go on the personal growth retreat, which 'helps participants identify negative behaviors, moods, and ways of thinking that developed unconsciously and were conditioned in childhood.' According to their website, it costs $5,350 and includes 'lodging, all meals and snacks, more than 90 hours of professional instruction and guidance, individualized attention and a post-Process call with your teacher.' 'I finally went to Hoffman towards the end of that year that we were separated, and I got the tools,' the Roar hitmaker revealed. 'We spoke the same language.' In addition to crediting the retreat for helping her rekindle with Bloom, she said she 'would be dead without it.' 'I would not be on this planet without that process and meditation. Because the noise got so large. When Witness came out and things started to shift, and I thought I really loved myself. I thought I really had that center, but actually that core was created from outside validation. It just helped me rewire what I think about myself, and it helped me connect my head to my heart,' she said. As for her favorite thing about her fiancé, who popped the question on Valentine's Day in 2019, she said: 'He shows up.' While appearing on Wednesday's episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast, the 39-year-old pop star finally revealed why she and the Lord of the Rings star, 47, called it quits after less than a year together 'We weren’t really in it from day one,' she recalled to host, Alex Cooper. 'He was because he had just done a huge time of celibacy and he had set intentions' 'I showed him the worst of me,' she said. 'I was like, \"Here’s the next test. I’m gonna show you the craziest b**ch you’ve ever seen,\" and he was like, \"I’m not shook.\" And I was like, \"You’re my baby daddy. If you’re not shook by this, then we’re going the distance.\"' To continue to improve their relationship, the lovebirds, who share a three-year-old daughter named Daisy, go to couple's therapy. 'We want to evolve that’s I think why we’re in our relationship is to become better humans so we can raise this beautiful human being,' she said. 'It’s been different layers. The more we do the work, the more we find the next level.' She added: 'Sometimes we get stuck, and we’re like, \"OK, let’s go in to do the work and this is going to be annoying, and I don’t want to do it. We don’t have the time. I’m tired.\" But we’re gonna do it. And we find the next level. That’s why we’re continuing in the relationship.' Unlike Bloom, who had stayed abstinent for six months prior to fatefully meeting Perry at Golden Globes afterparty, the mother-of-one said she was 'fresh out of a relationship' 'I was like, \"I can’t do this anymore. I need to swim in a different pond.\" But, I had to do a lot real work,' she explained of what led to their separation; seen in 2021 Earlier this year, the Pirates of the Caribbean talked about how he first 'fell in love' with Katy on the podcast What Now? With Trevor Noah. 'One of the things that I fell in love with with Katy was like, I didn’t really - she hates when I say this, so I have to word it carefully - but her music was everywhere, right?' Orlando recalled on Trevor's podcast. 'When I came up, it was just on every radio station, but I wasn’t conscious of - like, it wasn’t what I was listening to,' he admitted. 'But I fell in love with Katheryn, this girl from Santa Barbara - and by the way, parents, pastors, living on food stamps. We’re not talking glamorous, Montecito,' he noted. Katy has spoken candidly about growing up in a poor family, falling back on food banks and at times even busking when she was a teenage girl. Meanwhile, Orlando had a boarding school upbringing in England before landing his star-making role in The Lord Of The Rings when he was two days out of drama school. He reflected that he and Katy 'both meet each other with understanding where we came from, what we worked to do, what we had to do to get to where we got to.' Orlando explained that the Firework crooner 'definitely demands that I evolve, right? And I feel I do the same for her. And that makes for fireworks, pardon the pun, but it also makes for a lot of fun and a lot of growth.' He added: 'And, you know, I wouldn’t change it for anything, even when sometimes it feels like: \"How do we do this?\" Because we’ve got these two giant careers and lives and hers is even, you know, there’s even – it’s like a universe sometimes.' Last year he noted that he and Katy work in 'two very different pools' of the entertainment industry, which can lead to difficulties between them. Katy and Orlando got engaged in 2019, and the following year they welcomed their daughter Daisy Dove Bloom, who will turn four in August 'Her pool is not a pool that I necessarily understand, and I think my pool is not a pool that she necessarily understands,' he told Flaunt. 'Sometimes things are really, really, really, challenging. I won’t lie. We definitely battle with our emotions and creativity, [but] I think we’re both aware of how blessed we are to have uniquely connected in the way that we did at the time that we did, and there’s definitely never a dull moment,' shared Orlando.

To varying degrees, many of the proposed constitutional amendments would codify the right to kill unborn babies in abortions throughout pregnancy. Abortion activists reject this claim, touting the viability standard included in most measures — which is between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy — while de-emphasizing vaguely-worded exceptions for abortions later in pregnancy. Pro-life organizations and some Republicans warn that the vague wording of some of these measures would undo state-level protections for unborn babies and pregnant women and potentially undo parental consent and notification laws, among other concerns. When the Supreme Court issued its Dobbs decision on June 24, 2022, it overturned Roe v. Wade, which had invented a federal right to abortion for 50 years. The Dobbs decision thus returned the issue of abortion to individual states and their elected representatives, changing the nature of the struggle between the pro-life movement and the abortion industry. Pro-abortion organizations and activists have stealthily turned to ballot measures in the hopes of shoring up the growing abortion complex in the shift from federal to state power. Ballot measures are particularly effective as an offensive weapon because they are basically irreversible: they change a state constitution, take precedence over laws passed by state legislatures, and can only be overturned by another ballot measure. The measures are typically propped up by left-wing organizations and affiliates with deep pockets — such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU — out-of-state dark money groups, and billionaires with eugenicist leanings, oftentimes outspending pro-life organizations by double or triple. Every single pro-abortion-related ballot measure since the fall of Roe has been successful. During the 2022 special elections, Kansans rejected a ballot measure that would have established that the state Constitution does not include a right to abortion. During the 2022 midterms, voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont codified abortion into their Constitutions. At the same time, voters in Montana rejected a ballot measure that would have given rights to babies born alive in botched abortions. Voters in Kentucky also rejected an amendment similar to the one in Kansas. Last November, Ohioans also voted to codify the supposed right to abortion in their state Constitution via Issue 1. State by state, Republicans have been working to protect the unborn, while Democrats have expanded abortion nationwide via shield laws, telehealth, and tens of millions of dollars spent establishing their states as abortion havens. Last year saw the highest number and rate of abortions measured in the United States — there were an estimated 1,026,690 unborn babies killed in abortions in the formal U.S. health care system and a rate of 15.7 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, according to a report from the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute. That number is a ten percent increase in abortions from 2020. While abortion activists and Democrats wage their state-level campaigns, Vice president and Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris has made abortion and restoring a federal “right” to abortion the centerpiece of her reelection campaign — a stark contrast to former President Donald Trump’s position that individual states should set their own abortion laws. Harris’s intense focus on abortion is not unexpected, given that one in four Democrats are single-issue voters on abortion and that the majority of independents identify as “pro-choice.” Harris also has a history of working closely with pro-abortion organizations and targeting pro-life activists and journalists. The focus on abortion and painting Republicans as dangerous to women also seems like a ploy to distract from Americans’ top concerns under the Biden administration — the flailing economy and the border, which is essentially open — and potentially drive voter turnout to boost Democrats in other highly consequential elections. Abortion groups are spending big and working closely with Democrats to set policy demands, should the party successfully capitalize on the issue and clinch control of Congress and/or the presidency. Officially On the Ballot Colorado The proposed abortion measure, put forward by the group Coloradans for Protecting Reproductive Freedom, would ultimately enshrine the right to unlimited abortion in the state constitution and would also override a 1984 measure that prohibits health insurance from covering abortions for public employees and those on public insurance. “The right to abortion is hereby recognized. Government shall not deny, impede, or discriminate against the exercise of that right, including prohibiting health insurance coverage for abortion,” the proposed measure reads. The Colorado measure, which will appear as Initiative 89, would need the support of 55 percent of voters to pass. Abortion is currently legal in Colorado throughout pregnancy. Florida The proposed abortion amendment in Florida is backed by Floridians Protecting Freedom — a coalition of left-wing groups that includes Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Florida — and bars the state from restricting abortion before viability (approximately 24 weeks) or “when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” The ballot summary states: No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion. Current Florida law does require minors to have the consent of a parent or guardian to have an abortion. The measure will appear as “Amendment 4” on the general election ballot, according to state officials. It needs 60 percent support to pass. Abortion in Florida is currently restricted after six weeks of pregnancy, which is often when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. South Dakota The South Dakota proposed abortion amendment, put forward by the group Dakotans for Health, would allow abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy and would only allow the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester in ways related to the physical health of the pregnant woman. The amendment would allow abortion to be regulated or prohibited in the third trimester, except when necessary to preserve “the life or health” of the mother. The measure, which will appear as Amendment G, states: Before the end of the first trimester, the State may not regulate a pregnant woman’s abortion decision and its effectuation, which must be left to the judgment of the pregnant woman. After the end of the first trimester and until the end of the second trimester, the State may regulate the pregnant woman’s abortion decision and its effectuation only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman. After the end of the second trimester, the State may regulate or prohibit abortion, except when abortion is necessary, in the medical judgment of the woman’s physician, to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman. Abortion is currently outlawed in the state, except to “preserve the life of the pregnant female.” The measure would need a simple majority to pass, and would override the state’s current law. Maryland Maryland lawmakers voted in March of 2023 to place an abortion ballot measure in front of voters in November of 2024. The proposed amendment, which will appear as Question 1, states: That every person, as a central component of an individual’s rights to liberty and equality, has the fundamental right to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end one’s own pregnancy. The state may not, directly or indirectly, deny, burden, or abridge the right unless justified by a compelling state interest achieved by the least restrictive means. A simple majority of voters need to approve it for it to pass. There is already no limit on abortion in Maryland. New York New York Democrats passed a measure, called the Equal Rights Amendment, for the second time last year, giving it the green light to go before voters in November. The amendment, which will appear as Proposal 1, states: No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws of this state or any subdivision thereof. No person shall, because of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, creed, religion, or sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy, be subjected to any discrimination in their civil rights by any other person or by any firm, corporation, or institution, or by the state or any agency or subdivision of the state, pursuant to law. The measure would need a simple majority to pass. In New York, abortion is legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks if a woman’s health is at risk. Nebraska Two warring proposed abortion amendments will appear on Nebraska’s ballot in November. One measure, called the Protect Women and Children amendment, would enshrine the state’s current 12-week restriction into the state constitution, and contains exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. Republican Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed a bill in May 2023 that restricts abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy and outlaws “gender-affirming care” for minors. Before the 12-week limit was in effect, Nebraska limited abortions to 20 weeks of pregnancy. The ballot measure reads: Except when a woman seeks an abortion necessitated by a medical emergency or when the pregnancy results from sexual assault or incest, unborn children shall be protected from abortion in the second and third trimesters. The Protect Women and Children Nebraska Committee is comprised of four medical professionals and is backed by pro-life groups in the state as an alternative to the other ballot measure, which would allow abortions throughout pregnancy. Nebraska Family Alliance, which also supports the measure, said it “establishes a floor of protection, not a ceiling, meaning preborn children must, at a minimum, be protected by the second trimester, and stronger pro-life laws could still be passed going forward.” The other proposed amendment — the Protect the Right to Abortion amendment — would allow abortions until fetal viability, which is around 24 weeks of pregnancy, and then throughout pregnancy under some exceptions. The coalition behind the measure is called the Protect Our Rights campaign, and is endorsed by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nebraska and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska. The measure would amend the state constitution to read: All persons shall have a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, without interference from the state or its political subdivisions. Fetal viability means the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient’s treating health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures. The measures are competing, meaning if voters somehow approve both amendments, they cannot both be enshrined into the state constitution. The one that garners the most “for” votes is the one that is supposed to be adopted. Either measure will need a majority to pass, as well as the support of 35 percent of voters casting ballots. Montana An abortion measure in Montana seeks to enshrine a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that said the constitutional right to privacy protects the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice. The proposed amendment would allow for abortions throughout pregnancy, per the judgment of a doctor to protect a woman’s life or health, and would prevent the government from penalizing anyone involved in their own or another’s voluntary decision to have an abortion. The proposed measure, which will appear as CI-128, states: CI-128 would amend the Montana Constitution to expressly provide a right to make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion. It would prohibit the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion before fetal viability. It would also prohibit the government from denying or burdening access to an abortion when a treating healthcare professional determines it is medically indicated to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health. CI-128 prevents the government from penalizing patients, healthcare providers, or anyone who assists someone in exercising their right to make and carry out voluntary decisions about their pregnancy. The coalition behind the ballot measure is comprised of pro-abortion groups including Planned Parenthood of Montana, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Fairness Project. The effort comes after Montanans voted against an amendment in 2022 that would have mandated that infants who are born alive, including those who survive botched abortions, are legal persons entitled to life-saving medical care. The measure needs a simple majority to pass. Abortion is currently legal in Montana up to fetal viability, which is the stage of pregnancy when a baby has developed enough that it is able to survive outside the womb with medical intervention — typically around 22 to 24 weeks. Arizona An abortion measure will appear on the Arizona ballot as “Proposition 139.” The proposed amendment is being put forward by Arizona for Abortion Access — a coalition of groups including ACLU of Arizona, Affirm Sexual and Reproductive Health, Arizona List, Healthcare Rising Arizona, NARAL Arizona, and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona. The measure would amend the Arizona constitution to declare that “every individual has a fundamental right to abortion” and bars the state from doing anything that: Denies, restricts, or interferes with that right before fetal viability unless justified by a compelling state interest that is achieved by the least restrictive means. Denies, restricts, or interferes with an abortion after fetal viability that, in the good faith judgment of a treating health care professional, is necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant individual. Penalizes any individual or entity for aiding or assisting a pregnant individual in exercising that individual’s right to abortion as provided in this section. Abortion is currently restricted in Arizona after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which is when an unborn baby is believed to be capable of feeling pain. The Arizona Supreme Court allowed a near-total abortion ban from 1864 to go into effect over the 15-week restriction in April. However, Democrat Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs quickly signed a bill repealing the law on May 2. The abortion measure needs a simple majority to pass. Its passage would undo the state’s current 15-week abortion limit. Missouri An abortion measure will appear as Amendment 3 on Missouri’s November general election ballot The group behind the measure is Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, which is comprised of left-wing groups, including Abortion Action Missouri, the ACLU of Missouri, and the state’s Planned Parenthood affiliates. The proposed amendment would allow abortion until fetal viability, which is generally considered to be around 24 weeks of pregnancy. The amendment also permits abortions after that point if “in the good faith judgment of a treating health care professional [an abortion] is needed to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.” The measure also states: The Government shall not deny or infringe upon a person’s fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which is the right to make and carry out decision about all matters relating to reproductive health care, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care, and respectful birthing conditions. … The right to reproductive freedom shall not be denied, interfered with, delayed, or otherwise restricted unless the Government demonstrates that such actions is justified by a compelling governmental interest achieved by the least restrictive means. Any detail, interference, delay, or restriction of the right to reproductive freedom shall be presumed invalid. The measure further states that no person “shall be penalized, prosecuted, or otherwise subjected to adverse action based on their actual, potential, perceived, or alleged pregnancy outcomes, including but not limited to miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion.” “Nor shall any person assisting a person in exercising their right to reproductive freedom with person’s consent be penalized, prosecuted, or otherwise subjected to adverse action for doing so,” the measure reads. Abortion is currently outlawed in Missouri, except for in medical emergencies or to save a woman’s life. The abortion amendment would undo the state’s abortion restriction. The measure needs 50.1 percent support to pass. Nevada The proposed amendment in Nevada would further expand the state constitution to include the “fundamental right to reproductive freedom,” including prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation, abortion, and “abortion care.” The pro-abortion coalition pushing the ballot measure includes several left-wing organizations and Planned Parenthood affiliation. The amendment allows state lawmakers to regulate abortion after “fetal viability,” which is around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, but allows abortions throughout pregnancy if “in the professional judgment of an attending provider of health care, [the abortion] is medically indicated to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant individual.” If the proposed measure passes in November, it would have to pass again in 2026 before being added to the constitution, per state law. In Nevada, a statute was upheld through a referendum vote in 1990 allowing abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy. The law allows abortions throughout pregnancy when the life of the mother is in danger or for health reasons. Katherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

Speaking at the New York Economic Club, the former president also pledged to slash corporate tax rates for companies that manufacture domestically, establish “low-tax” zones on federal lands where construction companies would be encouraged to build new homes, and start a sovereign wealth fund. Trump had been discussing the idea of an efficiency commission with aides for weeks, people with knowledge of those conversations have told Reuters. His speech today, however, was the first time he publicly endorsed the idea. It was also the first time Trump said Musk had agreed to head the body. Trump did not detail how such a commission would operate, besides saying it would develop a plan to eliminate “fraud and improper payments” within six months of being formed. “I will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government,” Trump told an audience that included Trump’s former treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and financiers Scott Bessent and John Paulson. Musk said on an Aug. 19 podcast that he had held conversations with the former president about the commission and that he would be interested in serving on it. “I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises,” the Tesla chief wrote on X today. “No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.” Politicians have called for separate efficiency commissions before. Republican President Ronald Reagan established a similar body during his 1981-1989 term called the Grace Commission. Trump’s proposal drew a rebuke from Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 750,000 federal workers. He accused Trump and Musk of wanting to gut the nonpartisan civil service and replace fired workers with allies. “There’s nothing efficient about that,” Kelley told Reuters. Asked by Reuters about Musk heading the proposed government efficiency panel, Paulson said it was “great to have him as an ally. He’s a terrific businessman, and I think the government could become much, much more efficient.” CORPORATE TAX CUTS, HOUSING ON FEDERAL LANDS During his speech, Trump reiterated his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21%, but only for companies that manufacture domestically. He also said he would open up federal land to homebuilding in a bid to drive down housing costs. These new housing zones would be “low-tax” and “low-regulation,” Trump said, without elaborating. While Trump had already said he wanted to cut the corporate rate to 15%, he had not previously tied that rate to keeping manufacturing inside the country. Trump also called for creating a sovereign wealth fund, in part to fund major infrastructure projects. He added that he would rescind unspent funds related to the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, one of Biden’s signature legislative accomplishments. And Trump said he would “issue a national emergency declaration” in a bid to help new energy projects more easily clear bureaucratic hurdles. Trump said he would ban mortgages for migrants living illegally in California, after asserting without evidence that they were driving up housing costs. He did not provide specifics on how he would enact such a ban. Banks can provide mortgages to migrants in the country illegally, but do so infrequently. Trump’s housing affordability plan differs drastically from that of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, who has proposed creating a $25,000 credit for first-time homebuyers. Harris’ plan has been criticized by Republicans and some economists who say the credit will drive up housing prices. Trump’s plan to develop federal lands, on the other hand, could draw the ire of environmentalists, and it is unclear how much housing demand there would be in the rural areas where most federal land is located. Responding to a question from the audience, Trump said he would apply punitive economic sanctions to other countries only sparingly, so as not to threaten the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, a position at odds with his record during his time in office. During Trump’s 2017-2021 term, sanctions were a go-to foreign policy tool, and some advisers have advocated expanding sanctions against Iran and Russia. Harris policy adviser Brian Nelson said Trump’s economic agenda would “explode the national debt,” while driving up inflation and killing jobs. Trump is seen as a more competent steward of the economy by more voters. But his advantage over Harris on the issue is rapidly eroding, surveys show. Trump had an 11-percentage-point advantage on the economy in July, but that dropped to a 3-point lead in August, Reuters/Ipsos polling showed. Many economists believe the economic policies sketched out by Trump on the campaign trail will lower growth and drive inflation higher. But they also note that in order to implement much of his policy agenda, Republicans need to retain control of the House of Representatives and seize the Senate from Democrats.

It was a surprise move that heads off a potentially embarrassing trial weeks before the US presidential election. Biden had been set to stand trial in a Los Angeles federal courthouse on criminal charges of failing to pay $US1.4 million ($2 million) in taxes while spending lavishly on drugs, sex workers and luxury items. Instead, he pleaded guilty to all nine counts. Judge Mark Scarsi told Biden he faced up to 17 years in prison and up to $US450,000 in penalties. He set sentencing for December 16. Defendants who plead guilty in criminal cases typically work out an agreement with prosecutors beforehand, hoping to receive a lower sentence. That did not appear to be the case here. Earlier in the day, Biden had offered to plead guilty to the charges but avoid admitting wrongdoing, an unusual legal manoeuvre called an Alford plea. Prosecutors opposed that move. After a break, Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell told the judge he would plead guilty, despite having no prior agreement with prosecutors that would ease his sentence. In a statement after the hearing, Biden said he pleaded guilty to spare his family from having to sit through a trial that would have aired messy details from a period of his life in which he was suffering from drug addiction. \"For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this,\" he said. He added that he had paid back his taxes. Mr Lowell told reporters afterwards that Biden might appeal his sentence. He did not answer when asked why Biden waited until the trial's opening day to plead guilty. The guilty plea heads off a weeks-long trial that would have taken place at the height of the election campaign. Voters will choose on November 5 between Vice-President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, and Republican former president Donald Trump. Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid in July under pressure from his fellow Democrats. Hunter Biden, who has been open about his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction, is accused of failing to pay taxes from 2016 to 2019 while spending huge sums \"on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature\", according to an indictment. The trial could also have shed light on his work with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and other business dealings while his father was vice-president. The president's Republican foes have claimed those activities by his son were corrupt. The indictment says Hunter Biden \"earned handsomely\" while serving on the boards of Burisma and a Chinese private equity fund. Hunter Biden has denied any improper business dealings and Republican-led investigations in Congress have not directly implicated his father in any wrongdoing. He is appealing a guilty verdict in a separate case in Delaware for illegally buying a gun while using drugs. That conviction means he could face a stiffer sentence for the tax case if convicted, because he would be a repeat offender. The White House has said Joe Biden has ruled out pardoning his son.

I know I have mine locked up.” Biden has called for stricter gun control laws for the duration of his time in office, often mentioning his desire to restore an “assault weapons” ban that was in place between 1994 and 2004. This time he mentioned safe storage laws and said parents should be held responsible when their children commit crimes using guns. “How could you not have an assault rifle, a weapon in a house, not locked up and knowing your kid knows where it is?” he said. “You gotta hold parents accountable if they let their child have access to these guns.” Four people were killed after a gunman opened fire at a high school 50 miles northeast of Atlanta on Wednesday in an incident being investigated by multiple law enforcement agencies. Police announced the shooter was Colt Gray, 14, a student at the high school. He is in police custody and has been charged with murder. Law enforcement also said Gray will be tried as an adult. Gray was known to law enforcement, as the FBI’s Atlanta division said Wednesday it had received several anonymous tips about online threats he had made. Gray and his father were subsequently questioned by local law enforcement. “The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office located a possible subject, a 13-year-old male, and interviewed him and his father. The father stated he had hunting guns in the house, but the subject did not have unsupervised access to them. The subject denied making the threats online. Jackson County alerted local schools for continued monitoring of the subject,” the statement from FBI Atlanta said. Officials said Gray has been charged with four counts of felony murder, with additional charges expected to be levied against him. He will make his first court appearance at 8:30 a.m. on Friday. Vice President Kamala Harris offered condolences and vowed that “we must end the epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all” in a statement on Wednesday.

Turnbull had used their shared backgrounds as businessmen to emphasise that a deal is a deal, but Trump described it as a “stupid” agreement that would “make me look terrible”. The Trump administration honoured the deal, but the president wasn’t pleased about it – and he raced to end the introductory phone call with his Australian counterpart. “As far as I am concerned that is enough, Malcolm. I have had it,” said Trump, according to the transcript published by the Washington Post. “I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.” Now, as the Australian government contemplates the possibility of Trump returning to the White House, local analysts say his impulses “run counter to Australians’ instincts” and could be “damaging”. The Trump assassination attempt, the pressure on Joe Biden to pull out of the race, the subsequent coronation of Kamala Harris have all received extensive media coverage in Australia. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s live news channel interrupted Australia’s own parliamentary question time to air Biden’s speech to the Democratic National Convention. A YouGov poll in August tested Australian views on the contenders. When asked who they would vote for in the US election, 67% of Australian respondents said they would vote for Harris and 33% said Trump. It’s not just the personalities that have grabbed attention but also the realisation that as a US treaty ally, Australia would be tangibly affected by the election outcome. Michael Fullilove, the executive director of the the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy thinktank based in Sydney, says a Harris administration “would likely hew pretty closely to traditional US foreign policy positions”. “Donald Trump is a different matter,” Fullilove says. “Trump is sympathetic to isolationism; Australians are inclined towards internationalism. Trump swoons over autocrats and strongmen; Australia is an old democracy and a free society.” Most of the speculation has been focused on the Aukus deal, under which the US will sell Australia at least three Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines in the 2030s, before a new class – to be called SSN-Aukus – starts rolling off South Australian production lines in the 2040s. While the sale of submarines is not scheduled to occur during the next presidential administration, there is concern in Canberra over Trump-fuelled unpredictability. The Australian ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, and other Australian officials have been working to entrench support for Aukus on both sides of politics. Rudd, a former prime minister, once described Trump as “the most destructive president in history” but since joining the diplomatic frontlines has been working to mend fences. The Labor prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has insisted the US alliance runs deep and Australia will be able to work closely with whoever wins the election. But Trump would probably be unimpressed to learn that Albanese in 2021 took aim at the then conservative prime minister, Scott Morrison, for failing to condemn Trump strongly enough for inciting the Capitol riots. It all adds up to potentially challenging and unpredictable diplomatic encounters. Canberra is also concerned at the prospects of Trump ramping up the US-China trade war by imposing new tariffs on imported goods, causing spillover economic effects. “Trump is hostile to free trade,” Fullilove says. “The new tariffs he promises to introduce would be extremely damaging for a trading nation such as Australia.” Fullilove warns that Trump’s “settling point” on China remains unclear and many are concerned that the Republican nominee “would be overly combative”. “But equally concerning is the possibility that Trump would seek a grand bargain with China, perhaps trading away the security interests of the United States and its Indo-Pacific allies in return for trade concessions,” Fullilove says. And on climate, the differences are stark: while the Biden-Harris administration has labelled climate cooperation a key pillar of the alliance with Australia, Trump has threatened to once again tear up climate policies. Emma Shortis, a senior researcher at the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, says a Trump victory would “encourage already ineffective climate policy to get worse and give the Australian government another convenient scapegoat for our own inadequate policies”. Shortis, who challenged the foreign policy consensus in her 2021 book Our Exceptional Friend: Australia’s Fatal Alliance with the United States, says the looming election raises big questions about the relationship. “A Trump victory would be catastrophic for American democracy and make for a radical reshaping of America’s role in the world – not to isolationism, as is widely assumed, but to something much more aggressive. The implications of that for Aukus, and for Australian sovereignty, are deeply worrying.” Shortis believes a Harris victory would represent “something quite different”. In part, she says, it would continue the status quo, “but there are hints – in Harris’s choice of Tim Walz as running mate and the tenor of the campaign – of the possibility of generational change in American politics”.","summary":"Canberra is focused on what a second Trump presidency could mean for Aukus – its deal to acquire nuclear-powered submarines\n\nAustralians have already had a taste of the turbulence of dealing with Donald Trump, courtesy of a leaked 2017 phone call between the newly inaugurated president and the then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n\n“I think it is a horrible deal, a disgusting deal that I would have never made,” Trump said as Turnbull implored him to honour a refugee resettlement agreement made with the Obama administration.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/06/australia-thought-it-was-done-with-trump-now-the-us-treaty-ally-is-readying-for-his-possible-return","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/434b676957bcf76df3c92156dfeab6b9a4205f75/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 23:10:08","author":"Daniel Hurst","authors":["Daniel Hurst"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":255752466,"title":"The Russian Propaganda Attack on America","text":"When people think of the world of espionage, they probably imagine glamorous foreign capitals, suave undercover operators, and cool gadgets. The reality is far more pedestrian: Yesterday, the Justice Department revealed an alleged Russian scheme to pay laundered money to American right-wing social-media trolls that seems more like a bad sitcom pitch than a top-notch intelligence operation. According to a federal indictment unsealed yesterday, two Russian citizens, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, worked with a Tennessee company not named in the indictment but identified in the press as likely to be Tenet Media, owned by the conservative entrepreneurs Lauren Chen and her husband, Liam Donovan. The Russians work for RT, a Kremlin-controlled propaganda outlet; they are accused of laundering nearly $10 million and directing the money to the company. Chen and Donovan then allegedly used most of that money to pay for content from right-wing social-media influencers including Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, Lauren Southern, and Benny Johnson. Unless you’ve spent time sloshing around in some of the dumber wading pools of the internet, you may not have heard of these people, but they have several million followers among them. So far, Pool, Rubin, and Johnson claim that they had no idea what was going on, and have even asserted that they’re the real victims here. On one level, it’s not hard to believe that someone like Pool was clueless about who he was working for, especially if you’ve seen any of his content; these people are not exactly brimming with nuanced insights. (As the legal commentator Ken White dryly observed in a post on Bluesky: “Saying Tim Pool did something unwittingly is a tautology.”) And even without this money, some of them were likely to make the same divisive, pro-Russian bilge that they would have made anyway—as long as they could find someone to pay for their microphones and cameras. On the other hand, you might think a person at all concerned about due diligence would ask a few questions about the amount of cash being dumped on their head. An op-ed in a newspaper or a magazine usually nets the writer a few hundred bucks. Well-known podcasters and the biggest writers on Substack—and there are only a few—can make $1 million or more a year, but most people on those platforms never get near that kind of income. According to the indictment, however, the unnamed company agreed to pay one contributor $400,000 each month for hosting four weekly videos, and offered another a contract to make occasional videos at $100,000 a pop. Now, maybe I’m not well versed in the high-flying world of Tennessee media companies, but that seems like an awful lot of cabbage. What’s really going on here is that the Russians have identified two major weaknesses in their American adversaries. The first is that a big slice of the American public, especially since the ascent of Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, has an almost limitless appetite for stories that jack up their adrenaline: They will embrace wild conspiracies and “news” meant to generate social conflict so long as the stories are exciting, validate their preexisting worldviews, and give them some escape from life’s daily doldrums. The other is that more than a few Americans have the combination of immense greed and ego-driven grievances that make them easy targets either for recruitment or to be used as clueless dupes. The Russians, along with every other intelligence service in the world, count on finding such people and exploiting their avarice and insecurity. This is not new. (The United States does it too. Money is almost always the easiest inducement to treason.) But the widespread influence of social media has opened a new front in the intelligence battle. Professional secret agents no longer need to find highly placed Americans who have access to secrets or who might influence policy discussions. Instead of the painstaking work that usually takes months or even years to suborn foreign citizens, the Kremlin can just dragoon a couple of its own people to pose as business sharps with money to burn, spread cash around like manure in a field full of half-wits, and see what blossoms. The shenanigans described in the DOJ document were not exactly a SPECTRE-level op. In this case, Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva apparently developed and maintained a fake persona named “Eduard Grigoriann” who, for some reason, was just itching to plop a ton of money down on a venture in Tennessee. (Grigorian is a common name from the Caucasus region, but it is almost never transliterated with a double n at the end, which was a possible tell that it was a fake.) Even more amusing, Grigoriann apparently missed a meeting with his American partners because he was on Moscow time when he was supposed to be in Paris. According to the DOJ indictment, when Grigoriann realized he was too early for the meeting, he then performed a Google search for “time in Paris.” Oops. Remember, junior spies, always be aware of your time zone. As idiotic as this business was, Americans should not be complacent. Yes, people such as Johnson and Pool are execrable trolls, and yes, Chen has been fired from Blaze Media, a major conservative media outlet. But to the Russians, cooperative foreigners are interchangeable and replaceable. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is playing a very smart game here. For a relative pittance—$10 million is probably the loose change in the bottom drawer of Vladimir Putin’s desk—they gain a potentially huge amount of social discord, which in turn can translate directly into the electoral outcome the Russians so fervently desire: Trump’s return to the Oval Office. Today, Putin even trolled America by saying—“ironically,” according to the Russian press service TASS—that he would prefer that Kamala Harris win the election. She “laughs so emphatically and infectiously,” he said, that perhaps she wouldn’t impose more sanctions on Russia. That’s a lovely mixture of condescension and sexism, of course. Putin added that Trump had been very hard on Russia and imposed more sanctions than any other president; this is false, but it allowed Putin to affirm an oft-deployed Trump lie. The Justice Department finally seems to be going on the offense and fighting back against these Russian attacks on America. But this indictment is probably only the tip of the iceberg: Unfortunately, the Russians have scads of money, and plenty of Americans are despicable enough to take their cash.

These seven books help demystify human behavior. P.S. As I was finishing today’s Daily, news broke that Dimitri Simes and his wife have been indicted for violating sanctions on Russia and money laundering. Americans of a certain age may remember Simes from the 1980s: He was a former KGB officer who defected to the United States in the ’70s and then made himself a mainstay on television, commenting on Soviet affairs. He was the head of the Center for the National Interest from 1994 to 2022, a think tank that publishes the influential magazine The National Interest. (Disclaimer: I was a regular contributor to the magazine over the years.) Those of us who watched Simes’s career trajectory, however, might not be surprised at where he ended up, politically and geographically. Simes is now 76, and like some of the other fading stars of the Cold War era, he seems to have resented his declining influence in America. He decamped to Putin’s Russia, where his years of anti-Kremlin conservatism went out the window—no pun intended—and he again became a fixture on television. If the charges are true, it looks again like a case of a man who craved importance and cash and found them both in Moscow. — Tom Stephanie Bai contributed to this newsletter.

What’s more, is that Kamala’s husband, Doug Emhoff, told The Times of Israel that supporting censorship will be his pet project as “first gentleman” – especially censorship of speech he deems “antisemitic.” During a 2019 address to the Detroit Branch of the NAACP, Kamala Harris, during her first unsuccessful run for the presidency, vowed to put “the Department of Justice of the United States back in the business of justice” by building an army of civil rights division operatives to counter free speech “extremism” on the internet, because it’s a “threat to our democracy.” Harris vowed to not only go after social media users who say things she doesn’t like but to go after entire platforms if they dare to allow free speech to flourish. “We will hold social media platforms accountable for the hate infiltrating their platforms because they have a responsibility to help fight against this threat to our democracy. And if you profit off of hate, if you act as a megaphone for misinformation or cyber warfare, if you don’t police your platforms we are going to hold you accountable as a community.” Listen to Harris’ Remarks in the Video Clip Below: Harris’ 2019 remarks resurfaced the very same week that a Brazilian Supreme Court panel ruled in favor of the Lula government’s nationwide ban of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

You’re second gentleman,’” Emhoff recalled.Emhoff had already been speaking out against antisemitism and been open about his Jewish identity, but it was after that he began holding more intensive meetings with Jewish community leaders, which led to the roll-out of the first ever White House strategy for combatting antisemitism last year. During the same speech, Emhoff went on to vow more censorship as “first gentleman” and he specifically spoke out against campus protestors of the Israeli war effort, accusing them of scaring Jewish students out of going to class. “I can tell you, when Kamala Harris is president and I’m first gentleman, we’re going to make sure they can go to class,” Emhoff said.

As California’s homeless numbers have grown, I’ve seen nothing more than a series of patchwork and temporary “solutions” that have had no impact. It seems the scale of the crisis has overwhelmed California’s ability to address it. Our failure to house and care for the mentally or physically disabled is appalling. Equally bad is our inability to address the chronic homelessness of alcohol and drug addicts. And our lack of deterrence has only exacerbated the problem. The time has come for federal authorities to assume control and coordinate all levels of government resources in a unified solution. Squalid encampments, be they in parks, along waterways or on our city’s sidewalks, must be permanently eliminated and replaced with humane shelters. Other countries and states have effectively minimized homelessness. California is quickly running out of excuses. Dave Salle San Jose Trump’s Arlington stunt extends run of disrespect Re: “Trump, Gold Star families clash with Harris over Arlington Cemetery visit” (Page A4, Sept. 2). The group of Gold Star families who asked Donald Trump to attend services turned an event honoring their service into a political circus. For those of us whose families have also lost loved ones in American wars defending our country, we remember Trump’s insults to Gold Star families while he was president and his disrespect for Sen. John McCain and other brave Americans taken prisoner in war. Niccolo Caldararo Fairfax Wrong woman in state’s ‘favorite daughter’ role A California woman of color may become our next president. Great. Too bad it is the wrong person. This weekend former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was interviewed on TV by Bret Baier. She spoke articulately about international affairs: how Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping’s agendas are threatening the world and how Iran must be contained. She did not damn the Biden-Harris administration or lower herself to political bashing but said that America needs to reestablish our world leadership role. She also spoke of our need to better educate our children, especially the underrepresented. I was impressed by her knowledge and ability to answer each question with intelligent answers — no hesitations, straying from the subject matter, or uncomfortable pauses or false smiles. It is clear to me that she is head and shoulders above Kamala Harris in every respect. It’s too bad she is not our California, favorite daughter, presidential candidate. Neil Bonke Saratoga Vote for the flipper over the flopper The current presidential campaign is heating up with more effort to change voter positions, to get more people to register to vote, and to get registered voters to actually vote. The two campaigns are at full throttle and that brings up my issue: I want accurate information. For instance, I hear the term “flip-flop.” To start with, “flip-flop” is a slang term. It would seem to imply that one has a position, changes that position then changes back to the former position. In the current campaign, I see one candidate, Kamala Harris, flipping (evolving) and the other candidate, Donald Trump, flopping (lying). I’ll be voting for the flipper and hope you will as well. Lura Halbert Los Gatos Positive body image crucial for teens You’ve purchased their new school supplies, new shoes and notebooks. But have you talked with your kids about body image? As the new school year begins, it’s crucial that the adults in students’ lives address this pressing issue. Today’s students are constantly bombarded with images of stereotypically attractive and seemingly flawless individuals on social media, far more than previous generations. According to Harvard Health, “one in seven men and one in five women experiences an eating disorder by age 40, and in 95% of those cases the disorder begins by age 25.” But food is fuel and nourishment and community. As students return to school, let’s foster a culture of conversation about body image at our dinner tables. By encouraging our kids to embrace their unique qualities and strengths, we not only build resilience in mind and body but also equip them to tackle the demands of the new academic year. Elaina Huang Menlo Park Supreme Court rulings leave justice behind In response to the U.S. Supreme Court rulings in two cases this past summer involving presidential immunity and the rights of homeless people, we now have a Supreme Court that has said that we cannot send a president to jail for violating his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution, but we can send a homeless person to jail for the crime of having nowhere to go.

The picture was shared by Charles Herbster, a former gubernatorial candidate in Nebraska. The group descends from Francis Walz, the brother of Tim Walz’s grandfather, making them the governor’s second cousins. Family members denouncing their relatives who run for or serve as president is nothing new in today’s political world. Barack Obama, for example, has been on the receiving end of some rhetorical haymakers, with half-brother Malik Obama calling the 44th president a “fake a**” while announcing he’s voting for former President Donald Trump. Several of the Kennedy clan have publicly proclaimed their lack of support for RFK Jr., and even done multiple interviews to express their disdain, calling him “dangerous.” Donald Trump’s niece Mary has built a lucrative career around writing books, hosting podcasts and running to any so-called news outlet who will have her, with the singular focus of bashing the former president in the most personal way, despite not having spoken to him for years. Yet she’s cast as a “Trump insider.” But when it comes to any member of the Walz family who opposes Tim Walz’s candidacy while publicly supporting Trump, there’s zero interest by the media in putting any of them on camera to give them the Mary Trump treatment. This is also true of Jeff Walz, Tim’s older brother, who The Post exclusively reported is “100% opposed to his ideology” and says Tim is not “the type of character” who should make major decisions about the future of the country. And let’s not forget those members of the Minnesota National Guard who served with Tim Walz — and who absolutely went off on him this week as they described how he “abandoned” them when he learned his unit would be deployed to a war zone in 2004. “I call him a coward because he is,” one veteran told Megyn Kelly in a group interview. Another called the governor a “military impersonator” after it was revealed Walz lied repeatedly about his rank. “If you sold out your Guard unit and abandoned them, what are you going to do at the national level?” one veteran asked in reference to the possibility of Walz becoming vice president. One would think The New York Times or Washington Post would report on these comments, but each has completely ignored the story. It should also be noted that each paper has written several glowing features on Mary Trump. This media selection bias has been patently grotesque this election cycle. Here’s a big example: When Harris became the de facto nominee after Biden bowed out, conservatives quickly pointed to her record on illegal immigration, backing policies that allowed more than 12 million people to illicitly enter the country, including hundreds of the terror watch list. But instead of pointing out the myriad of ramifications of this crisis from a humanitarian to national security perspective, many in the media jumped to oddly defend Harris by insisting she was never the “border czar.” But here’s President Biden declaring just that in 2021: “I’ve asked her, the VP, today — because she’s the most qualified person to do it — to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and . . . stemming the migration to our southern border,” he said. So how has “stemming the migration to our southern border” worked out so far? And why won’t the media hold Harris accountable on this major campaign issue? We know the reason: Because doing so might help Donald Trump get elected again. To many in this business, that’s simply unacceptable. Just like it’s unacceptable to interview anyone in Tim Walz’s orbit — his family, his former National Guard unit — about just how unfit they believe him to be to get anywhere near the White House.

Offshore Wind Project","text":"Sept. 5 (UPI) -- The long-planned Maryland Offshore Wind Project, which aims to deliver more than 2 gigawatts of clean energy to two states, landed final approval from the Biden administration on Thursday. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has officially signed off on the nation's 10th offshore wind project after more than a decade of efforts, Acting Deputy Interior Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis announced. As planned by developer U.S. Wind Inc., of Baltimore, the project seeks to generate more than 2 gigawatts of clean, renewable energy for Maryland and Delaware and power over 718,000 homes over two construction phases. The administration forecasts the development and construction phases of the Maryland project will support more than 2,500 jobs annually over a seven-year span. The lease area is 8.7 nautical miles offshore of Maryland and 9 nautical miles from Sussex County, Delaware, at its closest points to shore. With Thursday's approval, the Biden administration has signed off on more than 15 gigawatts of clean energy from offshore wind energy projects -- equivalent to half of the capacity needed to achieve President Joe Biden's goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. That record represents a \"total game-change\" from the zero projects approved before Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office in 2021, added White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. \"From port infrastructure upgrades and new tax credits to speeding responsible and efficient permitting, we are using every tool available to continue turbocharging this industry and delivering a clean energy future for the nation,\" he said. Biden said in a statement that for the remainder of his tenure in office, the White House \"will continue to partner with industry, Tribes, ocean users, and other stakeholders to support supply chains that are Made in America, incentivize union-built projects, and continue seizing opportunities for additional clean energy technologies.\" BOEM first awarded the Maryland's project lease to U.S. Wind in 2014 under the administration of President Barack Obama, but it wasn't until 10 years later that project got the official go-ahead to proceed. One of the obstacles it has faced in recent years is opposition from officials in Ocean City, Md., who fear the installation of up to 114 wind turbine generators, up to four offshore substation platforms, a meteorological tower and offshore export cable corridors will interfere with its vital tourism industry. Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan said last month the city would likely sue if the Interior Department issued an approval.","summary":"The long-planned Maryland Offshore Wind Project, which aims to deliver more than 2 gigawatts of clean energy to two states, landed final approval from the Biden administration on Thursday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/09/05/Biden-administration-issues-final-approval-massive-Offshore-Wind-Project/6581725572501/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6581725572501/2024/upi/93019c638a664992e1a9f154b63bd797/v1.2/Biden-administration-issues-final-approval-for-massive-Md-Offshore-Wind-Project.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:57:01","author":"Don Jacobson","authors":["Don Jacobson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.024},{"id":255752752,"title":"Biden Admits 'Inflation Reduction Act' Was Wrongly Named: 'We Should've Named It What It Was'","text":"President Joe Biden on Thursday admitted that the $700 billion Inflation Reduction Act, which did not reduce inflation and included $369 billion for green energy initiatives, was wrongly named. Biden’s remark came at an event in Westby, Wisconsin, where he was touting his Bidenomics investments. He called the Inflation Reduction Act “the most significant climate change law ever,” adding, “by the way, it is a $369 billion bill, it’s called the–we we we should’ve named it what it was.” The Penn Wharton Budget Model found the bill would drop inflation by .1 percent over five years, and the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) analysis was similar. Instead, the bill, which is a scaled-down version of the failed Build Back Better Act legislation, is “the single most significant legislation to combat climate change in our nation’s history,” as the Biden-Harris Department of Treasury touted in a release in November 2022. As Breitbart News Policy Reporter Sean Moran noted, the Inflation Reduction Act also does the following: Allows Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs Extends enhanced Obamacare subsidies for three years, which would cost $64 billion Reduces the deficit by $300 billion Increases taxes while America just entered a recession Boosts funding for the IRS by $80 billion, which would make the agency larger than the Pentagon, State Department, FBI, and Border Patrol combined. …The bill contains budget gimmicks and fake offsets that mask the true cost of the bill The legislation narrowly escaped the Senate via a 51-50 party-line vote, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the tiebreaker. The Democrat-controlled House then advanced the legislation in a partisan fashion. Financial experts have singled out the negative aspects of the nearly trillion-dollar bill. For instance, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in April that it is hard to see inflation coming down to two percent, pointing to a slew of spending from Biden and the Democrat-led 117th Congress. “I think two is a hard number. We have restructured how we frame our economic policy. We have a trillion dollars of fiscal stimulus in the CHIPS Act, the Infrastructure Act, and the [Inflation Reduction Act],” Fink emphasized during an appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. “We have very poor legal immigration policies that have restricted, and that is all inflationary in jobs.” The Consumer Price Index in July notably climbed 2.9 percent year-over-year. Fox News’s Larry Kudlow, who was the director of the National Economic Council during the Trump administration, said in August 2022 that the bill entirely lacks economic growth incentive. “There is not one single iota, scintilla, whit, shred or morsel of economic growth incentives in this bill. Not a single comma, semicolon, dotted ‘i’ or crossed ‘t’ of growth. Nothing,” he said, as Fox News noted.","summary":"President Joe Biden on Thursday admitted that the $700 billion Inflation Reduction Act, which did not reduce inflation and included $369 billion for green energy initiatives, was wrongly named.\n\n\nThe post Biden Admits &#8216;Inflation Reduction Act&#8217; Was Wrongly Named: &#8216;We Should&#8217;ve Named It What It Was&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/09/05/biden-admits-inflation-reduction-act-was-wrongly-named-we-shouldve-named-it-what-it-was/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/Biden-Touts-the-Inflation-Reduction-Act-1-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:47:52","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.061},{"id":255748946,"title":"TikTok’s possible US ban losing support among Americans, Pew survey finds","text":"Americans are less supportive of a possible TikTok ban than they were 18 months ago, according to a new survey ahead of a government deadline next year to force a sale or bar the app from US users. Just 32 per cent of US adults back a TikTok ban, according to survey data from Pew Research released Thursday. Pew found that 38 per cent of US adults supported a ban last fall and 50 per cent were in favour in March 2023. Meanwhile, half of Americans now doubt TikTok will be banned at all, calling it “very or somewhat unlikely.” The survey showed that many Americans have shifted their stance on TikTok in the past year and a half, including over the past five months since US President Joe Biden signed a law that requires TikTok’s Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, to divest its ownership in the app or face a ban in the country. US lawmakers said they feared potential privacy and security issues related to TikTok’s Chinese ownership. The survey did not ask respondents why their opinions had changed. Former US president Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok while in office in 2020, has publicly reversed his opinion on the app and created an account earlier this year. US Vice-President Kamala Harris, who is running against Trump for president, has also used the app to campaign ahead of November’s election. Despite signing the bill that could ultimately ban the app, Biden has also created an account. Researchers found that views about the app remain divided along party lines. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely to think TikTok threatens national security, and are nearly twice as likely to support a ban than Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, Pew found. Even so, support for the ban has dropped by nearly 20 percentage points within each party since March 2023. ByteDance has until January to sell the app or face a ban in the US under the law signed by Biden. That deadline can be pushed back 90 days if a sale seems to be in progress, and legal action could further delay a ban from taking effect. TikTok has sued the US to try to reverse the law. Pew surveyed 10,658 adults from July 15 to August 4.

The former president insisted this week the incident did not happen, highlighting a growing disconnect between the messaging of the candidate and his campaign. NPR is identifying both staffers after the campaign’s conflicting responses to the incident last week outside Section 60 of the cemetery, where many casualties of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. The two staffers, according to a source with knowledge of the incident, are deputy campaign manager Justin Caporale and Michel Picard, a member of Trump’s advance team. Caporale is a one time aide to former first lady Melania Trump who left the White House to work for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis before returning to the Trump campaign. He was also listed as the on-site contact and project manager for the Women for America First rally in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021 where Trump urged the crowd to “stop the steal” before some of them stormed the U.S. Capitol. After Trump participated in a wreath laying ceremony on the third anniversary of the deadly bombing at Abbey Gate in Afghanistan that killed 13 U.S. service members, Trump visited Section 60 at the invitation of some family members and friends of the fallen soldiers. ANC rules, that had been made clear to the Trump campaign in advance, say that only an official Arlington photographer can take pictures or film in Section 60. When an ANC employee tried to enforce the rules, she was verbally abused by the two Trump campaign operatives, according to a source with knowledge of the incident. Picard then pushed her out of the way according to two Pentagon officials. The campaign’s conflicting messaging on the incident After NPR first reported the altercation last week, campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said they were “prepared to release footage” of the incident, and attacked the Arlington employee as someone “clearly suffering from a mental health episode.” Cheung also said they were granted access to have a photographer present, and pointed to a statement from Gold Star family members that invited Trump to attend the ceremony. The campaign also released a TikTok video that included video footage from Section 60, including a smiling Trump flashing a thumbs up with family members at the gravesites. But other tombstones are visible in the picture, and at least one family of a fallen Green Beret has confirmed they did not give permission for his grave to be filmed or used in a campaign ad. The Army released a statement last Thursday acknowledging that a cemetery employee “was abruptly pushed aside” and the campaign was warned ahead of time of the prohibition against photography and political activities at Arlington. The Army said the cemetery employee tried to de-escalate the situation after she was pushed, in hopes of not upsetting the Gold Star families in attendance. The Army said a police report of the incident was filed, but that the employee had declined to press charges, and that the Army considered the matter closed, but added that “the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked.” When NPR emailed both Caporale and Picard, Cheung responded, “I see you've been emailing some of our team members…As the Army has said, they consider this matter closed. President Trump was there to support the Gold Star families and honor the sacrifices their loved ones made.” Cheung also included a social media post that shows a Biden campaign ad from 2020 that used images of the then-vice president at the cemetery in 2010. Neither Cheung, Picard or Caporale responded to emailed requests for comment as of publication time. Reached by phone, Caporale referred questions to Cheung. The Trump campaign has still not followed through on its pledge to release video of the incident, despite repeated requests from NPR. This week, Trump contradicted his own campaign with a post on Truth Social falsely calling the confrontation a “made up story by Comrade Kamala and her misinformation squad” that attacked Harris and Biden for not attending the private ceremony. In an interview on Sean Hannity’s radio show Tuesday, Trump reiterated the false assertion that nothing happened at the cemetery, questioning the motives of the unnamed employee and downplaying the accusations as attacks over “publicity.” “Do you notice that the person represented now doesn’t want to talk, he doesn’t want to speak or talk?” Trump asked, mislabeling the employee as male. “The nice thing, the beautiful thing, was all the parents and relatives got together and they said ‘That’s a false story, it was totally false.’” Former President Trump polls well among veterans, and has many vocal supporters with military ties. Some of the family members who invited him to Arlington also spoke at the Republican National Convention, bashing Biden and vocally endorsing Trump. \"Joe Biden may have forgotten that our children died, but we have not forgotten — Donald Trump has not forgotten,\" said Cheryl Juels in Milwaukee at the RNC in July. Juels is the aunt of Sgt. Nicole Gee, one of the service members killed at Abbey Gate in 2021, during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal. \"Joe Biden owes the men and women that served in Afghanistan a debt of gratitude and an apology. Donald Trump loves this country and will never forget the sacrifice and bravery of our service members,\" she added. \"Join us in putting him back in the White House.\" But those families do not have the power to suspend the rules at Arlington, where Section 60 is a fresh and on-going memorial to hundreds of recent war dead that, like the rest of the cemetery, is meant to be above politics. The family of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano, a Green Beret who died by suicide after serving multiple combat tours and who is buried in Section 60, said according to their conversations with the cemetery, \"the Trump campaign staffers did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit.\" \"We hope that those visiting this sacred site understand that there were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected and treated accordingly,\" they said in a statement. Jimmy McCain, a US Marine whose father was the late senator John McCain, also condemned the visit. Trump has a history of controversial remarks about the military - he insulted Sen. John McCain for being a prisoner of war. He allegedly called dead soldiers \"suckers\" and \"losers,\" and recently stoked controversy for saying civilian Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients are much better than those who received the Medal of Honor — the highest military award in the country, often given posthumously. Trump’s conflicting messaging on the campaign trail The incident at Arlington National Cemetery is the latest example of conflict between the messaging efforts of Trump’s campaign and the candidate himself since President Biden ended his reelection bid and Vice President Harris became the Democratic nominee. The campaign’s attempts to use the bombing anniversary to attack Harris over the Afghanistan withdrawal, complete with videos from Gold Star family members blaming the administration for the deaths of their loved ones, has been overshadowed by the politicization of Arlington and its hallowed status. Last week, both Trump and campaign staff sought to clean up his stance on abortion rights and a ballot measure in his home state of Florida. Trump initially seemed to signal support for the proposed amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and posted that his second term would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.” After backlash from anti-abortion advocates and a statement from the campaign saying that Trump did not say how he would vote on the referendum, Trump eventually told a Fox News reporter he would vote against it. Trump has also publicly questioned the rules, format and fairness for next week’s debate even as his campaign accepted the conditions and has worked behind the scenes to iron out details. In a town hall conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity Wednesday, Trump called debate host ABC News “dishonest” and implied without evidence that Harris would get questions in advance. The debate will be a pivotal moment for Trump to try and regain momentum against Harris, who has erased Trump’s onetime commanding lead in the polls in the seven key battleground states. In the six weeks since the switch up on the Democratic side of the race, an NPR review of Trump campaign speeches has found the former president struggling to pivot a campaign tailor-made to beat Biden into focus against his new opponent.","summary":"NPR identified two Trump staffers involved in an altercation at Arlington National Cemetery including a deputy campaign manager, highlighting a disconnect between Trump's messaging and his campaign.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/05/nx-s1-5101991/trump-campaign-arlington-national-cemetery-staff-debate","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5790x3257+0+302/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2F2d%2Ff0534c444967ac806aaa4b6c4b86%2Fgettyimages-2168643368.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:47:05","author":"Stephen Fowler","authors":["Stephen Fowler"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":255748056,"title":"Trump tells Jewish donors they would be ‘abandoned’ if Harris is elected","text":"Donald Trump told Jewish donors on Thursday that they would be “abandoned” if Kamala Harris becomes president. In his speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas, the Republican presidential candidate also said he would ban refugee resettlement from “terror-infested” areas such as Gaza and arrest “pro-Hamas thugs” who engage in vandalism, an apparent reference to the college student protesters. While Trump sketched out few concrete Middle Eastern policy proposals for a second term, he painted a potential Harris presidency in cataclysmic terms for Israel. “You’re going to be abandoned if she becomes president. And I think you need to explain that to your people … You’re not going to have an Israel if she becomes president,” Trump said without providing evidence for such a claim. Under both Trump and Joe Biden, similar numbers of Palestinians were admitted to the US as refugees. From fiscal year 2017 to 2020, the US accepted 114 Palestinian refugees, according to US state department data, compared with 124 Palestinian refugees from fiscal year 2021 to 31 July of this year. Trump also said US universities would lose accreditation and federal support over what he described as “antisemitic propaganda” if he is elected to the White House. “Colleges will and must end the antisemitic propaganda or they will lose their accreditation and federal support,” Trump said, speaking remotely to a crowd of more than 1,000 donors. Protests roiled college campuses in spring, with students opposing Israel’s military offensive in Gaza and demanding institutions stop doing business with companies backing Israel. Republicans have said the protests show some Democrats are antisemites who support chaos. Protest groups say authorities have unfairly labeled their criticism of Israel’s policies as antisemitic. The Association of American Universities, which says it represents about 70 leading US universities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the United States, the federal government does not directly accredit universities but has a role in overseeing the mostly private organizations that give colleges accreditation. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump’s speech. The Democratic presidential candidate has hewed closely to the president’s strong support of Israel and rejected calls from some in the Democratic party that Washington should rethink sending weapons to Israel because of the heavy Palestinian death toll in Gaza. She has, however, called for a ceasefire in Gaza, calling the situation there “devastating”. Health authorities in Gaza say more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli assault on the enclave since the 7 October 2023 attacks led by Hamas. Approximately 1,200 Israelis were killed in the surprise attack and about 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. The subsequent assault on Gaza has displaced nearly its entire 2.3 million population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations at the World Court that Israel denies.","summary":"In Las Vegas summit speech, Republican candidate paints potential Harris presidency in cataclysmic terms for Israel\n\nDonald Trump told Jewish donors on Thursday that they would be “abandoned” if Kamala Harris becomes president.\n\nIn his speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas, the Republican presidential candidate also said he would ban refugee resettlement from “terror-infested” areas such as Gaza and arrest “pro-Hamas thugs” who engage in vandalism, an apparent reference to the college student protesters.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/05/trump-harris-republican-jewish-coalition","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71c5bbff5079af9c0b3e4cba40c3927f6cf8944/0_165_5179_3108/master/5179.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:46:41","author":"Guardian staff and agencies","authors":["Guardian staff and agencies"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":255748328,"title":"Decoding The Historical Democratic National Convention in Chicago","text":"By Debabrata Biswas from Boston A little over a month ago Democratic Party leadership was gripped with the idea that president Joe Biden might not be the best candidate to represent their party in the Presidential race against Donald Trump, with many dreading what they thought could be a landslide loss up and down the ballot in November 5 elections.. The Democratic National Convention was held from August 19 to 22, 2024 at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois. This Convention, during the year of the presidential election is held for nominating the official presidential candidate of the party, generally the candidate who won the primaries beforehand. But this year it is different in the way that Joe Biden who won the Democratic primaries effortlessly; announced on July 19, 2024, his withdrawal from the presidential election abruptly and endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement. Biden, 81, couldn’t reverse growing sentiment within his party that he was too old and frail to serve for the next 4 years and has the possibility to lose to Donald Trump. Joe Biden was the first president since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 to withdraw from a presidential election race, the first since 19th century to withdraw after serving only one term. And Biden is the only one to withdraw after already winning the primaries. The Convention started with much fanfare though there were some chaos outside the convention hall – a good number of protestors shouting against Israel’s massacres in Gaza. But it was subdued after some time and the Convention proceeded normally. The delegates of the convention ceremoniously voted to nominate VP Kamala Harris for president and her chosen running mate Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota for Vice President in the 2024 presidential election. Over the course of the week, speakers preached unity and joy as they contrasted Kamala Harris’s leadership and personality with Donald Trump. Party leaders and rising stars addressed in Chicago as the DNC continued, with speakers honouring president Biden and his time in office while celebrating a new name atop the ticket . Three ex- presidents, Governors, leaders in Congress and other prominent members of the party were addressing the convention spanning four days as Democrats gear up for November Presidential elections. On Monday, August 19, delegates heard from Hillary Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, First Lady Jill Biden and President Joe Biden himself. For the first time AOC of New York was given a prime time slot on the Convention night .She gave a fiery speech as expected. Hillary Clinton spoke hopefully of finally breaking the “glass ceiling” to elect a female president. President Joe Biden received a hero’s welcome on the opening night of DNC as he delivered his address designed to be a handoff from the incumbent president to his handpicked successor Kamala Harris .His voice was strong and emotional, unlike during his debate with Trump. His closing message was ‘ I gave my best to you for 50 years ‘. The Vice President Kamala Harris made an unscheduled appearance on stage to pay special tribute to Biden ahead of her own address to the Convention. She told the president – “Thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime service to our nation and for all you continue to do “. She added – ‘we are grateful to you’. Former president Barack Obama took the stage at DNC on day 2, Tuesday evening, praising President Biden just week after reportedly helping to oust Biden from his reelection effort. He said – “we worked together for eight years , sometimes pretty tough years, what I came to admire most about Joe wasn’t just his smarts and experience, but his empathy and his decency. And his hard earned resiliency and his unshakable belief that everyone in this country deserves a fair shot.” Michelle Obama gave a strong and articulated speech. Few people have as much of a hold on the hearts and minds of the Democratic base as Michelle Obama who was greeted with one of the loudest , longest round of applause as she took stage on day 2 of the Convention. “Hope is making a comeback” – she said, – ” my girl Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment “. Michelle slammed Trump as ” petty small and unpresidential ‘, She said – Trump is the same old con, doubling down on ugly misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better ” . She laid out the stakes and the challenges, facing Harris as a black woman seeking higher office in starker than any other Convention speakers. She also took a jab at Trump’s remark that migrants are stealing ‘Black jobs’. ” We are going to tell him that the job he is currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs’.- she said sarcastically She also cautioned the party by saying – even if there is ‘ something magical in the air ‘ – ‘ there’s a hard road ahead ‘. Basketball legend Ervin ‘ magic Johnson ‘ ,who is considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time, dished out praise on the speeches of Barack and Michelle Obama at the DNC .He said – ‘ they gave the best political speeches in history of our country. The powerful couple talked about working class families, family values, and moving the country forward together ‘. Vice President Kamala Harris was officially nominated as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party on the 2nd day in which she wasn’t attending .She was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin attending a big rally. She said after the presidential nomination – ‘ now let’s get to work ‘. Some important Republicans, surprisingly, showed up for Harris on day 2 of the Convention and spoke on the stage supporting Kamala Harris .Among them were Mayor John Giles of Messa, Arizona, a lifelong Republican, Kyle Sweetser- a Nikky Haley follower, Stephenie Grisham, a former Trump White House Press Secretary and chief of staff to Melenia Trump, who used to spend her holidays at Mar -a- Lago. She said about Trump – ‘ He has no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth ‘. One of the most important speakers on day 2 of the Convention was Bernie Sanders, Vermont Independent Senator, who has maintained a strong following among young and progressive voters for long. He meticulously laid out a list of proposals for the next Democratic administration. ‘Let us be clear, this is not a radical agenda ‘ – he said, – ‘ but let me tell you what a radical agenda is.’ The DNC’s 3rd night showcased a familiar former president Bill Clinton and introduced Americans to Minessota Gov. Tim Walz, little known outside his state until Kamala Harris selected him as her running mate. Clinton gave a o good speech as he always does. Apart from him, many other prominent leaders like Gov. Josh Shapiro (Pennsylvania), former speaker Nancyy Pelosi and vice presidential candidate gave speech in the Convention, enthusiastically applauded by the audience. On day 4, Thursday, the final night of the Convention many Important Union leaders, Senators like Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , Mark Kelly of Arizona and Governors like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Ray Cooper of North Carolina ,former Republican House Representative Adam Kinzinger and VP Kamala Harris took the stage with tremendous cheers from the audience. Elizabeth Warren was moved to tears after receiving a standing ovation from the crowd just before her speech. She compared Trump and Harris as candidate, she said- “groceries, gas, housing, health care, taxes, abortion – Donald Trump and J D Vance to look out for your family? Shoot! I wouldn’t let these guys, I wouldn’t trust them to move my couch.” Kamala Harris formally accepted the party’s nomination and delivered her acceptance speech. It capped the ebullient four day Convention in Chicago that showcased the Democratic Party’s reinvigorated chances against Donald Trump. Harris put patriotism at the heart of her speech. In her speech she singled out the middle ground and the middle class. She sought to cut Trump down on that agenda.” My entire career, I have only one client – the people – she said setting up a searing contrast with a Trump – “The only client he (Mr. Trump) has ever had – is Himself.” Kamala Harris delivered the final word about Trump when she called him an ‘unserious man’. On the final day, over and over Convention speakers repeated Kamala Harris’s new slogan – “A new way forward “- while the crowd chanted -‘ we are not going back.’ “Let us choose the sweet promise of tomorrow over the bitter return to yesterday “- Oprah Winfrey said. Only some 69 days until the election, Democrats sounded more than happy to give Kamala Harris room to position herself in whatever way she thinks is needed to defeat Donald Trump. On policy matters , she backtracked on fracking , flipped on Medicare for all and resented on not considering border crossing criminal- all with little blowback. Ms. Harris directly addressed a chief vulnerability – immigration, by vowing to sign a border security legislation that Trump had scuttled. Outside the Convention perimeter, pro -Palestinian protestors voiced their anger with the administration over Israel policy. But inside the Convention hall, Ms. Harris faced little pressure on Gaza or almost any other issue. She did, however, spoke extensively and confidently on Middle East conflict, firmly stating that Israel had a right to defend itself while also calling for self determination for the Palestinian people. She called for security and dignity of the people of Gaza which received the loudest applause from the audience. The DNC outperformed the RNC (Republican National Convention) held in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a category that would probably worry Trump. According to Neilson data , an average of 21.8 million viewers tuned in over four days to watch the Chicago DNC . It eclipsed the RNC viewers which was 19.1 million on average. Final day at DNC attracted 28.9 million viewers while 28.3 million watched the last night of RNC. Though TV rating for conventions are far from an accurate indicator of who wins elections. But those numbers could very well upset rating-obsessed Republicans and surely Donald Trump. Trump’s fixation on TV ratings and crowd size are well documented .On day 4 of the DNC, as Harris was delivering her address, Trump watched along, posting live reaction to his Truth Social account , then called into Fox News , afterwards to offer a meandering rebuttal. Overall, the Democrats are riding high after their successful Convention in Chicago and are relishing the good feelings of Kamala Harris’s upward trajectory in the polls. She has stacked out a lead of 2 points in the New York Times polling average after trailing by 5 points in a then hypothetical match up with Trump at the start of July. Emerson college and Fairleigh Dickinson University’s latest polls award Kamala Harris a 7 point national lead over Trump. In key swing states, the New York Times tracker breaks down the election this way- national average Harris 49 per cent and Trump 46 per cent. Democratic Party leadership are hopeful but not complacent. They have experience of 2016 presidential polls when despite all favourable ratings for Hillary Clinton, Trump won at the end. Kamala Harris knows that well. She is going the wholehog in mobilizing all sections in favour of her candidature.. I will work for all Americans- that is her message and she is showing how different she is from her rival Donald Trump. For Democrats, there is a rejuvenated mood in the campaign. Now everything depends on the final voting on November 5.

This week's Labor Day public holiday marked the symbolic end to the US summer. The first hints of autumn-like weather are finally upon us, and pumpkin-spiced products have started hitting cafe menus. In an election year, it also means the final stretch of an extraordinary campaign season is now well and truly underway. Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are already spending most of their time and energy in seven states where the election could be won or lost: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Neither side has any time to lose. Election day isn't until November 5, but early voting in some states will start this month. And in what will be the two candidates' first-ever face-to-face meeting, next week's debate could prove to be yet another pivotal moment in the race to the finish. Duelling debate strategies as both sides claim disadvantage The showdown on September 10 (local time) was supposed to be the second outing between Trump and President Joe Biden, but we all know how that turned out. After plenty of haggling between the Trump and Harris camps, both sides have now agreed to a very similar set-up to the arrangements in June. Hosted by American TV network ABC, the debate will run for 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks, and no live audience. Before the first debate, Biden's team had insisted on having microphones muted while the other candidate spoke. But it seemed to backfire on the president as he floundered while Trump came across as disciplined. Harris's team tried to reverse the rule, accusing Trump's advisors of being worried that the former president couldn't \"act presidential for 90 minutes on his own\". Her campaign eventually accepted the terms, arguing it didn't want to jeopardise the debate, but not without complaint. \"Vice-President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges,\" her team reportedly said in a letter to ABC. \"We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign's insistence on muted microphones.\" The messaging is part of a broader effort to cast the vice-president as the underdog in the election, despite some opinion polls suggesting she's ahead of Trump. Harris's campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, described the former president as a \"formidable\" debate opponent, and warned voting margins would be \"razor thin\" in November. \"Make no mistake: the next 65 days will be very hard,\" she wrote in a memo. It's a tried and tested strategy to try to prevent any over-confidence that could lead to a plateau in volunteering efforts or donations. Trump, for his part, has returned to a familiar part of his own playbook – accusing the debate hosts of being biased against him. \"They are the most dishonest network, the meanest, the nastiest, but that is what I was presented with,\" he told a Fox News town hall event in Pennsylvania. Trump argued, without evidence, that Harris would be given the debate questions in advance and pointed to a long-standing friendship between the vice-president and Dana Walden, a top executive at American ABC's owner, Disney. The network has previously insisted Walden has no input into the network's editorial decision-making. But Trump is once again trying to set an expectation that if he doesn't perform well, it's because things are stacked against him. He took the same approach ahead of the debate with Biden, arguing CNN's moderators would guarantee a three-against-one contest. In the aftermath of Biden's stumbles, however, he was full of praise for their \"firm but fair\" handling of the event. Hunter Biden legal twist The president's decision to abandon his bid for a second term in the White House has likely blunted the political impact of his son Hunter Biden's legal woes. But for several months after the 54-year-old was convicted of gun crimes in Delaware, a second case has loomed as another potentially damaging episode for the president's son and his family. Hunter Biden was due to go on trial this week accused of avoiding paying $US1.4 million ($2.1 million) in taxes on income from foreign business dealings – a topic that has come under intense scrutiny from his father's political opponents. At the same time, he's alleged to have spent large amounts of money on drugs, sex workers and luxury cars. Just as jury selection was about to begin, however, Hunter Biden's lawyers surprised the court by proposing what's known as an \"Alford\" plea. The unusual move allows a defendant to maintain their innocence while acknowledging there's enough evidence to convict them. But prosecutors opposed the request, and within hours, Hunter Biden had pleaded guilty to all nine offences. Sentencing has been scheduled for mid-December, and while the president's son has avoided another high-profile trial, he could face years in prison. Joe Biden has previously ruled out using his powers to pardon his son, although that pledge was made before he withdrew from the election. Republicans for Harris? Biden's replacement may have re-energised Democrats, but Harris is also trying to court voters on the other side of politics who don't want to see Trump re-elected. Last month's Democratic National Convention featured several Republican speakers, including former Trump administration press secretary Stephanie Grisham and former congressman Adam Kinzinger. Harris has now received the backing of Liz Cheney, one of Trump's most high-profile Republican critics. The daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney spent six years in the House of Representatives and helped to lead the congressional hearings into the January 6 attack. While Cheney has long made her disdain for the former president clear, she's gone a step further in declaring support for his opponent. \"I don't believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates' names, particularly in swing states,\" she said at an event in North Carolina. \"Because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.\" Harris's campaign said the vice-president was \"proud\" to have received the endorsement, while a spokesman for Trump – who's previously argued Cheney should be jailed – scoffed at the news. \"Who is Liz Cheney and what does she do?\" campaign spokesman Steven Cheung responded. One to watch: Melania Trump's tell-all While other political spouses – most notably second gentleman Doug Emhoff - are regular fixtures on the campaign trail, Melania Trump continues to maintain a low profile. But the former first lady is set to make a splash with a memoir, titled Melania, set for release just weeks ahead of the election. \"As a private person who has often been the subject of public scrutiny and misrepresentation, I feel a responsibility to clarify the facts,\" she said in a teaser video released on social media. \"I believe it is important to share my perspective. The truth.\" Speculation is already swirling that the 54-year-old would not return full-time to Washington if her husband won the election. And while she made a rare appearance at the Republican National Convention, days after her husband was shot, she opted against a speaking slot. Washington Post associate editor Mary Jordan, who wrote a book about Melania Trump, argued this year that the former first lady was \"fully aware that if she speaks rarely, people will listen more closely\". \"Melania plays the long game and doesn't do anything hastily,\" Jordan wrote in June. \"When needed, she deploys her power.\" Loading","summary":"After plenty of haggling, the Donald Trump and Kamala Harris camps have agreed to some rules for the first presidential debate.

Free speech was under attack. Independent and uncensored voices were sorely needed. It featured the six commentators who would be the faces of the operation, already some of the most-followed voices in the increasingly crowded and influential world of online conservative punditry. Over a dramatic electronic music track, each of them offered a brief reason why Tenet was needed now more than ever. “Maybe they take us down individually,” said Matt Christiansen, a conservative YouTuber and podcaster, in the video. “It’s a lot harder to do when we’re grouped together in this way.” Less than a year after that video was posted to YouTube, where it still has fewer than 9,000 views, Tenet has found itself at the center of a major U.S. government action to crackdown on Russian interference in the 2024 election. Prosecutors alleged two employees of the Russia-backed media network RT funneled almost $10 million to six commentators through a company that appears to be Tenet. Though the media company and the commentators went unnamed, their details match those of Tenet and Dave Rubin, Tim Pool, Benny Johnson, Lauren Southern, Tayler Hansen and Christiansen. An NBC News review of Tenet’s many videos combined with details from the government’s two indictments illustrate how the company amplified conservatives who had already embraced many talking points favored by former President Donald Trump and Russia, in line with the country’s broader propaganda goals. The alleged tactics would represent an evolution in Russia’s previous attempts to meddle with American voters’ perceptions of an upcoming election, marked in 2016 by crude but effective text posts on Twitter and Facebook. With Tenet, Russia appears to have updated a decades-old strategy of laundering propaganda through seemingly independent actors by targeting some of the most popular creators of the polarized U.S. political system. Still, the plan struggled. Tenet posted nearly 2,000 videos that got more than 16 million views on YouTube since November 2023, according to the indictment. The company was competing for attention in an oversaturated online space and among an electorate that, after years of consuming hyper-polarized content online, tends to seek and be served information that reinforces their own beliefs. As Tenet failed to rack up significant view counts even with its big-name commentators, frustrations spilled out from company officials that were captured in parts of the indictment. Five of those commentators have issued statements, some declaring themselves the victims and each saying that they were not knowingly part of the Russian scheme. The sixth, Southern, has not issued a statement or responded to requests for comment from NBC News. The six commentators did not respond to questions Thursday on how they believed they were deceived and whether they plan to give up the money. Tenet and its founders have yet to issue any statements and have not responded to requests for comment sent by NBC News. The indictment noted that at least two of the creators wrapped up in the Russian operation had been “deceived” by the founders of Tenet. Those founders also went unnamed, but business records show Tenet was founded by a married couple: Liam Donovan, a video producer, and Lauren Tam, a ​​video creator for The Blaze and a contributor to Turning Points USA, professionally known as Lauren Chen. “While the views expressed in the videos are not uniform, the subject matter and content of the videos are often consistent with the Government of Russia’s interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Government of Russia interests, such as its ongoing war in Ukraine,” prosecutors said in the indictment. ‘Influencers are patriots’ Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund who studies disinformation, noted that Russia’s use of American messengers — both covert and overt — is a tried-and-true tactic. But he added that the Kremlin has rarely — if ever — been able to tap people with the kinds of followings that Pool, Rubin and others had already amassed. Schafer said the long history of Russia’s influence campaigns in America involved financing news organizations or content creators who produce content that’s “beneficial to Russia.” “That does not mean that the content actually is pro-Russian,” Schafer said. “And I think that’s a key point. Often you’ll find the people justify taking the money, when they are aware that they’re getting money from Russia, by saying, ‘These are my beliefs. I’m not being told what to say.’ and it’s believable because Russia is just quite good at recruiting talent, finding the divisive, influential person who’s maybe an anti-imperialist, or whose worldview aligns with Russia, and let’s find a way to support them.” Schafer’s description of those tactics and aims matched those in internal company documents from Russian companies charged with operating the disinformation campaign known as “Doppelganger,” according to exhibits unsealed in a separate federal case on Wednesday. Russia’s effort to influence Americans before the election focused on the goal of securing a victory for Donald Trump in 2024, by exploiting political polarization according to the internal documents, and specifically instructed operatives to spread the view “that the US should target their effort towards addressing its domestic issues instead of wasting money in Ukraine and other ‘problem’ regions.” In the planning documents, Russian operatives said it was pointless to engender pro-Russian sentiment: “There is no point of justifying Russia and no one to justify it to. All American politicians and influencers are patriots and supporters of American supremacy.” But, the operatives wrote, there was benefit in exploiting conservative fears including concerns about online censorship, an encroachment on conservative rights, and a decline in the standard of living and a fear of losing the “American dream.” The documents suggested specific topics including poverty, crime, inflation, unemployment for white Americans, privileges for people of color, “perverts,” and the disabled, lies by the media and the Democratic party, immigration, and Ukraine. The Tenet Media commentators’ videos, while not associated with the Doppelganger campaign, tackled those exact topics, spreading to their millions of collective subscribers the very messages Russia hoped they would. It’s not clear how much due diligence the six pundits did before agreeing to take what prosecutors now say was Russian money from a fictional wealthy persona named “Eduard Grigoriann”. At least one of the six commentators requested more information on Grigoriann and, after receiving a fake one-page profile, agreed to work with Tenet, according to the indictment. ‘No holds barred’ In the 10 months after its launch, the creators of Tenet media would release hundreds of videos. Many focused on the election, all seemingly through a pro-Trump lens, often denigrating current president Joe Biden and vice president and current Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, painting former president Trump as a victim of an unfair mainstream media and the so-called deep state, and spreading unfounded conspiracy theories. Even in its relatively short time in existence, Tenet had already made inroads with the Republican party. Johnson, a former chief creative officer of the conservative activist group Turning Point USA, in particular enjoyed special access to the country’s most powerful political figures,. Johnson interviewed Donald Trump Jr. for the channel in February, the Trump campaign’s deputy director of communications Caroline Sunshine in August, and twice interviewed Lara Trump, the former president’s daughter-in-law and current co-chair of the Republican National Committee, in March and June. Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt popped up in a Tenet video, praising the “fantastic, loyal audience” Johnson had created. Other videos produced for Tenet media featured elected GOP officials. In one, Sen. Ted Cruz discussed his thoughts on Bud Light’s “woke marketing executives” in November while sitting in the back of a vehicle with Johnson. Asked by NBC News about appearances that members of the Trump family and campaign had made in videos hosted by a company that authorities say was Russia funded, Trump campaign spokeswoman Leavitt sent a link to two Trump posts on his social media website, one of which said that Vice President Kamala Harris and the Justice Department were “trying to interfere in and suppress the Election in favor of the Democrats by resurrecting the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and trying to say that Russia is trying to help me, which is absolutely FALSE.” The other Trump post said that the only way to “save our Elections, our System of Justice, our Constitution, and our FREEDOM” would be by electing him in November. Some of the channel’s videos hit themes shared by Russia and the Republican Party: undermining confidence in U.S. elections. The RNC’s main mission should be election integrity, Johnson said in one Tenet video from March, before introducing Scott Presler, a conspiracy theorist who headed a group that helped plan “stop the steal” rallies before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, as well as chaired a group called Gays for Trump. “Mass Voter Fraud CONFIRMED from Coast-To-Coast!” read the title of one video Johnson created for Tenet eight months ago, which featured an interview with Kari Lake. “The Fed LIES of January 6th EXPOSED,” read another, featuring an interview with Jan. 6 defendant Jacob Chansley, better known as QAnon Shaman. Johnson’s background for both of those Tenet videos featured an image of Trump’s mugshot from his Georgia election interference case. Others railed against progressive causes in the culture wars. “Fat Acceptance: Has It Gone Too Far?,” and “EXPLICIT Books OK For Schools?” contributor Tayler Hansen wondered in his November man-on-the-street videos, a hallmark of his collection. Lauren Southern, once known as the alt-right’s most notable female propagandist, had some of the channel’s most popular videos, including a documentary exploring the difficulty of finding love in the digital age and a video opining on the Great Replacement, a white nationalist conspiracy theory alleging progressive politicians are encouraging illegal immigration to win elections. They posted about race, LGBTQ issues, the Israel Gaza war, censorship of conservatives, the “crumbling” of society, and stoked baseless fears about what they claim is rampant violent crimes by migrants. And they posted about Ukraine, framing its fight against Russian aggression as a waste of money for Americans. Struggling for traction Some of Tenet’s operations appeared to have been directed at least in part by RT employees, according to details from the indictment. Alongside the popular commentator’s videos, employees for Tenet were posting news clips and short Tik-Tok style reels from creators on other platforms. The indictment noted these videos were possibly posted directly by Russian operatives employed by RT. Russian operatives from RT also monitored Tenet’s internal communications and edited content, according to the indictment. That included Discord channels for individual contributors and their teams, channels that discussed production-related matters, pitches and concepts. But even with millions of dollars and well-followed commentators, the indictment showed that the company struggled for traction, highlighting that even some of the more advanced foreign influence campaigns are still susceptible to the vagaries of the internet. Tenet’s YouTube channel counts more than 315,000 subscribers, but many of its videos received fewer than 10,000 views. The indictment alleges that one of the founders acknowledged that it would be “very hard” to “recoup” the money they were paying based on ad revenue alone. Struggling for traction, Tenet tried to capitalize on the distribution channels of their commentators to spread content, with one of the RT employees pushing one of the founders to pressure the commentators to share Tenet content on X, according to the indictment. “At least one share per day. Not one share per week,” the RT employee demanded. Sharing Tenet content was not part of the commentators’ contracts according to the indictment, which didn’t say whether the requests had been obliged. The indictment gives insights into how Tenet employees took marching orders from RT. In February, there was a debate over posting a video featuring Tucker Carlson touring a Russian grocery store, which was filmed when Carlson interviewed Putin in February. Carlson was not named in the indictment. “They want me to post this,” a Tenet employee referred to as Producer-1 wrote in their internal chat, but “it just feels like overt shilling.” When one of the founders replied that the other founder “thinks we should put it out there,” Producer-1 gave in, writing “alright I’ll put it out tomorrow.” In March, the RT employee asked one of the founders to get a commentator to cover the Moscow terror attack with “a Ukraine/U.S. angle.” The next day, the Tenet founder said she had spoken with one of the commentators. “[H]e’s happy to cover it,” the founder wrote.","summary":"The video introducing Tenet Media hit many common conservative tropes: Mainstream media couldn’t be trusted.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/internets-popular-trump-pundits-ended-paid-messengers-russian-propagan-rcna169803","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240905-tenet-media-personalities-se-419p-bbfd5e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:35:12","author":"Brandy Zadrozny","authors":["Brandy Zadrozny"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":255748650,"title":"Tim Walz: Time for Netanyahu to start moving in the direction of a two-state solution","text":"LAS VEGAS - Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' running mate, said it was time for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to start moving in the direction of a two-state solution, warning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at a critical juncture.","summary":"Comments are the first time either Harris or her running mate have directly called out the Israeli prime minister by name","url":"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-06/ty-article/.premium/tim-walz-time-for-netanyahu-to-start-moving-in-the-direction-of-a-two-state-solution/00000191-c44a-d86a-a5d7-f55a67470000","image":"https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/00000191-32a6-dda7-a7b1-f2be55910001/bc/6a/e6b7a4ae44fdacc11c507da5b637/409501.jpg?precrop=2200,1279,x0,y0&height=630&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:31:51","author":"Ben Samuels","authors":["Ben Samuels"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":255750984,"title":"Democrats call for gun safety legislation after Apalachee High shooting","text":"by Ross Williams and Stanley Dunlap, Georgia Recorder Americans watched in horror on TV and social media Wednesday as students from Apalachee High School in Winder evacuated the building following a shooting that left four dead and nine injured, according to law enforcement and news reports. The names of the four victims killed in the Apalachee school morning shooting Wednesday were confirmed during the night by law enforcement officials as 14-year-old students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo and math teachers Christina Irimie and Richard Aspinwall. Colt Gray, a 14-year-old student will be charged with murder and tried as an adult in connection with the shooting, authorities announced Wednesday.Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said there was no evidence that another shooter was involved in the incident at Apalachee Wednesday. No evidence was found that Gray or anyone else had a list of other Georgia schools that were also targets of violence. A second threat was reported to police Wednesday at another local high school, but police determined there was no threat following an investigation, according to authorities. “Investigators are actively pursuing any leads of any potential associates of the shooter that was involved in this incident,” Hosey said. “However, there is a lot of evidence that is being recovered and evaluated,” Hosey said. “We’re going through everything to determine if there are any active threats to any schools in this area, this county and the state of Georgia and we will continue to monitor that throughout this. ” Local law enforcement first received reports of an active shooter on the campus of Apalachee at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation and several other state and local law enforcement agencies and emergency responders are helping the Barrow Sheriff’s Office with the “fluid” investigation, Smith said. Fallout The shooting is likely to spur further calls for gun safety measures in the coming state legislative session, set to begin in January. A Senate study committee on safe firearm storage was already scheduled to meet for the first time Thursday morning. The five-person committee is chaired by Decatur Democratic Sen. Emanuel Jones and includes three Republicans and two Democrats. “As Chairman of the Senate Study Committee on Safe Firearm Storage, I am committed to finding solutions to stop these tragedies before they occur,” Jones said in a statement. “This is not about infringing on Second Amendment rights but protecting our children and their safety. The technology exists today to secure firearms effectively, ensuring that they do not fall into the hands of those who should not have access to them, particularly children. On average, 1,927 people die by guns in Georgia each year—these are not just numbers; they are lives lost and families shattered. We must do more.” Georgians have been shocked by several high-profile shootings in recent years, including in 2021 when a gunman killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent at spas across metro Atlanta, and in 2023, when a shooting in an Atlanta medical facility left one dead and put several blocks of the city on extended lockdown. Those incidents, combined with others nationwide, including 2022’s school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, spurred Georgia lawmakers to seek ways to increase student safety. Kemp has touted measures including a recurring $103.9 million budget item for school safety, which amounts to $45,000 per Georgia public school to fund safety measures. Democrats called for further steps. State Rep. Michelle Au, D-Johns Creek, achieved a rare victory for gun safety supporters last year when her gun storage bill that would have instated punishments for gun owners who negligently allow firearms to fall into the hands of unsupervised children if those children harmed themselves or others received a public hearing. That legislation did not pass, and neither did another bill touted as a compromise, which would have provided a tax credit of up to $300 for gun safety devices like safes and trigger locks. Earlier this year, the parents of a Michigan school shooter were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for failing to prevent their child from carrying out the attack, which killed four. National reaction Tributes poured in from around the country, and so did calls for new gun safety legislation. President Joe Biden said the shooting turned the back-to-school season into “another horrific reminder of how gun violence continues to tear our communities apart” and called on Congress to enact new firearm regulations. “After decades of inaction, Republicans in Congress must finally say ‘enough is enough’ and work with Democrats to pass common-sense gun safety legislation,” he said in a statement. “We must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again, require safe storage of firearms, enact universal background checks, and end immunity for gun manufacturers. These measures will not bring those who were tragically killed today back, but it will help prevent more tragic gun violence from ripping more families apart.” Vice President Kamala Harris said Wednesday’s deadly Georgia school shooting is yet another reason to ramp up efforts to eradicate the epidemic of gun violence that is affecting young people across the country. The Biden-Harris administration announced new gun safety initiatives in March to prevent mass school shootings and other gun violence affecting youth, including a greater focus on mental health services and preventing students and people in crisis from having access to guns. “This is just a senseless tragedy on top of so many senseless tragedies,” Harris said during Wednesday afternoon’s presidential campaign stop in New Hampshire. “It’s just outrageous that every day in our country, in the United States of America, that parents have to send their children to school worried about whether or not their child will come home alive. It’s senseless.” Harris called for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws. Georgia Democrats struck a similar tone. Georgia Congresswoman Lucy McBath, whose son Jordan Davis was killed by gun violence, said she was praying for families of victims. “I am praying for the students of Apalachee High School and the community of Winder,” she said in a statement. “I am praying for families across our state and entire country. Too many continue to experience the pain of gun violence. No family should have to go through this.” “My heart breaks for the families of the victims at Apalachee High School & for every student,” said U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock in a tweet. “The entire Winder community is in my prayers, but we can’t pray only with our lips—we must pray by taking action.” “Until we center the people and start a serious, bipartisan conversation in Washington & state capitols across the country to advance popular, common sense gun safety reforms, the sad truth is it’s only a matter of time before this kind of tragedy comes knocking on your door,” he added. Former President Donald Trump weighed in on Truth Social. “Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA,” Trump said. “These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster.” Georgia Republicans were largely sedate, offering prayers for victims and praise for law enforcement but not commenting on any policy ramifications. “I have directed all available state resources to respond to the incident at Apalachee High School and urge all Georgians to join my family in praying for the safety of those in our classrooms, both in Barrow County and across the state,” Gov. Kemp said in a statement. “We will continue to work with local, state, and federal partners as we gather information and further respond to this situation.” House Speaker Jon Burns said in a statement that the time to discuss policy will come. “As a father and a grandfather, I am devastated by the horrific tragedy that took place today at Apalachee High School,” he said. “We continue to mourn the senseless loss of life, and pray for those who were injured as we lift up their families and the entire Barrow County community during this time. “We have prioritized making significant investments in mental health and school safety funding – and while there will be a time and place for policy discussions, our sole focus right now remains on surrounding these students, teachers and families with our love and support.” Republican Congressman Mike Collins, whose east Georgia district includes the school, is known for politically incorrect and inflammatory tweets, but he was staid on Wednesday. “Leigh Ann and I are praying for the victims, their families, and all students at Apalachee High School in Barrow County,” he tweeted. “We extend our gratitude to law enforcement for their swift action to secure the school and get the shooter in custody. I have spoken with Sheriff Smith and told him my team and I are available to assist in any way necessary. We will continue to monitor and provide updates as prudent.” The school is represented in the state Legislature by two high-ranking Republicans, Sen. Bill Cowsert of Athens and House Majority Leader Chuck Efstration of Auburn, who expressed similar sentiments Wednesday.

A member of the hacking group USDoD claimed to have released the personal records of 2.7 billion people, which were reportedly stolen from National Public Data, a major data broker. The records include highly sensitive information, such as full names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and phone numbers. The nine House Republicans urged President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to back the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would block the “unconscionable practice of funneling taxpayers’ money to data brokers.” In April, the House passed the legislation despite the opposition of the Biden White House. U.S. House of Representatives Lawmakers have told Breitbart News that intelligence and law enforcement’s purchasing of Americans’ data is a run around the Fourth Amendment. “The privacy of our constituents, as citizens and consumers, must be protected,” the House conservatives wrote. The House Republicans contended that the hack of the data broker database could be used to target Americans: We are especially concerned that this data could enable malicious actors to build a sophisticated dossier on every American that can cross-reference and validate other sensitive personal data obtained from the largely unregulated data broker industry, as well as other past and future data breaches — such as the recent theft of genetic data and family tree history from 23andMe and the hacking of government employees’ security clearance records retained by the Office of Personnel Management. Moreover, this data breach is alleged to have occurred in April 2024, which means the hackers had four months to mine, sell, and otherwise exploit the data in the shadows before the American public was broadly alerted to the theft. This is unacceptable. A YouGov poll that FreedomWorks and Demand Progress commissioned found that 80 percent of Americans back closing the data broker loophole, while only ten percent oppose it. Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Warren Davidson (R-OH) — who sponsored the bill — Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Randy Weber (R-TX), Ralph Norman (R-SC), Andy Ogles (R-TN), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Barry Moore (R-AL), and Ben Cline (R-VA) signed onto the letter. The House Republicans urged the Biden-Harris administration to end the data broker loophole. “We ask for a swift and comprehensive response from your administration, including acknowledgement of the severe consequences of this breach for our national security — and for the executive branch to finally join us, hundreds of our colleagues, and hundreds of millions of Americans in demanding an end to the federal government’s subsidizing and warrantless exploitation of data broker surveillance,” the lawmakers concluded.","summary":"House Republicans urged the Biden-Harris administration to end the \"warrantless exploitation\" of \"data broker surveillance.\"\n\n\nThe post Republicans Urge Biden, Harris to End &#8216;Warrantless Exploitation&#8217; of Data Broker Surveillance in Wake of 2.7 Billion Records Exposed appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/09/05/republicans-urge-biden-harris-to-end-warrantless-exploitation-of-data-broker-surveillance-in-wake-of-2-7-billion-records-exposed/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/data-broker-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:24:38","author":"Sean Moran","authors":["Sean Moran"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.102},{"id":255749174,"title":"Four Tren de Aragua Gangsters Arrested in Denver Apartment Complex","text":"Officials are finally starting to address the growing presence of the dangerous Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, in the Denver metro area after viral video showed gang members taking over apartment complexes in the area shocked America. On Tuesday, the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Department arrested four Venezuelan migrants that they say are members of the gang for perpetrating threatening activities at the Ivy Crossing Apartments near South Quebec Street and High Line Smith Way. The four were charged with drug offenses, stolen vehicles, and other offenses, according to KDVR-TV. The apartment complex is in south eastern Denver only miles away from the apartment complexes in nearby Aurora, Colorado, where video showed armed gang members walking through apartment building hallways and threatening residents. Arapahoe County Sheriff Tyler Brown said that they are now trying to go more proactive on gang activity and added, “We’re looking for any violation that we can stop and make contact with somebody and addressing the issues that they might have.” Brown would not elaborate on the investigation that led them to the six who were arrested, nor would he say how they knew that four of them were members of the Tren de Aragua. The arrests come only days after viral video went national and gave America a glimpse of the criminal activity coursing through the Denver area as a result of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s failed border policies. Aurora City Council Member Danielle Jurinsky, who brought national attention to the migrant gangs that are being welcomed by the Biden-Harris administration and their Denver Democrat allies, also placed the blame directly on Denver and Biden. “This is a problem that is not just a Denver Metro area problem … [it] stems from a failed southern border,” Jurinsky exclusively told Breitbart News late last month. Since the video went viral, the Aurora Police Department announced that it is working with the Colorado State Patrol and Colorado Bureau of Investigation on a special task force to address the city’s concerns about the gang. While the police have finally started to step up to address this issue, attorneys for the apartment complexes in Aurora have been desperately trying to get the attention of officials for weeks ahead of the viral video. Attorneys for CBZ Management in Aurora had sent letters to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office alerting the state to the infestations of the dangerous gangs, the Denver Gazette reported. Meanwhile, Colorado’s Democrat Gov. Jared Polis not only dismissed the story of migrant gangs in Aurora, but even called the story a figment of council member Jurinsky’s imagination and chided city officials for raising false alarms.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued an order mostly siding with a timeline proposed by special counsel Jack Smith, hours after the two sides met in her courtroom earlier Thursday. Trump is charged with four counts related to his alleged efforts to overturn the election results, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. He pleaded not guilty to the charges again, but waived his appearance before the court Thursday. Chutkan’s order The judge’s order rejects the schedule set out by Trump’s lawyers that would have extended pretrial proceedings into the spring or fall of 2025 — well after the November presidential election. Smith and his team had pushed for discussions about immunity to take place alongside motions and other issues that the former president’s legal team is expected to raise. Chutkan ordered federal prosecutors to turn over to Trump’s team all required evidence by Sept. 10, and gave Smith’s team until Sept. 26 to submit an opening brief presenting their arguments on presidential immunity. Smith’s prosecutors said in court Thursday that the immunity filing would include new information that was not included in the indictment. Chutkan’s order paves the way for that material to become public before November’s election. The judge set an Oct. 17 deadline for Trump’s team to respond to the special counsel’s arguments and submit their own request to dismiss the indictment on immunity grounds. The government will then have until Oct. 29 to file its reply. Chutkan wrote in her two-page order that once the filings on the immunity issue are submitted, she will decide whether additional proceedings are needed. The judge also said a filing from Trump’s team that must be submitted by Sept. 19 should include “any specific evidence related to presidential immunity” that the former president believes prosecutors improperly withheld. The order also states Trump has until Oct. 24 to ask the court to allow him to submit a motion to dismiss the case on claims Smith’s appointment and funding is unconstitutional. The special counsel and his team have until Oct. 31 to file papers opposing this request. Thursday’s hearing The case is resuming months after the Supreme Court found that presidents are entitled to absolute immunity from prosecution for official acts that are part of their “core constitutional powers,” and the presumption of immunity for acts that are official but outside their “exclusive authority.” Private acts enjoy no immunity. The high court sent the case back to Chutkan for further proceedings. The judge held a hearing with Trump’s attorneys and Smith’s prosecutors earlier Thursday where they argued over the timeline and how the Supreme Court’s ruling should be applied to Trump’s alleged conduct. Smith’s team revised the indictment against Trump last week to comply with the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling. At the hearing, Chutkan and John Lauro, Trump’s lawyer, sparred over whether some of the conduct contained in the new indictment — namely the former president’s conversations with Vice President Mike Pence after the 2020 election — was covered by presidential immunity. Lauro has argued that the case should be tossed out even with the slimmed-down accusations since Trump’s discussions with Pence should be considered official acts and therefore not subject to prosecution. But Chutkan said those conversations may be subject to presumptive immunity, the lesser form of protection that can be rebutted by federal prosecutors. Whether Trump and Pence’s interactions are outside of the former president’s official duties will be for her to decide, the judge said. She also made clear that the upcoming election would not factor into any decisions about how the case will proceed. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is seeking to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris in November to secure a second term in the White House. “The electoral process … is not relevant here,” Chutkan told Lauro. “This court is not concerned with the electoral schedule.” Repeated warnings from Trump’s lawyer about the “weighty” and “grave” issues before the court earned him condemnation from Chutkan. “It strikes me that what you’re trying to do is affect the presentation of evidence in this case so as not to impinge on an election,” she said. “I am not considering it.” The hearing, and Chutkan’s order, reaffirmed that a trial in the case will not take place before the November election.

Harris' apparent embrace of YIMBYism signals a potential shift in how Democrats approach housing policy.\"There is a serious housing shortage. In many places, it's too difficult to build, and it's driving prices up,\" Harris said at a North Carolina rally on Friday. \"I will work with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy. We will remove barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels.\"Political commentator Anand Giridharadas highlighted Harris' alignment with the movement in his newsletter The.Ink, writing, \"Kamala Harris is a YIMBY.\" He noted that the YIMBY approach is becoming central to the Democratic Party's efforts to tackle the housing shortage.\"Housing policy is now a campaign issue, much like industrial policy has returned under Biden — because Democrats are realizing it's important to do things people can feel in their everyday lives,\" he said.The United States is grappling with a severe housing shortage that has increased rents and home prices. Between late 2019 and mid-2021, home prices surged more than 40 percent, well before the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 2022.Advocates of the YIMBY movement, which began in San Francisco due to activists frustrated by soaring rents and a tight housing market, argue that restrictive zoning laws, often driven by NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) opposition, are major contributors to housing shortages and rising rents.However, NIMBY attitudes are particularly common in affluent, progressive areas where Democrats hold significant influence. This conflict is particularly visible in California, where Democratic state leaders have pushed pro-housing legislation against resistance from local Democratic officials.Some political commentators view Harris' alleged embrace of YIMBYism as an opportunity, especially in swing states like Nevada and Arizona, where rising rents have outpaced income growth since the COVID-19 pandemic.\"The idea of increasing supply and exploring federal action has been a mainstream Democratic position,\" Bharat Ramamurti, a former deputy director of the National Economic Council under President Biden, told HuffPost. He praised the shift in the party's priorities.The Democratic housing policy approach was displayed during the Democratic National Convention in August 2024. There, Harris pledged to end the nation's housing shortage and streamline processes that delay housing projects.Former President Barack Obama also spoke on the issue at the DNC, emphasizing the need to build more homes and cut red tape. \"If we want to make it easier for more young people to buy a home, we need to build more units and clear away outdated laws and regulations,\" Obama said.Obama proposed a similar plan before leaving office in 2017, but this may be the first time housing has taken center stage in a presidential election.However, the YIMBY movement doesn't align perfectly with other core Democratic themes, such as empowering workers and fighting Big Business.Many Democrats represent urban and suburban areas where local homeowners and community groups, who usually vote Democratic, may oppose new developments—especially high-density housing—due to concerns about property values, neighborhood character, and traffic.Moreover, while Harris has embraced some YIMBY principles, she also supports policies that YIMBY critics believe could exacerbate the housing crisis, such as federal rent control, which historically has reduced the housing supply.Whether Harris can unite Democrats behind the YIMBY cause remains to be seen. However, her campaign has undoubtedly made housing a top issue, and she could claim ownership of the topic.Republicans, led by former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, have yet to provide specific details. Instead, they have focused on linking the housing crisis to immigration and blaming the Biden administration, including Harris, for high inflation and a low housing supply.\"Trump's focus on immigration as a housing solution is particularly controversial,\" Michael Ryan, a finance expert, recently told Newsweek. \"While reducing population growth could theoretically lower housing demand, economists warn it could also deplete the construction workforce, exacerbating supply issues,\" he added.Whoever comes next must address the housing crisis, even if they can't solve everything immediately. A Gallup poll from May found that the cost of owning or renting a home was the second-most important financial issue for Americans, following the high cost of living. With housing being a key concern, this issue will play a significant role in shaping voters' decisions just two months before November.","summary":"YIMBY, short for \"Yes In My Backyard,\" promotes increasing the housing supply by removing barriers to new construction.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-democrats-yimby-housing-1949642","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2465470/kamala-harris-housing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:12:21","author":"Jesus Mesa,Monica Sager","authors":["Jesus Mesa","Monica Sager"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":255746520,"title":"Judge Chutkan Grants Jack Smith's Request in Trump Case","text":"U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has sided with Special Counsel Jack Smith in a battle over scheduling pre-trial hearings and deadlines in former President Donald Trump's federal election subversion case.Trump's legal team requested earlier this month that Chutkan push back any further hearings and deadlines until next year, while arguing that the case should be dismissed entirely due to the Supreme Court's recent decision granting sitting presidents immunity from prosecution of crimes committed while conducting certain \"official\" acts.On Thursday, Chutkan denied Trump's request and established a timeline for proceedings that largely follows a timeline proposed by Smith.

Trump has ushered in an era of politics that is rhetorically charged and ever partisan, with Trump and his allies pushing that America will be doomed if his political opponents win this year's election.As Politico previously reported, the GOP's policy platform has shifted on several key issues, from abortion to immigration, since the former president's first bid in 2016. And Trump's slogan—Make America Great Again—has also landed beyond the campaign trail, becoming a rallying cry for voters who believe Trump represents a return to an \"America-first\" ideology in Washington.As University of Kentucky political science professor D. Stephen Voss described it, \"Trump has built what scholars call a charismatic movement—a political movement inseparable from the man himself.\"In an email to Newsweek on Thursday, Voss argued that Trump's impact on the GOP will likely only exist as long as he is atop the ticket, writing, \"None of the things that typically give a movement continuity would persist after Trump leaves the stage.\"\"The Trump movement is not defined by an ideology, not defined by an identifiable social group, and to the extent it's united by grievances, they're not fully articulated,\" Voss added. \"Trump might try to pass the mantle to another figurehead, such as a member of his family or a politician molded in his image, but leadership of a personality-based movement typically is hard to pass on.\"It's unclear who could take over for Trump once his political tenure expires. The former president, 78, is the oldest presidential nominee in U.S. history, and Voss pointed out his age could be an \"additional liability\" to Trump's chances of running another campaign in 2028 should he lose in November.\"More likely, if Trump needs to recede, we will see a variety of prominent politicians jockeying to become the future of the Republican Party, some resembling a fresh incarnation of Trump—still emphasizing immigration and endorsing a retreat from international commitments—and some proposing to chart a new course that could be more successful for the GOP than the last half-dozen years have been,\" Voss said. \"A Trump loss likely will set off a GOP free-for-all.\"Other experts theorized that the MAGA movement could outlive Trump, but agreed it was unclear who could eventually fill the former president's shoes. Lee Hannah, political science professor at Wright State University, told Newsweek that while there have been several candidates that \"try to run like Trump—even taking on a lot of his rhetoric … I don't see a natural heir to Trumpism at the moment.\"\"But we do see that Trump is making a concerted effort to reach young men and is currently doing better with that demographic than he did in 2020,\" Hannah said via email, noting the former president's recent string of appearances on popular podcasts and streamer sites with figures like Lex Fridman and Adin Ross.\"If anything, it seems like Trumpism is going to widen the gender gap and that may persist long after he is gone,\" Hannah added. \"So, I see the Trump movement and its impact on the GOP lasting long after him—but they don't seem to have one person that can encapsulate all that Donald Trump has.\"Experts have said that this year's election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris could see one of the biggest gender divides in U.S. history. While the former president remains ahead of his Democratic opponent among young male voters, Harris holds a consistent lead among women voters, and surveys show that young women of Generation Z are far more liberal than their male counterparts.Political analyst Craig Agranoff said in a text message to Newsweek on Thursday that it was \"unlikely that the influence of 'Trumpism'\" would \"disappear\" if Trump loses his reelection bid, adding the movement's priorities that \"have resonated with a significant portion of the electorate will continue to shape the Republican Party and its future candidates.\"\"Whether Trump himself would run in 2028 is speculative, but the movement he's built has inspired a younger generation of political figures [and] voters who may carry on its themes regardless of his candidacy,\" Agranoff added. \"The real question is how the party evolves in response to changing political dynamics!\"","summary":"Experts who spoke with Newsweek questioned if Trump's legacy in the GOP could continue beyond a November defeat.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/what-happens-maga-if-donald-trump-loses-1949629","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2465451/what-happens-maga-if-trump-loses.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:08:55","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.108},{"id":255749924,"title":"Joe Biden's Son Hunter Officially Pleads Guilty In Tax Evasion Case","text":"oe Biden's son Hunter pleaded guilty in a tax evasion trial on Thursday, without reaching the deal he had sought with prosecutors, in a case that has been an embarrassment for the US president. The 54-year-old admitted nine counts related to failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes over the past decade, money that prosecutors said he splurged instead on luxury living, sex workers and a drug habit. The pleas came on the day jury selection for a trial had been due to start, and hours after Biden had offered to plead guilty in the hope of striking a deal that might keep him out of prison. But no deal materialized and Biden made the pleas in open court. US District Judge Mark Scarsi set sentencing for December 16. Biden faces up to 17 years in prison and a fine in excess of $1 million. A trial had been expected to re-hash sordid details of a life that the defendant and his family -- including the president -- have long acknowledged had gone off the rails. \"I will not subject my family to more pain, more invasions of privacy and needless embarrassment,\" US media reported Biden saying in a statement. \"Prosecutors were focused not on justice but on dehumanizing me for my actions during my addiction.\" Biden has already spent a chunk of 2024 in court, having been convicted in Delaware of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun -- an act that is a felony. He has yet to be sentenced for that crime, and could face up to 25 years imprisonment. President Biden has the power to pardon his son, but has said he would not do so. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday that his position had not changed. \"It is still very much a 'no',\" she said. - Political battle - Lawyers for Biden have said he was only being brought before the court because of who he is. \"They want to slime him because that is the whole purpose,\" Biden's attorney Mark Geragos reportedly said during an August hearing in which he accused prosecutors of attempted character assassination. Biden's defense team has argued that the non-payment of taxes was an oversight in a life wrought chaotic by a spiraling drug addiction and the trauma of losing his older brother, Beau, to a brain tumor in 2015. Biden has paid the back taxes, as well as penalties levied by authorities, and had previously reached a plea deal that would have kept him out of jail. That agreement fell apart at the last minute, and Biden is understood to have been trying to reach another since then. That has been difficult for prosecutors, whose every move in this election year is being scrutinized by Republicans, who charge the defendant is being treated leniently because he is the president's son. Hunter Biden has for years been a foil for his father's political opponents, who have sought -- without producing evidence -- to smear the family as a group of criminals who have gained wealth and power because of Joe Biden's career. The elder Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race in favor of Kamala Harris has taken much of the zeal out of the Republican drive to make an example out of his son. Nevertheless, prosecutors appeared unwilling to cut him any slack. An attempt on Thursday morning by Hunter Biden to enter a so-called \"Alford plea,\" whereby he would admit guilt because of the high probability of conviction but maintain his innocence, was rebuffed. \"I want to make crystal clear: the US opposes an Alford plea,\" prosecutor Leo Wise told the court. \"Hunter Biden is not innocent, he is guilty.\" In his statement, Biden, who lives in Malibu, said his drug addiction was \"not an excuse, but it is an explanation for some of my failures at issue in this case.\" \"I have been clean and sober for more than five years because I have had the love and support of my family. \"I can never repay them for showing up for me and helping me through my worst moments. \"But I can protect them from being publicly humiliated for my failures.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"US President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, pleaded guilty Thursday to all nine tax charges he faced, without reaching a deal with prosecutors.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/joe-bidens-son-hunter-officially-pleads-guilty-in-tax-evasion-case-6500956","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-12/7odfp46s_hunter-biden-afp_625x300_10_December_20.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:08:19","author":"Hunter Biden","authors":["Hunter Biden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.436},{"id":255748906,"title":"JD Vance Says the Solution to the Childcare Crisis Is to Have Grandparents Do It for Free","text":"That’s right: While speaking at a conservative event on Wednesday, Vance was asked, “What can we do about lowering the cost of day care?” His verbatim answer: “Such an important question, Charlie [Kirk], and I think one of the things that we can do is make it easier for families to choose whatever model they want, right? So one of the ways that you might be able to relieve a little bit of pressure on people who are paying so much for day care is…maybe grandma and grandpa [want] to help out a little bit more, or maybe there’s an aunt or uncle that wants to help out a little bit more. If that happens, you relieve some of the pressure on all the resources that we’re spending on day care.” Yes, Vance’s brilliant solution to skyrocketing day care costs is for working parents to enlist grandparents and aunts and uncles—who either don’t have jobs of their own or are somehow able to take time off from work—to take care of their kids for free. It’s something stressed-out parents have definitely never thought of, and for the few who actually might have this magical scenario available to them, surely they aren’t taking advantage of it already. It’s so simple that it’s hard to believe child-hating Democrats like Kamala Harris never thought of it themselves. But Vance, of course, isn’t so out of touch that he thinks the majority of parents have a roster of family members they can call on to take care of their children for numerous hours a week. So he’s also got another idea: “Now…let’s say you don’t have somebody who can provide that extra set of hands,” he said. “What we’ve got to do is actually empower people to get trained in the skills that they need for the 21st century. We’ve got a lot of people who love kids, who would love to take care of kids but they can’t, either because they don’t have access to the education that they need or, maybe more importantly, because the state government says you’re not allowed to take care of children unless you have some ridiculous certification that has…nothing to do with taking care of kids. So empower people to get the skills they need. Don’t force every early-childcare specialist to go and get a six-year college degree where they’ve got a whole lot of debt and Americans are much poorer because they’re paying out the wazoo for day care. Empower working families, empower people who want to do these things for a living, and that’s what we’ve got to do.” So, just to get it out of the way, it’s not clear what “six-year college degree” the senator is talking about that is supposedly required to work at a day care. But apparently his solution—if, again, you don’t have free childcare at your disposal—is to have the government get rid of the pesky regulations currently in place to ensure the individuals looking after your children are qualified to do so. Of course, he doesn’t actually specify what “ridiculous certification” he’d get rid of; perhaps he’s talking about CPR? He definitely could be! Incidentally, given these robust policy plans Vance has put forth, you might be wondering what legislation he’s backed during his time in the Senate that would help parents. And the answer is: none that can be identified by the naked eye. Despite calling for a child tax credit of $5,000 per child in an interview with CBS News, he failed to show up for a vote last month on legislation that would—wait for it—expand the child tax credit.","summary":"His other big idea: get rid of the certification requirements put on day care providers, which are there to ensure children are safe.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/jd-vance-solution-childcare-crisis-is-to-have-grandparents-do-it-for-free","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66da2a645ef04e4ba4149002/16:9/w_3552,h_1998,c_limit/2162307813","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:05:44","author":"Bess Levin","authors":["Bess Levin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":255746346,"title":"Bill de Blasio sprinkles coconut on pizza, eats it crust- first in bizarre stunt to promote Kamala Harris","text":"What a weird-dough! Former Mayor Bill de Blasio chowed down — crust-first — on a piece of coconut-sprinkled pizza in a hard-to-stomach video stunt promoting Kamala Harris’ bid for president on social media Thursday. In a cheesy call-back to the viral ridicule he received for eating pizza with a fork in 2014, De Blasio is shown dumping a bag of dried coconut shavings on a piece of cheese pizza with a furrowed brow, according to footage he posted on X. The 63-year-old politician-turned-academic then flips the slice around and eats it backwards — in an absolutely coconuts apparent attempt to catch the internet’s attention — as he sits in a restaurant. “I am hungry. I will eat pizza today,” he wrote under the post — made to promote “Paisans for Kamala,” a virtual event that will feature Italian-American stars and politicians this weekend. “Join us virtually for Sunday dinner!” he tweeted. “RSVP at http://PaisansForKamala.com All our special guests will talk about what their heritage means to them, why they passionately support @KamalaHarris and what their favorite dish is.” De Blasio hopes the saucy throwback drums up buzz for the event, which will feature actors Steve Buscemi, Marisa Tomei, Lorraine Bracco, John Turturro and others. Politicians such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congressman John Garamendi and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro will also appear at the virtual dinner. “[It] brings together Italian-American stars, political leaders, and community members for a night of stories, recipes, and a conversation about the stakes in the 2024 election,” according to a press release. In January 2014, De Blasio was widely mocked for digging into a smoked-mozzarella-and-sausage pie at the Staten Island Pizzeria Goodfellas with a knife and fork. The move was a culinary abomination to many red-blooded New Yorkers, who profess a hands-only approach to the city’s signature dish — sparking the hashtag #forkgate. One food writer dubbed the incident a “disaster” while others called it De Blasio’s first mistake as mayor — and The Post teased, “Some New Yorker.” De Blasio defended himself at the time by saying he picked up the fork habit in his “ancestral homeland” of Italy, where most people use utensils when eating pizza.","summary":"Former Mayor Bill de Blasio chowed down crust-first on a piece of coconut-sprinkled pizza in a hard-to-stomach stunt promoting Kamala Harris’ presidential ticket on social media Thursday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/05/us-news/bill-de-blasio-sprinkles-coconut-on-pizza-eats-it-crust-first-in-stunt-to-promote-kamala-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89012965.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/1WMVzFTX-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-05 22:03:12","author":"Natalie O'Neill","authors":["Natalie O'Neill"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.426},{"id":255746648,"title":"CNN calls out Harris for using Trump's border wall in campaign ad after condemning it for years","text":"A CNN segment reported Wednesday on how Vice President Kamala Harris is using imagery of former President Trump’s border wall after condemning it for years as \"useless\" and un-American.
