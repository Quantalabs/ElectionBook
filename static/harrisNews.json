Now’s the time to put it out of its misery","text":"Just pull the plug already.\n\nIt’s time. In fact, it’s past time. The body is barely breathing.\n\nYes, “The Howard Stern Show” on SiriusXM is reportedly limping toward its final destination. The former shock jock’s $500 million contract, which he signed in 2020, is up in the fall; according to the US Sun, there’s a good chance he’ll be offered less money than he wants to renew.\n\nWhile there’s no official confirmation the show will end, it should go the way of Stephen Colbert’s farce of a late-night show.\n\nThis isn’t dancing on the grave of someone’s career. It’s merely acknowledging reality: Stern, 71, was paid all that ‘scarole to be edgy, relevant and interesting — something he hasn’t been in years.\n\nCertainly not since he enlisted in the cult of woo-woo therapization and disavowed so much of his best work, including pulling bawdy confessions from image-conscious bold-facers.\n\nNo more jokes about masturbating to Aunt Jemima. No more feuds with celebs like Chevy Chase and Kathie Lee Gifford. No more release-valve humor during some of our country’s darkest events. Or the inclination to be raw and unfiltered.\n\nOnce a swashbuckling, norms-shattering FCC antagonist, Stern has morphed into everything he formerly railed against.\n\nWhen it comes to celebrities, he can’t fawn over them enough now. Stern’s a first-class, A-list “Ass Smoochio,” a nickname he gave Arsenio Hall back in the day.\n\nLast summer, Stern — overestimating his own influence — made things even worse by entering the presidential media circus to sit down with a clearly diminished Joe Biden.\n\nThe old Stern would have spent 30 minutes at least on the gaffe-prone president’s mythical neighborhood gang leader and overall “bad dude” Corn Pop.\n\nInstead, he marveled over Scranton Joe’s high-school football exploits. He called Biden’s family — which consists of a crackhead son he later pardoned and a grandchild he didn’t acknowledge until the New York Times bullied him into it — “extraordinary.”\n\nStern even offered this profundity: “You’re the kind of leader I love … we’re lucky to have you in the Oval Office.”\n\nFartman would never.\n\nNot only did the fawning interview make Biden look like a doddering old man, it made Stern look positively impotent.\n\nStern sank even lower when he interviewed Biden’s replacement, Kamala Harris.\n\n“When I met you out in the hall, I said, ‘I’m really nervous because I want this to go well for you,’” Stern said. He then whined about “Saturday Night Live” parodying Harris.\n\n“I hate it. I don’t want you being made fun of,” Stern told her. “There’s too much at stake. I believe the entire future of this country right now … it’s literally on the line.”\n\nImagine that. A man who built an empire off of mocking powerful people thought that the potential president of the United States shouldn’t have to suffer a few jokes at her expense — something that actually works to humanize a candidate.\n\nTo call it malpractice would be kind.\n\nMeanwhile, Stern’s loyal audience, who dutifully renewed their Sirius subscriptions, are fair game for his wrath.\n\nLocking himself away in a two-year Covid quarantine, he derided listeners for daring to go outside and live their lives, calling them “stupid” for not sharing his ideology.\n\n“I hate the people who vote for [Trump],” he said last September. “I think they’re stupid. I do. I’ll be honest with you, I have no respect for you.”\n\nSiriusXM essentially built its initial subscriber base on the back of the one-time “King of all Media,” who in 2006 left terrestrial radio and the constraints of the FCC. That deal was reportedly worth $100 million a year and made him a very wealthy man.\n\nNearly 20 years on, the once-mighty monarch looks like a minor jester.\n\nMeanwhile, the media and entertainment landscape has been radically reshaped by an over-abundance of podcasts. There are a gazillion hosts doing what Stern once did — and many doing it much better.\n\nIt’s time for the retirement tour.","summary":"While there's no official confirmation the show will end, it should go the way of Stephen Colbert's farce of a late-night show.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/06/opinion/howard-sterns-show-may-be-ending-put-it-out-of-its-misery/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-9twj0g52t-1754523128565.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754508848&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gWSIxBaN-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-06 23:40:05","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":348818284,"title":"Trump reveals his bizarre theory on why Howard Stern could be cancelled","text":"President Donald Trump gave his take on why longtime radio show host Howard Stern may be facing cancellation. \n\nThe Sun reported Wednesday that Stern's SiriusXM show will end after the shock jock's current contract is up. \n\nThe Daily Mail previously reported that Stern had been in 'very serious negotiations' with SiriusXM about whether he would be able to extend his $500 million contract, which ends at the end of the year.\n\n'Howard Stern is a name I haven't heard - I used to do his show, we used to have fun - but I haven't heard that name in a long time,' Trump told reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office. 'What happened he got terminated?' the president asked. \n\nStern has not yet been terminated, but that didn't stop Trump.\n\n'You know when he went down? You know when he went down?' Trump then said. 'When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, he lost his audience. People said, get me a break. He went down when he endorsed Hillary Clinton.' \n\nClinton was Trump's 2016 opponent. \n\nStern also had Trump's 2024 rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, on his show last year. \n\nTrump also continued to chime in on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert's cancellation. \n\nColbert and the Late Show will both end in May. \n\n'Colbert has no talent,' Trump said in the Oval on Wednesday.\n\n'I mean, I could take anybody here. I could go outside to the beautiful streets and pick a couple of people that do just as well or better. They get higher ratings than he did. He's got no talent,' the president continued. \n\n'Fallon has no talent. Kimmel has no talent. They're next,' Trump added, name-dropping the other late night hosts. 'They're going to be going, I hear they're going to be going.' \n\nThis week Trump did decide that he liked one prominent figure in pop culture - actress Sydney Sweeney.\n\nOn Sunday, the Daily Mail asked Trump for reaction after Sweeney was outed as a registered Republican. \n\nTrump loved it. \n\n'She's a registered Republican?' the president said with interest on the tarmac of the Lehigh Valley International Airport outside of Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump was heading back to Washington after spending the weekend at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf resort.\n\n'You'd be surprised at how many people are Republican. That's one I wouldn't have known, but I'm glad you told me that,' he continued.\n\n'If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.'\n\nSince then, he posted on Truth Social sharing his support for the actress - and the White House's social media account created a meme of Trump, shouting out from the West Wing's rooftop, which he visited Wednesday.\n\n'Have you seen the Sydney Sweeney ad?' the post said.","summary":"President Donald Trump gave his take on why longtime radio show host Howard Stern may be facing cancellation.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14977661/donald-trump-howard-stern-cancellation-hillary-clinton.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/06/23/100989021-0-image-a-11_1754519874690.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 22:53:03","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":348829598,"title":"Elon Musk wins California free speech court ruling on digitally altered videos","text":"Tech mogul Elon Musk notched an important victory for free speech this week after a federal judge on Tuesday invalidated a California law that sought to restrict digitally altered videos on online platforms like X, which Musk owns.\n\nAssembly Bill 2655, the Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act of 2024, required X and some other large platforms to “block the posting of materially deceptive content related to elections in California, during specified periods before and after an election.”\n\n“No parts of this statute are severable because the whole statute is preempted,” U.S. District Court Judge John Mendez explained in his ruling. “No parts of A.B. 2655 can be salvaged,” he added.\n\nMendez, a 2008 appointee of President George W.

The absent democrats face a $500 fine for each day they are absent, but O’Rourke’s Powered by People PAC and the Soros-backed Texas Majority PAC are covering much of the cost, according to The Texas Tribune.\n\nSince the Texas House Democrats fled the Lone Star State, Powered by People has directed all donations towards supporting the effort, according to the Texas Tribune. O’Rourke’s political outfit has reportedly paid for lawmakers’ expenses, including travel, including private flights, hotel rooms, meals and logistical support, a source familiar with the matter told the outlet. (RELATED: Liberal Media Dutifully Ignoring Illinois’ Blatant Gerrymandering Hypocrisy)\n\nO’Rourke personally called lawmakers in recent weeks, urging them to flee the state to block the GOP redistricting efforts, The Texas Tribune reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the Texas Majority PAC is reportedly coordinating with national Democratic groups to court the party’s biggest donors to fund the lawmakers’ ongoing absence. The PAC is bankrolled by Soros and was founded by alumni of O’Rourke’s failed 2022 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nTexas Majority spent over $9 million during the 2024 election cycle, with nearly two-thirds coming from Soros, according to the Texas Tribune. Despite significant spending in the state, former Vice President Kamala Harris lost Texas to President Donald Trump by nearly 14 points in 2024, and Sen. Ted Cruz defeated Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 8.5 points.\n\nMost of the Texas Democrats are hunkering down in the heavily-gerrymandered state of Illinois, protected by billionaire Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The governor said on Tuesday that he has not yet financially supported the Democrats, but is “not reticent to do that.”\n\nOn Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott warned in a letter sent to the absent Democrats that fundraising to cover fines associated with their absence could be a violation of Texas House rules and bribery laws. Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton followed up on Wednesday by launching an investigation into Powered by People for “potentially operating an illegal financial influence scheme to bribe runaway Democrats.”\n\n“Any Democrat coward breaking the law by taking a Beto Bribe will be held accountable,” said Paxton. “Texas cannot be bought. I look forward to thoroughly reviewing all of the documents and communications obtained throughout this investigation. These jet-setting runaways have already lost public trust by abandoning our state, and Texans deserve to know if they received illegal bribes to do it.”\n\nO’Rourke told The Texas Tribune that he would “have the backs of these heroic state lawmakers for as long as it takes to stop Trump’s power grab.”\n\n“Every dime of expense for this effort is being paid for lawfully,” a spokesperson for the Texas House Democratic Caucus told The Texas Tribune, but declined to provide further details.\n\nThis is not the first time Powered by People has backed a similar effort, according to The Texas Tribune. In 2021, the group reportedly raised $600,000 to help fund Texas Democrats’ trip to Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to block Republican-backed election integrity measures.\n\nNeither Powered by People nor Texas Majority responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. \n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Still, Democrats have generally outperformed Republicans in special elections this year, fueling the party's optimism about a potential blue wave in the 2026 midterm elections.What To KnowFamiglietti, who on the campaign trail cast himself as a moderate, defeated Republican Alex Asermely by more than 67 percentage points in Tuesday's special election, receiving more than 83 percent of the vote. He is now poised to represent Rhode Island's Fourth District in the state Senate.That is a substantial improvement on Harris' margin of victory in the district last November, when she carried it by only about 11 percentage points.\"I am extremely humbled to have been elected to serve the community in which I was born and raised in the state Senate, and I look forward to the opportunity to work on the state level to support our District,\" Famiglietti wrote in a statement after his victory.Rhode Island has long been a safely Democratic state, but some areas in the state have become more competitive in recent years. Former President Joe Biden carried the district by about 17 percentage points in 2020, but former President Barack Obama enjoyed larger margins during his 2008 and 2012 presidential runs.Although President Donald Trump narrowed Democrats' margins, Ruggerio remained very popular in the district. He had not faced a Republican opponent in more than a decade and was reelected with nearly 95 percent of the vote in 2024.Meanwhile, a special election in Delaware saw a Republican outperform Trump's 2024 margin to make a competitive race in a district Harris won by nine points. Democrat Alonna Berry defeated Republican Nikki Miller by only 121 votes for Houst District 20.In April, the liberal-aligned Susan Crawford defeated conservative-aligned Brad Schimel in a critical Wisconsin Supreme Court race that was officially nonpartisan. Democrats also overperformed in two Florida House special elections, though Republicans still won. Democrats have also performed well in many other legislative special races, such as an Iowa state House seat in late April. Still, Republicans have overperformed in some elections as well, including a race for the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.What People Are SayingRhode Island state Senate President Valerie Lawson, Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian, in a statement: \"Congratulations to Senator-elect Stefano Famiglietti on his successful campaign and well-earned victory in the election. His deep roots in the community and clear understanding of the priorities of District 4 have resonated with voters, and his commitment to public service is a strong reflection of the values exemplified by Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.\"Alex Asermely, on Facebook: \"I want to thank the voters of Senate District 4 who exercised their right to vote in today's special election. Serving as the Republican nominee has been a great honor, and though the outcome is not what we hoped for, I am deeply moved by the trust and dedication of my team and supporters who have stood behind me in this fight. Just a few moments ago, I spoke with Senator-Elect Stefano Famiglietti and congratulated him on his victory.\"What Happens NextSpecial legislative elections are scheduled for August 26 in Alabama, California, Georgia and Iowa.","summary":"Rhode Island Democrat Stefano Famiglietti won a special election with more than 83 percent of the vote.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/stefano-famiglietti-rhode-island-special-election-2109967","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2697945/rhode-island-special-election.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=25dd46c8c54d3609aeee0031d797310c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 21:44:14","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.489},{"id":348811152,"title":"Musk Wins California Free Speech Court Ruling on Digitally Altered Videos","text":"Tech mogul Elon Musk notched an important victory for free speech this week after a federal judge on Tuesday invalidated a California law that sought to restrict digitally altered videos on online platforms like X, which Musk owns.\n\nAssembly Bill 2655, the Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act of 2024, required X and some other large platforms to “block the posting of materially deceptive content related to elections in California, during specified periods before and after an election.”\n\n“No parts of this statute are severable because the whole statute is preempted,” U.S. District Court Judge John Mendez explained in his ruling. “No parts of A.B. 2655 can be salvaged,” he added.\n\nMendez, a 2008 appointee of President George W.

Yet Carville said in a Politicon YouTube video that the Democrats should go well beyond redistricting if they secure unified control of the federal government in 2028. (RELATED: Jonathan Turley Predicts Whether Greg Abbott Will Be Able To Wrangle Dem Lawmakers Back To Texas)\n\n“[T]he Democrats talk about democracy … and preserving democracy and saving democracy — well, the truth of the matter is, people are right when they say this democracy is really imperfect,” Carville said. “And they’re going to have to do — if the Democrats win the presidency, the Senate and the House in 2028 … they are just going to have to unilaterally add Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia as states.”\n\n“The Constitution gives Congress power over federal elections. I don’t think they’re going to redistrict, but … they’re going to have to do it. They’re just going to have to do it,” he added. “And they may have to expand the Court to 13 members. Any of those things in isolation, I would be skeptical about, I would be cautious about, I would say, ‘Well, I don’t know if that’s the greatest idea in the world. You’re opening Pandora’s box.'”\n\nHowever, Carville said he believed it was necessary to “do all of those things” in order to “save democracy.”\n\nOnly 29% of Americans back increasing the number of Supreme Court justices, according to a 2024 poll by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDespite former President Joe Biden campaigning in 2024 on President Donald Trump being a threat to democracy, undecided swing-state voters trusted Trump over Biden on the issue, according to a June Washington Post-Schar School poll featuring “decider” voters from six swing-states.\n\nMoreover, the Democratic Party faced backlash for the process in which former Vice President Kamala Harris became the presidential nominee in 2024. She secured enough support from Democratic delegates to become the party’s presumptive nominee in July 2024, despite garnering virtually no primary voter approval.\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also agreed with comedian Akaash Singh on “Flagrant” in May that the Democratic Party was “a threat to democracy,” based on its presidential primary process.\n\n“I’m not going to argue with that point,” Sanders said. “And that’s why I’m proudly an independent.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Subscribe here.\n\nMost Democrats don’t know how to fight culture wars, let alone win them. Their instinct when confronted with a culture-war provocation is to either change the topic or disengage altogether.\n\nBut the social web is still bursting with reminders that, for a brief moment, just about a year ago, they almost figured it out. The evidence is in this picture, and the millions of variations that have been generated since.\n\nThe baby-faced J.D. Vance memes that float across your screens, and that may have prompted customs officials to detain and remove a Norwegian tourist earlier this year, have origins in this Twitter thread, which included the prompt “For every 100 likes I will turn JD Vance into a progressively apple cheeked baby.” J.D. Vance Babyface evolved into canonical form after the politician’s debate with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz but became ubiquitous only after Vance ambushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, demanding he thank the United States for past military aid. With a bit of comedic license, “thank you” became “pwease and tank you,” and a meme was born.\n\nWhy did internet jokers think to transform Vance into a giant baby? It’s hard to peer inside their minds, but just a couple of months before baby J.D. was born, grown-up J.D. had become the object of a crude satire, in which he’d supposedly (not actually) confessed to a sexual fetish for sofa cushions.\n\nAnd that gag had its origins in something real: a successful but fleeting Democratic effort, brought mainstream by Walz, to depict right-wing Republicans and their social and cultural fixations as “weird.”\n\nIt turned out Vance had left a lengthy trail of bizarre, officious comments about, well, a lot of things, but particularly female fertility and childlessness. He referred to childless women as “a bunch of … cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.”\n\nDuring the “weird” boomlet, all of progressivism became hyper-attuned to the bizarre conduct of the professional right. It made an impression on one of the most popular people in the world, who signed her Harris–Walz endorsement “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady.” And it fed fleeting but intensive mainstream scrutiny of rightist views on abortion and female subservience.\n\nI say “fleeting” because Democrats quickly spooked. That August, Kamala Harris’ pollster Geoff Garin reportedly advised the candidate to stop saying “We’re not going back,” because it didn’t look to the future, and advised Walz to “lay off all the ‘weird’ talk—too negative.”\n\nThe duo briefly resisted Garin’s advice, but by the next month they’d been tamed.\n\nBenefit of the Douthat\n\nVance’s snipe at “cat ladies” wasn’t Swift’s introduction to right-wing weirdness. It was more like a capstone.\n\nOne right-wing reactionary daydreamed that if Swift were to marry and procreate with her partner Travis Kelce—a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs—it would prefigure “the greatest spike in weddings in American history,” as “mimetic desire [grips] the hearts and minds of millions of millennial women,” yielding “a tsunami of heterosexual romantic happy endings” and, thus, a baby boom.\n\nIn November 2023, the Vance-aligned New York Times columnist Ross Douthat half-endorsed the fantasy, writing, “It would be delightful, for them and for us, if the burgeoning Swift–Kelce courtship went the distance, giving us a celebrity wedding and perhaps a royal baby.”\n\nOther rightists, offended by Swift’s basic decency, and Kelce’s pro-vaccine advocacy, took aim at the couple. They theorized that the relationship was an act, part of a put-up job that would culminate in a joint anti-Trump presidential endorsement. They even mused conspiratorially that Kelce’s all-star performance and the Chiefs’ victory in that year’s Super Bowl were rigged.\n\nThis stuff, too, was incredibly weird.\n\nIt’s weird to be paranoid or to feign paranoia as part of an elaborate performance to manipulate rubes. Harboring concerns, even religiously inflected ones, about the population of the country is one thing; opining on what other people’s reproductive organs owe the world is back-away-slowly cringe.\n\nA more mission-oriented progressive media apparatus, with help from elected Democrats, would have homed in on all of these interventions. On Douthat and the tradcon movement and their deep ties to Vance, and on how the pseudo-Darwinistic tech right embraced their ideas, infusing them with delusions about the gift of high-IQ semen.\n\nIn September 2024, Elon Musk offered to impregnate Swift with perhaps his 100th offspring. But by then the weird wave had crested. You can thank the pollsters.\n\nChurchill to Die On\n\nThere’s more to the right and its weirdness than its fixation on other people’s sex lives.\n\nThere’s the overlapping world of incels, and the world of fascists and groypers and neo-Nazis, which overlaps with that.\n\nTurning these people into stand-ins for elected Republicans, and making Republicans answer for them, isn’t beyond the capability of Democrats and progressives. Their failure to do it is mostly a matter of missing conviction. The necessary elements—nitpicking, performance of anger—make them feel icky, and in any case they assume in advance that their efforts would fail or backfire.\n\nThey need fewer pollsters reinforcing these instincts and more critics telling them to get over themselves.\n\nTwenty years ago, I watched Republicans and Fox News transform the leftist professor Ward Churchill into a stand-in for the Democratic Party. It was a formative political moment for me. Churchill had called the financial professionals and Pentagon officials who died on 9/11 “little Eichmanns” for their complicity with U.S. imperialism. Republicans got wind of this and pounced. It didn’t matter to them that leftists like Churchill hated Democrats, and Democrats’ defensive votes for the Iraq war didn’t provide them any cover from right-wing ascriptions of guilt by false association. Republicans had a template, and they deployed it.\n\nIn contrast to Churchill, Vance and Douthat and Musk and Nick Fuentes and Peter Thiel and Stephen Miller aren’t small fish, and they aren’t fake Republicans. They’re the real deal. Miller may, at an operational level, be the most powerful person in the world. Today’s GOP is chockablock with actual little Eichmanns like him. But Democrats practically never gesture to them and their dead-eyed, shiver-inducing antics, except occasionally to accuse the party of hypocrisy when Republicans pretend to stand against antisemitism. To end where we began, they don’t know how to fight culture wars, let alone win them, so they change topic or disengage altogether.\n\nThis imbalance explains why the politicians who’ve mentioned or alluded to Sydney Sweeney this past week are all salivating Republicans, but their weird, public horniness comes at no political risk, while Democrats, in stunned silence, lose another culture war.\n\nDemocrats can upend this pitiful dynamic whenever they want. But first they have to stop listening to people like Geoff Garin.","summary":"Democrats almost figured out how to win culture wars.

President Trump is right, everyday Americans don’t want to watch Colbert’s talentless, money-losing show. Protecting the First Amendment is a top priority to President Trump, which is why he signed an executive order on day one to stop federal censorship and protect freedom of speech,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.\n\nThe letter concludes by calling on elected officials to “resist this overreach” as well as calling for audiences to “raise their voice” to protect the left-wing bias in the media.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, X at WTHuston, or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston.","summary":"More than 2,300 Hollywood power players have signed a letter attacking President Donald Trump for what they call an \"authoritarian assault\" on free speech over his defamation lawsuits against left-wing media organizations.\n\n\nThe post Spike Lee, Lilly Wachowski, Adam McKay, 2,300 Hollywood Elites Rage at Trump for &#8216;Authoritarian Assault&#8217; on Free Speech appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/08/06/spike-lee-adam-mckay-2300-hollywood-writers-sign-letter-blasting-trump-for-authoritarian-assault-on-free-speech/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/08/spikekleeWachowskimckay-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 18:05:59","author":"Warner Todd Huston","authors":["Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":348781758,"title":"Epstein scandal looms over Washington DC","text":"The years-long scandal has inflamed again over the summer and President Trump, who is the master of the media blizzard, can’t seem to move on from it. The questions about his ties to the convicted sex offender won’t go away. And unhelpfully for the president, many of the loudest voices calling for the release of the ‘Epstein files’ are from within his loyal base (egged on in the years before the election by none other than Donald Trump Jr and now Vice President JD Vance).\n\nHe’s been subpoenaed, along with Hillary Clinton, to give testimony on his links to Epstein. President Clinton is on record saying he regrets ever meeting Epstein and never visited his notorious private island and had no knowledge of his crimes.\n\nSo has the Republican-led committee that issued the subpoenas just done President Trump a huge favour, drawing the Clintons and the Democrats into the saga?\n\nPossibly not, the same committee is also demanding the release of more Epstein-related documents from the Department of Justice, a reminder that plenty among the MAGA base believe they were promised far more transparency on Epstein from this president.\n\nI’m no stranger to the US beat, having been back and forth several times over the years, often in the summer months. My first impression this time is that the inflation that dominated the election cycle is very real. Prices are high, and so are the stakes for President Trump. He was elected to fix the Biden economy and consumer patience may well be running thin.\n\nIt’s August, but for the Trump White House, there’s no time for silly season. Not in your first year of re-election. Sidebar: Joe Biden’s numbers tanked during the Afghanistan debacle of his first August in power and never recovered.\n\nSo while the Epstein issue has the social media algorithms in overdrive, Trump’s second term will likely be defined by the state of the economy.\n\nTo that end, Donald Trump has just fired a top official because he didn’t like the latest stats on jobs added in the United States. Without evidence, he accused her of faking the stats to make him look bad and inflating them before the election to make Biden-Harris look good. The only problem? Biden’s last jobs numbers before the election were actually worse than Trump’s now.\n\nThis is all pretty revealing about the mindset of President Trump. He knows he won the election with a promise to ‘make America affordable again.’\n\nWhich takes us to tariffs. Another 25% just whacked on India for buying Russian oil. Make that 50% when you take into account hikes he’d already announced for a slew of countries taking effect this week.\n\nThe economic wisdom is that tariffs, which of course are largely paid by US consumers, are inflationary. And yet President Trump is sticking with them.\n\nIt’s a big risk.\n\nKamala Harris was punished for rocketing inflation in the Biden economy. Voters could see it with their own eyes and feel it in their own pockets. But the official numbers told the same story and Biden-Harris paid the price.\n\nAnd who posted those numbers?\n\nOnly the stats chief President Trump just fired.\n\nWatch more here:\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton subpoenaed in widening Epstein probe\nPresident Trump defends sacking of head of US labour stats bureau","summary":"No time for silly season at the Trump White House.","url":"https://www.channel4.com/news/epstein-scandal-looms-over-washington-dc","image":"https://fournews-assets-prod-s3-ew1-nmprod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2025/08/shutterstock_editorial_15428587e-2000x1333.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 17:22:00","author":"Ciaran Jenkins","authors":["Ciaran Jenkins"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.088},{"id":348768422,"title":"South Park hits back after US government uses show's image to promote ICE","text":"South Park has taken aim at the US Department of Homeland Security after the agency used an image from the long-running animated series to promote recruitment for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nOn Tuesday, the official DHS account on X, formerly Twitter, shared a still from a teaser for South Park’s latest season.\n\n The image, which shows ICE officers storming the fictional town of South Park, was accompanied by the caption: “JOIN.ICE.GOV.”\n\nThe show’s official account swiftly fired back, retweeting the post with the caption: “Wait, so we ARE relevant?”—adding the hashtag #eatabagofd***s in a typically unfiltered clapback.\n\nThe response appeared to reference a White House statement released after the season 27 premiere, which sharply criticised President Donald Trump. \n\nAt the time, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers dismissed the show, saying: “This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.”\n\nHowever, the season premiere drew 5.9 million viewers across Comedy Central and Paramount+, making it South Park’s highest-rated premiere since 2022 and its biggest cable share for a season opener since 1999, according to Paramount.\n\nThe controversial episode featured Trump in bed with Satan, who confronts him over persistent rumours his name appears on the infamous “Epstein list.” \n\nIt also lampooned the president’s legal troubles, including a fictional $16 million settlement with Paramount over a dispute involving the editing of an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn a teaser for the upcoming second episode, airing August 6 on Comedy Central, Trump is shown seated beside Satan at a formal dinner.

But Democrats are struggling to win them back.","text":"Latino voters are still waiting for real economic relief. Like most other Americans, they’re dealing with high prices, flat wages and the daily strain of trying to stay afloat. And they are not seeing solutions from either party. President Donald Trump promised to lower costs in his second term, but those promises have yet to materialize. Instead, he has turned to immigration crackdowns, using enforcement that stirs fear in Latino communities. Democrats haven’t filled the gap. Their response has been delayed, cautious or nonexistent. The result is a growing sense of cynicism among the very voters both parties claim they want to reach. That frustration isn’t anecdotal. It showed up clearly in polling about Latinos, Trump and the economy released late last week by Equis and Data for Progress, which surveyed over 1,600 Latino voters nationwide. The results reflect what many in the community have been saying for months, if not years: Latino voters aren’t energized; they’re exasperated with both Republicans and Democrats. And the usual campaign playbook isn’t reaching them. According to the poll’s top lines, only 34% of Latino voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 63% disapprove. That is a net negative of 29 points. Even among those who once viewed Trump as a strong economic leader, cracks are beginning to appear. Nineteen percent said they used to think he was a good businessman, but no longer do. When asked which party they trust more to handle cost-of-living issues, 13% said “neither,” and only 33% said they trust Democrats “much more.” The poll points to a clear conclusion: Latino voters, especially those who don’t feel tied to either party, are not fully aligned with Republicans or Democrats. They are skeptical, disillusioned and tired of promises that never turn into results. “The biggest takeaway from this research is that neither party should assume they have Latinos in their pocket one way or another,” Equis co-founder and CEO Stephanie Valencia told me in response to my written questions about the poll. “We’re seeing a third of Trump voters tell us they aren’t set on voting for a Republican in next year’s midterm elections, but we’re also seeing increased cynicism about both parties among key swing voters. Republicans shouldn’t assume they’ll hold onto all the Latino voters Trump gained in November, and Democrats shouldn’t assume that lower Trump approval will transfer altogether into increased support for them.” This moment didn’t come out of nowhere. According to Pew Research Center’s 2024 validated voter study, Trump pulled nearly even with Kamala Harris among Latino voters in 2024, winning 48% to her 51%. That marked a sharp shift from 2020, when Trump lost the Latino vote 36% to 61% against Joe Biden. The economy was the main driver. As I wrote last year, Trump made his biggest gains by convincing Latinos that he would bring down the cost of living. That faith was already starting to falter by May, as poll after poll showed Trump’s approval with Latinos slipping. This new Equis poll confirms what was already obvious. Among those Latino voters who switched from Biden to Trump, half now disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy. In the Equis poll, Latino voters were clear about what specific economic relief they were seeking. The top priorities were lowering the cost of food and groceries (ranked first by 11%), cutting taxes for the working and middle class (8%), increasing pay and benefits (7%), expanding access to affordable health care (7%), and increasing the number of good-paying jobs (6%). Even as the country watches mass deportations, the dehumanization of migrants, and targeted actions against Latino-majority areas like Los Angeles, immigration may not be the animating issue many assume it is, especially not for Latino swing voters, who, in fact, can make the difference in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 election. It is, and always will be, about the economy. Valencia said these voters didn’t back Trump out of loyalty but because they were desperate for economic relief. “Biden defectors took a chance on Trump, in part, because they were looking for relief from their economic challenges,” she said. “But Trump has yet to deliver on his promises to lower the cost of living, so today, half of Biden defectors disapprove of Trump’s job overall and of his handling of the economy. Democrats will need to offer Latinos a proactive vision for lowering the cost of living and build back their credibility and trust with Latino voters.” What Democrats still don’t seem to understand is that Latino voters are not coming back just because Trump is cruel. As hard as it is to watch what is happening daily and comprehend the damage it has caused throughout Latino communities, immigration raids and hard-line rhetoric won’t magically drive disillusioned voters back into the Democratic column. Many Latino voters still remember when Democrats and President Barack Obama held full control in Washington and failed to deliver immigration reform. Others blame them for failing to act sooner on wages, housing or health care. The idea that Trump’s extremism would be enough to win back these voters was inaccurate in 2024, and it remains so in 2025. Latino voters are still watching, but they are no longer waiting. Some Democrats have convinced themselves that Trump’s support has already peaked with Latinos and it is only decreasing. That would be a premature take, since, as Valencia noted, “the last few elections have proven just how dynamic the Latino electorate is.” If either party wants to earn their support, they’ll have to prove they can deliver. Nothing else will do.","summary":"Latinos who voted for Trump are feeling betrayed on his failure to deliver economic promises.

The man, who was arrested last year, reportedly avoided a prison sentence after entering into a plea agreement.While sharing his blog on X on August 6, Hilton reacted to the news and wrote,\"15 years old is too young to consent! But - Arkansas!!\"According to a report by KGNS News, a man identified as Mason Lee Gipson was reportedly arrested last year following allegations involving a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant. The 23-year-old was initially charged with fourth-degree s*xual assault, a felony. However, on July 17, he pleaded guilty to child endangerment as part of a plea agreement, allowing him to avoid a lengthy prison sentence.Before delving into details about the case, Hilton fumed at the incident and wrote,\"Prepare for your blood to boil. A man in Arkansas admitted to the police that he impregnated an underage girl… and yet he got no jail time! You read that correctly — ZERO JAIL TIME.\"According to the affidavit filed, the accused admitted during the interview with police that he was under the influence of alcohol during the incident. Hilton reported this and added that the incident caused the 15-year-old girl to become pregnant. Hilton questioned the decision and added that it should have been taken \"seriously.\"In his coverage, Perez Hilton further explained the court order and shared that the man was ordered to pay $690 to the girl and ordered to take \"parenting classes\" and \"undergo mental health assessment.\" The blogger was enraged over the judgment and reacted with the following words.\"This man admits to assaulting and impregnating a teenager, but he gets to be free and only pay her less than $700?

Since his death, they have been active in promoting gun safety, and the AI persona has now been developed as part of their ongoing advocacy efforts.As per the blog, Oliver's AI avatar appeared on an interview with Jim Acosta on Tuesday, wherein Joaquin's AI avatar presented a \"solution\" to \"gun violence.\" The AI avatar suggests the \"mix of stronger gun control laws,\" among other measures, to avoid incidents like the 2018 Florida shooting.Perez Hilton also expressed his views on Joaquin Oliver's AI avatar's interview and wrote,\"But, like… This AI version of Joaquin can’t ever actually share his true opinions on gun violence. We’ll never know what Joaquin felt in that terrifying moment — or what he would advocate for in its aftermath.

Claire’s relies on low-cost imports from Asia to sell merchandise to its customers, and tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump have played a key role in the company’s financial distress.\n\nImports from China were one of the main targets of the tariffs Trump announced at his “Liberation Day” event at the White House in April. Despite warnings from economists and other figures that tariffs increase costs and are an economic negative, Trump has stood by the policy.\n\nClaire’s currently has a nearly $500 million loan it is struggling to pay, but tariff costs have made it more difficult for the retailer to generate cash to pay off its obligations.\n\nTrump and his team said that after his tariff announcements he would quickly secure “deals” with countries for new tariff agreements. But thus far, the administration has been unable to secure an agreement with China—replicating his failed attempt at waging a trade war with China in his first term.\n\nRetailers have further been squeezed by the Trump administration’s decision last week to soon suspend the de minimis provision, which previously allowed shipments worth $800 or less to avoid tariffs. Those charges will now be incurred by retailers, which will most likely pass on those costs to consumers. The tariff fees effectively work as a tax hike, affecting middle- and lower-income families.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris warned the country about this possibility during her 2024 presidential campaign, describing Trump’s tariff plans as a “sales tax on the American people.”\n\nMore and more companies filing for bankruptcy protection have been citing tariffs alongside other struggles they are facing.\n\nHome decor chain At Home announced in June that it had filed for bankruptcy. “While we have made significant progress advancing our initiatives to date, we are operating against the backdrop of an increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving trade environment as we navigate the impact of tariffs,” CEO Brad Weston said in a statement.\n\nTariffs are contributing to an economic slowdown. Recent employment data shows that the Trump administration’s tariffs and mass layoffs are having a negative effect. But in response to this concrete economic data, Trump has not reversed course. Instead, he is promoting debunked conspiracy theories about jobs data being manipulated by shadowy forces.\n\nMeanwhile, retailers like Claire’s and the rest of America are stuck with the fallout.","summary":"Tween-focused fashion retailer Claire’s announced on Wednesday that it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the second time it has done so in seven years.

The lawsuit was filed from Elon Musk, his X platform, the Babylon Bee, and video platform Rumble.\n\nPolitico reports that the ruling marks a significant victory for tech billionaire Elon Musk and his social media platform X, which had challenged the California law alongside other plaintiffs, including satirical website The Babylon Bee and conservative social media site Rumble. The decision by U.S. District Judge John Mendez deals a setback to California Governor Gavin Newsom (D), who signed the legislation last year, vowing to take action after Musk, a then-supporter of former President Donald Trump, shared a humorous video of former Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the election.\n\nThe now-invalidated law would have prohibited online platforms from hosting AI-generated content related to an election in the period leading up to the vote. Its passage came amidst growing concerns about the rapid advancement and accessibility of artificial intelligence technologies, which allow everyday users to quickly create realistic images and videos, and the potential impact on the political process. However, opponents like Musk argued that the restrictions could infringe upon freedom of expression.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Mendez cited federal rules shielding online platforms from liability for third-party content, rather than addressing the free speech arguments central to the plaintiffs’ case. The judge determined that the California law, authored by Democratic Assembly member Marc Berman, conflicted with Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act. “They don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to,” Mendez said of sites like X that host parody videos.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported that Judge Mendez issued a preliminary injunction against the California law, calling AI-generated videos “the political cartoons of today:”\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Mendez expressed concerns that the California law was overly broad and subjective in its phrasing, potentially encompassing “vast amounts of political and constitutionally protected speech.” He noted that while concerns over manipulated digital content undermining elections may be valid, it does not give legislators free rein to restrict speech traditionally protected by the First Amendment.\n“While a well-founded fear of a digitally manipulated media landscape may be justified, this fear does not give legislators unbridled license to bulldoze over the longstanding tradition of critique, parody, and satire protected by the First Amendment. YouTube videos, Facebook posts, and X tweets are the newspaper advertisements and political cartoons of today, and the First Amendment protects an individual’s right to speak regardless of the new medium these critiques may take,” Mendez wrote in his decision. He pointed out that other legal avenues, such as privacy, copyright, and defamation laws, already provide recourse for those whose reputations may be harmed by altered depictions online.\n\nMendez also indicated his intention to overrule a second California law, which would require labels on digitally altered campaign materials and ads, on First Amendment grounds. During the hearing, the judge questioned the effectiveness of the labeling requirement, stating, “I think the statute just fails miserably in accomplishing what it would like to do.” He suggested that less restrictive approaches, less likely to chill free speech, might be preferable.\n\nGovernor Newsom’s spokesperson, Tara Gallegos, said the governor’s office was still reviewing the decision but maintained that “commonsense labeling requirements for deepfakes are important to maintain the integrity of our elections.” The California Attorney General’s office and the office of Assembly member Gail Pellerin, the Democrat who authored the second law, did not immediately provide comments.\n\nThe original challenge to the deepfake law was filed by Christopher Kohls, the creator of the controversial Kamala Harris video, on First Amendment grounds. The satirical video had depicted Harris describing herself as the “ultimate diversity hire.” X later joined the case after Musk criticized the measures as being “designed to make computer-generated parody illegal.”\n\nRead more at Politico here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.","summary":"In a win for free speech, a federal judge on Tuesday struck down California's law on AI-generated election parody videos.

Kessler, in a Substack piece, criticized both moves as repelling the Post’s left-wing readership. (RELATED: ‘The View’ Going On ‘Hiatus,’ Joy Behar Says)\n\n Glenn Kessler, the longtime “fact checker” behind the Washington Post’s “Pinocchios,” announced today that he is LEAVING the paper after 27 years. Here is just one example of Kessler’s work 👇 pic.twitter.com/4aQbq4oHuv — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) July 28, 2025 \n\n“[W]hile it would be great to get a more balanced mix of liberal and conservative readers, I didn’t understand how one could attract conservative readers … without alienating existing readers,” Kessler wrote. “The Post opinion pages already had an array of liberal, conservative and libertarian voices, but that’s not the same as the news pages. The Washington Post news division prides itself on accountability journalism, scrutinizing whoever is in power. Then, in October, Bezos killed a planned endorsement of [former Vice President] Kamala Harris in the presidential election.”\n\n“[T]he time to announce a no-endorsement policy was at the start of the election cycle, not weeks before a close election. The Post’s liberal readers viewed it as a move to curry favor with [President Donald] Trump, and 300,000 canceled their subscriptions within days — 12 percent of total digital subscriptions,” he added. “Another 75,000 people canceled when Bezos then announced in February that the opinion page would pivot to defending personal liberties and the free market. Not necessarily conservative but certainly libertarian.”\n\nKessler argued Bezos’ announcement signified a shunning of left-wing editorial writers.\n\n“[I]n terms of building readership, the new editorial policy didn’t make sense. The Post’s liberal columnists generated huge traffic — that’s because of the liberal slant of the readership — and now they’ve all quit,” he wrote. “Every day, I checked the daily traffic numbers and, year over year, it was like being on a waterslide — with no bottom.”\n\nKessler announced on July 28 that he was departing the Post after taking a buyout.\n\nHe faced backlash for some of his checks, notably a June 2024 piece that asserted certain videos of former President Joe Biden’s struggles were “cheap fakes.” He also accused the New York Post and the London Telegraph of following the lead of the Republican National Committee’s (RNC) website in the article.\n\n“The use of these clips is an especially pernicious couple of examples of manipulated video — what we label ‘isolation’ under our guide to manipulated video — because it’s intended to create a false narrative that doesn’t reflect the event as it occurred,” Kessler wrote. “The RNC and its avid followers in the conservative media earn Four Pinocchios.”\n\nThe Post did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Congressman, you've been openly against redrawing the maps in your state from when they just took effect in 2023. You are just one of seven Republicans in 26 total districts in your state. You beat your Democratic opponent in 2024 by 6.4 percent.\n\nIt does look as though there is about to be this redistricting arms race, which seems, at least as of now, prompted by President Trump pushing Texas to take this unusual step to try to offset losses in the midterms. If you had your druthers, would you tell Texas to cut it out?\n\nREP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Well, obviously, the veneer of partisan redistricting is off, and you have states across the country seeking to interject themselves into this fight. Remember, back earlier this year in Wisconsin, there was a Supreme Court race, and the main focus was about whether or not they would engage in redistricting. And ultimately, even though the Democrat candidate won, they chose not to allow for a mid-decade redistricting.\n\nObviously, Texas is proceeding forward. The challenge here, you look at New York. Kathy Hochul has some, you know, chutzpah here. The fact is, she tried to do partisan gerrymandering back in 2022, and the New York State Court of Appeals threw out the map because it violated the state constitution.\n\nI was executive director of the state Republican Party just over a decade ago when, in fact, New Yorkers went to the polls and adopted a constitutional amendment to ban gerrymandering and require an independent redistricting commission. That is the law of the land in New York. It does not allow for mid-decade redistricting.\n\nSo what the Democrats would have to do is pass a new constitutional amendment in two successive state legislatures and then get the voters to adopt it at earliest in 2027 to allow for a mid-decade redistricting. That is not what voters want. It's not what New Yorkers have, you know, voted for when they adopted this constitutional amendment back in 2014.\n\nTAPPER: Right.\n\nLAWLER: And in 2021, rejected an attempt by Democrats to weaken it with a constitutional amendment.\n\nTAPPER: So, if you look at the map, you have some exceptions like Illinois. There's blatant Democratic gerrymandering. But most of the worst offenders when it comes to gerrymandering are Republican states such as Texas. And what's going on here is President Trump is worried about what happens with almost every President, midterm election losses in the House. And to offset that, he looks at Texas and says, ‘oh, we can gerrymandering -- we can gerrymander five Republican seats there in the middle of the decade.’\n\nMy question for you is, I get that you don't like, and personally, I'm against gerrymandering all over the place. I don't like it in New York. I don't like it in Texas. I don't like it in California, et cetera. But like, what's going on now is there's about to be an eruption of this because not only are California and New York, Democratic states, threatening to do it. Trump is trying to push Missouri and Ohio as next states, Republican states, to try to squeeze out a few more Republican seats.\n\nWouldn't you like it all to stop? Wouldn't you -- I mean, what's your message to President Trump or the White House, party leaders about let's just stop it right now and stop it in Texas, stop it in New York, stop it in California, et cetera?\n\nLAWLER: Well, let's be clear. This has obviously been happening for decades. It's why in last November's elections, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less. As you pointed out, I won by 6.4 percent. And yet I'm a district that Kamala Harris won, one of only three Republicans to represent a district Harris won. So the problem is across the country, gerrymandering has been happening after each successive census and it has created less competitive districts.\n\nTAPPER: Right.\n\nLAWLER: And so there's very little room in terms of trying to pick up seats. And so, yes, I think it's wrong what Texas is doing. I don't support it. I think it is wrong what has happened in Illinois or New Jersey, for instance, which has a quote-unquote \"independent redistricting commission\" where the tie-breaking vote made this declarative statement: ‘Republicans got to draw the map last time. So I'm going to give it to the Democrats,’ even though it meant resulting in three Republicans getting elected.\n\nWe have to actually have neutral districts across this country. It would serve the country better. I am going to be introducing legislation to outright ban gerrymandering, let alone during mid- decade redistricting, but to not allow it at all. This is fundamentally why Congress is broken. You do not have competitive districts. And so most members are focused on primaries –\n\nTAPPER: Right.\n\nLAWLER: -- and not actually engaging in a general election.\n\nTAPPER: All right. New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler, come back when you introduce that legislation. We'd love to have you on.\n\nLAWLER: Will do.","summary":"Now that his book tour was over, CNN’s Jake Tapper was back to hauling water for the Democrats.

Harris announced the release of her upcoming book \"107 Days,\" documenting her short-lived presidential run, just a week after Biden reportedly signed a $10 million deal with the Hachette Book Group for his upcoming presidential memoir. While speaking on 2Way’s \"The Morning Meeting\" with Sean Spicer and Dan Turrentine, Halperin dismissed the notion that they discussed these books with each other, adding that the Biden team is ready to push back if they feel threatened.

First, because after years of getting our heads around the seemingly random selection of numbers and letters that comprise Sony's flagship 1000X range (over-ears start with a 'WH-' and end with 'M4, M5 or M6'; earbuds start with 'WF-' and end in the same way, except we're only up to 'M5' there) I think we've all finally cracked it. And we don't want you to simplify the naming of the best Sony headphones now, thank you very much.\nWhat was my second reason? I find it impossible to say the word 'Collexion' without affecting a problematic French accent like something from the well-known and very much of its time 1980s British comedy 'Allo 'Allo! – and if you need a third, the non-word 'Collexion' also reminds me of young persons' advice centers called Connexions in the UK (although admittedly these closed in 2012).\n\nYou may like\n\nSony WH-1000XM6 headphones are official – here are the 3 things you need to know, and yes, the design is more portable\n\n3 reasons I'd buy the Sony WH-1000XM6 and 3 reasons I wouldn't, based on my real-world testing\n\n4 reasons why we still rate the Sony WH-1000XM4 as the best headphones for most people 5 years after they launched – and there's 1 in particular\n\nBut Sony's gone and done it. As of late June, in both Canada and Japan, the trademark name '1000X The Collexion' officially exists for Sony. And despite any nagging inkling that this was a brainstorming session everyone should have slept on before making any big decisions, we all know about it now, thanks to The Walkman Blog.\n\nI shouldn't make this just about Sony. No, there are plenty of headphones and earbuds monikers out there that make me feel as if I'm writing out a WiFi password every time I name-check them – see the Technics EAH-AZ100, the Denon AH-C840NCW, the Panasonic RP-TCM225 and the Audio-Technica ATH-SQ1TW (all earbuds) for starters – why yes, your migraine will be with you presently. Now, imagine discussing which products should go into our respective earbuds buying guides, and welcome to my life…\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n1000X the Collexion: it's not just earbuds and headphones \nIs Sony perhaps just seeking to avoid WH-1000XM4 versus WH-1000XM5 versus WH-1000XM6 confusion here? It's a valid point – although do check out our explainer on the three models too – since the newest XM6 still can't seem to topple the twice-superseded XM4s off their perch as our recommended buy for most people.\nOr maybe the Sony WF-1000XM5 have been ordered one too many times in error, by buyers looking for over-ears who ultimately received in-ears?

The listing reads: \"Headphones; earphones; portable audio players; radios; loudspeakers; amplifiers; television receivers; telecommunication machines and apparatus\".\nThe keen-eyed will note the inclusion of portable audio players there – and here's an idea I can get behind. The original Sony Walkman arrived the same year I did (I'm not telling you the precise year), and it holds a special place in my heart. A 1000X Walkman may well work for me.\nCast your minds back to Sony's April 2024 release ULT range (billed as the bass-response option), including the ULT Wear headphones, several ULT Field Bluetooth speakers, and an ULT Tower bigger speaker beast. Those names were all trademarked ahead of the ULT brand release, so it's highly possible a full lineup of audio products is in the cards.\nOf course, Sony might (just might) be planning some sort of special edition boxed set of 1000X The Collexion headphones and/or earbuds, as it seeks to finally consign the five-year-old WH-1000XM4 to the big gig in the sky – because the excellent WF-1000XM4 have already gone that way.

We have a consolidating dictatorship in our country.\"\n\nRACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: You can narrow or widen the aperture as much as you want. You can look at the very big picture or the small local picture anywhere in the country. And we try to do as much of both of those things as we can every week here on this show.\n\nBut whether you're looking at small-scale local stories or the biggest picture stories about what's happening in our country, the story is the same, and it is now an undeniable thing. We have crossed a line. We are in a place we did not want to be, but we are there.\n\nThe thing we were all warning about for the last few years is not coming. It is here. We are in it.\n\nThis is what it likes, it turns out. This is what it's like, right? I mean, it's August.\n\nIt's a Monday. Every day the sun rises and the sun sets. And there are, you know, sports and movies, and there are new hit songs.\n\nThere are scandals here and there. There are crimes. There's everybody's personal quotient of family drama and health worries and money worries and falling in and out of love and in and out of faith.\n\nLife has not stopped, and none of our personal lives have stopped. But also, at the same time, life in the United States is profoundly changing, is profoundly different than it was even six months ago. Because we do now live in a country that has an authoritarian leader in charge.\n\nWe have a consolidating dictatorship in our country. And it sounds melodramatic to say it. I know.\n\nBut just go with that for a minute, right? Think in melodramatic terms. Think in cinematic terms.\n\nImagine the cartoon-level caricature of what you think a dictatorship looks like. I mean, it's secret police, right? A massive, anonymous, unbadged, literally masked, totally unaccountable internal police force that apparently has infinite funding but no identifiable leadership.\n\nAnd they act in ways designed to instill maximum fear and use maximum force. I mean, when you imagine an authoritarian country, right, what you imagine is masked secret police breaking people's car windows and snatching people off the streets and out of church parking lots and courtroom hallways and taking them away with no charges, no notice, no paperwork, no explanation. Not letting them see lawyers.\n\nAnd then moving them secretly to what are effectively black-site prisons where they won't tell you who's there and where no one's allowed in to see what's going on. And that kind of a cartoon caricature of an authoritarian country. The one you might have imagined.\n\nIn melodramatic and cinematic terms ever before we got here, you would expect, right, that you'd have a scapegoated minority group blamed for all things. In our case, immigrants. And the new extraordinary powers and shows of force by the secret police, among other things, all these extraordinary powers and shows of force will be framed as necessary to stop this terrible internal enemy.\n\nFrame everything as immigration enforcement. Because for immigration enforcement, not only is all force justified, but maximum force is preferred. And they're trying to make it into a national entertainment to threaten to feed immigrants to alligators in South Florida.\n\nThey're making them eat off dishes on the floor, like they're dogs. \n\n Recommended\n\n \n\n Stephen A.

As Donald Trump moves forward with a $10 billion defamation lawsuit, the conservative media mogul has agreed to reveal private medical updates. For the time being, the move puts Murdoch's deposition on hold.In a bizarre legal twist, 94-year-old media mogul Rupert Murdoch has agreed to provide Donald Trump with regular health updates as part of a court-approved delay in Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit over a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein. The agreement postpones proceedings unless Murdoch's condition worsens or the court denies a pending dismissal motion.Productivity ToolZero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guideBy Metla Sudha SekharFinanceIntroduction to Technical Analysis & Candlestick TheoryBy Dinesh NagpalFinanceFinancial Literacy i e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy CA Rahul GuptaDigital MarketingDigital Marketing Masterclass by Neil PatelBy Neil PatelFinanceTechnical Analysis Demystified- A Complete Guide to TradingBy Kunal PatelProductivity ToolExcel Essentials to Expert: Your Complete GuideBy Study at homeArtificial IntelligenceAI For Business Professionals Batch 2By Ansh MehraThe highly unusual arrangement was disclosed in a joint filing by both parties late Monday night. It temporarily postpones Murdoch's deposition in the case while motions to dismiss the lawsuit are being considered by federal Judge Darrin Gayles in Miami, as per a report by CNBC.ALSO READ: iPhone 17 launch date leaked and here's when the phone will be available in shelvesWhy did Rupert Murdoch agree to share his health updates?Live EventsDonald Trump's legal team had argued that time was of the essence, claiming Murdoch's declining health would prevent him from testifying later. \"Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares,\" stated the paperwork.To avoid an urgent deposition, Murdoch will now make a sworn declaration about his current health and provide regular updates. If there is a \"material change\" in his condition, or if he fails to comply with the agreement, he may be forced to take an expedited deposition, as per a report by CNBC.What is Donald Trump suing Murdoch and the WSJ over?Donald Trump filed the lawsuit last month, alleging that the Wall Street Journal defamed him in a July article claiming he sent Epstein a \"bawdy\" birthday card in 2003. Trump denied writing the card and responded with characteristic bombast, labeling the WSJ a \"useless rag\" and threatening legal action.ALSO READ: iPhone 17 Pro Max leak: Papaya orange color sparks huge debate among Apple fans\"This historic legal action is being brought against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS 'article.'\" Trump stated on Truth Social, naming Murdoch, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson, Dow Jones, and the article's authors as defendants.How does Jeffrey Epstein fit into the legal battle?The defamation suit focuses on Trump's longstanding relationship with the late financier and convicted offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein committed suicide in jail in 2019, while awaiting trial on federal trafficking charges.While Trump has repeatedly distanced himself from Epstein, photos and social media connections between the two have resurfaced over the years. The Justice Department has also recently come under fire for refusing to release Epstein-related investigative files, resulting in increased public scrutiny.ALSO READ: Biden allies threaten Kamala Harris: Talk about Joe’s decline and we’ll expose you with ugly stories What comes next?If Judge Gayles denies the defendants' motion to dismiss, Murdoch will have to appear for a deposition within 30 days. Until then, discovery, the exchange of evidence by both parties, is also on hold.Although the health updates are private, they create an unusual overlap between legal and personal boundaries. Though Murdoch's Fox News has long been a Trump ally, this court-ordered arrangement has thrown the two media behemoths into an awkward legal quagmire with no clear resolution, as per a report by CNBC.

The company also said that this was the show’s biggest share of a cable audience for a season premiere since 1999.\n\nThe episode featured several moments where Trump was in bed with Satan, who confronts the president over rumors that his name appears on the “Epstein list” in reference to documents from the investigation into deceased convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIt also took aim at Trump’s recent lawsuits, including his legal battle with Paramount over the editing of an interview with Kamala Harris, which saw the president receive $16 million in a controversial settlement.\n\nThe teaser for the second episode of the season, slated to air August 6 on Comedy Central, shows Trump seated next to Satan at a formal dinner when he reaches under the table and touches the character’s thigh. Satan then bats his hand away, telling the president to “stop!” while a presenter in the background is heard praising Trump, stating: “We want to honor the president’s courage…”\n\nThe second episode comes as South Park is heading to Paramount+ after the show’s creators struck a $1.5 billion streaming deal. South Park left HBO Max and migrated to Paramount+ as of August 5. \n\nNew episodes will continue to air on Comedy Central before being made available to stream.","summary":"Second episode of latest ‘South Park’ season will air August 6","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/south-park-trump-ice-episode-b2802964.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/06/13/13/Screenshot-2025-08-06-at-9-00-10-AM.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/nGVNNDsW-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-06 13:18:06","author":"Caitlin Hornik","authors":["Caitlin Hornik"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.069},{"id":348681386,"title":"Megyn Kelly’s Beyoncé meltdown has nothing to do with Sydney Sweeney","text":"Nearly all of this summer’s controversies have been mind-numbing in many ways, perhaps none more so than the reactions to American Eagle’s “good jeans” ad featuring Sydney Sweeney. President Donald Trump has since proclaimed Sweeney MAGA’s sweetheart. Megyn Kelly has posted about Sweeney dozens of times, claiming the left is obsessed with her. And now the popular right-wing podcaster is using the outrage to reignite her feud with Beyoncé, which suggests that beneath Kelly’s opportunistic interest in the culture wars lies a deeper personal grievance. \n\n“There has been an insane meltdown this week over Sydney Sweeney’s new American Eagle ad campaign. And I have to tell you, I have a lot to say on this,” Kelly told her podcast audience last week. “We are sick and tired of the nonsense where you are not allowed to ever celebrate someone who is white, blonde and blue-eyed; that we have to walk into a room apologetic for those things. In a way, this ad is the final declaration that we are done doing that s**t.”\n\nKelly, who first garnered a national platform because former Fox News head Roger Ailes considered being “blond” and “blue-eyed” a talent, was curiously singing a different tune about the “Euphoria” actress just a month ago. “Sydney Sweeney’s the new toast of the town out there because she’s got these enormous breasts that everybody’s obsessed with,” Kelly said about the starlet’s rise to stardom. \n\nBeing angry and attacking anything and everything for attention is the whole premise of “The Megyn Kelly Show.” So after spending days obsessing over the left’s so-called outrage, she’s dutifully shifted to overanalyze and critique another ad, revealing that, as critics suggested, the jeans brouhaha provides a safe space to promote white supremacy propaganda. \n\n“This is the opposite of the Sydney Sweeney ad. Quite clearly there is nothing natural about Beyoncé,” Kelly wrote in a post on X. “Everything — from her image to her fame to her success to her look below — is bought and paid for,” she added. “Screams artificial, fake, enhanced, trying too hard.” \n\nFor over a year now, the singer has partnered with Levi’s, appearing in ad campaigns and commercials for the iconic denim brand. The latest ad, released Tuesday, features Beyoncé in a curly blonde bob wearing head-to-toe denim embellished with rhinestones. “Cowboy Carter,” her most recent album, features a song titled “LEVII’S JEANS.” \n\nNeedless to say, Kelly’s diss is completely untethered from reality. Earlier this year, Beyoncé became the first Black woman to win a Grammy for Best Country Album, and “Cowboy Carter” won the coveted Album of the Year prize. Her success seems to have disturbed Kelly. \n\n“All hail Queen Bey, she’s here to rescue country music, which was a perfectly thriving industry long before Beyoncé showed up,” she complained on her show. Beyoncé’s most recent tour, which Billboard has declared the highest-grossing country music tour of all time, features a blurred-out clip of Kelly blasting the former Destiny’s Child star for “sticking her big toe” into country music. \n\nIt’s hard to believe now, but there was once a time when there was a perceptible difference between Megyn Kelly and Ann Coulter. Even though Kelly regularly squandered any chance to be even slightly thoughtful, her schtick on Fox News was “very serious journalist” covering the rise of the New Black Panther Party like it was some ominous threat. She comically lost it over a fictional character — Santa Claus — after Aisha Harris published an article arguing there should be room for a Black St. Nick. Kelly would have none of it. “Jesus was a white man, too. He was a historical figure, that’s a verifiable fact, as is Santa.” \n\nWant more sharp takes on politics?

Kelly hosted her daytime talk show for little more than a year before fumbling the bag by fondly reminiscing over the good ‘ole days of blackface as a cheeky Halloween costume. In 2018, she flopped again with a so-called “hard-hitting” interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHell hath no fury like a woman who tried to go mainstream and ended up humiliated. Kelly’s since gone full bore back to being a firebrand political pundit. She’s morphed from interviewing the women who accused journalist Mark Halperin of inappropriate behavior to hiring him to join her massively popular podcast empire. Meanwhile, she has called CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins a “cold-hearted b***h” and celebrated MSNBC’s firing of Joy Reid, whom she called “the most racist person on television.” Kelly also called former Vice President Kamala Harris “an unqualified political aspirant” because, she baselessly claimed, Harris “actually did sleep her way into and upwards in California politics.” Kelly even had a problem with Harris’ having attended Howard University, a historically Black college. In her 2024 endorsement of Trump, who had demeaned her eight years before, Kelly said, “He will be a protector of women.”\n\nEarlier this year, Kelly — for what must be the first time — tried to promote positivity toward women without directly denigrating anyone else in the process. In a post on X, she offered career advice to women, telling them they could have both a successful career and a fulfilling personal life: “The only thing stopping you? Your decision to settle for less.” Her base told her to shove it, and she did. (GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is currently having the same epiphany, publicly floating that the GOP is anti-women. I expect her transformation to be just as short-lived.) \n\nIt’s always funny when conservative women who aid right-wing men in ushering in autocracy are surprised when those same men don’t want to see them in power. Just because you’re on the bottom of the hit list doesn’t mean you’re not on the list.","summary":"The singer's success seems to have deeply disturbed the right-wing podcaster","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/08/06/megyn-kellys-beyonce-meltdown-has-nothing-to-do-with-sydney-sweeney/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/Megyn-Kelly-2182961650-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 13:05:05","author":"Sophia Tesfaye","authors":["Sophia Tesfaye"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":348689018,"title":"GOP congressman vows 'all options are on the table' to stop US-wide redistricting war","text":"Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., is promising that \"all options are on the table\" to try and stop states from creating a nationwide fight over redistricting congressional maps. \"It creates a lot of instability if you're just constantly shifting the lines on the map around so that, you know, representatives are losing constituents, losing communities, gaining new ones. People elect one person as their representative, and then suddenly that person is representing an entirely different area,\" Kiley told Fox News Digital in an interview Tuesday. \"It's just total chaos. It's not good for representative government. It's not good for constituents. It is not good for Democrats or Republicans.\" The California Republican spoke with Fox News Digital hours after introducing a bill that would block states from shifting the boundaries of their current congressional districts ahead of the 2030 census. BETO O'ROURKE DROPS F-BOMB AS HE URGES DEMS TO 'MEET FIRE WITH FIRE' AGAINST GOP REDISTRICTING PLANS IN TEXAS Texas Republicans are currently mounting a push to redraw the Lone Star state's congressional map. President Donald Trump, who supports the effort, said it would give the GOP as many as five new seats in the House of Representatives. California Democrats have launched their own redistricting bid in response, with Gov. Gavin Newsom signaling he's ready to wield the Democratic supermajority in the state legislature to push a special election for voters to decide on new congressional maps. Several states, both with Republican and Democratic majorities, have since followed suit in threatening their own redistricting efforts. When asked if he thought the issue began with Texas, however, Kiley pointed out that Newsom's bid would require sidelining the state's independent redistricting commission. California is one of eight states that has an independent commission charged with redrawing state maps, according to a chart by Loyola Law School. GOP LAWMAKERS CLASH OVER STRATEGY TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CRISIS \"What Newsom is doing is unique because he is actually trying to abolish an independent commission that currently exists and exercise a power that he doesn't actually have, and to override the will of voters in the process,\" Kiley said. \"That being said, I don't love what's happening in Texas, or I don't like the idea of this happening anywhere else in the country.\" Kiley said he'd already spoken with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., about his bill, but would not discuss the details of their conversation. \"I made it very clear my view on this and what I think he needs to do. And I'm hoping that he'll do the right thing,\" Kiley said. He said at another point, \"This is an issue that affects our Republican conference – and all of this is not popular among Republican members of our conference – but it's also a matter of the House as an institution. And he, as the leader of the House, I think, needs to show some leadership.\" Johnson, for his part, has yet to weigh in on Texas and California, as well as the wider redistricting fight across the country. The Louisiana Republican has been on a congressional delegation trip to Israel for several days while the issue exploded onto the national stage. But when asked if he saw a realistic path to getting his bill passed, Kiley told Fox News Digital, \"I'm ready to use any and all legislative tools available to get the bill to the floor.\" SCHWARZENEGGER PUSHES BACK AGAINST NEWSOM IN REDISTRICTING FIGHT \"The easiest way to do that would be for the speaker to do the right thing and get behind it. But I'm going to fight in every way I can to get it approved, because this is a matter that's of tremendous importance for the country,\" Kiley said. \"It's of particular importance to my state, and I'm not a lot about to let the governor, you know, go down this incredibly destructive road that will do grave damage to democracy in California.\" He did not rule out mechanisms to force a vote on his bill, like a discharge petition or a privileged resolution, if House leaders did not act. \"We need to get this passed. We need to stop Newsom. And we need to bring this chaos to an end,\" Kiley said. Any such action would have to wait until early September at the earliest, however. Congress is currently in its annual August recess, when lawmakers are back in their home districts connecting with constituents. Kiley said he was not \"super concerned about my own seat,\" noting he won re-election by a healthy margin. Indeed, Kiley won re-election in California's 3rd congressional district by double-digits in November 2024 – even outpacing Trump, who won the area by 3% over former Vice President Kamala Harris.

And that's pretty universally true.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Johnson and Newsom's offices for comment but did not immediately hear back.","summary":"Rep.

The two were first spotted out having dinner together at Le Violon in Montreal in late July, with an eyewitness telling TMZ the rumored couple had some drinks and could be seen sharing many dishes together. Just a few days later, photos of Trudeau at Perry's concert at Montreal’s Bell Centre were posted on social media, in which the politician could be seen smiling alongside his 16-year-old daughter, Ella-Grace. In other footage from the concert, Trudeau can be seen singing along to Perry's hit song, \"Dark Horse.\" Rumors of their relationship come following news of Perry's breakup with actor Orlando Bloom. The former couple originally dated for a year from 2016 to 2017, later reconnecting in February 2018. After getting engaged in February 2019, they welcomed their daughter Daisy in August 2020 before ultimately calling off their engagement in June 2025. NEWLY SINGLE KATY PERRY ENJOYS INTIMATE DINNER WITH FORMER CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER DURING WORLD TOUR BREAK Soon after Trudeau and Perry were spotted out together, The Onion shared an Instagram post featuring a fake photo of Bloom and German Chancellor Angela Merkel out to dinner together. \"Just weeks after announcing his split with fiancée Katy Perry, English actor Orlando Bloom was photographed Friday dining with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\" the caption read. \"‘Angela kept Orlando laughing all night—he couldn’t keep his eyes off her!’ said an insider source who spotted the pair sipping wine, slurping oysters, and splitting a decadent piece of chocolate layer cake at a Michelin-starred restaurant.\" The \"Lord of the Rings\" actor seemingly enjoyed the joke, leaving three clapping emojis in the comments section. Perry is not the only star to set her sights on a politician, with some even going on to marry them. Here are some other celebrities who have dated famous politicians. Rosario Dawson and Cory Booker After first connecting in early 2018, sparks flew between actress Rosario Dawson and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., when they reconnected in early 2019. The two were spotted at a meet and greet with the cast of \"Dear Evan Hanson\" on Broadway. Dawson seemingly confirmed their relationship when questioned by TMZ while at the airport in Washington, D.C., in March 2019, when she told reporters, \"He’s a wonderful human being. It’s good to spend some time together when we can.\" The \"Jane the Virgin\" star would go on to support her partner during his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination throughout 2019 and 2020, later attending the inauguration of former President Joe Biden with him in January 2021. After over two years of dating, however, a source close to the couple confirmed in February 2022 that the two had gone their separate ways. Elizabeth Taylor and John Warner Elizabeth Taylor met her sixth husband, John Warner, in 1976 while on a blind date, and the rest is history. The couple went on to get married just five months after their first date, with Taylor telling Larry King in 2001, \"I thought we would get married, live on the farm, raise horses.\" In the end, however, Warner set his sights on the United States Senate, and with Taylor's support, won a seat in the legislative branch in 1979 as the senator for Virginia. The demands of being a public servant would go on to put a strain on their marriage and, after a 14-month separation, they divorced in 1982. FORMER SEN. JOHN WARNER AND ELIZABETH TAYLOR MET ON A BLIND DATE WITH QUEEN ELIZABETH \"He knows he wasn’t the love of my life. And I know I wasn’t the love of his life,\" Taylor told The New York Times in 2002. \"But we loved each other. We got along wonderfully until he decided to be a politician. And then he married the Senate.\" Cheryl Hines and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Cheryl Hines and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first met in 2006 while on a ski trip, but as they were both married to other people at the time, they didn't start dating until late 2011, later confirming their relationship in 2012. They went on to get engaged in April 2014 and tied the knot later that year in August. Although the couple spent years keeping their relationship private, the two were thrust into the spotlight when RFK Jr. announced in April 2023 that he would be running for president. Hines stood by his side during his campaign for the presidency and again later during his confirmation hearings prior to his appointment as the United States secretary of Health and Human Services. Sheryl Lee Ralph and Vincent Hughes Sheryl Lee Ralph and her husband Vincent Hughes first met in the early 2000s and went on to tie the knot in 2005. Hughes has held his position as a Pennsylvania state senator since 1994, and due to both his and Ralph's demanding work schedules, they haven't lived in the same city throughout their marriage. \"First of all, 20 years, keeping this marriage together, you have to be together sometime,\" she told the Philadelphia Inquirer in February 2023. \"Vincent is not able to leave the state the way I can leave the state. In fact, in 20 years of our being together, I'm going to say my husband has maybe been in California, maybe, 25 times. That means I'm in Philadelphia every two weeks.\" Montel Williams and Kamala Harris Montel Williams' past relationship with former Vice President Kamala Harris was brought to light in 2019, when photos of the two of them surfaced on social media and rumors about her dating history were perpetuated on X during her bid for the 2020 presidential nomination. \"@KamalaHarris and I briefly dated about 20 years ago when we were both single. So what?\" Williams posted in 2019 in defense of Harris during the 2019 Democratic primary. \"I have great respect for Sen. Harris. I have to wonder if the same stories about her dating history would have been written if she were a male candidate?\" Since breaking things off with Williams, she married Doug Emhoff in 2014. Barbra Streisand and Pierre Trudeau In her memoir, \"My Name is Barbra,\" singer Barbra Streisand went into detail about her relationship with former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, whom she met in 1968 at the premiere of her movie, \"Funny Girl.\" She recalled telling her friend, \"That's the kind of man I would like to date.\" Pierre is the father of Justin Trudeau. \"He was so elegant, yet totally unpretentious and perpetually curious ... an adventurer who had backpacked through the Middle East and Asia as a young man,\" Streisand wrote in her book. \"And he had real charisma, generating so much excitement before and after his election that the Canadian press gave it a name ... Trudeaumania.\" The two ultimately dated for one year, with Streisand writing, \"My brain was in love, but not my body.\" They remained great friends until his death in 2000, writing in her book, \"the world lost a great leader ... and I lost a great friend.\" LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Given the competition, why not?","text":"Now, before you pooh-pooh the idea of a fake anchor of a fake news show on Comedy Central being the new leader of the Blue Team, think about the precedent and the weakness of his competition.\n\nFirst, the precedent:\n\nRonald Reagan won his party’s nomination in 1980 and the presidency in a landslide.\n\nClint Eastwood was once elected mayor of Carmel, California.\n\nFred Grandy, who played a guy named Gopher on The Love Boat, won two different House races in Iowa.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, a former comedian and actor, won Ukraine’s presidency in 2019, also in a landslide.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger won two gubernatorial elections in the blue state of California as a Republican.\n\nActor Fred Thompson won a Senate seat in Tennessee and even ran for president in 2008.\n\nActor and comedian Al Franken won a Senate seat in Minnesota and probably would have run for president in 2020 if not for sexual harassment allegations.\n\nWe could go on, but you get the point. It’s not so far-fetched for Stewart to capture the Democratic nomination, especially given the most recent precedent of President Donald Trump’s jump from The Apprentice to the presidency.\n\nAnd then there’s what could be the former Daily Show host’s competition for the nomination. Does anyone really think there’s one candidate out there on the Left that can generate more free media than Stewart in the same manner Trump did in 2015-2016 against 17 others in easily cruising to the GOP nomination?\n\nRhetorical question.\n\nLook who the likely contenders will be: \n\nA) Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who supports open borders and a path to citizenship for all those entering the country illegally. She also staunchly opposes funding for Israel’s Iron Dome, which has saved countless lives. And on spending, she wants to commit trillions of taxpayer dollars to tackle climate change.\n\nB) Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who presides over a state with the highest taxes in the country, almost completely shut down his state over COVID-19 for years while breaking his own rules time and again, and totally botched preparation and response to California wildfires earlier this year. Even his own residents don’t want him to run: A recent Emerson College/Inside California Politics poll found that 59% said they don’t think Newsom should run in 2028.\n\nC) Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has never received one vote in a primary despite running for president twice. She lost the last election decisively to Trump, has basic communication skill problems when speaking outside of a teleprompter, and is forever tethered to the Biden administration, arguably the worst of our lifetimes.\n\nD) Pete Buttigieg, a failed mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and an even bigger failure as former President Joe Biden’s transportation secretary. He once took paternity leave for two months during a supply chain crisis without telling anyone. He recently grew a beard to appear tougher and more manly. He also launched a $1 billion pilot program to “build racial equity in roads.” He comes across as if he were programmed by ChatGPT.\n\nE) Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), a Fred Flintstone doppelganger. Similar to Newsom, he is presiding over a blue state that is seeing such a mass exodus due to high crime and taxes that it will likely lose electoral votes after the 2030 census. Similar to Ocasio-Cortez, he supports mass amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nF) Gov. Andy Beshear (D-KY): If watching paint dry is your thing, Beshear is just the candidate for you. Seen as a relative centrist, being a Democratic governor of a red state. And centrists simply do not get the same media attention that an Ocasio-Cortez or Stewart would receive.\n\nG) Rahm Emanuel, who left Chicago as mayor with an 18% approval rating. He’s also seen as a relative centrist.\n\nThere may be a few others — Govs. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), Josh Shapiro (D-PA), Wes Moore (D-PA) — but this isn’t exactly the 1927 Yankees. Also, Stewart has shown an ability to effectively debate, most notably in his pointed exchange with Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala, which pretty much led to the end of CNN’s Crossfire more than 20 years ago.\n\nStewart isn’t necessarily seen as a Hollywood elitist. The 62-year-old got passionately involved in hounding Congress to pass legislation as it pertains to providing millions to first responders with possibly fatal or debilitating health issues after 9/11. And he didn’t just throw a check at a charity or record a PSA and call it a day — he literally went to Capitol Hill and brought a ton of media attention with him.\n\nDuring one hearing in 2019, Stewart was met with some empty seats while speaking to the House Judiciary Committee after some representatives decided not to show up.\n\n“It’s an embarrassment to the country,” Stewart said. “And you should be ashamed of yourselves.”\n\nThe clip went viral. The full House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to advance the bill, which eventually passed overwhelmingly.\n\nStewart has also been very active in supporting veterans exposed to toxins, having played a key role in getting the PACT Act passed. “I’m not sure I’ve ever seen this situation where people who have already given so much had to fight so hard to get so little,” Stewart said. “I hope we learned a lesson.”\n\nThe Democratic Party is completely in the toilet right now, clocking in at 19% approval in Quinnipiac University’s latest survey. One of the primary reasons is trust: How could anyone have faith in a party that has had fixed presidential primaries for the last three elections?\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton was crowned the nominee, with WikiLeaks emails showing the DNC did everything in its power to ensure a surging Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) didn’t sniff the nomination. In 2020, Biden finished fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire before his competition was convinced to drop out of the race ahead of Super Tuesday because the powers that be saw him as someone who could be sold as a centrist compared to the other candidates, including Buttigieg, Sanders, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). And in 2024, Biden was shoved aside after flopping in his debate against Trump, again by party powers, and Harris was installed without any input from the public.\n\nWhile we’re on the trust question, how could voters trust Democrats after the lockdowns and school closings they advocated so passionately for during COVID-19? And how could voters ever trust this party again after the attempted cover-up of Biden’s failing cognitive health, arguably one of the biggest political scandals in history?\n\nFor Stewart’s part, agree or disagree with him, he has an authenticity gene that others, most notably Newsom, Buttigieg, Ocasio-Cortez, and Harris, lack. He also obviously has great comedic timing, which plays well to a press that isn’t interested in doing deep dives in tax or foreign policy, and instead goes for the easy, cheap zinger every time — see the media rise of Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) as an example.\n\nNote: Nobody is saying Stewart will be the 48th president of the United States. While his record of supporting first responders and veterans is admirable, it’s as clear as mud where he stands on China, Israel, or trade policy. He’s been a vocal opponent of Trump’s border wall. He’s never run a business or been an executive of anything, unlike Trump.\n\nBut that may not matter in today’s political environment. Establishment candidates are almost seen as toxic. Voters continue to yearn for candor and sharp elbows.\n\nJon Stewart, your 2028 Democratic nominee?\n\nIt’s not as far-fetched as it first sounded.","summary":"The final delegates put the next Democratic nominee for president over the top to clinch the nomination.

The FCC approved a long-planned, $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media last month which will soon place CBS News under new ownership. The deal, which is set to close Thursday, will see Skydance CEO David Ellison take control of the Tiffany Network and its struggling news division. Industry insiders believe Ellison, who was spotted sitting with President Donald Trump at a UFC event in April, will aim to eliminate the perceived liberal slant at CBS News. Ellison’s team has already committed to appointing an ombudsman to oversee CBS News content, and staffers are bracing for other changes as Skydance honchos put their stamp on the network. CBS STAFFERS SPECULATE ON GAYLE KING'S FUTURE AS NETWORK BOSSES PUSH 'EDITORIAL SHIFT' ON STRUGGLING AM SHOW This has put a spotlight on King’s \"CBS Mornings,\" which has never seriously challenged NBC’s \"Today\" or ABC’s \"Good Morning America\" for any substantial length of time, instead settling for a perennial third-place finish among all relevant viewership measurables. \"CBS Mornings,\" co-anchored by King, Tony Dokoupil and Nate Burleson, averaged 1.8 million total viewers during July, compared to 2.7 million for \"GMA\" and 2.4 million for \"Today.\" While third place is nothing new for CBS’ morning show, the program is also steadily losing viewers. \"CBS Mornings\" averaged 1.9 million viewers in 2025 through July 27, shedding 10% of the 2.2 million it averaged during the same time period in 2024. The ratings drop is even worse among the advertiser-coveted demographic of adults aged 25-54, as \"CBS Mornings\" has averaged 332,000 demo viewers in 2025—a loss of a quarter of the 441,000 it managed in 2024. NBC’s \"Today\" and ABC’s \"Good Morning America\" have also lost viewers compared to the first seven months of 2024, but the declines are not as severe as the drop-off at CBS. CBS HOST GAYLE KING INSISTS DEI MEANS ‘DEFINITELY EARNED IT’ \"CBS Mornings\" has also lost 6% of total viewers and 18% in the demo when comparing its average audience since Election Day 2024 to the period before President Trump’s victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris. King, who has long been the subject of often-unflattering tabloid fodder, has not helped \"CBS Mornings\" increase its audience despite the free publicity she generates by hobnobbing with A-listers. King is regularly on red carpets and often posts photos at lavish events. The high-paid anchor was photographed alongside Oprah Winfrey and Kris Jenner lounging on a yacht off the coast of Spain in July after attending Jeff Bezos’ $50 million wedding. In April, King drew criticism when she was part of an all-female crew for a 10-minute Blue Origin space flight. Some complained about the environmental impact, and others questioned if the brief flight was a worthwhile use of resources. The Blue Origin space flight gave \"CBS Mornings\" a brief bump, but the program has since lost 5% of its 2025 total viewers and 17% of demo viewers since the day King went to space. The ownership change has led to industry chatter that changes are inevitable, with much speculation around King and whether incoming executives will keep her around when her contract expires—reportedly in May 2026. \"Gayle is the only CBS News employee making eight figures, and she’s gotten anything she wants for years, including choosing her executive producer [Shawna Thomas] and doing alienating coverage out of touch with the CBS viewer,\" a longtime network morning show producer told Fox News Digital. \"Now that the numbers are slipping badly, Gayle has lost a lot of her leverage,\" they continued. \"Combine that with her embarrassing space flight and her tasteless swanning around on David Geffen’s yacht last month with Kris Jenner, and she’s due for a big pay cut and a comeuppance.\" King has also been a champion of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), which is something Ellison’s team has promised to dismantle at CBS. She also sparked backlash for taking a 2017 vacation with the Obamas while she worked on a show that covered politics. At the time, King insisted her trip to Tahiti alongside the former president was not political, but her cozy relationship with the former First Family helped tarnish the reputation of CBS News—something incoming management is believed to want to distance itself from. GAYLE KING DISAPPOINTED BY BACKLASH TO BLUE ORIGIN FLIGHT, ACCUSES CRITICS OF SEXISM A CBS News staffer recently told Fox News Digital that King is \"insulated by her team,\" which includes Thomas. However, an \"editorial shift\" is being pushed by CBS News president and executive editor Tom Cibrowski and his No. 2, Wendy Fisher, the network's senior vice president of editorial. \"They’re changing story selection and tweaking the show some,\" the CBS staffer said. \"I know Tom has been involved in the show heavily though,\" they continued. \"He wants us to focus on stories outside of major cities and in the middle of the country. Stories that affect real people and that they’re talking about at home.\" The staffer believes the changes Cibrowski has implemented over the past couple of months are him \"putting his mark on the division\" and have nothing to do with the parent company Paramount's settlement with Trump or the Paramount-Skydance merger. In September, \"CBS Mornings\" will ditch its studio in Times Square and return to CBS Broadcast Center on 57th Street in New York City. It remains to be seen what other changes are on the horizon once Skydance executives begin to put their mark on the division. CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If all of Trump’s current tariffs remain in place, they will yield $2.2 trillion of revenue over the coming decade, according to the Yale Budget Lab.\nIn other words, Trump has effectively enacted the largest tax hike in modern US history — without Congress ever taking a vote.\nShould the Supreme Court uphold these actions, they could transform America’s approach to fiscal policy. If sweeping taxes on foreign imports do not require congressional approval — while all other forms of taxation do — the US is liable to lean on the former. \nFurther, low taxes and growing spending on Medicare and Social Security are poised to swell US deficits over the coming decade. Faced with growing pressure to generate new revenues, future presidents may be reluctant to dig an even deeper hole by repealing Trump’s tariffs. \nNone of this means that Trump’s trade agenda is certain to survive. But for a policy that is both politically unpopular and economically unsound, it could prove difficult to dislodge. \nThe US is increasingly desperate for revenue – and Congress is increasingly averse to raising taxes\nThere is a fundamental tension at the heart of American fiscal policy: Our government’s need for revenue is rising, while Congress’s appetite for taxation is declining. \nAs the US population ages, providing public pensions and health insurance to older Americans has become more expensive. But instead of increasing taxes to account for this fact, Congress has enacted multiple sweeping tax cuts since 2000. \nOf course, this was primarily the work of Republicans: Under Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump, the GOP slashed taxes, to the disproportionate benefit of the wealthy. \nYet once Republicans lowered the bar for tax rates, Democrats repeatedly refused to raise it back to its previous level. In 2013, President Barack Obama made Bush’s income tax cuts permanent for households earning below $400,000 (which effectively preserved 82 percent of the Bush tax cuts). Under President Joe Biden, meanwhile, Democrats left the bulk of Trump’s first-term tax cuts in place. (Those rate reductions had been set to expire this year, but Kamala Harris vowed to extend them for Americans earning less than $400,000. So even if Democrats had won last November, much of the Trump tax cuts would have survived.)\nAs a result of all this, federal spending as a percentage of the economy has risen sharply since 2000, while tax revenues have fallen.\n[Image: https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/fredgraph-4_220b5a.png?quality=90&strip=all]\nDeficits are therefore poised to swell in the coming decades, as the Government Accountability Office illustrated earlier this year, in a chart that does not even account for the impact of Trump’s newly passed tax cut bill:\n[Image: https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-04-at-3.43.52%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all]\nIn the wake of that tax cut, Democrats have once again acquiesced to the newly established, lower rates for non-wealthy taxpayers. For example, although Trump’s decision to eliminate taxation on tips has no sound economic rationale, congressional Democrats have largely embraced it.\nThe United States is an economic superpower, which prints the world’s reserve currency. We have therefore been able to run large deficits for decades without incurring much tangible economic cost. But that started to change a bit post-Covid, as large deficits helped fuel higher interest rates for both the US government and borrowing public. \nAnd pressure to increase revenue will likely become even more acute by 2035, when Social Security’s trust fund will be exhausted, according to government projections. At that point, funding Social Security benefits at current levels will require an additional $414.5 billion a year. \nMaintaining Trump’s tariffs wouldn’t be sufficient to solve America’s fiscal challenges. But repealing them would exacerbate those difficulties. Confronted by increasingly burdensome deficits — and a Congress terrified of authorizing substantial tax increases — the next Democratic president may feel that retaining a substantial share of Trump’s tariffs are the best of their bad options.\nHow Democrats, Republicans, and special interests could conspire to preserve Trump’s tariffs\nThis scenario is especially plausible if Democrats secure full control of the government. A Democratic trifecta would likely be eager to enact new social spending. And it would be difficult for a president to pursue that aim while unilaterally slashing revenue through tariff relief.\nThis is not to say that Democrats are likely to preserve all of Trump’s tariffs. Those most antithetical to rational diplomacy — such as heavy levies on Canada — seem destined for repeal. Likewise, a Democrat would surely lift Trump’s zanier sectoral tariffs, such as his proposed 250 percent duty on pharmaceuticals (assuming that ever takes effect). But his universal, baseline tariff could plausibly survive, if perhaps at a lower rate. \nIn any case, it is conceivable that future Republican presidents might even build on Trump’s tariffs. The conservative movement would prefer to answer rising deficits with spending cuts. But they’ve perennially struggled to find enough legislatively viable cuts to offset their desired income tax reductions (let alone actually reduce the overall deficit). \nIf Republicans find themselves politically incapable of slashing Medicare and Social Security, then further raising taxes on foreign imports may be an appealing backup plan. Conservatives have long favored taxing consumption over labor income or capital gains. And tariffs are a consumption tax, albeit an inefficient one that’s draped in jingoistic garb.\nFinally, special interest lobbying could also reinforce Trump’s protectionist regime, under a Republican or Democratic president. \nAny individual tariff tends to have concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, which can make them politically resilient. For example, America has long imposed tariffs on foreign sugar, a policy that aids domestic sugar producers at the expense of consumers. But the cost to each individual consumer is tiny, so sweet-toothed Americans lack sufficient incentive to form a movement for cheaper pastries. By contrast, the benefits of the tariffs to America’s sugar industry are large, which leads it to lobby aggressively for their preservation. As a result, the path of least resistance for elected officials is to keep the sugar duties in place.\nThis same dynamic applies to many of Trump’s tariffs. US exporters would be better off if all of Trump’s tariffs were lifted, as those trade restrictions increase their costs of production while slowing economic growth. But many would likely benefit from preserving trade protection for their specific industry. So interest group politics could fortify Trump’s trade protectionist regime. \nHow free trade could still make a comeback\nAll this said, it isn’t hard to envision a world where Trump’s tariffs largely expire with his presidency (if not before). \nFor one thing, the Supreme Court may well deem much of Trump’s trade agenda unlawful. Most of Trump’s tariffs are premised on a dubious interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which empowers the president to levy duties in response to “unusual and extraordinary” threats amid national emergencies. In the administration’s view, this law authorizes them to impose tariffs on more or less any nation, since America’s trade deficit constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. Suffice to say, that is not an opinion shared by many legal scholars or economists. \nOne court has already ruled Trump’s use of the IEEPA illegal, and the case is now before the federal appeals court.\nWere the Supreme Court to strike down Trump’s use of the IEEPA, he could attempt to reimplement his tariffs under different presidential authorities. But those other mechanisms come with more bureaucratic red tape, which is why Trump has leaned so heavily on emergency powers.\nFurther, even if the judiciary leaves Trump’s tariff regime intact, economic developments could erode its political standing. \nThere are signs that the president’s trade policies are undermining growth and elevating prices. Last month, inflation ticked up while hiring slowed — and both job losses and price increases were concentrated in trade-sensitive sectors. Given that many of Trump’s largest tariffs have yet to take effect, it’s reasonable to worry that the costs of his trade agenda will continue to mount. \nAlready, that agenda is incredibly unpopular. In a recent Fox News survey, Americans disapproved of Trump’s tariff policies by a 26-percentage-point margin, while just 36 percent approve of his handling of trade in Gallup’s polling. If America tips into a recession during Trump’s term, these numbers are liable to get even worse. In that scenario, it is difficult to imagine that the Democratic Party’s 2028 nominee would not campaign on a promise to reverse most of Trump’s trade agenda. \nIronically, Trump’s tariffs might be most vulnerable to repeal in a world where Democrats win the White House in 2028, but not full control of Congress. Under those conditions, a Democratic president would face less pressure to generate new revenue, since they would be incapable of enacting ambitious new social programs. Unable to pass partisan legislation, such a Democrat might see lifting tariffs as one of their few tools for both symbolically rebuking Trump’s legacy and materially delivering for voters.\nSeparately, if this hypothetical future president were concerned with repairing American global prestige and influence, they might view relaxing tariffs on US allies as an imperative. \nPolitical cowardice could sustain Trump’s trade regime\nThe future trajectory of American trade policy is therefore unknowable. What seems clear is that Trump’s tariffs have a better chance of enduring than they rightfully should. \nThe president’s protectionist agenda is a political and substantive disaster. But it also represents a means of massively increasing revenue without anyone in Congress needing to vote for a tax hike. \nIn an ideal world, the US government would not embrace an economically and geopolitically destructive approach to funding itself, just so its elected representatives could dodge the responsibilities of governance. In our decidedly suboptimal universe, this scenario can’t be ruled out.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s tariffs are slowing economic growth, raising prices, undermining American manufacturing, marginalizing the US geopolitically, and attracting widespread public opposition.

TikTok is a stand-in for a bigger phenomenon in modern American society: passive news consumption and incidental exposure, or the sense that news and information find their way to people.\nAs opposed to active news consumers — who are seeking out information, want to keep up with current events, and are more engaged with politics — passive news consumers encounter things in passing while scanning headlines on social media apps and video feeds or see and hear current events discussed by influencers on TikTok or their weekly podcasts. Politics might not be central to their lives. They might not be frequent voters. And so, they don’t go out of their way to keep up with the latest developments.\nI’ve been thinking about this active versus passive distinction a lot recently, because I think it describes a lot of what is happening with Gen Z. This cohort of voters has been particularly confounding as of late. They are a lot more Republican than young voters of the past generation, even though plenty of evidence suggested they’d be the most progressive generation yet. Gen Z turned out in high numbers last year and shifted hard toward the GOP (though a slight majority did still support Democrats). Although there are signs this turn is slowing down, it doesn’t seem to be benefiting Democrats just yet.\nOf course, no group of voters is monolithic, and no single reason can explain this evolution among voters ages 18 to 29. But I think there’s an overlooked, under-the-radar divide that could add some nuance to our understanding of Gen Z, why they are giving Democrats more trouble, and why they might continue to surprise both political parties.\nAfter tuning into focus groups of young Americans conducted by the Democratic research project Navigator and taking a look at accompanying survey data by the Democratic polling firm Global Strategy Group over the last six months, it is clear that the active versus passive information divide is becoming a big split among the youngest cohort of Americans. This divide might explain why Democrats misjudged their level of support among young voters and why Republicans will face trouble with them in coming cycles.\nYoung Americans are disproportionately passive news consumers\nEven as alternative media consumption grows, algorithmically powered feeds take root, and the primacy of mainstream media continues to decline, Americans generally tend to belong more to the “active” news consumption category than the “passive” one. According to Navigator’s research, some six in 10 eligible voters fall into the active category, while four in 10 belong to the passive one.\nThose trends hold for all age cohorts except for one: voters under 30. Some 58 percent of young voters say “news comes to me.” It’s an anomaly. Majorities of other generations, including millennials and Gen X, say that they “seek out news,” while younger voters are more likely to consider themselves passive consumers of information.\n[Media: https://www.datawrapper.de/_/MusQz/]\nThere are other curious cross sections in this polling. Younger, passive news consumers tend to rely on social media websites — like Facebook, X, and YouTube — much more than broadcast television for their knowledge and awareness of politics when compared to young active consumers. The young passive group tends to prefer TikTok and Snapchat, while the active group prefers X. And more generally for passive news consumers, they tend to be non-voters or presidential-election-only voters for whom politics is really not important to their identities. Only about one in three would say politics is central to their lives.\nPut all these trends together, and you start to see a picture of a young voter cohort dramatically divided by how informed and engaged in politics they are. There are those who care deeply about politics, have strong ties to either the Democrats or the GOP, tend to vote in most elections, and actively seek out news and information. They happen to be a minority in Gen Z.\nAnd then, you have those who don’t care for politics, call themselves political independents and moderates, tend not to vote, and get informed passively. They are the emerging silent majority.\nAsk them, and both might say they are “well-informed.” As the Navigator researchers put it in their recent report, “no one is ‘low information’” anymore; they exist in radically different environments and are hearing very different versions of reality. \nPassive news consumers helped Donald Trump and Republicans last year; Kamala Harris and Democrats had an edge with young, engaged, and active news consumers — but they weren’t enough to outweigh the effect of passive, less engaged youth.\nThis is a familiar problem for Democrats. In midterm, off-year, and special elections, Democrats tend to be helped by having an electorate more populated with frequent and better-educated voters than in presidential cycles. You can now add a new dimension to this phenomenon: their form of news consumption.\nThis emerging divide is just starting to be seen\nThe information gap isn’t going away. Gen Z and millennials will be the largest eligible voting age groups of the electorate in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. \nThe Gen Z focus groups, with both college and non-college educated young men and women, show this divide in sharp focus. The college-educated group skewed Democratic, many of its participants tended to talk about politics as being more central to their lives, and they referred to themselves as cautious but active news consumers. Many referred to mainstream and legacy news sources to fact-check claims they hear and as primary sources of news they can trust.\nThe other groups of non-college educated young men and women were made up disproportionately of passive news consumers. They reported much weaker ties to parties or ideologies, and very few mentioned that politics were a central part of their lives. They still felt well-informed on current events, and none cited traditional or mainstream news sources as the way they keep up with politics. Instead, what stood out to me was the varied kinds of tools they counted as sources of information: streamers, newsletters, Reddit, comments sections on short and longer-form YouTube videos, and AI-powered news summaries.\n[Media: https://www.datawrapper.de/_/mShLi/]\nOverall, not a lot of news seems to be breaking through and sticking with the passive Gen Z participants, aside from generally negative views on the economy (and, at the time, the drama following the Epstein Files). They are upset with the state of the country under Trump, but they aren’t turning to or really hearing from Democrats in response.\nThese seem to be the kinds of voters that could play a decisive role in future elections. They are a majority of Gen Z, so will become a bigger part of the eligible voting pool. It’s not at all a given if they will vote, but if 2024 showed anything, it was that these Gen Zers can be persuaded and activated in numbers large enough to impact elections — something that should be concerning for both political parties and their future candidates. \nIf Navigator’s own efforts are any indication, at least some Democrats are trying to make the rest of their party aware that they have a big problem with passive Gen Z consumers. Navigator, for example, is encouraging Democrats to center a more progressive and populist message on economics, affordability, and wealth inequality as a way to break through to these kinds of voters. \nRepublicans, meanwhile, seem to be leaning into culture war messaging still through social media messaging, programs led by groups like Turning Point USA and the Young Republicans National Federation, and right-wing podcasters and influencers.\nIt’s too early to tell which will be more successful, but the wager for passive young news consumers may end up turning out big electoral rewards.","summary":"The future of American politics might be decided by whether young voters get most of their news through TikTok.&#160; I don’t mean to single out the Chinese-owned vertical video app here.

Law firms, universities, even Supreme Court justices have surrendered to Trump's most outlandish demands that they cede their governing principles to him and pay financial tribute that runs into hundreds of millions of dollars. The rationale for some of Trump's policies—social and economic—are mysterious. But a greater mystery is why these institutions have given in, sometimes without a whisper of defiance. The capitulation trend has encompassed some American institutions that made their names standing firm against authoritarianism. One is CBS, whose parent, Paramount Global, last month settled a $20-billion Trump lawsuit over the editing of an interview with Kamala Harris at \"60 Minutes\" by paying $16 million, ostensibly to finance Trump's presidential library. The settlement \"resembled payment of an extortion-like penalty to the government for the standard editing\" of the Harris interview, Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for Leadership Studies and a leading professor at the Yale School of Management, wrote in The New Republic with two Yale colleagues. As my colleague Meg James reported, critics blasted the settlement, with one calling it a \"spineless capitulation\" that would only embolden politicians and others to \"weaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism.” Shortly after the settlement, as it happens, CBS announced the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's \"Late Show,\" silencing a widely-followed Trump critic (at least on broadcast TV). The network attributed its decision to economic factors, but it's been commonly seen as related to the settlement with Trump. Sonnenfeld ably placed the settlement in the context of CBS's distinguished journalistic history, which he traced back to the work of Edward R. Murrow in the 1930s and later; under Murrow, he noted, the news division of CBS became \"the gold standard of broadcast journalism.\" In settling what many legal commentators regarded as a frivolous lawsuit, Sonnenfeld wrote, Paramount's goal appeared to be securing the government's approval of its then-pending $8-billion merger with Skydance Media. The merger promptly received approval from the Federal Communications Commission and closed on Aug. 7, completing what Sonnenfeld called a \"sellout of the Columbia Broadcasting System’s journalistic values to commercial interests.\" Many of the other deals with Trump similarly subordinate the institutions' moral or ethical values to commercial or financial concerns. I asked Paramount for a response to Sonnenfeld's commentary, and received a statement that \"companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. CBS is far from alone. Indeed, in the media sphere it was preceded by the Walt Disney Company, which in December settled Trump's lawsuit over ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos’ on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. In fact, Trump had been found liable for sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll, not for rape. The settlement involved a $15-million contribution for Trump's presidential library. Leading universities have surrendered to Trump accusations of antisemitism and gender discrimination. Columbia (from which I hold a graduate degree) agreed last month to pay $221 million to \"resolve\" government allegations that it has violated federal anti-discrimination laws. Brown University also reached an agreement with the White House last month to pay $50 million toward workforce development programs in its home state, Rhode Island. Trump has recently turned his crosshairs on UCLA, freezing more than $300 million in research grants on the ostensible grounds that the university has failed to “promote a research environment free of antisemitism.” UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk has responded that “this far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination.” At least nine leading national law firms have also capitulated to Trump attacks by agreeing to payments totaling $940 million, according to a compilation by Axios, including pro-bono legal representation for conservative entities and other commitments. These settlements often involve non-financial commitments. Some institutions under Trumpian fire agree to end programs promoting workforce, student and faculty diversity, equality and inclusion, or \"DEI,\" to cite the common conservative shibboleth, or to eliminate other forms of outreach. In effect, they're ceding control over their academic structures to the White House. Institutions that have fought back have often been able to block administration threats in federal trial and appellate courts. That's been true for four law firms that have challenged Trump. Harvard, the target of a concentrated attack by Trump, has won a temporary restraining order against the administration's effort to prevent the university from enrolling foreign students. A separate lawsuit over Trump's threat to freeze scientific and other academic grants to the university and its affiliates is pending. The surrendering institutions typically have cited the economic consequences of opposition. Trump's threat to withhold research funding, which can run to billions of dollars a year, has rattled universities. In explaining Columbia's nine-figure payoff to the administration, Acting President Claire Shipman stated that most of the $400 million in federal research grants that Trump canceled in March will be reinstated, \"and Columbia’s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored.\" The university said the settlement would close \"a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty.\" At the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison—the first law firm to reach a deal with Trump—Chairman Brad Karp said the deal was made to reverse Trump's executive order cutting its lawyers off from government contracts, revoking their security clearances and prohibiting them from entering government buildings or dealing with federal employees. That all amounted to \"an existential crisis\" for the firm, Karp told his partners and associates. It's possible, though never stated outright, that the surrendering institutions recognize that the clock is running on Trump's authority. His presidency runs only until Jan. 19, 2029. (Never mind his musings about a third term, which would be unconstitutional. On the Gonna Happen scale, that's a Not.) They may simply be buying time in the expectation that a succeeding president will reverse the strictures he has imposed. In the meantime, courts may quash his threatened punishments as illegal or unconstitutional infringements of 1st Amendment rights. \"Appeasement may well be a viable strategy when the party being appeased is willing to take the win and stand down,\" writes Steve Vladeck of Georgetown law school. But it's \"a potentially catastrophic approach\" that can end up enabling, even encouraging, more bad behavior. Columbia, for example, thought that by acceding to Trump's demands in March to discipline students involved in a pro-Palestinian protest and placing its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under \"academic receivership\" and appointing an outside chair to run the unit for five years, won it a restoration of research funding. This proved to be untrue, leading to its $221-million settlement in July. Even while mounting a legal fight against Trump, Harvard has shuttered its diversity offices, which served minority and LGBTQ students and women, in July—steps that resembled demands from the Trump administration as part of an offer to restore potentially billions of dollars in research funding. But those actions haven't appeared to quell Trump's attacks on the university. The university has said that it \"remains committed to cultivating a community where all of its members can thrive.” The truth is that Trump can do a lot of damage to institutional interests while he remains in office and legal challenges wend their way through the federal judicial system on their way to possible consideration by the Supreme Court. Even if the High Court ultimately finds Trump's actions to be illegal, the process takes time and money, neither of which the plaintiffs will recover. As Trump's public standing begins to erode, new signs of resistance are emerging among his likely targets. Within the Big Ten conference, faculty senates at 14 of the 18 member schools have passed what amount to mutual aid commitments, aimed at coordinating \"a unified and vigorous response\" to political attacks, in the words of the model resolution developed at Rutgers. (The other 17 schools are the universities of Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin; Indiana University; Michigan State, Ohio State and Penn State; Purdue; Northwestern; UCLA; and USC.) The faculties at Purdue, UCLA and USC haven't yet signed up, but dozens of other schools have inked so-called mutual academic defense compacts. One can only wonder if the trend toward capitulation to Trump's bare-knuckled threats will have lasting consequences for the rule of law, social norms and the reputations of the submissive institutions. Some law firms that made deals with Trump to protect their business interests have lost clients that came to doubt that they would stand up forthrightly for the clients' interests. Sonnenfeld alluded to the possible aftermath in his brief against Paramount/CBS, which he described as a \"tragic capitulation of First Amendment rights, accompanied by a demoralizing and brand-tarnishing political appeasement.\" He closed his essay with a fitting quote attributed to Murrow: \"A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves.”","summary":"Law firms, universities, judges--they're all bowing to Trump's threats, even though they're almost surely illegal and his term is finite.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-08-06/why-are-americas-most-powerful-institutions-capitulating-to-trump","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/908edb7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3960x2640+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F4f%2F3f27e1fcb8665ac4a47ddfcc509f%2Fd10e2484fdc744c5a496e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 10:00:00","author":"Michael Hiltzik","authors":["Michael Hiltzik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.279},{"id":348749900,"title":"NASA Budget Cuts Could Halt Space Missions, Climate Research, Experts Warn","text":"Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American’s Science Quickly, I’m Rachel Feltman.\n\nThe White House recently proposed slashing NASA’s science budget nearly in half and reducing the space agency’s overall funding to just three quarters of what it received last year. When adjusted for inflation the proposed fiscal year 2026 budget would be NASA’s lowest since the beginnings of the Apollo program. But these days NASA is responsible for much more than keeping up with the space race. NASA’s work touches our daily lives in ways most people never realize, from the weather forecasts that help you decide what to wear to the climate data that helps farmers know when to plant their crops.\n\nThe stakes are so high that every living former NASA science chief—spanning from Ronald Reagan’s administration through Joe Biden’s—recently signed a letter warning that these cuts could be catastrophic for American leadership in space and science.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nToday we’re joined by Lee Billings, a senior editor at Scientific American who covers space and physics. He spoke with one of those former NASA science chiefs about why this moment feels different—and why the scientific community is sounding the alarm.\n\nLee, thanks so much for coming on to chat.\n\nLee Billings: It is my pleasure, as always, Rachel. I am happy to be here, even though I wish the circumstances were a bit happier.\n\nFeltman: Right, things aren’t looking great for NASA. What exactly is going on with the agency’s funding?\n\nBillings: Oof, well, to sum it up: the White House has proposed that NASA’s science budget be effectively cut in half, that the agency as a whole receives about only three quarters of the funding that it received in the previous fiscal year. And there’s been a lot of pushback about that, of course, because if you cut NASA’s science budget in half, for instance, then you’re probably gonna have to shutter, cancel, decommission dozens of active missions across the solar system and in Earth orbit, and you’re going to really hamstring a lot of good science, a lot of things that feed forward into other aspects of national economies and competitiveness.\n\nSo the Senate and the House appropriators have been upset about this to various degrees, and they have, apparently, largely now restored a lot of that funding when you’re looking at, like, the appropriations process and the back and forth between the Senate and the House. I don’t think that we’re entirely out of the woods yet—things are not fully finalized—but it is looking a bit brighter.\n\nAnd one contributor to that pushback from Senate and House appropriators might have been a letter that was recently sent to them—an open letter from all the living previous science chiefs of NASA, the associate administrators of the Science Mission Directorate of NASA. Every single one who’s still alive, from serving [in] the Reagan administration all the way through the Biden administration, signed on to this letter on a bipartisan basis and said, “We’re really not cool with these proposed changes; they’re potentially catastrophic for the nation and for NASA as a whole, so let’s not do them.”\n\nFeltman: So this pushback is like really seriously bipartisan effort.\n\nBillings: That’s correct. And, you know, these are serious people. They’ve had their finger on the pulse of every aspect of our civil space agency for, you know, the better part of 40 years, collectively. And none of them seemed too happy about the potential changes that these budget cuts would’ve wrought on NASA.\n\nFeltman: Let’s talk some more about those potential changes. What are the signatories of this letter most concerned about?\n\nBillings: You know, it—it’s hard to reel out a concise laundry list because the cuts [laughs] were so large, they threatened to affect almost everything. And I’m gonna read just a couple of quick excerpts.\n\nSo they say that these budget cuts would, quote, “cede U.S. leadership in space and science to China and other nations,” would “severely damage a peerless and immensely capable engineering and scientific workforce” and would “needlessly put to waste billions of dollars of taxpayer investments.” They would, quote, “force the U.S. to abandon its international partners who historically contribute significantly to U.S. space science missions.”\n\nAnd then they spend a paragraph going into more details. And we’re talking about things like winding down Hubble, even starting to wind down the James Webb Space Telescope, which only launched a few years ago. We’re talking about turning off missions that are currently at Jupiter, like NASA’s Juno mission. We’re talking about retreating at Mars and turning off a lot of the orbiters and landers and, and rovers there.\n\nWe’re also talking about closing some of NASA’s eyes to Earth. We’re talking about cuts that would affect things like the Landsat program, which NASA manages [with] the United States Geological Survey, which, you know, looks at things like weather and precipitation and, and helps people avoid dangerous storms or know when to plant or harvest their crops—things like that.\n\nIt even cuts into things like aeronautics; people forget that that—the first A in NASA stands for “aeronautics,” I’m pretty sure, and there’s lots of work that’s done there, too. That’s everything from developing next-generation engines and other parts of airframes that can lead to more efficient flight to, you know, software systems that can probably help air-traffic controllers and things like that. It’s a full-spectrum situation.\n\nFeltman: So I know that you talked to one of the authors of this letter. Could you tell us more about who he is and why he feels so strongly about this?\n\nBillings: Yeah, his name’s John Grunsfeld; sometimes he’s called “Dr. Hubble.” And he is a lot of things. In short he’s an astrophysicist. He is a five-time spaceflight veteran—a former NASA astronaut who went up to fix the Hubble Space Telescope and service it, hence the “Dr. Hubble” name. And of course, he is also a former associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, a former chief scientist of NASA.\n\nJohn Grunsfeld: There’s no question that science in the United States is under attack, and the president’s budget request shows that NASA, you know, is not at all spared.\n\nBillings: And so when people like this have strong opinions and speak up I think it’s important to listen. I really feel like some of his strongest material was when we prompted him by saying things like, you know, “What—why is this happening right now? What upsets you about it?” And he had some pretty sharp words for, you know, these proposals and, and the Trump administration. He threw some sharp elbows.\n\nGrunsfeld: You know, I can only speculate that this is part of a deliberate attempt to dumb down America. People who are poorly educated are much more easily manipulated than people who have strong critical-thinking skills.\n\nBillings: The stuff he said there, it’s the kind of thing where this isn’t some sign-toting hippie doing a protest in the street. Like, this guy—that was the other thing that he said that I thought was really good: when I challenged him directly, I was like, “You know, you can look through your socials and your history and I can see that, you know, you were a supporter of Kamala Harris. There’s gonna be this pushback on you—that you’re just a partisan hack and you’re compromised by your bias—and how would you respond to that?”\n\nAnd he answered me very clearly: talking about his resume, talking about his experience at NASA, talking about his spaceflights and how he put his life on the line for the nation to upgrade and service and preserve one of our most cherished and enduring iconic national resources, the Hubble Space Telescope. And he talked about how he’d worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations in the past. And, you know, I—to me that really resonated because, like, this is—he’s not the kind of person who makes a lot of headlines with a lot of splashy talk, right? But when he does talk in a concerted way that’s trying to get attention, I do think it’s worth listening.\n\nFeltman: Yeah, and what is he most concerned about?\n\nBillings: So the two that he really highlighted for me when, when we spoke, the first was the cuts to astrophysics.\n\nGrunsfeld: I’m an astrophysicist, so that actually has me seriously depressed. There’s especially one cut, which is eliminating the high-altitude balloon program, which—I have to say, having run NASA Science—is probably the most efficient and productive program in all of NASA and in all of the federal government because it always has a tiny budget and it does tremendous science.\n\nBillings: And it seems to be one of the areas where NASA and, by proxy, the United States is really in a pole position. We’re really leading the world in a lot of domains of astrophysics in terms of building telescopes to see further and more clearly deeper out into the cosmos, and he definitely thinks that that is at risk.\n\nAnd the other one that he pointed out has—it hits a little closer to home.\n\nGrunsfeld: Earth science: part of NASA. And one of the things we know is that the Earth as a system is incredibly complex, and it’s that view from space—not only, you know, seeing the whole Earth with our fleet of satellites but also over a long period of time—that allows us to develop models to accurately predict what the future will be.\n\nBillings: The planet’s warming, and that’s not a partisan appraisal—that’s just a fact. And we need to know how that works. And we need to know how it’s cascading through the Earth’s system to affect everything from precipitation patterns to extreme weather events, so on and so forth—sea-level rise, lots of things. So there’s lots of areas where NASA’s work, especially its observations of our home planet, really do touch people’s lives, everyday people’s lives, in, in lots of subtle ways.\n\nFeltman: Of course NASA has faced potential budget cuts before. So, what does John say is different about this? Why did he and the rest of the folks who signed feel the need to speak out now?\n\nBillings: One thing that’s indisputable is: if you look at these proposed budget cuts and you look at NASA’s funding over time, across the entirety of its nearly 70-year history, the budget cuts, if they went through, would be bringing NASA to its lowest state, its lowest budgetary state, since before the [beginnings of the] Apollo program—since, really, its founding. So that’s pretty historic.\n\nAnd of course, NASA is doing a lot more with its money than it did back in the Apollo days. You know, back then it was all about a moonshot and beating the Soviet Union in this new “High Frontier,” and it was a very focused, almost singular goal. Now NASA’s portfolio is vast. If you look at all the different things it’s doing and all the different types of science that it supports, all the different technology development that it supports, all the different aspects of our lives that these things filter into, it’s just grown so much.\n\nSo we’re pairing a historically low budget with an immensely expanded portfolio of responsibilities, obligations and opportunities, and I think it’s that combination that really set the alarm bells off and that really brought not just John Grunsfeld to the table to write this letter but also all of his predecessors within NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.\n\nFeltman: It makes sense that this former NASA head is really concerned about this stuff. But how could it impact our listeners?\n\nBillings: Woo, well, I think that our listeners should care for many different reasons, and, and it kind of depends upon one’s point of view. If you’re really enthused and excited about just fundamentally expanding the frontiers of our knowledge about the universe, right, if you are captivated and awestruck by pretty pictures from space telescopes and other worldly vistas from interplanetary spacecraft, you should be concerned about that window closing on the universe. And again, we’ve been at the forefront.\n\nMaybe you’re very, very, very patriotic and you’re always first to start chanting “USA!” at any public event. Well, in that case maybe you don’t care so much about pretty pictures from space telescopes and rovers on Mars looking for signs of life, but maybe you just want the U.S. to be the best, right? And if these sorts of budget cuts go through, then it’s very hard to see how we’re still gonna be the best in these domains, instead of some other competitor nations, particularly China.\n\nChina’s rapid rise in space science and exploration and spaceflight is something that many people have flagged, obviously, and that John Grunsfeld also noted when we spoke, and they are going full bore. They have a space station up there right now. They are going to be launching almost, like, a Hubble Space Telescope–like orbital observatory that’s gonna hang out near their space station for servicing in [the] coming years. They are probably going to pull off the first successful Mars sample return mission before NASA and the European Space Agency, its key partner, will manage to retrieve a bunch of samples that they already have stored there on Mars.\n\nYou know, attracting the best and the brightest to our shores from all across the world, because who wouldn’t want to work on a mission to land people on Mars? Who wouldn’t wanna work on a mission to try to find life on some distant exoplanet? Those things are fundamentally attractive and cool to a lot of people—again, the best and the brightest—and we want to have them here, I think.\n\nThere’s also the direct-utility angle of people wanting to know if it’s gonna be rainy or sunny tomorrow, what they need to wear if they’re going out to work: Should they wear a light sweater, or should they, you know, wear seersucker because it’s gonna be 90 percent humidity? Is there gonna be a big squall or hurricane that might blow in? Those things depend on forecasts, which are based on data that, to some degree, comes from NASA assets—NASA satellites, NASA computers crunching the numbers, all that stuff. So Earth observations have a very strong, direct influence on our daily lives, whether we really recognize it or not, and it’s threatened by these sorts of budget cuts.\n\nFeltman: Lee, thank you so much for coming on to chat.\n\nBillings: Rachel, it is always my pleasure. Again, I wish the circumstances were a little better, but hey, hope springs eternal.\n\nFeltman: That’s all for today’s episode.

The first six months of this administration have been marked by ever-higher prices. Republicans in Congress would be wise to remember that voters are never quicker to fire elected officials than when they break a core promise. It is this Congress who will be on the ballot next year, not Donald Trump. The campaign trail promises sounded too good to be true, because they were. Trump committed to \"end\" inflation, cut energy costs \"in half,\" make health care more affordable, and that Americans would see \"drastic price reductions\" and cheaper groceries. For most swing voters, lower costs were the whole point of voting for those now in power. They were counting on policies that would improve their lives, not make them harder. As polls show, the anger runs deep for a president and Congress who are gutting the social safety net, dolling out special favors to their wealthy friends and personally profiting from high office. WHY AOC COULD TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 AND KAMALA HARRIS WON'T Working Americans are speaking out against the policies that are making life more expensive. And candidates running in 2025 and 2026 have a duty to listen. We help lead the bipartisan Cost Coalition, which exists to show how Washington’s economic agenda is making the American Dream unaffordable. The most credible voices in this fight aren’t in Washington; they’re our neighbors who are paying more and getting less. America’s working families, veterans, small businesses and people of faith, are rising up to tell the real story. Take Trump’s signature Washington policy solution, the \"big, beautiful bill,\" which raises costs. Its inflationary tax breaks for the wealthy mean gutting the safety net and kicking 10 million Medicaid beneficiaries off of their health insurance. When Allison Harris’ daughter was diagnosed with cancer, steep medical bills would have bankrupted their family even with private insurance coverage. Michigan’s Medicaid program helped cover the costs. She told their local news station that when the \"big, beautiful bill\" was signed, she felt \"fear and disgust. Because you never know until something like this cancer journey happens, exactly how much stuff costs.\" DON'T BE FOOLED. MAMDANI ISN'T THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THESE TWO PATRIOTIC WOMEN ARE Her daughter, Kendall Williams, added, \"I feel like the fact that they even signed it into law just shows how some adults don’t have common sense.\" Common sense is hard to find in Washington, especially when it comes to the economic whiplash from blanket tariffs that are fueling a new wave of inflation. The price of ground beef is at a record high and more Americans are using Buy Now, Pay Later to afford groceries. Large retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon have already raised prices. And now Proctor and Gamble says tariffs will increase prices on common household products from Tide detergent to Luv’s diapers. \"It’s hard enough to buy the things my family needs. Raising that cost is going to make it harder,\" Ohian Charlene Monoskie said to her local news. It’s not just families. Hard choices are facing small business owners – eat the tariffs or raise prices on their customers. TRUMP'S TARIFFS AND TAX CUTS ARE CRUSHING MAIN STREET AND MAKING MAR-A-LAGO ELITES RICH After decades teaching in Pennsylvania schools, Jamie Pikulsky opened the From Scratch Uniontown cafe, where she tries to keep her prices affordable to compete with larger chains. But tariffs mean she’s paying $600 more a month for the coffee she serves her customers. She says: \"I don't know of any small business right now that is thriving. It's tough across the board.\" Instead of ending inflation \"immediately,\" like Trump promised the country at the Republican National Convention last summer, his policies have made inflation worse. And more pain could be on the way with the latest round of tariffs, after failed negotiations didn’t yield 90 deals in 90 days. Both parties should fight against the Washington agenda that is raising costs. More elected Republicans need to think for themselves. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., had the guts to choose the people of North Carolina over the \"big, beautiful bill.\" Tillis spoke out on the Senate floor, asking his colleagues, \"What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there?\" Tillis knew that kicking people out of their health insurance shifts costs onto all of us. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION And Democrats must show they are listening to working people by focusing relentlessly on lowering costs and growing the economy. Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is running to succeed Tillis, is showing the way by calling out \"politicians in D.C. [who] are running up our debt, ripping away our healthcare, disrespecting our veterans, cutting help for the poor, and even putting Medicare and Social Security at risk, just to give tax breaks to billionaires.\" So is Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who says: \"The cost of living in the economy is the driving issue for the average person. It’s just not always driving the conversation among political elites.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That’s the disconnect. Whatever the billionaire in the White House may think, the American people are not stupid. They know they are paying more and getting less. They are saying it today and they will say it again next year, when they will again cast ballots for who leads the next Congress.

I’m Jon Wiener. Later in the show: Robert Reich says the origin of our troubles with Trump and MAGA go back to the sixtieshe says it was our mistake, starting with the sixties movements – that we created “a giant political void that would eventually be filled by Donald Trump’s angry, bigoted cultural populism.” His new memoir is “Coming Up Short” — we’ll talk about it, later in the hour. But first, how do we face how bad things are now, while also understanding the reasons for hope – and the opportunities for action? Katrina Vanden Heuvel, editor and publiser of The Nation, will comment – in a minute.[BREAK]Katrina vanden Heuvel, longtime editorial director and publisher of The Nation, has returned to work this week as editor of the magazine. She’s also been a columnist for the Washington Post. She’s written for the New York Times, the LA Times, and The Guardian, where she’s now a regular contributor. Katrina, welcome back\n\nKatrina vanden Heuvel: Thank you, Jon. You know, if I might preempt you, which I’ve done too often on talk TV — These are extreme times, and I felt that, while there will be a successor to me, someone younger, I felt at this moment a trust in The Nation, both as a trust of history, a trusted independent publication, at a time when independent media is under terrible stress. And I’m not fetishizing history, I’m not tethered to history, but I do draw from history to understand what is happening today. I believe that it is an unparalleled, dangerous, perilous time. At the same time, I feel a resilience, having studied and lived through terrible times, and I think that allows me to find the writers and thinkers.And also my sister used to say her friends loved ‘Yes!’, exclamation point, and she said they love The Nation, but they thought of it as “No!” exclamation point, maybe. But I do think this is a time to lift up what’s happening around this country and the world that offer alternative affirmative projects, because we can’t all live on doom and gloom, and doom scrolling all day. We need, I hate to say, the vision, but to have an alternative sense of what is working and lessons to be drawn, but in ways that are alive and vibrant. And I really feel dedicated to that.And the executive editor, who will become John Nichols, is also someone I’ve worked with. We’ve devised the honor roll over the years, people doing good things in bad times, good times, not so good times, and drawing that from the thirties, 1930s, from the magazine. There’s a new politics that The Nation in some ways has found a tie to, and we are going to really test that in these coming months and years.JW: Of course, the publishing landscape, as you’ve suggested, is a lot darker now than when you left day-to-day editing in 2019. Just to remind everybody, the publisher of the Washington Post stood next to Trump at his inauguration. Another of his companies paid $40 million to license a Melania Trump documentary. That’s the Washington Post’s owner. Several of their most important writers left in protest.More recently, CBS fired its top late night host, Stephen Colbert, whose nightly ridicule of Trump has been relentless and hilarious. And the parent company of CBS, Paramount, paid Trump $16 million for, in quotes, his ‘presidential library’ after he sued them for a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.And before that, ABC news paid Trump 15 million, again for his presidential library, to settle a defamation lawsuit over a report by George Stephanopoulos. That’s the Washington Post, CBS and ABC.And some ways much worse is the Republicans in Congress have defunded NPR and PBS. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is closing. And that means many dozens of public radio and TV stations, especially in the less populous red states, will go dark. That is a totalitarian move that’s a lot bigger than networks paying cash to Trump. And that makes independent media, including The Nation, more important than ever. It deepens our responsibilities.And as you’ve said, the hardest part is facing how bad things are, while we are also seeing the reasons for hope and for action. Doing both of those things simultaneously is hard, but as you say, you’ve had some experience with this.\n\nKVH: Our longtime contributor, you knew him well, Jon, Gore Vidal used to describe The Nation as ‘an early alert warning system’ to what’s coming over the transom, over the fortifications. I think of my colleague, Mark Hartsgaard, whose book ‘On Bended Knee’ was about the media during the Reagan era. This is worse, but I would suggest that we revisit the 1996 National Entertainment Series. The Nation did the first centerfold, which showed GE, ABC, News Corp — It showed that news was a cog in a corporate structure, which had regulatory business in Washington DC. We’re seeing that revealed painfully crystal clear in the Trump years.The independence of a publication is marked not just by its financial state, but it is in these times largely defined by those who want to be close to a president who thrives on corruption and spectacle and input into his own piggybank. But I do think that the corporate media has shown how craven it is in these last months, and it’s up to The Nation and independent media, not to speak truth to power, Jon, because I believe those in power know the truth, but to expose the truth — so that ordinary people, good people, can seize that news and mobilize. Because if you don’t know, you don’t know what you’re mobilizing for. I do think The Nation does play a critical role in these times. Just briefly, we did a lot of reporting on how Rupert Murdoch bought his way to end the serious cross-ownership rules. Those are going to be obliterated in the next few weeks. And we have his move to LA: the LA Pest is going to open soon.\n\nJW: You’re talking here about Rupert Murdoch’s announcement that he’s launching a California edition of the New York Post right wing tabloid, and this is supposed to happen in early 202,6 based in Los Angeles, called the California Post.\n\nKVH: I think there is very high quality journalism being done at The Nation at other publications that are independent. I’m on the Hillman Media Judging Committee and we see that every year. It’s the business model, Jon, that is still very perilous and dangerous, as we see how the corporate media has capitulated, anticipatorily capitulated, and opened the sluice gates for more peril to the media remaining.\n\nJW: We need to remember that what Trump is doing is not popular, even among his own supporters, right now. His tariffs are the main thing that’s been driving down his approval ratings and causing his 2024 coalition to unravel. Let me just summarize some of the recent data from the Economist-YouGov poll. His overall approval rating just in the six months since he took office: down 21 points. Down 44 points with 18 to 29 year olds. Approval down 30 points with Hispanics since he took office. 29 points down with Independents. Down 20 points with people making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year. And it’s not just the economy, inflation, the high prices for food and rent. He’s underwater on virtually all the issues. Many more people disapprove than approve of what he’s done on immigration, deportations, education, social programs. On healthcare, his approval rating is 35%. So we have big opportunities here — and also big responsibilities.\n\nKVH: I agree. We have opportunity. We have responsibility. Those numbers are exhilarating. It doesn’t mean that those numbers move in a straight line direction. I think the town hall meetings, which we’re going to cover this August, will expose lawmakers to anger and despair, and may open things up. But it demands an opposition party which speaks directly to people’s lives and offers an alternative so that it’s not one and a half parties. I do think the media plays a role here. There are independent media showing the despair and the disillusion, but Trump dominates the news. He still dominates the arena and that needs to change. I think we’re seeing alternative leaders speak in ways that do touch people.\n\nJW: I want to talk about that – because, while the news is terrible, it’s not all bad. Probably the brightest light in the current dark landscape is Mamdani, the Social Democrat who beat former governor Andrew Cuomo to win the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York City. What has The Nation had to say about his campaign?\n\nKVH: Well, you’ll see more next week when the interview John Nichols and I did – the hour interview at the Little Flower Cafe in Astoria, ‘Little Flower’ being the nickname for Zorhan Mamdani’s favorite mayor, Fiorella LaGuardia. What Mamani has done, and I saw him on Sunday with Elizabeth Warren, who came to campaign for him, is make affordability a central premise of a progressive landscape. It’s not the banks, but affordability of groceries, of transportation, of housing. And he’s done it with a smile and an elegance and a use of social media that is truly unparalleled. It shows, it reminds us that The Nation needs, yes, sincerity, but also levity, I mean with a purpose. And I’m impressed.He came back from Uganda where he went to see his parents and grandparents to introduce them to his new wife. But he came back and he met with a family of the private security cop who had been killed in the terrible shootings a few days before, when he’d been in Uganda. And he did it with a humanity that crossed the politicization and weaponization of such incidents.I think he has a real chance and he’s brought together a great coalition. Your viewers may know of ranked choice voting. It didn’t work well in 2021 in New York City. We endorsed 1, 2, 3, but one was Zorhan and two was Brad Lander, who’s been a long time progressive advocate on the city council, now controller. The Working Families Party the next day did the same lineup of Zorhan and Brad Lander. What Brad Lander did though in coalition with Zorhan is very important to understanding the success of ranked choice voting.\n\nJW: And it’s not just deep blue New York City where we’ve had some striking progressive victories, just in the last month. Let’s talk about Seattle. Seattle, the home of Microsoft and Amazon, where a woman named Katie Wilson is showing that Mamdani is not alone. I didn’t know about her until I read The Nation.\n\nKVH: That’s part of the role of The Nation in a way. But Katie Wilson, that is a tough city, but she has taken it on through taxation issues, the referendum, the big tech, high tech corporations, and she is a transportation expert. The mayor of Boston who’s 36 is going to be reelected. So there are those around the country, and I do think with gridlock and worse in Washington DC it’s important to have champions at the city and state level.\n\nJW: Much more amazing than Seattle or Boston: let’s talk about Omaha, a city in one of the reddest states that has had a Republican mayor who’s held office since 2013; won her last race by 30 points. Nevertheless, a Democrat, John Ewing Jr., beat her in May by nearly 13 points. If you do the arithmetic there, that’s a shift of 43 points. In Omaha, a red city. Again, I learned about this from The Nation. What can Democrats learn from John Ewing Jr’s victory in Omaha?\n\nKVH: Well, first of all, Nebraska has a very good Democratic chair who’s written for us, Jane Kleb. You are a historian. I am not. But that region of the country had farmer-labor alliances. It was a populist part of the country, and he’s retrieving those traditions in a modern way. So I think he’s running a populist multiracial campaign in the big cities, in Omaha a populist campaign, which leads with the bread and butter issues. And I think that there’s an opening for that and he’s showing it.So when people say it can’t be done — I think next is Idaho. I’m going to take back Frank Church’s seat. The famous story: Eric Foner emailed –great historian — emailed me one night and said,’ can someone get something to Bernie Sanders? Can he stop talking about Denmark?’ Eric Foner in the middle of the night wrote an open letter, which we published, it was to Bernie, about retrieving your own country’s radical traditions, which exist — and are not so odd and fringy. They’re part of the tradition, and I think that part of The Nation’s mission is to highlight what is new but has roots in a history.\n\nJW: I think Trump knows he’s in deep trouble in the midterms next fall. He knows how unpopular he is. He knows how tiny his the Republican margin is in the House, and how likely that the Democrats can win the House. I think that explains this authoritarian scheme of his in Texas to eliminate five Democratic congressional seats through an unprecedented reapportionment move. John Nichols has a piece up at The Nation right now at the website that says,’Representative democracy will live or die in Texas.’\n\nKVH: It’s a sign of how authoritarian, not only Trump is, but some of the governors, who were ramming through legislation to rig the system. That is not a democratic system that Abbott is trying to create, and it’s happened before. And you are looking at people who rigged the rules. And by the way, it’s also the anniversary, I think the 60th of the Voting Rights Act. Making that more difficult to do? That’s called democracy, and that’s how they run. That’s how they rule, and it’s something we have to expose and rally people to understand how dangerous it is because it’s a slippery slope. You begin in Texas, you’re going to see it around the country, and we’re asking one of the legislators, a good lawyer who fled, to write for The Nation about the experience.\n\nJW: In conclusion here, you’ve just returned to the editor’s desk at The Nation this week. What do you see the schedule for the next weeks and months and year for what we used to call ‘America’s oldest weekly’?\n\nKVH: Well, we’re doing events to mark the 160th anniversary – from an event at Ethical Culture honoring the intern program, which Victor Navasky started more than 40 years ago. Someone wrote to me today that they value The Nation, not just because of the words we publish, but because of the people we’ve kind of brought through the media and journalistic system. So that will be interesting.And then we have Kaveh Akbar, our poetry editor, with Judy Collins.And then we’re heading to San Francisco where I hope to be in conversation with Jerry Brown, and we’ll have Elie Mystal, our great justice correspondent, and Rebecca Solnit and others in conversation about this moment.But I also turn back to my desk and I’m going to edit Jamie Galbraith on parallels between Reagan and Trump on the economy, which is something to think about. And a piece about the New York City political scene, which has changed really in interesting ways. The Working Families Party, which The Nation helped create in 1998, is now considered sort of the senior guy on the street. And DSA, which you’ve seen over time, Democratic Socialists for America has had a lot of energy and input.I do think that I’m a deviation at The Nation because we do have a younger generation of democratic socialists. I remain a Rooseveltian 2.0. Lina Kahn, the great anti-monopolist professor, former head of the FTC, had an op-ed the other day, I wish we’d published it — about Zorhan and small business. We should not cede small business to the right. And his work on halal trucks and bodegas have redefined in some measure what small businesses do.One of our contributors, I’ve said this before, Norman Thomas, a socialist we endorsed in 1932, said, ‘there are no lost causes. There are only causes waiting to be won.’ But I do think that realism is important, but also resilience. I think it’s a very tough time for a lot of people and we have to be understanding of that — so that we give people, not the week of Trump, we do that, but we also give them the week of Resistance 2.0.\n\nJW: Katrina Vanden Heuvel, she’s Publisher of The Nation — And now, once again, editor of The Nation Magazine. Katrina, thanks for all your work, and thanks for talking with us today.\n\nKVH: Thank you.[BREAK]\n\nJon Wiener: Now it’s time to talk with Robert Reich about how we got here and what we can do now. He’s done a lot in his life: He’s a legendary teacher at Berkeley. He was Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton. He’s written 18 books, which have been translated into 22 languages. His articles have appeared in The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. He’s a columnist now for The Guardian. And a lot of us read his daily newsletter at Substack or follow him on Instagram or TikTok or YouTube, where he is a star. And he has a new book out: It’s called Coming Up Short: A Memoir of My America. We reached him today in Berkeley. Robert Reich, welcome back.\n\nRobert Reich: Well, good to talk to you, Jon.\n\nJW: You call your memoir ‘a story of the failure of my generation.’ It’s mine too. You say it was our mistake, starting with the sixties’ movements. We had a civil rights movement and an anti-war movement, and then in the seventies, a women’s movement, then a gay rights movement, then an environmental movement. But you say one movement was missing — and that created what you call ‘a giant political void that would eventually be filled by Donald Trump’s angry, bigoted, cultural populism.’ What was missing?\n\nRR: Well, in a word, it was the labor movement – actually, two words, Jon. The labor movement had been around obviously in fits and starts over a hundred years, but I didn’t really, and here’s my confessional, I didn’t really think about it in those days as a movement. Labor was there. It was big labor, there were big companies, big corporations, and there was big government, and it didn’t seem necessary in a way to consider or to talk about the labor movement or to talk even about the working class. And I think that that was my error. It was an error that a lot of people made because all of these other movements did take a life of their own, they accomplished a great deal, but by forgetting about workers and the labor movement, I think we laid the groundwork for something quite ugly.\n\nJW: The Democrats’ great turn away from the working class and the labor movement of course came in the Bill Clinton years when you were Secretary of Labor. The whole thing was pretty clear from the start of the Clinton campaign in 1992, at least if you listened to third party candidate, Ross Perot. You quote him in your book on the subject of NAFTA, which George HW Bush had just negotiated with Mexico, also Canada, in one of the presidential debates in ‘92, watched by 60 million people. That’s about the same number that watched the debates this year. Perot explained why he was against NAFTA. “If you’re paying $13 or $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border and pay $1 an hour, have no healthcare, no environment or pollution controls, no retirement, and you don’t care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound coming from the south.” Today, that seems obvious. How did it seem to you in 1992?\n\nRR: In 1992, Jon? I was worried about that. I thought that, and I put it in slightly in different terms. I worried that American workers would lose bargaining leverage. They were already losing bargaining power. I talked about it inside the, in coed incipient Clinton administration, but I lost those internal debates. It was very clear, Bill Clinton and other people around him wanted to embrace NAFTA, and I did what I was told to do, and I think in retrospect, I don’t know whether that was the right thing to do. I argued as much as I could, and I also argued against Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. In fact, I was worried that that would have an even bigger, essentially a sucking sound. I lost a lot of the arguments internally, Jon, I’ve written about that. You and I have talked about that, and I guess from where we are right now, I see that all of this contributed to, it didn’t lead in inevitably to Donald Trump, but it contributed to the emergence of Donald Trump.\n\nJW: The big debate in American politics really for the last 50 years has been framed by the Republicans. They say more government is bad. Freedom from big government is good, freedom for the market. You’ve been arguing with this position for a long time now. Remind us what your reply has been.\n\nRR: I’ve said it so often. It just, it’s sort of automatic and I don’t think people even listen because I’m so predictable. The question is not more or less government. The question is, who is government for? Is it working for average working people and the poor, or is it working for the people who have a lot of money and a lot of resources and big corporations? And certainly, over the last decades, government has done more and more on behalf of the latter, that is big corporations and the wealthy because that’s where the money has come from for campaigns. That’s where the legalized bribery that I talk about in the book has really occurred. And if we want to, and we have to, and this is not if we want to, we have to disabuse ourselves from that kind of addiction. And the Democratic Party has got to give up the corporate and financial Democrats that have been so important to the party in terms of money but have eroded the party’s moral authority.\n\nJW: When you were Secretary of Labor, you did get Congress to raise the minimum wage just before the ‘96 elections. What had it been and what did they do?\n\nRR: Well, they raised the minimum wage to, I believe it was $5 and—\n\nRR: 15 cents, which I mean, it doesn’t, from today’s standpoint, it doesn’t look like anything, but it had been $4 and 25 cents. It was a Republican Senate and a Republican House. They didn’t want to raise the minimum wage. And basically, it wasn’t me, I mean, I did try to lead that charge on the hill, but what really did it was that most Americans and the Republicans saw the polls, the same polls that everybody else saw. And it was not just one poll. It was poll after poll after poll. Most Americans wanted the minimum wage raised, not because they would benefit. They knew that they were not on a minimum wage, but they felt that it was the fair thing to do. And that’s a very important part of the story because Americans have this very deep-seated sense of what’s fair and what’s not fair. I saw it firsthand when I was labor secretary and before and after and since. And we can’t simply assume that everybody is cynical like Donald Trump, or everybody is negative and mean spirited like Donald Trump. No, I think Americans really are fundamentally good and fair.\n\nJW: It’s been 16 years since Congress raised the federal minimum wage. It’s been $7 and 25 cents. You said the Republicans supported it in 1996, and that was because so many Americans supported raising the minimum wage. Don’t so many Americans still support raising the minimum wage? 83% say the current $7 and 25 cents rate is not enough to live on. How much should it be in 2023? 65% of voters said $15 an hour. Younger people favor a lot more.\n\nRR: Today, you’re absolutely right. I mean the same percentage, if not more, want the minimum wage raised. It hasn’t been raised since 2009. This is crazy. We can’t expect. Most people cannot possibly live on today’s minimum wage. It should be at least $15. And if you actually controlled for both inflation and productivity improvements, it would be closer to 20 or $25 an hour.\n\nJW: So after Clinton, of course, then came Obama, there was that speech in 2004 that he gave at the Democratic National Convention that made him an instant hero. He said, “there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America. There’s a United States of America.” Now today, that seems totally wrong, doesn’t it?\n\nRR: It does. It seems quaint, if not wrong. I mean, how can there be not a liberal and not a conservative America? And I think what Obama was trying to do, and he did it with such grace, and he did, he continued to try to do it. And that is to tell us that we are part of one society, one experiment in democracy, and we shouldn’t allow people to try to divide us. I mean, look, let’s be clear here, the divide and conquer strategy has been very effective. And it’s been used by, I’m sure Vladimir Putin has been using it. And I’m sure also the oligarchy of America has used it because you see, if you can divide Americans and make them think that they’re real enemies are the people on the other side of the political divide, then they don’t look up and see where all the money and power really has gone in our society.\n\nJW: Obama didn’t really help with this problem at all. Despite the economic crash of 2008. He stuck with Wall Street and the big banks and divide in America, deepened and after America, the 2016 elections. Bernie Sanders ran in the Democratic primaries even though he wasn’t a Democrat. And even though, as you say, he was a 74-year-old Jew from Vermont. You say, if the DNC had not tipped the scales against him by rigging campaign financing in favor of Hillary, Bernie would’ve been the party’s nominee in 2016. How do you feel about Bernie?\n\nRR: I love Bernie. He’s one of my heroes. I don’t know where he gets his energy, his stamina, his tenacity. But he’s been there and he’s out there, even as we speak, he’s out there. He’s talking to people. He’s telling the truth, and God bless Bernie.\n\nJW: I want to change the subject to your teaching. You taught at Harvard and then you taught at Berkeley. You’ve just retired. Harvard, of course, the elite private school, Berkeley, the flagship public university. What differences did you see, and which did you like better?\n\nRR: Oh, Berkeley. I mean, Harvard is a wonderful institution, obviously, but I love University of California, Berkeley. Berkeley, in fact, the entire University of California system is the largest and most powerful system of upward mobility in America. My students, most of them were first generation, first generation in terms of getting a college diploma. A third of them came directly. They transferred from community colleges. It’s an engine of upward mobility.\n\nJW: One thing I want to ask you about that I’ve learned only recently, not everybody is interested in politics the way we are. In fact, most people aren’t very interested in politics. They don’t follow the news that much, especially working class and poor people. They’re preoccupied with their own lives, their own problems, their own pleasures, politics for them, is sort of like the Olympics. You watch it every four years for a couple of days, maybe you hope your team wins. And all the effort and all the money that our side puts into getting the right message out, a message that’s been tested, they don’t pay attention. They’re not very interested. They vote on vague feelings: ‘I like him,’ or ‘he seems like a good guy to me’ =- or they don’t vote at all. 89 million people did not vote in 2024. That’s a lot more than the number of people who voted for Trump, 77 million.So better messaging, which so much of our work goes into figuring out, better messaging may not be the best way to reach all these people. We need to find other modes of communication, other ways to reach them than the kind of politics we’ve been doing all our lives. And now you are a star on TikTok and YouTube where you have 1.3 million subscribers. And on Instagram you have 2 million followers – and Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, these are the places where now where millions of people who don’t read the daily newspaper or watch TV news get their information. How did you become so good at this?\n\nRR: I don’t know. I don’t know. I really don’t know. I have two sons, one of whom named Sam has been doing a lot of social media. Sam runs a company called Dropout Television. Have you seen any of that? \n\nRR: Well, you’re not alone. I mean, nobody our age has seen it. But young people, my students, they all know Sam. In fact, somebody came up to me on the sidewalk just a couple of days ago and said, I mean, “Are you Sam Reich’s father?”But a few years ago, it was about 10 years ago, Sam said to me, “Dad, I know you write books. You like to write books. And I know you get a lot of satisfaction out of it, but my generation is – they’re not big readers, particularly of your kind of book. And if you want to reach my generations generation, you’ve got to do social media.”And at that point, I barely knew what social media was, but he tutored me, he helped me. And I have a little group of young people who are in their twenties and thirties who helped me do it. I couldn’t do it without them. They’re very talented and they keep me young to the extent that anybody can do that. So yes, I mean, I still write books, hence the book we are talking about, Coming Up Short, but I do a lot of social media because it is a way of teaching. It is a way of connecting.\n\nJW: I want to talk about one other thing: tall people. Your memoir, you called Coming Up Short. It’s the thesis of your book that our generation failed to strengthen democracy. But that’s also a pun about your height. You are not a tall person. I am not a tall person. And you make the point that the taller candidate usually wins the election. Our tallest presidents, I look them up, there’s a Wikipedia page, ‘Presidents by height.’ Lincoln is our tallest president, six feet, four inches. LBJ number 2, 6’3” and a half, Clinton 6’3”, FDR 6’2”, Obama 6’2”, George HW Bush 6’2”, JFK 6’1”, Reagan 6’1”, Joe Biden, 6 feet even. What about Trump? Of course, Trump lies about his height. He claims to be 6’3”. There’s also a Wikipedia page about this, but photos show him standing right next to Obama, and they’re exactly the same height, more or less. Trump has more hair on top of his head, so maybe he’s, and Obama is 6’2”. I had a professor who blamed all the troubles of the world on what he called the six-footers. Why should the six-footers always win?\n\nRR: Well, that’s a very good question. I think there’s a lot of prejudice in our society that we don’t talk about against short men or in favor of tall men, and women it’s slightly different. But I think that the studies that I’ve read, and I’ve been kind of interested in this subject, obviously I have a personal interest, but I’ve been interested sociologically. It turns out that, and there are many evolutionary biologists and others who think that we are kind of genetically wired to choose big people, tall men, to be our leaders because they are, again, in terms of kind of Darwinian survival of the fittest, they are the ones who can protect us. Even our language, when we talk about ‘looking up to somebody’ or ‘somebody has stature’ or I mean, there are all kinds of ways we unconsciously are prejudicial. And then in dating, I don’t know whether you had this experience, Jon. I’m very short and there were a number of girls who just didn’t want to look at me. They didn’t want to go out with a boy who is shorter than they were. And that was the cruelest, the cruelest of all prejudices.\n\nJW: Last thing: the long game. Going back to Bernie just for a minute here. One of the things you say you love about Bernie is that he exemplifies the long game his whole life. He’s been saying the same thing. He doesn’t have a problem staying on message. We have midterms coming up in a year and a half. Then we have an election after that. What is the long game for us right now?\n\nRR: I think the long game has got to protect our democracy, and to actually get it back, to revive and rebuild democratic institutions. In the book, I talk about Donald Trump as not being the cause of our present problems, but the consequence, the culmination of decades of neglect. We took many of these institutions for granted. We deregulated. I was part of an administration that deregulated Wall Street, that embraced free trade, that didn’t pay much attention as corporations got bigger and bigger and monopolized industries that didn’t really pay much attention to unions. And I think that all of this added up to a, I don’t want to be reductionist here and say it automatically led to Trump, but it led to a large and disaffected and angry working class that felt looked down upon, felt forgotten. And when somebody like Trump came along, and even though he lied through his teeth and even though he was a Trojan horse for the wealthy and the billionaires, he sounded like, he acted like he cared about, and he recognized working class people.\n\nJW: Robert Reich – his new book is Coming Up Short, A Memoir of My America. Bob, thank you for all your work, and thanks for talking with us today.\n\nRR: Well, Jon, thank you.","summary":"Jon Wiener\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Start Making Sense: The Nation’s editor on our tasks now, and the Berkeley economist on understanding our historic mistakes.\n\n\n\n\nThe post Katrina vanden Heuvel on Where We’re Going, and Robert Reich on How We Got Here appeared first on The Nation.","url":"https://www.thenation.com/podcast/politics/sms-08062025/","image":"https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2227951455.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 09:00:00","author":"Donald Trump,Jon Wiener","authors":["Donald Trump","Jon Wiener"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.224},{"id":348608790,"title":"On This Day, Aug. 6: U.S. drops atomic bomb on Hiroshima","text":"Aug. 6 (UPI) -- On this date in history:\n\nIn 1890, the first execution by electric chair was carried out.

A new letter to recognize a Palestinian state is gaining signatures in the House. Devoted allies of Israel are speaking out against its government, brushing off whatever texts and phone calls they’ve been getting from the dwindling number of party voters or donors still standing steadfast behind Israeli actions in Gaza nearly two years after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack.\nIt’s no longer just the far left rejecting Netanyahu’s years of identifying more with Republicans. There is also a bitter backlash among many Democratic politicians, who have felt bullied by the Israeli government and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group, and there’s revulsion over the images of starvation and dying children.\n“We can disagree about a lot of things in the foreign policy space, but there’s no room to tolerate mass starvation,” said Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, who is Jewish and widely seen as one of the party’s future leaders in the Senate. Schatz argues there’s a conflation of opposing the Israeli government and opposing Israel’s right to exist that he calls “ridiculous” and an “intentional strategy” meant to distract.\n“I think there’s a recognition that Netanyahu is making Israel and Israelis and Jews unsafe all over the world,” Schatz said. “More and more of us are saying so and voting accordingly.”\nUS Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who represents a moderate district in New Jersey with a significant Jewish population and is now the Democratic nominee for governor in a traditionally blue state where Trump ran stronger than expected, said she has sensed a clear shift among voters.\n“We are seeing more and more people coming to: October 7 was horrific, the hostages need to be released, Israel has a right to exist, Netanyahu has been a really bad actor in this space, the starvation of people in Gaza is unacceptable, the idea that in rooting out Hamas you’re going to kill hundreds and hundreds of innocent children and families is not the way the United States conducts their support of their allies,” Sherrill told CNN in an interview last week. “So Netanyahu has to be held accountable.”\nAnd Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee and is considering his own presidential run, said after how he saw the Israel conflict resonate on the trail last year, “it’ll still be an issue” for 2028.\nAs for what comes next, Walz said, “People are going to have the conviction of how they talk about it.”\nWhen Netanyahu visited Capitol Hill during a trip to Washington in July, only a handful of Democratic senators participated in a bipartisan photo with him. Among those was New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, an adamant defender of Israel who was mocked on social media for seeming to stand in a way that his face couldn’t be seen in the shot.\nPrime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, center, meets with a bipartisan group of lawmakers including Sen. Cory Booker, right, on July 9, 2025, in Washington.\nSamuel Corum/Sipa USA\nBooker, who has been raising money ahead of another potential presidential run, told CNN that was just about a bad angle and he stood where the photographer directed. He said he agrees in being critical of Netanyahu, but “you cannot demand, negotiate, work towards a resolution of the conflict if you are not having conversations with the principal players that are doing those things.”\nLeaders of multiple Jewish and pro-Israel groups told CNN privately that they have grimly determined their best and most practical approach is to see what Israelis do in elections next year.\nBut critics have tried in vain for parts of four decades to wait out Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, a conservative who has stymied Democratic presidents going back to Bill Clinton. Netanyahu rejects the creation of a Palestinian state and has claimed there is “no starvation” in Gaza, even as his government has been under international pressure to permit the distribution of more aid.\nAnd there are still top Democrats who will stand with Netanyahu or at least limit the distance they keep from him.\nAsked whether they were ready to break with Netanyahu, an aide to House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries pointed to recent statements decrying violence and calling for humanitarian aid. An aide to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer did not respond.\nThe traditional AIPAC-funded trip of House Democratic freshmen to Israel, this year led by Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the former House majority leader, and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California, leaves later this week. The group is expected to meet with Netanyahu while there. A Hoyer spokesperson declined to confirm details of the trip, including whether the group would meet with Netanyahu.\nThe rare Democrat to stick with Netanyahu in public, voicing feelings that still resonate among some voters and donors, is Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman.\n“That’s the democratically elected leader. If you have to make a choice, Hamas or the democratically elected leader, I’m always going to stand with Israel through this,” Fetterman said. “I saw those pictures. Obviously it’s appalling, heartbreaking. Many people will blame Israel for that. I only blame Hamas, and I blame Iran ultimately.”\n‘We have to balance’\nZohran Mamdani’s June win in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary proved both that being unwilling to affirm support for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state or calling Israel’s conduct a genocide is not disqualifying, even in a city where Jews make up a large portion of the electorate.\nA mid-July CNN poll found just 23 percent of Americans saying Israel’s actions have been fully justified, in a 27-point drop from a poll shortly after the October 7 attacks.\nThe share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults saying that the US provides too much military aid for Israel rose from 44 percent in March to 59 percent. Democratic-aligned adults under the age of 35 are particularly opposed to US military aid to Israel, with 72 percent saying the US is doing too much.\nRhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, known much more for the seriousness with which he approaches military matters than for chasing political trends, said he voted for a narrow rifle sales stoppage amendment to last week’s resolution to get Netanyahu’s attention, though “we have to balance sending a message and also ensuring that strategically they can protect themselves.”\nBeing out of the White House and either majority in Congress limits their options, Reed said, arguing Republicans have not done enough beyond President Donald Trump expressing dismay over the photos of starving children and trendsetter Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene using the word “genocide.”\nSen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, during a hearing in Washington, DC, US, on June 25, 2025.\nEric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty Images\nBut Reed, 75, said he’s disturbed to see anti-Israel sentiment taking root anywhere, including among younger Democratic voters.\n“Part of it is they’re reacting to the scenes of the violence against children, and they’re also, I think, a generation that have not, like me, literally grown up with Israel, when you saw a struggling nation that had been persecuted worse than any people on Earth start building a real democracy,” Reed said.\nTo Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, another Democrat stoking chatter about a 2028 run, there’s no ambiguity in how to talk about it.\n“I know our political enemies want to make people believe that if you don’t support what Netanyahu is doing right now inside Gaza then you don’t support Israel. We shouldn’t concede that. We shouldn’t operate from a position of fear,” Murphy told CNN.\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, also being talked about as a presidential hopeful, said his own conviction is that “we always need an Israel that is able to defend itself, both for its and the United States’ national security, and also people shouldn’t be starving in Gaza.”\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who wrote the military aid resolution but also cautioned Mamdani when they huddled last month to be more deliberate about making clear he wasn’t anti-Israel or antisemitic, told CNN he thinks his colleagues risk losing an authentic connection to voters if they don’t rapidly change what they’re doing and saying on Israel.\nAsked whether that risked Democrats being seen as anti-Israel, Sanders pointed out that he is Jewish himself and decades ago lived in Israel for a few months.\n“To be anti-Netanyahu, anti-a-right-wing-racist-extremist government, that’s anti-Israeli government,” Sanders said. “If you’re against Trump, you’re not against America.”\nRahm Emanuel, whose middle name is literally Israel, recalled Netanyahu calling him a self-hating Jew when he was President Barack Obama’s chief of staff.\nDevoted Obama supporters raged at what they perceived as disrespect, especially as Obama approved aid increases, including for the missile defense system known as the Iron Dome. In 2015, Netanyahu broke protocol to go around Obama and address a joint session of Congress to blast the Iran nuclear deal the president was pursuing. By 2016, he was building up a supportive relationship with Trump, which eventually had him talking up the Republican just days before the close 2020 election.\nNetanyahu cleaved close to Trump to the point of hesitating to condemn the president’s “some very fine people on both sides” comment following the neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Last month, Netanyahu accepted an interview with a MAGA-friendly podcast and when asked about Mamdani’s position on Israel, responded first by talking about the candidate’s past support of “defund the police,” a favorite Trump topic.\n“He made a conscious decision to position Israel as a partisan political issue. Everybody warned him it was a mistake,” said Emanuel, a CNN contributor. “As always, he thought he was the only smart guy in the room.”\nNow Emanuel is considering a presidential run of his own. Asked whether he worried Israel support would be a litmus test, he said, “I don’t believe you can say where things will be in two or three years, but if we don’t change course, you can see where this road leads.”\nLeaders of multiple Jewish and pro-Israel groups told CNN privately that they have grimly determined their best and most practical approach is essentially to quietly wait out the trauma and hope the politics turns. There’s another Israeli election next year, and while Netanyahu is now in a minority coalition, he has been counted out before.\n“To the extent that Democrats are increasingly voicing their concern and disapproval on the situation in Gaza, this is largely aligned with where the vast majority of Jewish Americans are as well,” said Halie Soifer, the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, a group formed in the aftermath of Trump’s comments about Charlottesville and which she said has seen a massive increase in its membership since his second inauguration.\nThe party still faces deep divides\nMany American Jewish voters last year were driven toward Republicans by a mix of feelings that Democratic leaders were not pro-Israel enough and that they had been too accepting as some anti-Israel protests tipped into antisemitism. That was with Joe Biden in the White House, a president who was unabashedly Zionist and who in retrospect, several Democratic leaders say, should be seen as having staved off how much worse the humanitarian crisis has gotten since he left office.\nPresident Joe Biden joins Netanyahu and other Israeli officials in Tel Aviv on October 18, 2023.\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\nBiden’s actions and comments also fueled the “Uncommitted” movement and protesters who regularly interrupted his events last year, arguing that the same positions that others deemed insufficiently pro-Israel were in fact overly pro-Israel.\nBy November, Kamala Harris’ campaign had been tied into knots trying to satisfy all the factions. The widespread disappointment helped fuel narrow losses in Michigan and Pennsylvania, which both have large Jewish and Arab American populations, and beyond.\nThere are three major Democrats running Michigan’s open Senate seat next year: Abdul El-Sayed, who backed the Uncommitted movement and has accused Israel of genocide; state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who at a campaign event on Wednesday spoke about being a mother watching the suffering and said of Netanyahu, “We cannot let this man tell us that what we are seeing with our own eyes is not what is actually happening”; and US Rep. Haley Stevens, who has been praised by AIPAC for her support of Israel and described it in April as a “strong ally of the United States of America, a democracy, and a beacon of hope.”\nSchumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who leads the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, have expressed a preference for Stevens, who put out a statement last week calling for cooperation to get food into Gaza and Israeli hostages out.\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, the first Jewish leader of his state, said that he is not convinced the issue will move voters overall. But he said there is no way to look at the policy or politics and not be incredibly sad.\n“Democrats have a tougher line simply because Republicans say, ‘We’re all in with Israel,’ so people know to either go or leave, whereas people just get angrier at Democrats,” Stein said. “I think you can be a Zionist and critical of the government of Israel. I don’t think those things are in conflict. And the reason I think that is because that’s where I am personally.”","summary":"Fearing Zionism could die among Democrats, many party leaders are explicitly breaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try to stop anti-Israel attitudes from becoming a litmus test for next year’s midterms and the 2028 presidential primaries.

A new letter to recognize a Palestinian state is gaining signatures in the House. Devoted allies of Israel are speaking out against its government, brushing off whatever texts and phone calls they’ve been getting from the dwindling number of party voters or donors still standing steadfast behind Israeli actions in Gaza nearly two years after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack.\n\nIt’s no longer just the far left rejecting Netanyahu’s years of identifying more with Republicans. There is also a bitter backlash among many Democratic politicians, who have felt bullied by the Israeli government and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group, and there’s revulsion over the images of starvation and dying children.\n\n“We can disagree about a lot of things in the foreign policy space, but there’s no room to tolerate mass starvation,” said Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, who is Jewish and widely seen as one of the party’s future leaders in the Senate. Schatz argues there’s a conflation of opposing the Israeli government and opposing Israel’s right to exist that he calls “ridiculous” and an “intentional strategy” meant to distract.\n\n“I think there’s a recognition that Netanyahu is making Israel and Israelis and Jews unsafe all over the world,” Schatz said. “More and more of us are saying so and voting accordingly.”\n\nUS Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who represents a moderate district in New Jersey with a significant Jewish population and is now the Democratic nominee for governor in a traditionally blue state where Trump ran stronger than expected, said she has sensed a clear shift among voters.\n\n“We are seeing more and more people coming to: October 7 was horrific, the hostages need to be released, Israel has a right to exist, Netanyahu has been a really bad actor in this space, the starvation of people in Gaza is unacceptable, the idea that in rooting out Hamas you’re going to kill hundreds and hundreds of innocent children and families is not the way the United States conducts their support of their allies,” Sherrill told CNN in an interview last week. “So Netanyahu has to be held accountable.”\n\nAnd Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee and is considering his own presidential run, said after how he saw the Israel conflict resonate on the trail last year, “it’ll still be an issue” for 2028.\n\nAs for what comes next, Walz said, “People are going to have the conviction of how they talk about it.”\n\nWhen Netanyahu visited Capitol Hill during a trip to Washington in July, only a handful of Democratic senators participated in a bipartisan photo with him. Among those was New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, an adamant defender of Israel who was mocked on social media for seeming to stand in a way that his face couldn’t be seen in the shot.\n\nBooker, who has been raising money ahead of another potential presidential run, told CNN that was just about a bad angle and he stood where the photographer directed. He said he agrees in being critical of Netanyahu, but “you cannot demand, negotiate, work towards a resolution of the conflict if you are not having conversations with the principal players that are doing those things.”\n\nLeaders of multiple Jewish and pro-Israel groups told CNN privately that they have grimly determined their best and most practical approach is to see what Israelis do in elections next year.\n\nBut critics have tried in vain for parts of four decades to wait out Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, a conservative who has stymied Democratic presidents going back to Bill Clinton. Netanyahu rejects the creation of a Palestinian state and has claimed there is “no starvation” in Gaza, even as his government has been under international pressure to permit the distribution of more aid.\n\nAnd there are still top Democrats who will stand with Netanyahu or at least limit the distance they keep from him.\n\nAsked whether they were ready to break with Netanyahu, an aide to House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries pointed to recent statements decrying violence and calling for humanitarian aid. An aide to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer did not respond.\n\nThe traditional AIPAC-funded trip of House Democratic freshmen to Israel, this year led by Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the former House majority leader, and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California, leaves later this week. The group is expected to meet with Netanyahu while there. A Hoyer spokesperson declined to confirm details of the trip, including whether the group would meet with Netanyahu.\n\nThe rare Democrat to stick with Netanyahu in public, voicing feelings that still resonate among some voters and donors, is Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman.\n\n“That’s the democratically elected leader. If you have to make a choice, Hamas or the democratically elected leader, I’m always going to stand with Israel through this,” Fetterman said. “I saw those pictures. Obviously it’s appalling, heartbreaking. Many people will blame Israel for that. I only blame Hamas, and I blame Iran ultimately.”\n\n‘We have to balance’\n\nZohran Mamdani’s June win in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary proved both that being unwilling to affirm support for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state or calling Israel’s conduct a genocide is not disqualifying, even in a city where Jews make up a large portion of the electorate.\n\nA mid-July CNN poll found just 23 percent of Americans saying Israel’s actions have been fully justified, in a 27-point drop from a poll shortly after the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults saying that the US provides too much military aid for Israel rose from 44 percent in March to 59 percent. Democratic-aligned adults under the age of 35 are particularly opposed to US military aid to Israel, with 72 percent saying the US is doing too much.\n\nRhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, known much more for the seriousness with which he approaches military matters than for chasing political trends, said he voted for a narrow rifle sales stoppage amendment to last week’s resolution to get Netanyahu’s attention, though “we have to balance sending a message and also ensuring that strategically they can protect themselves.”\n\nBeing out of the White House and either majority in Congress limits their options, Reed said, arguing Republicans have not done enough beyond President Donald Trump expressing dismay over the photos of starving children and trendsetter Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene using the word “genocide.”\n\nBut Reed, 75, said he’s disturbed to see anti-Israel sentiment taking root anywhere, including among younger Democratic voters.\n\n“Part of it is they’re reacting to the scenes of the violence against children, and they’re also, I think, a generation that have not, like me, literally grown up with Israel, when you saw a struggling nation that had been persecuted worse than any people on Earth start building a real democracy,” Reed said.\n\nTo Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, another Democrat stoking chatter about a 2028 run, there’s no ambiguity in how to talk about it.\n\n“I know our political enemies want to make people believe that if you don’t support what Netanyahu is doing right now inside Gaza then you don’t support Israel. We shouldn’t concede that. We shouldn’t operate from a position of fear,” Murphy told CNN.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, also being talked about as a presidential hopeful, said his own conviction is that “we always need an Israel that is able to defend itself, both for its and the United States’ national security, and also people shouldn’t be starving in Gaza.”\n\nVermont Sen.

I don’t know why you haven’t endorsed me yet.’ So she comes back, and she tells me this, and I’m like, ‘The nerve!'”\n\nO’Brien, who has criticized the Democratic Party in the past, went on to claim that when Harris met with the union’s executive board, which had prepared a slate of 16 questions, she only answered four questions.\n\n“She really didn’t answer the questions, and then on the fourth question my chief of staff slides me an index card and says, ‘This is the last question. She’s not answering anymore,’ because she wanted to, like, pontificate and give her speech of why the country is the way it is, why we should endorse her.”\n\nO’Brien paraphrased her closing as essentially telling the union leadership, “‘Listen, I’m going to win with you or without you.’”\n\n“And it was like such a smug answer, like, okay, and that turned the majority of the people in that room off her,” he said. O’Brien then described their postmortem of the meeting, noting that many in the union leadership were turned off by Harris’ smug demeanor and body language.\n\n“You could smell it a mile away,” he said.\n\nThe Teamsters declined to endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential race, a move that sparked internal and external criticism.\n\n“Once we announced that there was going to be no endorsement, that’s when all the keyboard warriors came out and the attacks from the DSA and, you know, my friends that were allegedly my friends that were, you know, high-ranking senators of the Democratic Party,” he said. “Once I spoke at the RNC, then I was, you know, no good.”\n\nHarris didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"He described one off-putting encounter a Teamsters leader had with the 2024 presidential candidate in a photo op line:","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/06/us-news/kamala-harris-pressured-teamsters-union-boss-sean-obrien-for-an-endorsement-during-2024-presidential-campaign/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-biz43b7au-1754456495178.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754442125&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 05:14:25","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.499},{"id":348563394,"title":"Disdain and apathy in Washington DC","text":"I had never been to a protest where no one turned up. But on a recent evening in Washington DC, there was just me and the three organisers. It was an awkward situation, like a group waiting for the arrival of the friend they all like most; more solitude than solidarity. The situation was surprising, given the issue. The leaflets the organisers had been handing out the week before promised a “15-minute noise disruption” to “BLOW THE WHISTLE ON ICE”. Ice, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is Donald Trump’s migrant deportation army, which has a larger budget than the Italian or Australian military.\n\nThe organisers even chose an opportune spot, outside the entrance to a subway station in the NoMa neighbourhood, a gentrified Lego box of French restaurants and beer gardens and fairy lights just north of the Capitol. It’s like Shoreditch without the history. Federal employees, lawyers and charity managers populate the cookie-cutter apartment blocks – emptier today after Trump’s purge of the old regime. Call it liberal flight.\n\nI asked one of the organisers whether the power vacuum at the top of the Democratic Party might explain why no protesters had turned up, even in this progressive quarter. Kamala Harris had planned to do her victory speech last year a short cycle ride up the road. The day after the election, when she finally appeared, her obliviously cheery tone jarred with the funereal atmosphere. The politics of joy – that sickly, inane slogan, which captured the substance of her campaign – crumbled on contact with reality. Since then, the Democrats have been petrified by failure.\n\nBut the organiser didn’t want to get into that. He had an arid look in his eyes. He confessed regret at the turnout, then stressed that this was the first of many protests to come. His badge read: “I am the resistance,” with a stinging literalism. As we spoke, his expression became panicked. Perhaps this was because he was talking to a reporter. But if I organised a protest under the name Refuse Fascism and no one turned up, I would be panicked too.\n\nDisdain for democracy, rather than apathy, might explain the dearth of protesters. A few days before, I was in a bar in the neighbourhood talking to a man who had been an entrepreneur and was now a corporate manager. His deltoids looked like dumbbells and his favourite author was Malcolm Gladwell. He had a wife, decent money and a drive to succeed. He squirrelled down book recommendations as if he would actually read them. He also thought assassination was the only route out of this tyrannical age. One or two tech billionaires, he impassively evaluated, had to be shot as a warning to the oligarchy. I noted his own, personal success. He shook his head while sucking on a prawn tail and said I didn’t get it.\n\n“Have you heard of fuck-it money?” he asked. I had.\n\n“And fuck-you money?” Yes: enough to quit work whenever you want.\n\nHe said the tech barons had “fuck-you-I’m-going-to-control-your-mind money”. In a country where the median salary is around 25 per cent higher than in Britain, money here is really a question of power. The American middle classes remain the most prosperous people in human history. And yet, there is a hunger for a violent reckoning growing among the well-off, fatalist left.\n\nAt the protest in NoMa, commuters skulked out of the subway station, irritably declining to exercise their First Amendment rights. They looked drained at the idea of another year shouting on the pavement. The sun was unrelenting, but most chose not to wear sunglasses and scowled at the concrete. It was as if these liberal professionals feared a deportation van would screech around the corner as soon as they hoisted a placard. After a decade of Trumpian drama, they seemed to have lost their energy for resistance. In the summer heat, any residual hope sunk into the tarmac.\n\nI escaped to a bar down the road so as not to intrude on the organisers’ embarrassment. When I returned after my first cocktail, they were still alone, blowing whistles into the wind, rocking back and forth as if they were praying at the Wailing Wall.\n\nIf this is the level of opposition on the street, is there any more energy in the Democratic Party? Earlier that day, I had attended a round-table lunch with a member of Congress. The dining room teemed with Washington’s establishment journalists.\n\nThere is a split among Congressional Democrats between those who see Trump as an aberration to endure, and those who think his presidency means the death of democracy – which, in turn, justifies a dirtier form of opposition politics. In other words, do you meet Trump on his own terms and accept the tawdriness of American politics today, or loyally abide by the mores of a dying regime?\n\nMany Democrats still think, as Norman Mailer put it, that politics is “no more than a quarrel among engineers”. At another round table a few months ago, I asked whether the gathered Democratic elites actually wanted to be the party of the working class, and was met with resentful silence. Then, someone muttered a theory about controlling the “uneducated masses”.\n\n“Lots of [Democrats] want to bring a knife to a gunfight,” the member of Congress said disapprovingly at the lunch. They were very much in the existentialist camp, and spoke about a figurative insurgency against Trump. “If you don’t have an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] to hit a tank, then you use a shotgun, you throw some barbed wire on the ground.” They wanted the party to revolt against its obsession with process, which deadens its appeal to voters. The weak opposition to Trump’s budget bill in March was the moment this divide calcified. Some Democrats thought voting “no” would help Trump. At the lunch, they said they thought Democratic hopes lay in forcing “the [bureaucracy to] work for your big bold idea, instead of being absolutely owned by the bureaucracy”.\n\nYet Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary for New York mayor, the most significant irruption in the party in the past six months, shows something else. Mamdani offers what we might call polite, middle-class populism, conducted in a suit and fought on social media. Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist, manages to pit himself against the marauding Wall Street class without adopting Trump’s brash, indecorous type of politics.\n\nThat many party leaders want to break with bourgeois decorum – a last refuge of progressive dignity – speaks to their desperation. One Democratic staffer in Congress told me their colleagues were “very disappointed and disengaged”. Where five years ago Democrats “were running up and down the Capitol’s corridors trying to oppose Trump, lots of them now feel like it doesn’t matter”.\n\nAt a bar in Georgetown, north-west DC, I met a senior administration official well-versed in Magaworld, and recounted the lonely protest over a few beers. The White House considers most protests an inevitable reaction from progressives, and without political power – they are something to taunt, mock and goad. But some flickers of opposition are causing concern.\n\n“The only protest movement with any energy now is the Third-Worldist pro-Palestine, pro-Hamas and Groypers protest movement,” the official told me. (For the uninitiated, the Groypers are a crop of online young men who follow the white-nationalist streamer Nick Fuentes.)\n\nThe war in Gaza is fracturing Maga in two ways. First, many feel the special relationship between the US and Israel is incompatible with America First. Bending to the whims of a small state in the Middle East does not sit well with the movement’s hard-line nationalists. “The benefit of doubt that everyone, I think rightly, gave Israel after October 7 has been, if not entirely squandered, then at least stressed,” the official told me.\n\nSecond, anti-Semitism is prevalent among the online right, and dovetails with the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy-scandal. “The angriest reactions to Epstein are rooted in opposition to Israel,” the official noted. (Tucker Carlson has suggested that Epstein was working under Mossad orders to blackmail the world elite.)\n\nTrump supporters’ anger at the White House over Israel and Epstein shows that when Maga breaks with the president over a certain issue, the movement shifts right, deeper into the conspiratorial online frenzy. Recall the disdain directed at Trump over the success of his Covid vaccine programme, an America First victory he has chosen to forget. Or the pushback when the president proposed slowing the deportation of undocumented migrants working on farms. As Steve Bannon once put it to me, Trump is a moderate in this world, a sea wall against what is on the horizon.\n\nUS presidential elections don’t really start and end in Washington; they are simply the never-ending ambience of American life. Striving Democrats are already conducting covert campaigns. Ditto Republicans. Names that frequently arise in the latter party for 2028 include JD Vance, Marco Rubio, Tucker Carlson and Don Jr (Trump’s eldest son). Unlike the Democrats, Republican governors are scarcely mentioned. It’s unclear whether Trump will crown a successor or invigilate an Apprentice-style rivalry.\n\nLooming over the chatter is Trump’s mortality. The president turns 80 next year. Though he has deified himself into a messianic figure for his supporters, he cannot be resurrected. What follows will be a fight for succession that will be quasi-religious as much as political.\n\nLegacy is certainly on Trump’s mind. Republicans have proposed renaming the opera house in the Kennedy Center after the first lady, Melania. The White House has announced plans to build a grand, gold-dripping banqueting hall, partly funded by Trump, which would replace the East Wing. The real-estate dealer is reconstructing the country’s icons of democracy in his own image. Even in death, Trump will haunt America. \n\n[See more: How anti-migrant politics came for Deliveroo]","summary":"Democrats struggle to oppose Trump, while Republicans worry about his succession.","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/americas/north-america/us/2025/08/disdain-and-apathy-in-washington-dc","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/08/05/GettyImages-1229623207.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 05:01:00","author":"Freddie Hayward","authors":["Freddie Hayward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":348544840,"title":"Michael Goodwin: Sen. Warren backing Mamdani is the latest example of Dems floundering — and their zany agenda","text":"More than six months into Donald Trump’s highly consequential second term, Democrats are still looking for their sputtering resistance movement to deliver some big victories.\n\nInstead, they’ve suffered repeated failures and are responding with an increasingly angry radicalism that has zero appeal to the hearts and minds of most voters.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal poll found that a mere 33% of national respondents hold a favorable view of Dems, which the Journal called the party’s lowest point in its polls over three decades. \n\nIt also found that a stunning 63% of voters hold an unfavorable view of the party.\n\nThose dismal results are the fruit of a run of bad candidates —think Kamala Harris and Tim Walz — and a scatter-shot strategy that consistently defies common sense and traditional American middle-class values.\n\nThe impression is that party leaders and high-profile advocates are lurching from one temper tantrum about Trump to another, each delivered with the desperation of a Hail Mary pass.\n\nThey seem more concerned about the welfare of illegal immigrants, including gang-bangers, than about the physical safety and financial security of innocent, tax-paying Americans.\n\nComes now the latest example of their zany agenda, this one courtesy of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \n\nIn a few brief remarks Monday, she managed to prove that the passing years have not dimmed her gift for poor judgment and terrible ideas.\n\nMajor party headache\n\nHer new brainstorm threatens to become another major headache for her party.\n\nAppearing in Gotham with socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Warren declared that “New York City is the place to start the conversation for Democrats on how affordability is the central issue, the central reason to be a Democrat, and that delivering on it in meaningful, tangible ways that will touch working families is why we’re here.”\n\nIt’s a pretty strange thing to say given that it was almost exclusively Democratic mayors, governors and lawmakers that created the affordability crisis she now bemoans.\n\nShe went on to claim that Mamdani, the 33–year-old nepo-baby radical who won the Dems’ mayoral primary, should be the party’s national face.\n\n“Bring it on!” Republicans say, convinced that he would be a major drag for Dems in the 2026 elections.\n\nThe GOP would be delighted to run against a party that features a radical leftist who never held a real job in his life.\n\nIt’s worth noting that four years ago, then-Mayor-elect Eric Adams declared himself “the new face of the Democratic Party.”\n\nThe idea never gained much traction, with his tenure soon swamped by the tide of illegal border crossers waved in by Joe Biden, as hundreds of thousands made their way to New York for free housing, food and medical care.\n\nAdams never quite recovered, and that was even before he faced federal corruption charges brought under Biden that the Trump Justice Department dropped.\n\nNonetheless, the turmoil and critical coverage were such a burden that Adams passed up his party’s primary and is seeking re-election in November as an independent.\n\nAlthough he and the NYPD deserve great credit for driving shootings to historic lows, recent polls show the mayor’s support is stuck in single digits and sometimes falls below the slice of voters who say they are undecided.\n\nNY Dems shun him\n\nAs for Warren’s idea about making Mamdani the national model for the party, she is so deep in fantasy land that she’s even out of step with leading New York Dems.\n\nThey are avoiding the far-leftist candidate like the plague, which is what he could be politically in areas that are more balanced than the People’s Republic of New York, where there is just one registered Republican for every six registered Dems.\n\nAnd so Gov. Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries all have declined to endorse Mamdani, which is an exceptional rebuke to him and his platform.\n\nNormally, they would reflexively back the winner of the party’s mayoral primary, but they look ahead and see his major positions — defund the police, hike taxes, boycott Israel and support the anti-Jewish mobs disrupting cities and college campuses — as a toxic brew that even if it prevails in the city, won’t fly around the rest of the state or across the nation.\n\nThey see him as a major burden next year, when Hochul will be seeking re-election and Schumer and Jeffries will be trying to guide Dems to victory in their respective chambers.\n\nOf the group, Hochul has been the most outspoken and explicit in shunning him.\n\nMamdani’s plan to tax high-income New Yorkers would require legislative approval and her signature, and the governor made it clear that’s not going to happen.\n\nDays before the late June primary, Hochul threw cold water on the tax proposals he aims to use to fund his long list of free things, including buses and child care.\n\n“I’m not raising taxes at a time where affordability is the big issue,” she said in a TV interview. \n\n“I don’t want to lose any more people to Palm Beach. We’ve lost enough . . . so let’s be smart about this.”\n\nHochul’s answer was surprising in that she’s usually an automatic yes vote for new taxes, congestion pricing being a recent example.\n\nBut her answer was also clever in that she adopted Mamdani’s theme of an “affordability crisis” and turned it on its head to use it as a reason not to support him.\n\nShe’s right in the sense that when it comes to affordability, New York governments’ addiction to high spending and taxing already are major causes.\n\nTrickle-down pain\n\nCity and state regulations also amount to a mountain of expensive red tape that discourage construction as well as business and job creation.\n\nHer congestion tax is a good example of the trickle-down impact. \n\nThe price of every loaf of bread, bottle of beer and bag of potato chips sold in Midtown now includes a portion of the added tax she slapped on delivery trucks.\n\nMeanwhile, the state’s enormous budget reflects the way the government mafia grabs a piece of every action. \n\nAlbany is now spending $254 billion this year, more than $100 billion more than it spent a decade ago.\n\nFlorida has millions of more people than New York, but somehow manages to make do with spending $117 billion.\n\nThat’s almost identical to the city’s budget alone, which is $116 billion this year, up from $75 billion over the last decade.\n\nThese exploding expense budgets do not include the numerous “off-the-books” entities such as the MTA, public colleges and universities, the Dormitory Authority and scores of other lesser-known units that spend multiple billions of dollars they collect from the public.\n\nJust remember: As bad as things are, they can always get worse. \n\nAnd if Mamdani is elected, everything definitely would get worse.","summary":"More than six months into Donald Trump’s highly consequential second term, Democrats are still looking for their sputtering resistance movement to deliver some big victories.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/05/opinion/michael-goodwin-sen-warren-backing-mamdani-is-the-latest-example-of-dems-floundering-and-their-zany-agenda/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/080425-nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-109210599-e1754446205718.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 03:46:56","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":348547398,"title":"South Park takes aim at Trump administration again as series moves to Paramount+","text":"South Park will continue to take aim at the Trump administration as ICE descend on the fictional Colorado town in an upcoming episode.\n\nA teaser for the next episode, due August 6, shows Trump seated next to Satan at a formal dinner when he reaches under the table and touches the character’s thigh.

New episodes will continue to air on Comedy Central before being made available to stream.\n\nDespite the streaming move, co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone made it clear that they won’t be pulling any punches with the show’s explosive return to screens last month, its first episode in two years.\n\nThe episode launched a scathing critique of the president, referencing the recent cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Trump’s lawsuit against Paramount, and the prospect of government censorship.\n\nSeveral moments saw Trump in bed with Satan, who confronts the president over rumors that his name appears on the “Epstein list” in reference to documents from the investigation into deceased convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe episode also took aim at Trump’s recent lawsuits, including his legal battle with Paramount over the editing of an interview with Kamala Harris, which saw the president receive $16 million in a controversial settlement.\n\nWhen the people of South Park turn on Trump after Jesus is introduced as a teacher in the local school, the president sues the town’s people for $5 billion.

Then they \"crack\" the rest more thinly across the remaining districts to ensure losses there.\n\nIt isn't inherently illegal at the federal level unless electoral districts are redrawn along racial lines and both parties have been guilty of excessive manipulation to maximize their vote.\n\n\"I'd be happy to outlaw gerrymandering,\" Democratic strategist Mike Nellis, a former top aide to 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris, posted on X.\n\n\"I think it's ridiculous for politicians to draw their own maps, but I'm not for unilateral disarmament when Republicans are trying to rig the midterms.\"\n\nRedistricting typically happens once a decade after the census, but lawmakers have increasingly been inclined to break with that tradition.\n\nWhile Trump coasted to victory in 2024, his success wasn't contagious, and his party was left clinging to the House by a threadbare 219–212 margin. \n\nHistorically, the party in the White House loses ground in midterms, and Trump's team knows the clock is ticking. \n\nTo tighten his grip, the president has leaned on Texas to redraw its congressional map to create five new Republican-friendly seats. \n\nBut Trump and his party are not stopping with the Lone Star State, according to US media.\n\nRepublicans in Missouri and Ohio are planning their own redistricting to boost their representation in Washington, while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has made noises about addressing the \"raw deal\" conservatives got in the last Sunshine State redistricting round.\n\n- Democratic counteroffensives -\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic governors are preparing their own counteroffensives.\n\nIn California, Gavin Newsom has floated a potential special election to redraw the map -- a dramatic reversal in a state where redistricting power has belonged to an independent commission since the 2010s. \n\nIn Illinois, JB Pritzker recently hosted a delegation of Texas Democrats to talk strategy. \n\nAnd in New York, Kathy Hochul hinted at a redistricting push of her own, telling a Buffalo crowd, \"If other states are violating the rules, I'm going to look at it closely.\"\n\nGerrymandering is hardly a new phenomenon in US elections, but the latest escalation has sparked fears of what Hochul cast as a nationwide partisan \"war.\"\n\nOpponents say gerrymandering entrenches politicians, pushes candidates toward ideological extremes and erodes public trust in the democratic process.\n\nIt is also a risky business, and even the best-laid maps can collapse under the shifting ground of demographic changes and political overreach that tends to spark a legal backlash. \n\nThe term \"gerrymandering\" dates back to 1812, when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry approved a salamander-shaped district that sparked the term.\n\nAs the salamander digs in for 21st century elections, the consequences are more far-reaching.\n\nAccording to the Cook Political Report, just one in 16 House seats were competitive in 2024 -- 12 held by Democrats and 15 held by Republicans, out of a total of 435.\n\nDemocrats believe Trump's latest push may have crossed a legal line by coordinating with local Texas officials, citing the president's July 15 comment that with \"just a simple redrawing, we pick up five seats.\" \n\nThey also point to reports that senior Trump aides met with Texas Republicans to finalize plans.\n\nBut Daron Shaw, a politics professor at the University of Texas, said it was \"curious\" to blame Trump for the problem, given that deeply Democratic California is the country's most \"egregious gerrymander.\" \n\nLiberal Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts were also at fault, he told AFP.\n\n\"It's especially kind of rich coming from people in California and Illinois that have gerrymander significantly more egregious than exists in Texas,\" he added.","summary":"Donald Trump is pulling hard on the levers of power to strengthen Republicans through redistricting in Texas and other states -- the latest offensive in escalating moves by both sides to shape the battlefield of US democracy for the midterm…","url":"https://www.guampdn.com/news/national/republicans-and-democrats-go-to-war-over-us-election-map/article_fc56108f-9280-5c5d-9d46-9b32c9183d11.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/6e/56e96b5f-f701-56b7-9281-69c4be9240cb/6892bb18c6d51.image.jpg?crop=341%2C341%2C85%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 01:11:17","author":"Brendan Smialowski,Frankie TAGGART AFP","authors":["Brendan Smialowski","Frankie TAGGART AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gu","sentiment":-0.061}]}
