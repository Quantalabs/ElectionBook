But the screenings have stopped because of President Trump's mandated budget cuts.Tennant says he's worried for the younger workers.\"What's going to happen, I'm afraid, is your young ones, before they realize what they've done to their body, they're gonna have black lung, and the numbers is going to rise,\" Tennant said.Catherine Blackwood was a PhD scientist at the NIOSH facility in Morgantown, West Virginia, where she studied the dangers of mold exposure.\"I'm angry that we are just being cast aside,\" Blackwood said. Her job was eliminated April 1, along with over 200 others at the facility — from the people who oversee mine safety to those who study cancer-causing chemicals in firefighters. \"I'm really worried and fearful about what the impacts are going to be on the rest of us,\" Blackwood said.And it's not just about Morgantown.\"Every single person faces different hazards at their work every day. And without NIOSH, I think that we are all in danger,\" Blackwood said.Although some roles were temporarily reinstated in recent days, the Trump administration still plans to terminate all staff in the coming months, leaving the future of the health screenings and other programs in doubt.When asked about the cuts to crucial programs, a Health and Human Services spokesperson said in part: \"The department remains focused on cutting wasteful bureaucracy and eliminating duplicative administrative roles.\"But Blackwood says, \"The work being done at NIOSH was not wasteful. It was not duplicative. It was not redundant. The research that was being done at NIOSH was being done nowhere else in the world.\"West Virginia isn't only coal country — it's Trump country. He won the state in 2024 with 70% of the vote.Tennant, now retired, says he didn't vote for former Vice President Kamala Harris or Mr. Trump.\"He's looking at the coal-fired power plants, but he's also doing away with NIOSH that helps the safety of the coal miners,\" Tennant said.The budget for NIOSH was about $363 million in 2023, the same year that job injuries and illnesses cost Americans around $176 billion, according to the National Safety Council. Without NIOSH, officials say that number could be higher. \"I don't think it's hyperbole to say that eviscerating NIOSH, as they have, will cause people to die,\" Blackwood said.","summary":"The Trump administration's cuts to NIOSH have gutted crucial programs affecting millions of workers across the U.S.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/west-virginia-coal-miners-lose-black-lung-screenings-trump-slashes-worker-safety-agency-niosh/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/07/a3cdd0d3-67fe-4f2b-b613-46928e416739/thumbnail/1200x630/7da897b3d59100ac84a4a50fa3f1361f/duncan-eoa-niosh-cuts-050725-copy-01-frame-864.jpg?v=e61856d8e666e7ed5709adc37bb2d465","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3739288_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-05-08 00:17:28","author":"Jericka Duncan","authors":["Jericka Duncan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":318956888,"title":"Trump picks reality show star whose stepson was charged over Jan 6 riot for Holocaust Museum council","text":"President Donald Trump has appointed a Real Housewives of New Jersey star to serve on the board of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nSigalit Flicker, 57, was appointed by Trump on Monday along with four other new members to replace President Joe Biden’s picks who were axed last month, marking the first time a sitting president has eliminated board appointees ahead of their term’s completion.\n\nDoug Emhoff, former Vice President Kamala Harris’ husband, was one of the booted council members.

Now, with the release of her latest book, she’s a two-time author — and an all-time attention hog.\n\nPart memoir, part self-help, but mostly self-pitying, “Manual Not Included” is the book that no one asked for. And it acts as a companion to “The Baldwins,” the TLC reality show that no one watched.\n\nThat’s a lot of spotlight for a couple who really just want to be left alone.\n\nIn between writing about her adventures in breast-feeding and how she moved away from “gentle parenting,” Hilaria moans about the media’s red-hot pursuit of the endlessly fascinating couple.\n\nThe one-time “Extra” correspondent claims to be completely unmoved by the idea of fame.\n\nShe benevolently writes in the intro how she doesn’t “blame those who gossip; I feel for them, because they are a product of a system that most of us play into. We fear that if we question the system, we will get hurt and be ostracized.”\n\nWhen she’s not complaining about the intrusion into her privacy — while simultaneously begging us to come in — she’s dropping inanities that made me wonder if Kamala Harris was her ghostwriter.\n\n“I think there is a tendency for humans to reject the old and think that our contemporary world is the most evolved. It is probably why we constantly strive to grow and invent and change,” Hilaria writes in reference to nothing in particular. “How humbling it is to think that we all just exist in a moment in time and what is ours and new will soon become old.”\n\nSpeaking of old, she writes about her 90something grandfather, who was a veteran. And straight. But “he had one flag flying outside his home — the LGBTQIA+ flag. He wanted all to know that everyone was welcome and that straight men didn’t have to be so insecure about their own sexuality.”\n\nSure, lady.\n\nThen, there’s the love story with her 26-years-older husband which, she claims, got her pegged as a gold digger.\n\n“No matter who dated Alec Baldwin, she was going to be picked apart,” she writes. \n\nBut Hilaria was not picked apart. Doors were opened for her. She was given a gig with “Extra” and regular appearances on morning and daytime TV. During which, no one even questioned her “Spanish” background. People simply took her word for it.\n\nIf anything, she was treated well and — as she loves to point out — as a good influence on her notoriously irascible husband.\n\nThe tide only turned in 2020, when a Twitter user revealed the truth: She wasn’t Hilaria desde España. She was Hillary from Boston.\n\nThe book finally explains it all. She has ADHD and dyslexia, you see, which accounts for her bizarre Spanish-ish accented English.\n\n“Labels such as multicultural, multilingual, third-culture kids, culturally fluid, are attempts to capture what it is to belong and not to belong in a world that just wants to put every one in one simple box,” Hilaria writes. “We often gravitate toward one another. We sound different because we naturally code switch betweendifferent languages and mannerisms.”\n\nThen, my favorite line of the book: “I had a crash course in how some monolingual people really struggle with how I speak.”\n\nYes, the poor slobs who speak only one language are simply unable to grasp the singular gifts and enigmatic brain of the ever-versatile Hilaria. Perhaps this unique “code switching” of which she writes skipped my bilingual family and all the others I grew up with.\n\nBut thankfully, we don’t know her pain.\n\n“I’ve always wondered what it would be like to just belong,” she writes wistfully. “My father called me once when I was going through a particularly hard time and said, ‘I’m sorry I brought you up in such a complicated way.’”She seems to forget that her well-deserved public ridicule stems from the fact that her own husband told David Letterman “my wife is from Spain” — and at every turn, she’s perpetuated this vague Iberian origin story to obscure the fact that she’s a boring ol’ Yankee.\n\nShe can’t back out of the lie, so she’s keeps offering absolute nonsense. Hoping the monolingual morons will think it’s them, not her.\n\nAnd what would a Hilaria Baldwin tell-all be without a dive into her family’s side of the horrific accidental “Rust” shooting that left cinematographer Halyna Hutchins dead — and her continued reminders that her husband suffered too, physically and mentally.\n\n“The tabloid media will likely create headlines from this chapter,” she writes. “It’s what they do. But I ask that we all have the decency to look beyond the headlines and remember what happened — someone died.”\n\nIndeed, this did catch my eye. Because she’s used it as fodder to film a reality show and write a self-serving book. And her constant public picking at scabs does no good for anyone’s healing.\n\nHilaria claims to not need anyone’s approval, but begs for it at every turn.","summary":"Part memoir, part self-help, but mostly self-pitying, Hilaria Baldwin's \"Manual Not Included\" is the book that no one asked for.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/07/opinion/hilaria-baldwin-complains-about-fame-even-as-she-flogs-her-memoir/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/hilaria-baldwin-book_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/IKnHxF6v-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-07 22:40:18","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":318902398,"title":"Rogan mocks Canada for reelecting Liberal Party, says ‘dumba–‘ Conservative candidate refused to come on show","text":"Podcaster Joe Rogan on Tuesday marveled at how Canada reelected yet another liberal government after years of controversies.\n\nCanada’s Liberal Party won the country’s federal election for the fourth consecutive time on April 28. At one point, Pierre Poilievre appeared poised to become the next prime minister and lead his Conservatives to a majority government after Justin Trudeau announced his plans to step down. But in a turnaround sparked in part by President Donald Trump’s threats of annexation and his tariffs on America’s close ally and northern neighbor, Liberal Mark Carney won.\n\nRogan’s guest, hunting podcaster Cameron Hanes, brought up Canada’s infamous 2022 crackdown on the Freedom Convoy protest under Trudeau, when hundreds of truckers and sometimes thousands of protesters clogged the streets of downtown Ottawa by Parliament to protest vaccine mandates, coronavirus passports and other government restrictions.\n\n“People who donated to them got their bank accounts frozen,” Rogan marveled as he recalled the “insane” incident. “And then that same party just won again. Good job, Canada!”\n\nThe host then claimed that Poilievre rejected his invitation to be a guest on the podcast.\n\n“I offered to have that Pierre guy come on the podcast. He didn’t do it. Wouldn’t do it. Thought it was too problematic. Or whatever,” Rogan claimed, adding that a source told him “his advisers were telling him not to do it.”\n\n“Like, hey, dumba–,” Rogan added with a grin.\n\nTrump’s lengthy appearance on Rogan’s podcast was seen as a critical moment in the election, while then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ potential interview falling through came to be seen as a strategic blunder.\n\nSome observers have dubbed the 2024 presidential election the “podcast election” because of how critical the role of podcasts were in lieu of legacy media.\n\nHanes scoffed at people being concerned about coming on Rogan’s podcast, arguing he does friendly interviews, “You’ve never been the ‘gotcha’ guy.”\n\n“I would just ask him questions like, ‘What’s wrong with Canada,’” Rogan said. “‘How did this happen?’ and ‘Why did it go this way? What can be done to reverse some of these things that have been put into place?’ Like, ‘How did you feel about this? What would you have done differently?’ Real simple stuff.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. We’ve touched on polls before, but I don’t think I’ve seen anything quite as egregious in pollsters’ bias as recently when they apparently or supposedly or purportedly surveyed the first 100 days of President Donald Trump and the public reaction. \n\nAlmost immediately headlines blared, “Worst First 100 Days in History.” “Trump Drops From 52 to 42.”\n\nEverybody was confounded because the economic news was pretty good. Job growth was just spectacular. Over 170,000 jobs. Inflation was down. Energy prices were down. Corporate profits were up. There was a movement on the trade question. Ukraine still—there was no bad news except the controversy and chaos of a counterrevolution. \n\nSo, what were the pollsters trying to tell us? Or were they trying to manipulate us? And I think it’s the latter.\n\nLarry Kudlow, for example, the Fox, former Fox Business—I think he still is at Fox. He pointed out that when he examined The New York Times and The Washington Post polls, they were deliberately not counting people who surveyed that they were Trump voters in 2024. That was half the country. They were only polling about a third. Think of that. A third of the people that said they voted for Trump they polled. Not half. So, of course, their results were going to be disputed or suspect.\n\nBut here’s another thing. There were analyses after each of the 2016, the 2020, and the 2024 elections about the accuracy of polls, post facto, of the election. And we learned that they were way off in 2016. They said they had learned their lessons. They were way off in 2020. They said they learned their lesson. And they were way off in 2024. \n\nAnd why are they way off? Because liberal pollsters—and that’s the majority of people who do these surveys—believe that if they create artificial leads for their Democratic candidates, it creates greater fundraising and momentum. Kind of the herd mentality. “Oh, Trump is down by six. I don’t wanna vote for him. Then he won’t win.” That’s the type of thing that they want to create. \n\nI’ll give you one example. The most egregious. The most egregious of all these polls was the NPR/PBS/Marist poll. They have Donald Trump just very unpopular after 100 days. Very unpopular. This is the now-defunded Corporation for Public Broadcasting, that umbrella organization from which this poll was funded and conducted. \n\nDo we remember that poll? It was the one poll that came out the night before the 2024 election. They said that then-Vice President Kamala Harris would win by four points. And they said it was beyond the margin of error. And one of the pollsters said, “It’s her race to lose.” She lost by a point and a half. They were five and a half points. Did they apologize? No. Here they are again.\n\nAnd David Plouffe, one of the directors of the Harris campaign, just recently came out and said, “Well, we had all these inside polls we never disclosed. But not one of them—not one of them—had Harris ever ahead of Trump.” \n\nInside polls don’t lie because you pay somebody to tell you the truth. Nothing will get you fired and lose income quicker than to lie about a poll so that your candidate will be happy and rely on your false information. People don’t pay for that kind of stuff. \n\nSo, in other words, they knew the whole time—the Harris campaign—that 15 of those 20 polls, 19 polls that all had Harris winning the election, they were all false. Of course, they never said anything.\n\nAnd so, here’s my point. If you look at the polls that were the most accurate—Mark Penn was very accurate. He’s a Democratic pollster. But especially, the Rasmussen poll and the Insider Advantage and the Trafalgar poll. They joined together and they had a 100-day survey. Rasmussen—each day of the 100-day period that he’s issued a poll. And guess what? They have Trump ahead by anywhere from two to three points after 100 days. And they were the most accurate. \n\nAnd yet, what do these news outlets say that Trump—it’s a disaster. That he’s polling—no. He’s polling very well. Things are going very well. \n\nThe pollsters that indicate that people support him are the only pollsters that have any reputation after this decade-long polling disaster in which their prejudices, their biases, and their hatred of Donald Trump affected their results. And they were effectively in league with the Democratic candidate to create momentum rather than to adhere to a spirit of professionalism and honor.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

It’s important to me and I was excited to share it with the Holy Post and its audience,” the senator tells Vanity Fair.\nGillibrand broke down her reasoning during the podcast interview itself. “I asked my staff, ‘Please find venues and platforms and stages I can be on to talk about faith and to talk about how faith motivates me as a public servant, as a lawmaker, and as somebody in public life,’” the senator told podcast cohost Skye Jethani. She emphasized that, counter to claims from the right, she doesn’t believe Democrats are out of step with Christian values and language: “‘Love your neighbor’ I see as much more aligned with the brand of who the Democratic Party is than who the party of [Donald] Trump is today.”\nGillibrand’s faith isn’t news—she has attended a bipartisan Bible study on Capitol Hill since at least 2017—but she seemingly has a more vibrant religious life than she has previously let on. In her conversation with Jethani, she mentioned that she often travels to churches around New York State to give sermons on Sundays, adding that she has wanted to write a book about her faith but has had trouble finding a publisher.\nJethani, who previously served as a pastor and also writes an online devotional series called With God Daily, has been cohosting the podcast with Vischer for more than a decade. The media company, which has 112,000 subscribers on YouTube, is a small but influential outpost in the world of conservative Christians who have bristled at Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party, but have felt hesitant to consider themselves Democrats. Before the 2024 election, Vischer, Jethani, and their cohost, Kaitlyn Schiess, a popular Christian speaker and author, all discussed the idea of rethinking the Christian approach to voting. In the months since, they have criticized Trump without throwing their allegiances completely to his Democratic opponents.\nJethani tells Vanity Fair that he thinks Holy Post’s anti-Trump reputation might have attracted the attention of Gillibrand’s team. “We have been very, very critical of Donald Trump, and that’s partly because we come out of an evangelical community that has sold its soul in many ways to this person,” he says. “I think some people who come to our podcast go, Oh, finally here are some Christians talking about Trump in a significant and critical way. They make assumptions, therefore, that we are completely on board with everything that the Democrats say and do and stand for, and we’re not. We have critiques there as well.”\nJethani says he hopes that politicians will be circumspect about the lessons learned from 2024 and the impact of Joe Rogan’s platform. “The Joe Rogan lesson is not ‘do more podcasts.’ The Joe Rogan lesson is that people want long-form conversations with their political leaders and candidates that are not just a series of talking points. That’s easier to do on a podcast than a televised interview or a radio interview because of the format,” he says. “I agree with Senator Gillibrand that [Democrats] do have a messaging problem and getting on more podcasts would help, but then they also have to let their guard down in those settings, which I understand is risky and dangerous for a political leader.”\nThe stakes were high when Jethani asked Gillibrand about abortion, an issue on which the hosts of Holy Post have found themselves at odds with Democrats. “I know Senator Gillibrand’s position and I had no interest in challenging her on that,” he told VF. “I know the plank of the Democratic Party, and I know that it’s a fool’s errand to say, ‘We’re just going to sweep that away and change it.’ My concern is: Is this party open to people who don’t share their perspective entirely being a part of the party?”\nGillibrand’s answer on the podcast was definitely in line with Democratic rhetoric on abortion dating back decades. “I think it’s important that we as a party believe in bodily autonomy and equality and civil rights and civil liberties. And literally making health care decisions for women on any level is antithetical to that value. I think that value is a preeminent value,” she answered. “But if any candidate has their own view about whether they would ever seek an abortion or whether they would urge a family member to seek or not seek an abortion, that is entirely their right to have whatever beliefs they have. I would argue strongly, however, that trying to assert your beliefs on someone else is morally wrong and not consistent with, certainly, my faith, and it’s not consistent with the Constitution.”\nStill, her emphasis on civil liberties left Jethani and his cohosts groaning in their debrief of the interview. Jethani tells VF that he bristled because of the presumption that his position entailed “trying to impose this on other people for nefarious reasons.”\nUltimately, though, Gillibrand’s decision to highlight individual rights might have been a misstep. In the years following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, some advocates have spearheaded a new approach for responding to the deadly outcomes of the post-Roe world. In 2024, Democratic strategists hoped the party would make inroads among voters who had previously considered themselves pro-life, and Kamala Harris was an ideal messenger for the moment. During her speech at the Democratic National Convention last August, and during remarks at a high-profile Texas campaign rally in October, the former vice president spoke movingly of women whose lives were endangered or lost because they couldn’t access a timely abortion. It was an issue Harris cared about deeply, which stood out in a campaign that otherwise played it safe.\nThough Gillibrand gestured at health care, she ultimately brought the abortion conversation back to her personal faith, arguing that she sees the separation of church and state to be her fundamental value. “Churches who want to protect life as a sacred life, they need to be evangelizing. They need to be spreading their message,” she said. “That is the role of the church, to convince people that their view of these issues is the right view. But I do not think it is right for a politician to impose that view.”\nIt was an understandable answer coming from a lawyer. Still, it provided little information about her own beliefs and how her experiences in a faith community have informed them, and those are things a Christian listener would want to know. America is full of faith traditions and congregations that see reproductive justice as an important part of their political theology, and some of the moment’s most robust challenges to the post-Dobbs abortion landscape have been coming from organizations associated with Reform Judaism.\nJethani says he’s worried her answer is a sign that Democrats are still struggling with speaking to “sincerely religious” people on a variety of issues. “I totally respect Senator Gillibrand’s view on abortion.

Hand to God, that’s how I roll in the real world.” Miller and Longwell rolled their eyes, suggesting Last was less charitable in private. “I get a string of text messages from him,” Longwell said. “‘These fucking idiots,’” Miller joked.\nAt its peak, the livestream saw more than 3,000 active viewers, including fellow Substacker Chris Cillizza, with many chatting it up throughout. To Longwell, publisher of The Bulwark, this type of unfiltered community conversation is what subscribers are truly paying for. “I think the alchemy between us has been the parasocial relationships,” she tells me. “People feel like they are friends with us. One of us represents them.”\nThe media upstart, launched in 2019 by “Never Trump” Republicans, is thriving in a second Donald Trump term, with the outlet expecting to reach 100,000 paid subscribers by the end of May and 1 million general subscribers by the end of June. Since The Bulwark publishes little content behind a paywall, readers are presumably dropping $100 or more annually for a Bulwark+ membership to engage with the site’s prominent voices—and one another. “The thing that people really pay for is to go deeper with the community,” says Longwell, adding that the site could easily “convert much more aggressively if we put more things behind a paywall. But we like to say you can’t save democracy from behind a paywall.”\nThe Bulwark has already evolved since its earlier incarnation, which came in the wake of The Weekly Standard’s demise; it’s now meeting a new Trump era—and the resistance emerging alongside it—by expanding its capabilities for original reporting and video. The outlet boasts 1.25 million subscribers on YouTube, though, like other outlets trying to grow audiences on the platform, it’s still honing its strategy, wary of how an algorithmic tweak can throw things off course.\nStill, even while enjoying recent success, Miller says he would trade it all to not have to live through another Trump presidency. “I’d gladly not be hitting this milestone and be covering whatever is happening in Kamala Harris’s first 100 days,” he tells me. “But you know, that’s not what the fates had in store for us.”\nRecently, Miller has been channeling his full energy into the outlet’s YouTube offerings, posting videos on the platform usually six to eight times a day. The channel features a range of content with headlines like “Trump’s Latest Interview Should FREAK YOU OUT” and “MAGA Cultists Are IN FOR IT! Tariff Agony INCOMING!” Many videos include a thumbnail picture showing Miller with a look of astonishment mixed with disgust on his face, and many feature discussions with a range of guests, including Michael Steele, Tom Nichols, Derek Thompson, and George Conway.\nAround the time of heightened discussion around whether Joe Biden would drop out of the 2024 presidential race, Miller started putting more effort into the outlet’s YouTube content, with Longwell agreeing that they needed to not only meet their audience on the medium, but also understand “that the platform demands a certain way of presenting oneself.” It’s “just the language that people on the platform speak,” Longwell adds, also admitting that it was “difficult” at first to translate their written commentary—the presentation of which “looks a lot more like The Atlantic”—for the YouTube crowd, but “engaging in that platform’s language has really helped us grow there.”\nOnce they saw steady growth, Miller noticed what the platform’s algorithm was rewarding, leading to the channel’s transition into its current style. “There’s an adjustment to: How are we going to package the content in a way that will do well on YouTube so we can maximize the number of people that see it?” He remains acutely aware of not going “overboard,” saying that “you don’t want to mislead,” but adding that “it’s just the nature of the game.”\nStein had a desire to get back to the “upstart mentality,” which he experienced early in his career at places like HuffPost, where he was the site’s first reporter. “You have more freedom to be punchier and more direct with your reporting and more provocative with your headline writing,” he says. “That was all really alluring.” By the spring of 2024, Stein took matters into his own hands, reaching out to Miller to inquire if The Bulwark was hiring. “He’s like, ‘No, we’re not hiring. We have enough reporters.’ And I was like, ‘What about me?’” Stein recalls. Miller put him in touch with Longwell, to whom he pitched his experience at establishment outlets as an asset to help the independent media venture “operate and grow.”\nSomething that also made “the jump attractive is that The Bulwark had a more multimedia dimension to it,” compared to Politico, Stein tells me. “The chance to do some video was an added bonus.” (Stein, like Miller, is a familiar face to MSNBC viewers.) However, Stein expressed a bit of concern about “overinvesting” in YouTube, given how the news media has been burned before by social media algorithm changes. “It’s just—we’ve all lived through those episodes where you rely a lot on third-party platforms. We’re highly aware of that,” he says. “I just don’t want to get to a place where something changes and we’re like, Oh no, we overdid it.”\nWith that being said, Stein is ensuring the editorial future of the publication by building out the outlet’s reporting prowess through Substack newsletters. “It was really Sam’s vision to bring on a SEAL team of really talented people who he thought could take The Bulwark from a niche commentary space to a mainstream publication that still had a certain perspective,” Longwell tells me.\nThat team has included the likes of Adrian Carrasquillo covering immigration, Jonathan Cohn covering the administration’s institutional dismantlement, and Lauren Egan covering how Democrats are fighting back. The “cherry on top” for Stein was poaching Will Sommer from The Washington Post to cover the online right. “Over the years, the weird characters that he came to cover with his expertise, they’ve become like power brokers,” Stein adds, specifically referencing Sommer’s coverage of Laura Loomer. “There was, from the top down, a recognition that we are at a place editorially where we need to supplement our great essay writing, commentary, and analysis with original reporting, and that there’s almost a moral rationalization around hiring people who can dig in” on these specific subjects, Stein says.\nStill, The Bulwark won’t allow recent success to provide a false sense of confidence about the “economics of this industry,” according to Stein, who tells me, “We’ve seen plenty of outlets overextending in times of success.” The Bulwark is “doing things strategically,” he adds, “and with an eye toward making it sustainable from a business standpoint.”\nThe Bulwark has an opportunity to differentiate itself in the marketplace, suggests Longwell, as consumers see major media and tech companies as “kowtowing” to the administration. “Our authenticity has been a big part of the draw,” Longwell says, adding, “There’s a combination of the fracturing of the old media environment, along with Trump coming in, that has just created kind of the perfect storm in which we’ve been able to really thrive and grow.”","summary":"The Never Trumpers on Substack are nearing 1 million subscriptions while beefing up original reporting and churning out YouTube clips.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and eight other Democratic senators are urging the top shareholder of CBS News’ parent company not to cave to Donald Trump and settle the president’s $20 billion lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nIn a letter sent to Paramount Global boss Shari Redstone on Tuesday evening, first reported by The New York Times, Sanders and the other senators wrote that Trump’s complaint – which most legal experts have said is baseless and would likely get tossed out of court – is a “blatant attempt to intimidate the media and those who speak out against him.”\n\nThe letter comes as Paramount and Trump’s legal team are currently in mediation to resolve the case out of court, with the company’s executive board already laying out an acceptable monetary amount that they’re willing to pay in a settlement. Redstone, who has now recused herself from the board’s discussion on the case, has long pushed for a settlement in hopes that it will convince the Trump administration to approve Paramount’s merger with Skydance.\n\n“This lawsuit is an attack on the United States Constitution and the First Amendment. It has absolutely no merit and it cannot stand,” the letter stated.\n\n“In the United States of America, presidents do not get to punish or censor the media for criticizing them. Freedom of the press is what sets us apart from tin-pot dictatorships and authoritarian regimes,” the senators continued.\n\nBesides Sanders, the letter was signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Ma.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Ct.), Ed Markey (D-Ma.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Ct.), Dick Durbin (D-Il.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Or.). The senators also pointed out that Paramount’s own lawyers recently argued in court that Trump’s suit, which claims CBS engaged in election interference with its editing of the Harris interview, is “without basis in law or fact” and should be dismissed. \n\n“Unfortunately, it appears that Paramount is now seeking to settle this case with Trump for as much as $75 million,” they noted. “In our view, that would be a grave mistake. We urge you and Paramount’s board of directors to reconsider.” \n\nLabeling the case a “bogus lawsuit,” the senators said that “rewarding” Trump with millions of dollars “will not cause him to back down on his war against the media” but rather it would “only embolden him to shakedown, extort and silence CBS” whenever the network reported on issues Trump disliked.\n\nQuoting CBS News legend Walter Cronkite, the senators wrote that “freedom of the press is not just important to democracy, it is democracy” before making one final plea to Redstone and the board.\n\n“Stand up for freedom of the press and our democracy,” they concluded. “Do not capitulate to this dangerous move to authoritarianism.” \n\nA Paramount spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe letter comes just two weeks after 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens abruptly resigned because of corporate interference, claiming he was unable “to make independent decisions” on the direction of the show. Earlier this year, amid the president’s continued attacks on the show, Redstone installed CBS News veteran Susan Zirinsky as the interim executive editor overseeing standards, which saw Zirinsky serving as a check on Owens and serving as Redstone’s eyes and ears on the show.\n\nMeanwhile, after Trump raged last month about two 60 Minutes segments about Greenland and Ukraine and called for his hand-picked FCC chairman to take action, Redstone contacted Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks and wondered if it was possible to “delay sensitive stories about Trump” until the Skydance deal was sealed. \n\nIt would appear that the answer was no. This past Sunday, the newsmagazine ran a lengthy report on how the president is targeting “some of the biggest law firms in the country that he accuses of ‘weaponizing’ the justice system against him,” which included an interview with Democratic attorney Marc Elias, a hated figure in MAGA circles.\n\nThe president's anger towards 60 Minutes has only continued to fester this week. Four days after the program was nominated for an Emmy for its editing of the Harris interview, Trump took to his social media platform to gripe about the nod while boasting about his lawsuit.\n\n“[I]n a total slap in the face to anyone who believes in TRUTH and Honest Journalism, this Fake News Puff Piece has now been nominated for an award by the totally discredited Emmys,” the president blared on Truth Social. “Did 60 Minutes and its Corporate Parents apply to get an Emmy for an illegally falsified interview, or did other Fake Outlets nominate them for this dubious ‘honor’?”\n\nTrump added: “These antics are why the American People have no trust in the Press, and demand that the Media, very much including 60 Minutes, CBS, and its owners, be held responsible for their corruption and lies, which is exactly what we are doing in Court!”","summary":"‘Stand up for freedom of the press and our democracy.

At all.\n\nThe last Gallup poll taken before his disastrous June debate performance showed him at 38% job approval. The highest his approval rating rose in the early months of 2024 was 40%. A majority of voters had been saying for months that they thought Biden was too old to run for a second term. That included large numbers of Democrats.\n\nBiden is, of course, entitled to his own opinion about his presidency. But he is not entitled to his own facts. \n\nLater in the interview, Biden was asked whether the final outcome in the election might have been different if he had ended his candidacy earlier. “I don’t think it would’ve mattered,” he said.\n\nLook, it’s impossible to prove a hypothetical. Biden didn’t get out earlier. Kamala Harris lost. We know this. But consider what Biden staying in the race as long as he did meant:\n\nTens of millions of Americans watched the June debate and the Democratic panic that followed as the party tried to push Biden out. That happened right as the party would normally be building buzz for its convention and trying to define [THEIR OPPOSITION/MESSAGE AGAINST?] Trump. None of that happened until—at the earliest—September.\n\nBiden [GOT MORE?] unpopular. I know I made this point already but consider this: Democrats had a guy who less than 4 in 10 Americans approved of as their standard-bearer until the end of July! Every time swing voters thought of Democrats in that time, they thought of Biden! Not good!\n\nAnd there was no primary. Biden simply handed the Democratic presidential nomination to Harris. She received a total of zero votes from Democrats; she faced no opposition for the nomination. Had Biden dropped out a year earlier, in July 2023, there would have been a robust campaign to replace him on the ticket. Harris might have won anyway—I think she probably would have—but she would have earned the nomination in the eyes of voters rather than having it handed to her by a guy that the country didn’t approve of anyway.\n\nBiden is trying to re-emerge a bit of late—he will be on The View tomorrow—as he seeks to polish his legacy. I get it. But his comments to the BBC suggest to me he still really, really doesn’t get it. And that’s bad news for Democrats as they try to understand what actually happened last year and how to rebuild ahead of 2028.","summary":"ReutersFormer President Joe Biden sat for an interview Wednesday with BBC Radio in which he seemed entirely oblivious to the role he—and his decision to run for a second term—played in the Democratic party’s loss to Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nStart here: Biden said that the reason “it was hard to say, now I’m going to stop” was because his administration had been “so successful.”\n\nWhile it’s far too early to judge Biden’s presidency in historical terms, the reality of the 2024 race is that voters did not see him as a successful president.

More recently, Democrats gained a Senate seat in 2022 when Joe Biden was in the White House and Republicans gained two seats in 2018 during Donald Trump’s first midterm. \n\nThis cycle, Republicans are at risk of losing their hold on Congress if Trump’s job approval rating doesn’t rebound, but the overall natural partisanship of states with Senate races on the 2026 ballot favors the GOP. \n\nTrump won 21 of the 22 states where Republicans are defending a Senate seat next year; Maine is the lone GOP-held seat in a state where Kamala Harris finished ahead of Trump. If Democrats can finally find a way to defeat Sen. Susan Collins in the Pine Tree State — which is a big “if”— and win North Carolina, a swing state where GOP Sen. Thom Tillis is running, they would still need to gain two more seats for the majority. (And that’s assuming Democrats hold all of their own competitive seats, including Georgia and Michigan, which is not guaranteed.)\n\nNone of the other 20 seats currently held by Republicans look particularly promising for Democrats at this early stage of the cycle. But they’re going to have to break GOP winning streaks somewhere to have a chance of getting to 51 seats. \n\nDemocrats could target GOP Sen. Joni Ernst in Iowa. But Senate Democrats haven’t won the Hawkeye State since Tom Harkin’s reelection in 2008 and haven’t won a nonincumbent race for the chamber since his initial election in 1984. It’s also been 18 years since Democrats won in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and South Dakota. \n\nBut the GOP winning streak is much longer in other states. Democrats haven’t won a Senate election in Wyoming since Gale McGee’s reelection in 1970, haven’t won in Idaho since Frank Church won a fourth term in 1974, and haven’t won in Mississippi since John Stennis’ reelection in 1982. (The fact that Democrats mentioned Mississippi as a potential target in a recent New York Times article demonstrates how difficult the 2026 map is for their party.)\n\nDemocrats also haven’t won a Senate race in Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina or Tennessee since the 1990s. The longest GOP streak of this Senate class appears to be Kansas, where Republican Roger Marshall is up for a second term and where Democrats haven’t won since 1932. \n\nMontana and Ohio, where Republicans Steve Daines and Jon Husted are on the ballot, have seen Democratic Senate victories as recently as 2018. But those states aren’t encouraging for Democrats considering the incumbents in those races, Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, respectively, were regarded as great candidates and just lost reelection last fall in contests that weren’t even nailbiters in the end. And Democrats have won in West Virginia as recently as 2018 but don’t have anyone who can recreate Joe Manchin III’s success from almost a decade ago.\n\nSo why would Democrats have any chance of winning the Senate majority in 2026? Because streaks are made to be broken. Like in a football game, when an announcer points out that the kicker hasn’t missed a field goal in years, right before the kicker shanks it. There’s no permanence in politics.\n\nMore seriously, it will take an extraordinary set of circumstances for Democrats to flip the Senate — a combination of national and race-specific dynamics — because under a normal political environment, Republicans should hold and potentially expand their majority. \n\nSo how could Democrats pull this off?\n\nThe best evidence is probably Alabama. Doug Jones won a special election there in 2017, even though Democrats hadn’t won a Senate race in the Yellowhammer State in 25 years, not since Richard Shelby won reelection as a Democrat in 1992. With Trump in the White House and, most importantly, Republicans nominating Roy Moore, with his significant baggage, Jones broke the streak.\n\nSomething similar could happen this cycle in Texas, where Democrats haven’t won since Lloyd Bentsen was reelected in 1988. Democrats need a national political environment in which Democratic turnout is high, independents revolt against the first half of Trump’s second term, and GOP turnout is depressed, as well as state Attorney General Ken Paxton defeating Sen. John Cornyn in the Republican primary. Paxton doesn’t have the same salacious baggage as Moore, but Texas isn’t as Republican as Alabama. \n\nDemocrats may also need to hope for flawed GOP nominees in Louisiana and Kentucky, but they might have to rely more heavily on national dynamics there. Despite their electoral success in 2024, Republicans have a history of finding new ways to lose winnable races. \n\nFor now, Democrats’ challenge is recruiting quality candidates before it’s clear whether Republicans will have a flawed nominee or whether the political winds are blowing against the GOP. Democrats have to convince people to put their lives, jobs and families on hold to enter races that look like extreme long shots right now. \n\nSuch a risk could result in a 20-point loss or it could pay off with an upset victory, because, again, nothing is permanent in politics.","summary":"ANALYSIS — Democrats haven’t won a Senate race in Tennessee since Al Gore was reelected in 1990, but they might need to win there next year to win the majority.  While midterm elections typically go poorly for the president’s party, that trend is more evident in the House — Democrats had a net gain of [&#8230;]\n\n\nThe post Senate Democrats need to break some streaks to win the majority appeared first on Roll Call.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/05/07/senate-democrats-midterm-elections-majority/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/05/senate_luncheons210_050625.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 18:24:57","author":"Charles E.

Republicans don’t care as long it means a windfall for billionaires like Elon Musk,\" New Jersey’s Frank Pallone, the top Democrat of the House Energy and Commerce Committee who requested the CBO analysis, said in a Wednesday post on X.\n\nThe most destructive plan that Republicans are debating is ending a tax loophole 49 states use to get more federal funding for Medicaid expenditures. \n\nThe New York Times explained how this tax loophole works:\n\nIn its simplest form, the tax maneuver works like this: When a Medicaid patient goes to the hospital, the federal government and state usually share the costs. The ratio varies from one state to another, depending on how poor the state is, but the federal government often pays around 60 percent of the bill.\n\nStates that use provider taxes to get more money usually start by paying the hospitals more. If the federal government is paying 60 percent and the state 40 percent, when a state bumps a payment to $1,030 from $1,000, the federal government chips in $618 instead of $600.\n\nIf Republicans end this loophole, it would get Republicans much of their desired $880 billion in federal savings, but 8.6 million people would lose their Medicaid coverage, and 3.9 million people would simply go without health insurance altogether, the CBO said.\n\nNext up, the CBO looked at a GOP proposal to cap how much Medicaid pays states for each enrollee.\n\nThe Hill explained how those per-capita caps would work:\n\nA per-beneficiary cap would fundamentally change Medicaid from an open-ended entitlement to one with strict limits on federal spending. Congress would set a fixed amount per beneficiary for each state to receive, and states would be responsible for all remaining costs.\n\nThe CBO found that if Republicans capped spending for all Medicaid enrollees, it would cause as many as 5.8 million people to be kicked off Medicaid, with 2.9 million people becoming uninsured.\n\nThe CBO also looked at Republicans’ plan to lower the federal medical assistance percentage each state receives. Lowering FMAP rates would negatively impact Republican-controlled states the most, as many of those states receive the highest FMAP rates. Republican-controlled states make up nine of the top 10 states with the highest FMAP percentages, according to KFF, a health news outlet.\n\nIf Republicans reduce FMAP rates, 5.5 million people would lose their Medicaid coverage, and 2.4 million would become uninsured, according to the CBO.\n\nUltimately, cutting Medicaid to finance tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy is politically toxic. Polls show voters like Medicaid and don't want Republicans to use cuts to the program to fund Trump's tax plans.\n\nVulnerable Republican lawmakers seem to understand this, with many all but begging House GOP leadership not to make them vote to cut the program.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson allegedly ruled out two of those destructive Medicaid cut plans—the FMAP reductions and per-capita spending caps—Punchbowl News reported. \n\nHowever, Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska doesn’t seem to believe that, telling The Wall Street Journal that he’s been pressured to vote for those cuts. \n\n“Here’s the tactic they’ve been using: ‘Don’t worry about the Senate. They’ll fix it.’ And now we’re getting ready to take our third vote on this,” Bacon, who represents a district that Democrat Kamala Harris won last year, told the outlet. “We feel like we’re being pushed up to the edge of the cliff here.”\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of Congress and cannot by themselves vote down whatever proposal Republicans settle on, are using the CBO report to warn voters about what would happen if Republicans make these Medicaid changes.\n\n\"This is exactly what we have been ringing the alarm about. Republicans may claim they aren’t cutting Medicaid, but their actions speak louder than words,\" Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, wrote in a post on X of the CBO findings. \"That's why I'll keep fighting their attempts to slash it and rip away care from American families.\"\n\nAnd Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York had a more blunt assessment of the CBO report.\n\n\"Told ya,\" she wrote in a post on X.","summary":"House Republican plans to slash $880 billion from the federal budget would lead to millions of Americans getting booted from their health insurance, according to a nonpartisan analysis released Wednesday.\n\n\n\nDemocrats asked the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that analyzes the impacts of legislation, to review changes that House Republicans are debating making to Medicaid in order to finance President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which would extend his 2017 tax cuts for the rich and fund his evil immigration plans.\n\n\n\n\nA sign points visitors toward the financial services department at a hospital on Jan. 24, 2014.\n\n\nThe CBO's report shows that the varying Republican plans would lead as many as 8.6 million low-income Americans to lose their Medicaid coverage and either have to pay for coverage or go without insurance.\n\n\n\nIn analyzing five different Republican proposals to cut Medicaid spending, the CBO found that all of them would lead to many, many Americans losing their Medicaid ","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/5/7/2321019/-GOP-budget-plans-would-rip-health-care-away-from-millions?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1425520/story_image/AP25100620659039.jpg?1745596568","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 18:00:05","author":"Emily Singer","authors":["Emily Singer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.536},{"id":318871944,"title":"Bernie Sanders Urges Shari Redstone Not to Settle ’60 Minutes’ Lawsuit","text":"Opposition to CBS News parent Paramount potentially opting to settle a $20 billion lawsuit from President Donald Trump is growing, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) warning the network that doing so will embolden the government to continue targeting the press. \n\n In the letter sent to controlling shareholder Shari Redstone on Tuesday, Sanders nods to chatter that Paramount may reach a deal to resolve the case for up to $75 million.\n\n “Rewarding Trump with tens of millions of dollars for filing this bogus lawsuit will not cause him to back down on his war against the media and a free press,” the senator writes. “It will only embolden him to shakedown, extort and silence CBS and other media outlets that have the courage to report about issues that Trump may not like.”\n\n Last week, lawyers for both sides sat down to discuss a possible settlement. For Paramount, incentives to dispose of the case are high. A deal may open up a pathway for regulatory approval of its pending merger with Skydance. It’s believed that Redstone supports this avenue.\n\n By most legal observers’ thinking, the lawsuit is destined for dismissal because of industry-wide norms related to editing interviews. Trump pursues a novel theory revolving around arguments that CBS News’ editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign constitutes a violation of Texas’ consumer protection law covering deceptive advertising and unfair competition.\n\n In March, Paramount moved to dismiss the case under arguments that its editorial judgments are constitutionally protected free speech. It also challenged Trump’s filing of the lawsuit in a federal court in Texas, which has become a hot spot for legal battles advancing conservative legal causes. CBS is incorporated in New York, but Trump’s legal team chose to sue in the Northern District of Texas, prompting concerns that he’s cherry-picking judges by filing the complaint at a court where a sympathetic judge is likely to oversee the case.\n\n “This lawsuit is an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,” wrote Thomas Riney, a lawyer for CBS, in the dismissal bid. Trump seeks to “punish a news organization for constitutionally protected editorial judgments they do not like.”\n\n On this point, Sanders, who was joined by eight senators, writes, “We, and most legal experts who have reviewed this case, could not agree more. This lawsuit is an attack on the United States Constitution and the First Amendment. It has absolutely no merit and it cannot stand.\n\n The letter warns of escalating efforts to chill free speech if Paramount were to settle the lawsuit, pointing to the administration’s intimidation of the media and “those who speak out against” Trump.\n\n “Stand up for freedom of the press and our democracy,” Sanders writes. “Do not capitulate to this dangerous move to authoritarianism.” \n\n CBS News isn’t the only outlet that’s been targeted. Last month, FCC chair Brendan Carr urged the agency’s enforcement arm to open an investigation into Disney and ABC for allegedly maintaining discriminatory policies through racial quotas, among other things.\n\n Amid settlement discussions, Trump continues to criticize the network.\n\n “The case we have against 60 Minutes, CBS, and Paramount is a true WINNER,” he wrote on Truth Social last week. “They cheated and defrauded the American People at levels never seen before in the Political Arena.”\n\n Sanders was joined by Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.).","summary":"The letter signed by nine senators urges Redstone to \"Stand up for freedom of the press and our democracy.\"","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/bernie-sanders-urges-shari-redstone-not-settle-60-minutes-lawsuit-1236210041/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Shari-Redstone-Sun-Valley-Conference-GettyImages-1327838483-H-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 17:47:51","author":"Winston Cho","authors":["Winston Cho"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":318867250,"title":"Trump angered by Emmy nomination for '60 Minutes' interview at center of lawsuit","text":"President Donald Trump lit into the Emmy nomination for the \"60 Minutes\" interview at the heart of his massive lawsuit against CBS, saying Wednesday it was another reason for media distrust. Trump is seeking $20 billion for what he alleged was election interference with how CBS edited its interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the days leading up to the 2024 presidential election. The Harris segment earned an Emmy nomination in the \"Outstanding Edited Interview\" category, outraging critics, and not surprisingly, Trump himself. CBS aired two different responses by Harris to the same question on two different nights of programming, which turned out to both be part of one lengthy response to the same query. \"In a total slap in the face to anyone who believes in TRUTH and Honest Journalism, this Fake News Puff Piece has now been nominated for an award by the totally discredited Emmys,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"Did 60 Minutes and its Corporate Parents apply to get an Emmy for an illegally falsified interview, or did other Fake Outlets nominate them for this dubious \"honor\"? These antics are why the American People have no trust in the Press, and demand that the Media, very much including 60 Minutes, CBS, and its owners, be held responsible for their corruption and lies, which is exactly what we are doing in Court!\" COLBERT CALLS OUT CBS PARENT COMPANY PRESSURING ‘60 MINUTES’ The lawsuit has drawn extensive attention, with critics of Trump expressing concerns about the First Amendment and government overreach. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other Democratic senators have openly lobbied CBS parent Paramount not to settle the case and give Trump a victory. The Emmy nomination for the controversial interview raised plenty of eyebrows. \"The irony is, some folks at ‘60 Minutes’ are popping champagne over an Emmy nomination — for the same interview that landed them in legal hot water. It’s a reminder that these awards are voted on by other journalists, not the public, not their bosses — and certainly not lawyers,\" a source familiar with the inner workings of CBS News told Fox News Digital. The two sides have entered mediation in the suit, which is occurring in the backdrop of a planned multibillion-dollar merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. Paramount Global controlling shareholder Shari Redstone reportedly hopes to prevent potential retribution by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which has the authority to halt the transaction. CBS ANCHORS SALUTE OUTGOING '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER, SAY EFFORT TO SETTLE TRUMP LAWSUIT TIED TO CORPORATE MERGER Adding to the drama, \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens abruptly quit the long-running CBS News program last month, which he said was due to concerns about the show's editorial independence. \"60 Minutes\" anchor Scott Pelley confirmed on the air after Owens' announcement that Paramount was trying to meddle with the news magazine's stories. \"Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger,\" Pelley said. \"The Trump administration must approve it.

The letter said ActBlue delivered a \"lackluster response\" to queries on the matter. As recently as August 2024, however, the site had required CVV numbers for donations on pages observed by Fox News Digital, including former Vice President Kamala Harris' White House campaign. However, Republicans pressed ActBlue further, the letter pointed out. Steil's panel subpoenaed ActBlue for \"documents relating to ActBlue's donor verification policies, contributions originating outside of the United States, deplatformed entities, and reported unauthorized or fraudulent donations.\" \"ActBlue’s responsive documents confirmed that the platform accepted unverified payments during a period of record campaign fundraising,\" the letter said. \"Although ActBlue has since updated its policies to reject donations without safeguards such as a CVV requirement, the Committees’ oversight found that ActBlue implemented these changes only after ensuring that they would not negatively impact Democrat donations.\" Subsequent inquiries into whether ActBlue and related entities were meaningfully deterring foreign actors \"have shed some light on the nature of their operations, but many questions remain.\" The committees released a report last month, claiming \"ActBlue executives and staff are aware that both foreign and domestic fraudulent actors are exploiting the platform but do not take the threat seriously.\" BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY Fox News Digital reached out to ActBlue with a request for comment.

He believes [he has] a historical right to Ukraine. He can’t stand the fact that the Russian dictatorship that he runs, that the Soviet Union has collapsed. And anybody that thinks he’s gonna stop is just foolish.”\n\nThe Trump administration has suggested that Ukraine will have to accept the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russian forces as part of the price of peace — a concession the Kyiv government regards as a red line directly contrary to their constitution.\n\n“I just don’t understand,” Biden said, “how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, to decide he’s going to take significant portions of land that aren’t his, that that’s going to satisfy him. I don’t quite understand.”\n\nIn recent weeks, White House officials have urged both countries to speed up progress toward a potential deal — while also threatening to wash its hands of mediating the conflict altogether.\n\n“You’ve got a guy who wants to walk away from it all,” Biden said. “I’m worried that Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America and the leadership of America in the world, to deal with not only NATO, but other matters of consequence.”\n\nThe former president also defended his own administration’s level of assistance to Ukraine, telling host Nick Robinson that “we gave them everything they needed to provide for their independence, and we were prepared to respond, more aggressively, if Putin moved again.”\n\nBiden also condemned Trump’s expansionist rhetoric, in which the current president has mused about taking over Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal.\n\n“What the hell’s going on here? What president ever talks like that? That’s not who we are,” the former president said. “We’re about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post and was reproduced with permission","summary":"Former US President Joe Biden has given a surprisingly candid take on last year’s tumultuous presidential election that saw Donald Trump regain power.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/joe-biden-defends-lastminute-decision-to-end-reelection-bid-in-first-interview-since-leaving-white-house/news-story/8360cdaf55a30fcb79c8d4f17fb6d1c5?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f407811575f465fafd9b85119c6fb68c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 17:14:33","author":"Samuel Chamberlain","authors":["Samuel Chamberlain"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":318855594,"title":"‘What president ever talks like that?’ Biden on Trump’s leadership so far","text":"In his first post-presidential interview since U.S. President Donald Trump took office, Joe Biden equated the pressure the president is putting on Ukraine to “modern-day appeasement,” a reference to the British government’s pre-Second World War effort to curtail the Nazi’s invasion of Europe.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today program to mark the 80th anniversary of VE-Day (Victory in Europe), the former president said that Trump’s pursuit of Panama, Greenland and Canada has weakened global trade and diplomatic partnerships in the U.S. and spawned a sense of mistrust among its European allies and NATO, which was formed after the Second World War.\n\n“What president ever talks like that?” Biden said. “That’s not who we are. We’re about freedom, democracy, opportunity — not about confiscation,” he told the BBC’s Nick Robinson, adding that “Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America and the leadership of America.”\n\nBiden also said it was a “difficult decision” to leave the U.S. presidential race last year, four months out from election day, to make way for former vice-president Kamala Harris to take on Trump. He added that making the call earlier, as some critics had suggested, wouldn’t “have mattered.”\n\nBiden’s mention of appeasement refers to former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain’s efforts in the 1930s to weaken Hitler by offering Germany land to halt the Nazis’ annexation of Europe, which Biden likened to Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine should hand over Crimea to Russia and that parts of the country captured during the conflict should remain under Russian rule.\n\nTrump’s opposition to the war in Ukraine stems from his argument that providing aid is a waste of American taxpayers’ money.\n\nHe briefly paused U.S. assistance to the country in March but resumed it after signing a deal with Ukraine that granted the U.S. access to its expansive mineral resources, which the president argued could open the door to further U.S. aid.\n\nIn late April, the president said that Crimea, a strategic peninsula along the Black Sea in southern Ukraine that was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, “will stay with Russia.”\n\nThose comments came about two months after a now-infamous exchange between Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in the Oval Office, which Biden referred to as “beneath America.”\n\n“I don’t understand how they fail to understand that there’s strength in alliances,” Biden said of the Trump administration on Wednesday.\n\nAsked about Trump’s triumphant celebration of his first 100 days in office, the former president replied that he’ll let history pass judgment.\n\n“I don’t see anything that was triumphant,” he said.\n\nYou can watch the full video over at the BBC.\n\n— With files from the Associated Press","summary":"Asked about Trump’s celebration of his first 100 days in office, Biden said, 'I don’t see anything that was triumphant.'","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11168227/joe-biden-interview-donald-trump/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2194358329.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 17:05:17","author":"Rachel Goodman","authors":["Rachel Goodman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":318870938,"title":"Democrats can't wait for 2028","text":"Among the many problems Democrats faced in the 2024 election — former President Joe Biden’s obvious decline, a rejiggered ticket at the 11th hour, a slumbering economy and border crisis that Dems took too long to acknowledge — was their terrible timing.\n\nWhen Biden won in 2020, it was with an implicit promise to be a one-term president, a transitional one, not a transformational one, a “bridge” as he called it.\n\n“Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” he said two months into his term. “There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.”\n\nExcept, he wasn’t a bridge at all. After spending the next three years playing coy about his 2024 plans, essentially boxing out any serious contenders from emerging, including his own vice president, he officially announced his candidacy for reelection in April of 2023. No longer transitional, he was now a bridge to more of the same. A crumbling one, at that.\n\nHis broken promise, followed by his months-long refusal to step aside despite brutal poll numbers and the urging of his party, meant no Dems got a real chance to offer up a different vision. Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., made an attempt, but without the Democratic National Committee’s imprimatur, it was never going to be a serious challenge to Biden.\n\nBy July of 2024, the writing was on the wall. Biden couldn’t keep running. He could barely keep being president. With only three-plus months left to campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were left in a pretty undesirable position to try to beat an ascendant Donald Trump.\n\nIf Dems want to learn from past mistakes, there are a bunch they can choose from. But most urgently, they can’t wait again. They need to start running. Now.\n\nThe 2028 election may seem far away, but it isn’t. Voters need time to get to know their candidates, and the party needs a long runway to condition an environment for newcomers.\n\nUnlike in 2024, Dems need to have a robust primary — a real one. If the plan is to just run Harris again, Harris who gave a valiant effort but lost all seven swing states to a convicted criminal, and box out other contenders, the Dems will lose. Not because Harris is a flawed candidate — though she is — but because Democratic voters feel cheated out of an actual contest, and they feel let down by leadership, which insisted for too long that Biden could get the job done.\n\nA number of Dems look to be toying with a run.\n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been making the podcast rounds, and is set to headline a conspicuous town hall in Iowa later this month.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, an outspoken Trump critic, was in New Hampshire in April, where he gave a rousing speech to a group of Dem activists, officials and donors.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s long believed he was the Dems’ heir apparent, has been staking out some ground on his podcast, offering fresh criticism of his own party to appeal to moderates.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear recently said he’s contemplating a run.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have been packing arenas in an off-puttingly named “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, but he’ll be 86-years-old in 2028, while AOC will be old enough to run for the first time.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania’s Sen. John Fetterman and Gov. Josh Shapiro’s names have also been bandied about in Dem circles.\n\nWhatever you think of their qualifications or chances, there’s a sizable stable of Dems to take on Trump. That’s all fine and good, but they need to announce, not just flirt.\n\nThis isn’t a political climate in which Dems can afford to wait until 2027 to field their candidates. Other than a few, most of the aforementioned Dems don’t have huge national name ID. Remember, though Harris was the vice president of the United States when she was plopped onto the top of the ticket in 2024, undecided voters felt they didn’t know her.\n\nDems also need to coalesce around messages that will help them win in the midterms and 2028. So far, they haven’t found them. If presidential candidates announce sooner rather than later, some of those successful messages may emerge.\n\nTrump’s approval numbers are bad, and plenty of voters want to start imagining and investing in a candidate who can beat whomever Republicans field. Dems, give voters what they want.\n\nS.E. Cupp is the host of “S.E. Cupp Unfiltered” on CNN.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com\n\nGet Opinions content delivered to your inbox.

The two beat a third candidate, Republican Brian Frank, to advance to the general election this fall. \n\nPureval hopes to cruise to a second term in the Democratic stronghold after easily winning the 2021 election. He was poised to run unopposed until early February, when Frank and Bowman jumped into the race.\n\nBowman's campaign website says he was inspired to launch his mayoral bid after Vance's inauguration in January, \"an event he cheered with immense pride.\"\n\n\"There was nobody that pushed me into it, nobody that told me that this is a pathway I should go,\" Bowman told the Associated Press in April. \"But I just thought this would be a great way to help impact the city in another realm as well, because that's always been the focus.\"\n\nBowman, 36, is the founding co-pastor of a local nondenominational evangelical church, and co-owns a coffee shop in the same neighborhood, along with his wife Jordan. His main campaign priorities include money management, increasing public safety, improving infrastructure, lowering property taxes and protecting children, including \"safeguarding the unborn.\"\n\nWhile Bowman has called Vance an \"incredible role model,\" he has also stressed that his half-brother is \"not a political counselor to me.\" And he acknowledges the differences in scale.\n\n\"I need people to see that — that our job isn't to copy and paste what's going on in the nation,\" Bowman said Tuesday, according to member station WVXU. \"Our job is to say, however the nation's going, what's going to be best for the city of Cincinnati?\"\n\nBowman's relationship with Vance\n\nVance didn't publicly acknowledge his half-brother's campaign until Tuesday, when he endorsed him in a tweet just hours before polls closed.\n\n\"My brother Cory Bowman is running for mayor and is on the ballot today for the primary,\" Vance wrote. \"He's a good guy with a heart for serving his community. Get out there and vote for him!\"\n\nVance and Bowman have the same father, Donald Bowman, who died in 2023. But they did not grow up together: Vance was raised by his mother's side of the family and didn't have a relationship with his biological dad.\n\nAfter Vance's mother remarried, she changed his last name from Bowman to Hamel. Years later, he changed it again, to Vance — the last name of his maternal grandparents, who raised him. \n\nThe half-brothers both grew up in Ohio: Vance in Middletown, and Bowman on a farm outside of Hamilton, about 20 miles from Cincinnati.\n\nBowman has said that he met Vance — who is four years older — as a teenager, and fondly remembers playing basketball together. He said their bond strengthened over the years, in part because they both went to college in Ohio, got married and became parents around the same time.\n\nBowman graduated from Miami University in Ohio, then studied the ministry at River University in Tampa, Fla. That's where he met his now-wife, Jordan. They have three children, with a fourth due this summer.\n\nBowman moved to Cincinnati around 2020, the AP reports. Bowman's campaign website says he felt \"a call to return to his roots.\" While critics have seized on Bowman's relatively short residency in the city, he says he's always called it home.\n\n\"I truly believe this is the greatest city on the face of the earth,\" he tweeted in February. \"I may be biased. Maybe because … I grew up here. My greatest memories are here. My favorite food is here … the best people in the world are here.\"\n\nBowman faces an uphill electoral battle \n\nBowman and his Republican-affiliated primary opponent Brian Frank were the first Republicans to enter Cincinnati's mayoral race in 16 years.\n\nThe last to do so was Brad Wenstrup in 2009, who won a U.S. House seat several years later.\n\nWhile the race is technically nonpartisan — meaning candidates are listed on the ballot without any party affiliation — Cincinnati hasn't had a Republican-aligned mayor in decades. Voters elected an all-Democrat, nine-member City Council in the last election in 2023. \n\nWhile President Trump won Ohio by more than 10 percentage points in November, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris outperformed him in Hamilton County, home of Cincinnati. She won over 56% of the county's vote, compared to Trump's 42%.\n\nBowman seemed to embrace the challenge ahead in social media posts celebrating his victory on Tuesday.\n\n\"The greatest gift local government can offer its residents is a choice,\" he wrote. \"That's exactly what voters will have this November.\"","summary":"Cory Bowman, who shares a father with Vance, says he was inspired to enter the race after his half-brother's inauguration.

Bowman finished a distant second with 12.9% of the vote, followed by Brian Frank with nearly 4.6%.\n\nMunicipal elections in Cincinnati are officially non-partisan, but Pureval is aligned with the Democratic Party and Bowman with the GOP.\n\nBowman, 36, runs The River Church in the city’s West End with his wife, Jordan, and owns a local coffee shop. He and Frank were the first Republicans to throw their hats into Cincinnati’s mayoral race since 2009.\n\nBowman — the son of Vance’s estranged father, Donald Bowman, who died in 2023 — reconnected with his older half-brother when he was a teenager. \n\nThe elder Bowman put Vance up for adoption when he was in kindergarten, and the future VP was primarily raised by his maternal grandparents — whose last name he eventually took.\n\n“Hey Cincinnati!” Vance wrote on X Tuesday. “My brother Cory Bowman is running for mayor and is on the ballot today for the primary. He’s a good guy with a heart for serving his community. Get out there and vote for him!”\n\nCincinnati, like most major US cities, is heavily Democratic and went for then-Vice President Kamala Harris by more than three-to-one in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“You can’t get that far as a Trump-Vance Republican in the city of Cincinnati,” David Niven, a professor of politics at the University of Cincinnati, told the New York Times.\n\nPureval, the son of Indian immigrants, was the first Asian American to be elected mayor of the Queen City in 2021, winning 66.8% of the vote.\n\nBowman has accused Pureval of failing to make necessary infrastructure repairs, imposing a new zoning plan without sufficient review, and responding inadequately to a major snowstorm in January.\n\nThe Republican, who cites his half-brother as an inspiration for his own political ambitions, said he decided to run for mayor after learning that Pureval was likely going to be unopposed in his bid for a second term.","summary":"Cory Bowman, the half-brother of Vice President JD Vance, survived Cincinnati's mayoral primary Tuesday to compete in the general election.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/07/us-news/jd-vance-half-brother-cory-bowman-survives-cincinnati-mayoral-primary-reaches-general-election/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/104010305.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 15:44:39","author":"Elizabeth Karpen","authors":["Elizabeth Karpen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.423},{"id":318853350,"title":"'What president ever talks like that?'

We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity — not about confiscation.\"\n\nBiden defeated Trump in the 2020 election. Concerns about Biden's ability to handle another four years in office became manifest after a disastrous debate performance in June 2024. Weeks later, Biden announced he would bow out of the race, with his vice-president Kamala Harris subsequently unable to defeat Trump.\n\nBiden has returned to the public eye after leaving the White House in January, making his first speech last month in Chicago, where he lamented a Trump administration that had already \"done so much damage and so much destruction.\"\n\n'No better partner': Biden in Ottawa in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Biden made the first U.S. presidential visit to Ottawa in seven years.\n\n\"The United States chooses to link our future with Canada, because we know that we'll find no better partner — and I mean this from the bottom of my heart — no more reliable ally, no more steady friend,\" he said at the time.\n\nTrump has never come to Canada as president and has often derided former prime minister Justin Trudeau, and occasionally, without referring to her by name, longtime cabinet member Chrystia Freeland. Trump slammed both again on Tuesday, when newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney paid his first visit to the White House.\n\nFreeland was integral in hammering out with American and Mexican counterparts an update to the North American Free Trade Agreement of decades earlier.\n\nLike Trudeau and then-president Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, Trump officially signed off on that pact in 2018, and over a year later, the U.S. president was still characterizing it as \"the fairest, most balanced, and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law.\"\n\nAs his political comeback picked up steam, and especially since his November re-election, Trump has assailed the agreement and complained that Canada is \"ripping us off,\" suggesting that the U.S. doesn't need Canadian goods or resources.\n\nTrump has accused Canada of freeloading off of the significant military protection and equipment the U.S. provides, though the president has also offered up a number of dubious statistics regarding trade deficits between the countries.\n\nHe also assailed the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. via Canada, though all available numbers indicate the flow of fentanyl, as well as weapons, is greater in the opposite direction.\n\nTrump has threatened to apply various tariffs on Canadian goods and services, which has sparked nationalist sentiment north of the U.S. border and boycotts of some American products.\n\nPeriodic surveys dating back at least 60 years have evinced low levels of interest among Canadians in becoming part of the U.S. \n\nWhen asked Tuesday if he would respect the will of Canadians, Trump seemed to suggest that it could change \"over a period of time.\" Carney quickly responded that \"Canadians' view on this is not going to change.\"\n\nAt another point, Trump said \"never say never,\" over the prospect of Canada becoming a state.\n\nThe Trump administration has not explained why Canada would be a 51st state, given that surveys have consistently shown that a majority of Puerto Ricans — who are American citizens — would favour statehood over the current status as a U.S. territory. Even greater numbers of District of Columbia residents, surveys have consistently shown, would like D.C. to become a state.\n\nSlams Trump 'appeasement' of Russia\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Biden said the Trump administration's pressure on Ukraine to give up territory to Russia amounts to \" modern-day appeasement.\"\n\nTrump has said that Crimea, a strategic peninsula along the Black Sea in southern Ukraine that was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, \"will stay with Russia.\"\n\nEarly in his presidency, Trump ordered a pause in American aid to Ukraine — then resumed it. Last week, the two countries signed an agreement granting American access in an investment fund to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, though any payoff would be far off the horizon, as the Eastern European country, in addition to being under attack, has no commercially operational rare earth mines at present.\n\nTrump and his Vice-President J.D. Vance at times publicly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over a perceived lack of gratitude in an Oval Office in February, a display Biden described as \"beneath America.\"\n\nThe heated confrontation followed comments by both Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth in Europe that had leaders there questioning Washington's commitment to the defence of the continent.\n\n\"I don't understand how they fail to understand that there's strength in alliances,\" Biden said of the Trump administration.\n\nIn arguably his administration's greatest foreign policy accomplishment, Biden was able to lead a multilateral response of European nations and Canada to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. It has been estimated the Biden administration provided Ukraine about $500 billion US in military aid, along with billions in humanitarian assistance.\n\nBiden did receive some criticism from members of Congress from both political parties for delays in providing Ukraine with certain weapons systems, and it was reported that the administration balked at allowing Ukraine to strike targets within Russia with American missiles, before moving off that stance late last year.","summary":"In his first post-presidential interview, Joe Biden expressed dismay over his successor Donald Trump's statements about acquiring Panama, Greenland and making Canada the 51st state.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/biden-bbc-interview-trump-1.7528502?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7528614.1746629413!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/usa-biden.JPG?im=Resize%3D620","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 15:36:59","author":"Chris Iorfida","authors":["Chris Iorfida"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":318866914,"title":"Trump Rages at Emmy Nomination for ‘60 Minutes’","text":"President Donald Trump unleashed yet another blistering attack on CBS in response to news that a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris got nominated for an Emmy Award for its editing. \n\nTrump sued the network and its parent company Paramount Global in a $20 billion lawsuit in October—slamming them for editing the interview with the Democratic presidential nominee, he says, to make her sound better.

CBS has said the interview was not deceitfully edited, though its parent company Paramount Global has still tried to pursue a settlement in order to secure its merger with Skydance. \n\nOn Wednesday, Trump also branded the piece an “Election Interfering interview... which aired on CBS just before Election Day and deep into Early Voting.” \n\nThe president claimed that Harris’ answers were “unlawfully fixed, manipulated, and doctored throughout by CBS, in order to try and make Kamala appear at least somewhat coherent.”\n\nHe said 60 Minutes, CBS, and Paramount tried to hide the full transcript “from the American People” and refused to release it until after his Nov. 2024 election. The network released the unedited transcript in February this year. \n\nThe interview, he claimed, was “fake, corrupt, anti-Trump propaganda.” \n\nIt comes after Trump’s comms chief also slammed the Emmys for the nod. \n\n“Of course it’s nominated for best editing because it takes some serious talent to edit Kamala’s answer into something that’s coherent and understandable, which in the end they still failed to do,” Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital.\n\nCBS, meanwhile, appears undeterred by Trump’s legal case. On Sunday, 60 Minutes examined the president’s revenge tour against Big Law in a scathing episode.\n\nThe newsmagazine spoke with lawyers and firms who were targeted by Trump through sweeping executive orders aimed at cutting them off from the federal government.\n\nThe News and Documentary Emmys will be awarded in June. \n\nThe segment goes up against CBS’ interviews with Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the late Pope Francis, plus NBC’s interview with Celine Dion and ABC’s interview with Brittney Griner.","summary":"Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump unleashed yet another blistering attack on CBS in response to news that a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris got nominated for an Emmy Award for its editing. \n\nTrump sued the network and its parent company Paramount Global in a $20 billion lawsuit in October—slamming them for editing the interview with the Democratic presidential nominee, he says, to make her sound better.

Last Sunday, the Trump-loving far-right populist George Simion topped the first round of Romania’s presidential elections, securing over 40 percent of the vote and a realistic path to the top office. Echoing Trump’s pledge to “Make America Great Again,” Simion promises to “give back to the Romanian people what was taken from them”. He is not an outlier.\n\nIn neighbouring Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly embraces the mantle of Trump’s European standard-bearer. Trumpworld’s influence in the region extends beyond politics. Jared Kushner is spearheading a real estate venture in downtown Belgrade, and Donald Trump Jr has recently completed his second tour in months of Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria, rubbing shoulders with politicians, business elites and crypto entrepreneurs eager to forge ties with the Trump family.\n\nEastern Europe’s fascination with the “America First” president is fuelled by both ideological alignment and hard-nosed pragmatism. The MAGA message resonates widely across the post-communist landscape. A recent Gallup poll ahead of the 2024 United States election showed that 49 percent of respondents in Bulgaria and Hungary – and a staggering 59 percent in Serbia – preferred Trump over Kamala Harris. This is no coincidence. From the AfD supporters in former East Germany to the ruling Georgian Dream party in Tbilisi, illiberal actors across the region are rallying against the liberal democratic consensus. Their views on issues like LGBTQ rights, race, gender, multiculturalism, vaccines and Ukraine mirror those of Trump’s base. Trump’s friendliness towards Vladimir Putin has further enhanced his appeal in Russia-friendly nations like Serbia.\n\nThere is also a transnational dimension. Eastern European diasporas in the US tend to favour Trump, drawn by social conservatism or competition with other ethnic and racial groups. Their counterparts in Western Europe are similarly inclined, even as they benefit from the very open-border policies they often deride. In Romania’s recent election, 60 percent of Romanians living in the European Union and the United Kingdom voted for Simion. Many had previously backed Calin Georgescu, a far-right figure publicly defended by US Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference.\n\nAt home, elites see in Trump a potential enabler. A powerful friend in Washington who overlooks corruption and democratic backsliding could prove advantageous both domestically and internationally. The prospect of US foreign policy becoming indistinguishable from the Trump Organization’s business agenda is attractive in a region rife with opaque sectors like infrastructure, energy and mining. The recent US-Ukraine critical minerals deal is seen as a blueprint for currying favour with a transactional White House.\n\nThis relationship is already yielding dividends. In April, the Trump administration reversed sanctions on Antal Rogan, a close Orban ally, originally imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act by the Biden administration. The move has raised hopes elsewhere: in Bulgaria, tycoon and political heavyweight Delyan Peevski – also sanctioned under Magnitsky – is reportedly eyeing a similar reprieve.\n\nYet Eastern Europe’s Trump infatuation may prove fragile. Ironically, Trump’s economic nationalism threatens to undercut the very economies governed by his ideological allies. Hungary and Slovakia, both heavily reliant on automotive exports, stand to suffer under US tariffs. Slovakia’s car industry alone accounts for nearly 30 percent of national exports and employs 10 percent of the workforce. Even a modest 10 percent tariff could decimate jobs in Central Europe’s industrial belt.\n\nSuch economic fallout would have political consequences. In the Czech Republic, it might boost populist Andrej Babis, a Trump-like businessman. But in Hungary, Orban already faces a serious challenge from Peter Magyar, with elections looming next year. In Slovakia, Robert Fico governs with a slim majority and increasing public dissent – his long-term survival is uncertain.\n\nTrumpism has already proven a liability for right-wing allies in Canada and Australia. While Eastern Europe remains more receptive, the region is not immune to the risks of over-identification with a movement that pits itself against the European Union, liberal values and global economic integration.\n\nThe MAGA revolution may still fire up crowds in Bucharest and Belgrade – but its contradictions could just as easily burn those who embrace it.\n\nCourtesy: aljazeera","summary":"Dimitar Bechev Despite Donald Trump’s fraying popularity at home, there is a corner of the globe where his brand remains remarkably resilient: Eastern Europe.

She was fully funded, and what happened was, what we had set out to do, no one thought we could do.\"He added: \"We had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'I’m gonna stop now.'\"\n\nThe 46th president also insisted he never planned a second term and positioned himself as a bridge to a new era.He explained: \"I meant what I said when I started, that I’m preparing to hand this to the next generation... but things moved so quickly, and it made it difficult to walk away.\"\n\nHarris, 60, made a mark in history as the first Democratic presidential candidate in two decades to lose both the popular vote and the Electoral College – despite a massive $1 billion fundraising spree just months before.In one of his last interviews before exiting office, Biden told USA Today he believed he could have defeated Trump once more if he had stayed in the race – even though public polls pointed to a looming landslide loss. \n\nHowever, he admitted he wasn't sure he could have withstood another term.Biden previously admitted to a number of gaffes he made during his time in office, including how he \"screwed up\" during the debate and was \"stupid\" for not getting credit by putting his name on the pandemic relief checks his administration sent out in 2021 – as Trump did in 2020.\n\nHe also said the administration could've done a better job \"lifting Americans' spirits\" during the COVID pandemic.Additionally, some of the former president's closest advisers have admitted Biden's old-school governing style didn't always mesh with modern politics.\n\nJake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, said: \"The president has been operating on a time horizon measured in decades, while the political cycle is measured in four years.\"The BBC interview with Biden was filmed on Monday in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, as part of the 80th anniversary commemoration of the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nBiden took a swipe at Trump’s handling of Russia’s 38-month Ukraine invasion, slamming the administration for \"modern-day appeasement\" of Vladimir Putin – without naming him directly.He also criticized the Trump administration's suggestion that Ukraine should accept Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea as part of a peace deal, calling it a dangerous concession.\n\nBiden questioned how anyone could believe giving land to a dictator would end the conflict, saying: \"I just don’t understand.\"Recently, White House officials have pushed both countries to accelerate negotiations for a deal while also warning they might completely step away from mediating the conflict.\n\nBiden expressed concern over Europe's confidence in America's leadership, criticizing Trump's rhetoric about territorial expansion and defending his own administration's support for Ukraine.","summary":"In his first interview since leaving office in January, former president Joe Biden gave a chilling response when asked about exiting the 2024 presidential race.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/joe-biden-white-house-interview-admission/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/o0e74JgA5/0x0/joe-biden-white-house-interview-admission-1746624310070.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 15:01:03","author":"Juliane Pettorossi","authors":["Juliane Pettorossi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":318828454,"title":"They Helped Deliver Miami-Dade for Trump. Now They're Having Regrets","text":"A growing number of Venezuelan voters in South Florida, once among President Donald Trump's most loyal supporters, are rethinking their allegiance as his administration's moves on immigration have taken a toll on their fellow citizens.A new poll released Monday by Florida International University's Latino Public Opinion Forum shows the GOP is losing its grip on this crucial voting bloc, as the White House moves quickly to end protections for Venezuelan migrants and ramp up mass deportations.Why It MattersSince his January 20 inauguration, President Trump has rolled out sweeping immigration changes, marking a sharp escalation of his hardline enforcement agenda. These efforts have expanded deportations—even targeting noncitizens who had previously been granted legal permission to live and work in the United States.The White House's decision to revoke key protections for Venezuelan migrants—including Temporary Protected Status (TPS)—and to deport alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang to El Salvador without due process has left some of Trump's former supporters feeling frustrated and betrayed by an administration they once firmly supported, the poll shows.What To KnowTrump's move to terminate key protections for Venezuelan migrants has fractured the Venezuelan diaspora in South Florida. While many long-settled Venezuelans still support the former president, recent arrivals and mixed-status families are turning away—frustrated by what they see as a betrayal from an administration they once backed.Florida is home to nearly half of the Venezuelan population in the U.S., according to Pew, with some 118,000 alone residing in Miami-Dade County, where their political influence has grown over the past 20 years. Trump carried Miami-Dade by about 125,000 votes over Kamala Harris in November, according to state voting data, making him the first Republican to win there since George Bush in 1988.In the April survey of 408 Venezuelan residents in Florida, conducted by Florida International University's Latino Public Opinion Forum, nearly half of those who reported voting for Trump in 2024 said they now either regret their decision or have mixed feelings about it. About 40 percent of all respondents said they plan to support a Democratic, Independent, or non-MAGA candidate in the future.\"It was seen as a betrayal,\" said Eduardo Gamarra, the FIU political scientist who led the poll. \"We're observing an extraordinarily polarized community—one that's split between those who are citizens and those who are not, between those who have resolved their immigration status and those who haven't.\"Among the 32 percent of respondents who said they voted for Trump in 2024, Gamarra noted that disillusioned supporters aren't necessarily gravitating toward other Republican figures. Instead, they're stepping away from the party altogether. The survey also found that 39 percent of all participants are reconsidering their vote because of Trump's handling of Venezuela policy, with most of that shift leaning toward Democratic candidates.Still, a solid bloc of support remains. Among Trump 2024 voters, 35 percent said they are \"very satisfied\" with their choice, while 22 percent expressed regret and another 12 percent reported some dissatisfaction.A Generational and Status-Based DivideGamarra described the divide as deeply generational and tied to immigration experiences. \"Venezuelans who arrived before 2000 are the most radically Republican,\" he told Newsweek. \"But newer arrivals—many of whom are TPS or parole recipients—see the administration's policies as abandonment.\"That divide mirrors dynamics seen in South Florida's extensive Cuban community, Gamarra added. \"It's something we've always seen: those already here often discriminate against new arrivals, thinking they're not as good or that they're different,\" he said. \"There are class, political, and racial dimensions to this.\"The FIU survey also revealed the extensive reach of Trump's immigration policy changes within the Venezuelan community. More than 57 percent of respondents said they or someone close to them had been affected by the termination of Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans—21 percent personally, and 35 percent through a friend or family member. Only 41 percent reported no direct or indirect impact.About 80 percent of all respondents—including half of those who are U.S. citizens—called Trump's decision to end TPS unjust. Nearly as many voiced the same opinion about the shutdown of the humanitarian parole program for Venezuelans, which had previously provided a legal pathway before being suspended.That skepticism extends to how recent deportations have been handled. A solid majority of respondents—61 percent—said they do not believe the deportations were carried out in accordance with U.S. law. Just 18 percent said they were, while 21 percent said they were not sure.Political Consequences for Rubio and GOP AlliesThe political consequences may surface as soon as 2026. One of the final questions in the survey asked about views on Florida's congressional delegation—including former senator and now Secretary of State Marco Rubio—and the responses suggest a cooling of support.Rubio, once closely aligned with the Venezuelan exile community, recently sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that, according to Gamarra, \"didn't oppose cutting TPS.\" That move, he said, \"went down extremely badly—it felt like treason.\"Deploying a soccer metaphor, Gamarra added: \"The ones who were caught offside were [Mario] Díaz-Balart, [María Elvira] Salazar, and [Carlos] Giménez—the three Cuban American representatives who had campaigned hard in defense of immigrants.\"Whether this voter shift results in real electoral change remains to be seen, but Gamarra emphasized its potential significance: \"That 50 percent of Trump voters reconsidering their support could be decisive in [the midterms].\"What People Are SayingEduardo Gamarra, the FIU professor who led the poll, told Newsweek: \"From what I've seen in this recent survey, the solution to the problems of undocumented Venezuelans lies in the hands of those who have papers.\"Gustavo Garagorry, head of the Venezuelan American Republican Club of Miami-Dade, said in an interview with Politico: \"I'm really embarrassed by what's happening to Venezuelans... More than one is on the verge of a heart attack over this.\"Republican Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, whose district includes parts of Miami-Dade, told Politico: \"Do not be scared yet, because chances are we're going to be able to find a solution.\"What Happens NextUnless new visas are secured by April of next year, thousands of Venezuelan TPS holders could lose their work permits and face deportation. Miami Republicans, including Salazar and Diaz-Balart, are lobbying to create legislative solutions such as Salazar's reintroduced Dignity Act, which would combine tighter border security with paths to legal residency.","summary":"A new poll suggests President Trump is dramatically losing support among a core voting bloc that broke for him decisively in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/venezuelan-voters-miami-dade-florida-trump-2068811","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2639748/venezuelans-miami.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 14:59:40","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.091},{"id":318813298,"title":"Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha awarded Pulitzer for Gaza coverage","text":"NEW YORK (AFP): Coverage of the wars in Gaza and Sudan, and the attempted assassination of U.S. President Donald Trump, dominated the Pulitzer Prizes announced Monday at Columbia University in New York.\n\nConsidered one of the most prestigious awards in U.S. journalism, the Pulitzers also recognize literature, drama and music.\n\nThe core issues of the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign took center stage at the awards, which recognized coverage of Trump and his bloodied ear after a July 13 assassination attempt, as well as the loss of abortion rights for women in the United States.\n\nThe Washington Post staff won in the category of breaking news reporting for the paper’s “urgent and illuminating” coverage of the gunshot that wounded Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe prize for public service reporting went to ProPublica’s reporting on the deterioration of U.S. women’s access to abortion and reproductive health care, which profiled pregnant women who died after doctors delayed urgently needed care for fear of violating “vague” rules in “states with strict abortion laws,” the committee wrote.\n\nIn September, ProPublica reported on the 2022 death of 28-year-old Amber Thurman in a Georgia hospital, attributing it to a lack of care under the state’s restrictive abortion laws.\n\nHer death was later discussed by presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who blamed the rollback of women’s rights on the Supreme Court and its conservative majority.\n\nReuters news agency won in the investigative journalism category for its “boldly reported expose” of lax fentanyl regulation in the United States and abroad.\n\nImages from Trump’s assassination attempt made headlines worldwide, and a New York Times photographer won a breaking news photography Pulitzer for an image where the bullet could be seen flying toward Trump’s head at the campaign event.\n\nIn fiction, Percival Everett’s “James” was awarded for its “accomplished reconsideration of ‘Huckleberry Finn’ that gives agency to Jim to illustrate the absurdity of racial supremacy,” the committee wrote.\n\nLet it bring hopeThe Pulitzer for best international reporting was awarded to New York Times journalist Declan Walsh for coverage of the bloody conflict in Sudan, the illicit gold trade and regional negotiations at the heart of local clashes.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prizes are overseen by Columbia University, which was the site of many pro-Palestinian demonstrations and subsequent crackdowns.\n\nIt is currently embroiled in controversy following the arrest of foreign students who participated in demonstrations against the war in Gaza and are facing threats of deportation and expulsion from the United States.\n\nThe Pulitzer committee awarded Mosab Abu Toha, a Palestinian poet from Gaza, in the “commentary” category for essays published in The New Yorker magazine.\n\nThe committee praised his “essays on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combine deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year and a half of war with Israel.”\n\nIn a post to social media, Abu Toha announced the award and posted “Let it bring hope.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe Trump administration has attempted to end deportation protection for almost every immigration group but may have to wait on Haitians. A recent court ruling that allows Venezuelans to keep Temporary Protected Status bolsters the case for Haitians. A new analysis finds Haitians should prevail on their TPS court actions. They have done well economically in the United States and have crossed the border unlawfully at a low level following the extension of TPS in June 2024.\n\nA Judge’s Immigration Ruling Helps Haitians\n\nOn February 24, 2025, in a Federal Register notice, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that DHS would “partially vacate” the decision of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on TPS for Haiti. In June 2024, Mayorkas extended and redesignated Haiti for Temporary Protected Status for 18 months, until February 3, 2026. That action benefited Haitians who received TPS in the original 2010 designation and eligible individuals residing in the United States as of June 3, 2024.\n\n“Haitians have a strong case to block the Trump administration’s partial vacatur of former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’s decision to extend Temporary Protected Status for Haitians,” according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. An earlier NFAP report predicted (correctly) that Venezuelans would likely prevail in their case against the Trump administration on TPS.\n\nOn April 16, 2025, Amy Pope, director general of the International Organization for Migration, said at a UN briefing: “The situation has become much, much worse in recent months,” estimating approximately one million people are displaced in Port-au-Prince, with “almost nothing in the way of protection, particularly for women and girls.” According to Pope, “The capital city of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, is 85% occupied by gangs. It is impossible for people to go in and out of the capital city by road. . . . The safety is so far from being assured it’s just not safe.” She called the situation “dire.”\n\nIn a ruling relevant to Haiti TPS, on March 31, 2025, U.S. District Judge Edward M. Chen stopped Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from vacating the Mayorkas extension of TPS for Venezuelans.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPakistan Says 26 Killed After India Launches Airstrikes (Live Updates)\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, May 7th\n\nREAL ID Deadline Is Today–Here’s What You’ll Need To Fly\n\nJudge Chen ruled that plaintiffs would likely prevail on at least three grounds. First, the judge agreed that Secretary Noem lacked the authority to vacate Mayorkas’ extension of TPS for Venezuelans. Second, he ruled that the Mayorkas extension of TPS for Venezuelans was not “novel.” Third, the judge cited statements by Noem and Donald Trump and found it was likely “the Secretary’s decisions to vacate and terminate TPS for Venezuelans are unconstitutional because they were motivated at least in part by animus based on race, ethnicity or national origin.”\n\nThe National TPS Alliance, which can continue the legal effort on behalf of Haitians, brought the lawsuit on Venezuelans assisted by the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law, the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, the ACLU Foundation of Southern California and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. A separate lawsuit, Haitian Evangelical Clergy Association, et al. v. Donald Trump et al., was filed on March 14, 2025.\n\n“The plaintiffs have an extremely strong case on a narrow point of law in the Haitian Evangelical Clergy Association case before Judge Cogan in New York,” said Ira Kurzban, an attorney in the case. “The Trump administration lawyers, in the TPS Alliance case, have already conceded that they had no authority to terminate TPS by shortening the time period. They will have to explain that statement in the New York case to a no-nonsense judge who I believe will hold them to their word.”\n\nThe Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow it to proceed with ending TPS for Venezuela.\n\nIn addition to the arguments cited by Judge Chen, plaintiffs can contend that the Trump administration decided to terminate TPS before it conducted an analysis of conditions in Haiti. Such a predetermined outcome would likely be unlawful.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump declared he would end TPS for Haitians. “Springfield is such a beautiful place,” Trump told NewsNation in October 2024. “Have you seen what’s happened to it? It’s been overrun. You can’t do that to people. I’d revoke (the protected status), and I’d bring (the migrants) back to their country.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nDanielle Paquette wrote in the Washington Post: “Throughout American history, plenty of leaders have bashed immigrants. But never before has a presidential candidate—let alone a victorious one—vowed to banish a specific group from a specific city.”\n\nJ.D. Vance, now vice president, spread unsubstantiated rumors during the campaign about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, claiming they were eating their neighbors’ pets. Donald Trump’s presidential debate with Kamala Harris drew more attention to the rumors. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs,” he said. “The people that came in. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating—they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country. And it’s a shame.”\n\nBlaming immigrants for eating pets was an American urban legend before Haitians moved to Springfield, Ohio. “Do not too easily accept the statement . . . that Asian refugees barbecue pet dogs here ‘all the time,’” wrote folklore specialist Jan Harold Brunvand, professor emeritus at the University of Utah, in 1986.\n\nArmed gang leader Jimmy \"Barbecue\" Cherizier and his men are seen in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, March 5, ...

The Mayorkas Federal Register notice in June 2024 cited approximately 100 sources on conditions in Haiti, but the Noem notice cited only one source on conditions in Haiti.\n\nNoem’s Federal Register notice (February 26, 2025) claimed a small UN security force that arrived in June 2024 could improve conditions in the country. In a human rights report published two days after the DHS Federal Register notice, Freedom House concluded that the United Nations MSS mission did not help stabilize conditions in Haiti: “A culture of impunity in law enforcement leaves civilians in Haiti with little protection from the illegitimate use of force, and police and civilians are subject to lethal attacks by heavily armed criminal groups.”\n\nThe World Bank found, “Amid the lingering crisis, high vulnerability to natural hazards, coupled with violent gangs vying to gain control over business districts, the economy contracted for five consecutive years . . . GDP [Gross Domestic Product] is estimated to have contracted for a sixth year by 4.2% in 2024 behind the backdrop of gang violence.”\n\nHaitian Immigration Data Show Economic Success In America And Little Illegal Entry\n\nThe DHS Federal Register notice declared that it was “contrary to the national interest” to allow Haitians to remain in the United States. Noem implied that extending TPS for Haitians could be a “pull factor” for migration. However, the Border Patrol encountered only 64 Haitians at the Southwest border in July 2024, a month after Mayorkas extended and redesignated TPS for Haitians. The numbers have continued to drop, with 35 encounters in November and 31 in December 2024. In February 2025, the Border Patrol encountered only two Haitians at the Southwest border.\n\nThe National Foundation for American Policy found Haitians have integrated and thrived in the United States based on their income growth and other factors.\n\nOn average, real earnings for Haitians arriving between 1985 and 2009 increased by 46% 10 years after arriving in America compared to 25% for U.S.-born workers during the same decade. For Haitians who arrived between 1985 and 1989, real earnings increased by 75% in the 10 years after arriving.\n\nHaitian incarceration rates (in jail or prisons) are about half those of the U.S.-born: 1.2% for Haitian males aged 18 to 50 compared to 2.3% for U.S.-born males in the same age range.\n\nMore than 90% of Haitians speak English within a year of arriving in the United States, and within a decade, nearly all Haitians speak English, based on analyzing cohorts arriving between 1985 and 2009. For Haitians who arrived in America between 2005 and 2009, 98.6% spoke English 10 years later.

Get out there and vote for him.”\n\nReacting to his showing in Tuesday’s primary, Bowman said: “What I will say is that it looks like [Pureval] had a good head start, but we’re kind of catching up a little bit... So once I see the numbers there, I’ll know what our mission, our focus needs to be going into November.”\n\nPureval responded to his commanding win by thanking his supporters and saying the city remains “on the right path.”\n\n“Based on the early returns, I’m incredibly grateful for the citizens of Cincinnati giving us an opportunity,” he said. \n\n“Hopefully, it makes a positive statement. I’m not sure I can read anything into it other than the people think the city is on the right path.”\n\nHowever, he also warned against complacency among citizens, noting the worrying low turnout, which saw just 10 percent of eligible voters turn up to cast their ballots.\n\n“Given the chaos and uncertainty from the federal government, now is the time for voters to be engaged and exercising their voice,” the mayor said. \n\n“That is also on me. I’ve got to do a better job of making government relevant to people and making sure they see themselves in their local government.”","summary":"Cory Bowman, a local church pastor and coffee shop owner who has never run for public office before, sets up November face-off with incumbent Democrat Aftab Pureval","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cory-bowman-cincinnati-mayor-jd-vance-b2746415.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/07/11/09/Cory-Bowman-mro9gvb1.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mkdy67q9-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-07 13:48:53","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.117},{"id":318788752,"title":"Joe Biden finally opens up about the REAL reason he dropped out of the 2024 election","text":"Former President Joe Biden admitted he had a hard time bowing out of the 2024 presidential race after his agenda got going as he opened up about his difficult decision in his first broadcast interview since leaving office in January. \n\nBiden, 82, conceded to BBC Radio 4's Today program when asked why he didn't end his campaign earlier: 'I don't think it would have mattered.' \n\nAfter a disastrous debate against Donald Trump on June 27, Biden took less than a month to finally end his reelection bid on July 21, 2024.\n\nThat gave then-Vice President Kamala Harris just 106 days to build-out a presidential campaign, which she ultimately lost to Trump in November.\n\n'It's a question lots of people ask you, Mr. President – did you leave it too late? Should you have withdrawn earlier, given someone else a bigger chance?' BBC host Nick Robinson asked.\n\n'We left at a time when we had a good candidate,' Biden said of Harris in the interview that aired Wednesday morning. 'She was fully funded.' \n\n'And what happened was, what we had set out to do, no one thought we could do,' the former president added. 'We had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'I'm gonna stop now.''\n\nThe eleventh-hour decision has been widely criticized by Democrats who felt that if Biden gave into the pressure earlier it could have made a difference in the 2024 election outcome.\n\nBut Biden threw a wrench into his confusing defense when he told BBC that he always intended to serve only one term.\n\nThe former president said he wanted to be a transitional figure for the future of the Democratic Party after defeating Trump in 2020.\n\n'I meant what I said when I started, that I'm preparing to hand this to the next generation … but things moved so quickly, and it made it difficult to walk away,' he admitted.\n\nBiden's demeanor in the gaffe-filled sit-down was reminiscent of the latter years of his presidential term, riddled with mumbles, nonsensical rants and long pauses.\n\nHe struggled to properly articulate his thoughts, at times speak in whispers and refused to ever address the current president by his name.\n\nBiden told USA Today in one of his final interviews before ending his one-term presidency that he thought he could have won in a rematch with Trump if he stayed in the race.\n\nBut polling and public sentiment showed a very different story with Biden heading for a landslide loss.\n\nBiden opted for his first post-presidency broadcast interview to be with a foreign outlet. It was pre-recorded on Monday in the former president's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. \n\nThe interview was done under the pretenses of speaking with Biden on the day marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. \n\nIn the sit-down, Biden continued to lash out at his predecessor and successor.\n\nHe doesn't like the way Trump talks and how he conducts foreign relations – like musing about taking over Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal and renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\n'What the hell's going on here? What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are,' the former president said. 'We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.'\n\nHe also voiced worries about U.S. relations with Europe declining after Trump took over.\n\nBiden expressed 'grave concern' over the breakdown of post-World War II allegiances and called it 'foolish' to think Russian President Vladimir Putin would concede the war in Ukraine if parts of the country were given to the Kremlin as part of a peace deal.\n\nHe can't understand how Trump believes 'dictator' Putin would be fully satisfied if he is allowed to 'take significant portions of land that aren't his.","summary":"Joe Biden admitted he had a hard time bowing out of the 2024 presidential race after his agenda got going as he opened up about his difficult decision in his first broadcast interview since leaving office in January. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14687331/joe-biden-real-reason-dropped-2024-election.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/07/13/98129627-0-image-m-17_1746622603819.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 13:25:19","author":"Editor,Katelyn Caralle","authors":["Editor","Katelyn Caralle"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":318815446,"title":"‘What the hell is going on here?’: Joe Biden unleashes on Trump","text":"Former President Joe Biden broke his silence on President Donald Trump in his first interview since leaving office. \n\nBiden has largely avoided the public eye since leaving office earlier this year and has kept quiet on any criticism of the sitting president. However, he sounded the alarm on Trump in a scathing interview with BBC’s Nick Robinson that was published on Wednesday. \n\nBiden criticized Trump over his leadership on the world stage and scorched him for his treatment of U.S. allies and his desire to annex Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal. He also ripped Trump for his behavior in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this year.\n\n“I found it beneath America, the way that took place,” he said of Trump and Zelenskyy’s meeting. “And the way we talk about now that, ‘it’s the Gulf of America’, ‘maybe we’re going to have to take back Panama’, ‘maybe we need to acquire Greenland, ‘maybe Canada should be a [51st state].’\n\n“What the hell’s going on here? What president ever talks like that? That’s not who we are,” he told the BBC. “We’re about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.”\n\nBiden also spoke about Trump’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war and slammed Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine give up territory to end the war. \n\n“It is modern day appeasement,” Biden said, according to BBC. The BBC noted that Biden was making a reference to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, “who sought in the late 1930s to appease Adolf Hitler’s demands in a failed attempt to avoid a catastrophic all-out war in Europe.”\n\nTrump said he would end the war in the first “24 hours” of being president. He has since criticized Ukraine and Zelenskyy as he continues to claim that Russia wants a deal to end the war.\n\nBiden pushed back on that in his interview, according to BBC.\n\n“He believes he has historical rights to Ukraine... He can’t stand the fact that […] the Soviet Union has collapsed,“ Biden said of Putin. And anybody who thinks he’s going to stop is just foolish.”\n\nBiden also warned that democracy is “receding” around the world with Trump leading the U.S. When asked if he believed Trump was behaving more like a “monarch,” Biden sidestepped the question.\n\n“He’s not behaving like a Republican president,” he said.\n\nHe was also asked about Trump’s triumphant celebration of his 100 days in office that he marked last week. \n\n“I don’t see anything that was triumphant,” he said.\n\nBiden dropped out of the 2024 race just four months before Election Day and immediately endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him. He said he did not regret the “difficult” decision, saying it would not have mattered if he stepped aside earlier.\n\nTrump has repeatedly tried to blame Biden for nearly all of the woes he has encountered since being sworn in to office, including the high costs of eggs, inflation, immigration and the economy. He rarely misses an opportunity to denounce Biden, who has remained mostly out of the public eye since leaving office in January.\n\nMany polls show that Americans are not buying Trump’s excuses.\n\nWhen asked who was responsible for the state of the economy, 54% of respondents in a CBS News poll said it was Trump’s policies. Another 21% said it was Biden’s policies, 20% said it was both of them equally and 5% said it was neither of them.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Last Sunday, the Trump-loving far-right populist George Simion topped the first round of Romania’s presidential elections, securing over 40 percent of the vote and a realistic path to the top office. Echoing Trump’s pledge to “Make America Great Again,” Simion promises to “give back to the Romanian people what was taken from them”. He is not an outlier.\n\nIn neighbouring Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly embraces the mantle of Trump’s European standard-bearer. Trumpworld’s influence in the region extends beyond politics. Jared Kushner is spearheading a real estate venture in downtown Belgrade, and Donald Trump Jr has recently completed his second tour in months of Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria, rubbing shoulders with politicians, business elites and crypto entrepreneurs eager to forge ties with the Trump family.\n\nEastern Europe’s fascination with the “America First” president is fuelled by both ideological alignment and hard-nosed pragmatism. The MAGA message resonates widely across the post-communist landscape. A recent Gallup poll ahead of the 2024 United States election showed that 49 percent of respondents in Bulgaria and Hungary – and a staggering 59 percent in Serbia – preferred Trump over Kamala Harris. This is no coincidence. From the AfD supporters in former East Germany to the ruling Georgian Dream party in Tbilisi, illiberal actors across the region are rallying against the liberal democratic consensus. Their views on issues like LGBTQ rights, race, gender, multiculturalism, vaccines and Ukraine mirror those of Trump’s base. Trump’s friendliness towards Vladimir Putin has further enhanced his appeal in Russia-friendly nations like Serbia.\n\nThere is also a transnational dimension. Eastern European diasporas in the US tend to favour Trump, drawn by social conservatism or competition with other ethnic and racial groups. Their counterparts in Western Europe are similarly inclined, even as they benefit from the very open-border policies they often deride. In Romania’s recent election, 60 percent of Romanians living in the European Union and the United Kingdom voted for Simion. Many had previously backed Calin Georgescu, a far-right figure publicly defended by US Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference.\n\nAt home, elites see in Trump a potential enabler. A powerful friend in Washington who overlooks corruption and democratic backsliding could prove advantageous both domestically and internationally. The prospect of US foreign policy becoming indistinguishable from the Trump Organization’s business agenda is attractive in a region rife with opaque sectors like infrastructure, energy and mining. The recent US-Ukraine critical minerals deal is seen as a blueprint for currying favour with a transactional White House.\n\nThis relationship is already yielding dividends. In April, the Trump administration reversed sanctions on Antal Rogan, a close Orban ally, originally imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act by the Biden administration. The move has raised hopes elsewhere: in Bulgaria, tycoon and political heavyweight Delyan Peevski – also sanctioned under Magnitsky – is reportedly eyeing a similar reprieve.\n\nYet Eastern Europe’s Trump infatuation may prove fragile. Ironically, Trump’s economic nationalism threatens to undercut the very economies governed by his ideological allies. Hungary and Slovakia, both heavily reliant on automotive exports, stand to suffer under US tariffs. Slovakia’s car industry alone accounts for nearly 30 percent of national exports and employs 10 percent of the workforce. Even a modest 10 percent tariff could decimate jobs in Central Europe’s industrial belt.\n\nSuch economic fallout would have political consequences. In the Czech Republic, it might boost populist Andrej Babis, a Trump-like businessman. But in Hungary, Orban already faces a serious challenge from Peter Magyar, with elections looming next year. In Slovakia, Robert Fico governs with a slim majority and increasing public dissent – his long-term survival is uncertain.\n\nTrumpism has already proven a liability for right-wing allies in Canada and Australia. While Eastern Europe remains more receptive, the region is not immune to the risks of over-identification with a movement that pits itself against the European Union, liberal values and global economic integration.\n\nThe MAGA revolution may still fire up crowds in Bucharest and Belgrade – but its contradictions could just as easily burn those who embrace it.","summary":"Eastern Europe’s love affair with Trump runs deep - but economic fallout may soon cool the romance.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/5/7/eastern-europe-bets-on-trump-but-at-what-cost?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-12T042113Z_1495448614_RC2GT8AXZUVF_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-ORBAN-1720758824.jpg?resize=1920%2C1280&quality=80","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 13:02:31","author":"Apps Support,Dimitar Bechev","authors":["Apps Support","Dimitar Bechev"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.522},{"id":318940996,"title":"MSNBC's New Show Asks If Trump Defunded PBS Because He Thinks Elmo Is Black","text":"Tuesday saw the second-ever installment of MSNBC’s The Weeknight, featuring Alicia Menendez, former Kamala Harris spokeswoman Symone Sanders-Townsend, and former RNC chairman and current liberal talking points repeater Michael Steele.

But also, we're talking about Big Bird and, like, Elmo and, I just like, do they think Elmo is black? Maybe that's it.
