It didn’t sit well with a lot of people, who found it to be tasteless and self obsessed. That is except for actual headliner Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, who appeared to find the whole thing very funny and even donned a “Brat” hat for his own performance.\n\nCharli knows better than to pull a stunt like that again — as we’ve learned from her ever-changing Apple girls (this time Gracie Abrams) she doesn’t do repeats — but if she’d whipped that sash back out for Glastonbury 2025, it would have been totally warranted.\n\nThe 32-year-old singer, real name Charlotte Aitchison, has become the reigning queen of dance pop over the past two years with her mega Brat album rollout and the subsequent remix album, Brat and it’s completely different but also still Brat. “Brat summer”, the hedonistic season of messy fun inspired by the album, was referenced by everyone from Kamala Harris and Barack Obama to Gwyneth Paltrow, and it featured heavily in the 2024 US Presidential race.\n\nFor 2025, Charli brought the full Brat experience to Glastonbury. No guests, just pure Charli — good camera work, neggy crowd work that everyone loved, twerking in artificial rain. Even though much had been speculated over the potential of Lorde or Billie Eilish coming out, those speculations quickly died out as soon as their relevant tracks were played. Charli was good enough on her own.\n\nCharli xcx was also present last year, but her DJ set was so vastly oversubscribed that many failed to access the stage and it even allegedly prompted an emergency meeting of senior Glasto bosses. This year she was bumped up to the Other Stage and strategically placed at the same time as Doechii (who has a similarly young, feral fan base) and Neil Young, the headliner, who had a depressingly small crowd for a Saturday night headliner. \n\nBut it wouldn’t have been out of the question to have bumped Charli all the way up to the Pyramid. It will be widely accepted that she should have replaced Olivia Rodrigo this year, and that Glastonbury *still* doesn’t quite get the pull of electronic music, as much as they keep trying,\n\nOpening with 365, the tone was set from the outset. Eyes widened, jaws unhinged, arms raised, the crowd literally went wild. Aitchison then led the crowd through a number of other Brat hits such as 360, Club Classics and Apple — wise, considering that most of the people there probably became fans in 2024. But she played to the fans too — Charli Stan favourites like Unlock It and Vroom Vroom were peppered throughout. \n\nSlower moments of the set were less saggy and more cathartic, like a breath of fresh air during a come up, with newly minted fan favourite Party 4 U taking fans from mad, feverish rapping to pure emotion in mere seconds. Track 10, which Aitchison has described as a rite of passage song that she must perform every single time she’s on stage, gave everyone a moment to catch their breath and count themselves lucky to be there.\n\nTowards the end of the set, Charli once declared brat summer a “forever thing” not just a seasonal thing. And it was understood. It’s not a seasonal thing. It’s a Charli thing.It’s the kind of show people will brag about attending for years. It just should have been on the Pyramid stage.","summary":"Should Charli have headlined the Pyramid Stage?

The attack also claimed the life of her husband, Mark, and left a state senator and his wife with serious injuries.\n\n“Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most impactful speaker in Minnesota’s history.

Biden was also one of more than 7,500 people who paid their respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. Biden also visited the wounded senator in a hospital.\n\nDozens of current and former state legislators from both parties and other elected officials who worked with Hortman also attended.\n\nHortman, who was first elected in 2004, helped pass an expansive agenda of liberal initiatives like free lunches for public school students during the momentous 2023 session as the chamber’s speaker, along with expanded protections for abortion and trans rights. With the House split 67-67 between Democrats and Republicans this year, she yielded the gavel to a Republican under a power-sharing deal, took the title speaker emerita, and helped break a budget impasse that threatened to shut down state government.\n\nThe governor’s eulogy\n\nWalz said Hortman saw her mission as “to get as much good done for as many people as possible.” And he said her focus on people was what made her so effective.\n\n“She certainly knew how to get her way. No doubt about that,” Walz said. “But she never made anyone feel that they’d gotten rolled at a negotiating table. That wasn’t part of it for her, or a part of who she was. She didn’t need somebody else to lose to win for her.”\n\nThe governor said the best way to honor the Hortmans would be by following their example.\n\n“Maybe it is this moment where each of us can examine the way we work together, the way we talk about each other, the way we fight for things we care about,” Walz said. “A moment when each of us can recommit to engaging in politics and life the way Mark and Melissa did — fiercely, enthusiastically, heartily, but without ever losing sight of our common humanity.”\n\nThe Rev. Daniel Griffith, pastor and rector of the Basilica, who led the service, said the country is in need of deep healing. He said it seems as if the U.S. is living in the “dystopian reality” described at the beginning of William Butler Yeats’ poem, “The Second Coming.”\n\n“Here in Minnesota, we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice,” Griffith said. “The killing of George Floyd just miles from our church today. And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest possible terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed, our democracy.”\n\nBut the priest also said Minnesota could also be “a ground zero place for restoration and justice and healing.” He added that the presence of so many people was a sign that that work can succeed.\n\nArchbishop Bernard Hebda of the Saint Paul and Minneapolis Archdiocese offered his condolences to the Hortman family.\n\nA private burial will be held at a later date.\n\nThe Hortman family\n\nThe Hortmans were proud of their adult children, Sophie and Colin Hortman, and the lawmaker often spoke of them.\n\nIn a voice choked with emotion, Colin said his parents embodied the Golden Rule, and he read the Prayer of St. Francis, which his mother always kept in her wallet. He said it captures her essence. It starts, “Lord make me an instrument of your peace.”\n\nAfter the service, Walz presented the children with U.S. and Minnesota flags that flew over the Capitol on the day their parents were killed.\n\nThe suspect\n\nThe man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park on June 14, and wounding Democratic state Sen.

In 1976, at the height of Cronkite’s reign as “the most trusted man in America,” CBS News president Richard Salant penned a 76-page document outlining CBS News standards.\n\nPage 58 is focused on editing and suggests the “60 Minutes” interview at the center of Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News would have been frowned upon during the Cronkite era.\n\n“The objective of the editing process is to produce a clear and succinct statement which reflects fairly, honestly and without distortion what was seen and heard by our reporters, cameras and microphones,” Salant wrote in the 1976 document, which has come to the attention of the Trump legal team.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit alleges CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t “listening” to the Biden administration. Harris was criticized for the “word salad” answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on “Face the Nation.”\n\nHowever, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, she gave a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing her answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day.\n\nThe raw transcript and footage released earlier this year by the FCC showed that both sets of Harris’ comments came from the same lengthy response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the “Face the Nation” preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special.\n\nCBS News, which has denied any wrongdoing and stands by the broadcast and its reporting, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital when asked if the Cronkite-era standards have changed.\n\n“If more than one excerpt from a speech or statement is included in a documentary broadcast, the order of their inclusion in the broadcast will be the same as the order of their inclusion in the speech or statement, unless the broadcast specifically indicates otherwise,” Salant wrote in the 1976 CBS News Standards guide.\n\nWhen Cronkite died in 2009 at age 92, his Associated Press obituary said the famed anchor “valued accuracy, objectivity and understated compassion” and “always aimed to be fair and professional in his judgments” regardless of personal views on a topic.\n\nTwo polls pronounced Cronkite the “most trusted man in America”: a 1972 “trust index” survey in which he finished No. 1, about 15 points higher than leading politicians, and a 1974 survey in which people chose him as the most trusted television newscaster, according to the AP.\n\nSalant, who was running CBS News when “60 Minutes” was launched, was lauded by The New York Times when he died in 1993.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.

The mediator recently proposed the network end the president’s $20 billion lawsuit with a $20 million settlement, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLast month, Trump rejected Paramount’s $15 million settlement offer as he sought at least a $25 million payout as well as an apology. According to the Wall Street Journal, Paramount “isn’t prepared” to give one.","summary":"Trump claims ’60 Minutes’ interfered with election through selective editing.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/28/media/60-minutes-kamala-harris-interview-at-center-of-trump-lawsuit-runs-afoul-of-cronkite-era-cbs-guidelines/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/107328627.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 21:12:46","author":"Fox News,The New York","authors":["Fox News","The New York"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":336248622,"title":"Biden, Harris, Walz attend funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Hortman, killed in shooting","text":"MINNEAPOLIS -- Democratic former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman was honored for her legislative accomplishments and her humanity during a funeral Saturday where former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined over 1,000 mourners.\n\nHortman was fatally shot two weeks earlier by a man posing as a police officer in an attack that Minnesota's chief federal prosecutor has called an assassination.

The 33-year-old is the son of noted postcolonial theorist and academic Mahmood Mamdani, who has written extensively on the legacy of colonialism in Africa, and acclaimed film director Mira Nair. His middle name is, of course, a reference to Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanaian Pan-Africanist revolutionary leader. But now the younger Mamdani has become a name to be reckoned with on his own accord.\n\nBy defeating a formidable establishment figure — former Governor Andrew Cuomo — in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary race, Mr. Mamdani has catalysed sharp discourse within the fractured and soul-searching Democratic Party, still reeling from stinging defeats in the presidential and Congressional races in 2024 that heralded the Trump 2.0 era. New York is largely a Democratic stronghold, and the winner of the primary typically goes on to win the mayoral race. In the November Mayoral election, Mr. Mamdani will take on the incumbent, the unpopular Eric Adams, who is expected to run as an independent.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s political career is relatively short — he was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2020. In the State capital of Albany, he joined a small group of lawmakers affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), a progressive and socialist organisation that was formed in 1982 but truly took flight during Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in 2016. Since then, it has emerged as a major leftist pressure group operating both within and outside the Democratic Party. Mr. Mamdani’s victory is reminiscent of a similar triumph in New York when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (fondly known as AOC) won a Congressional election in the city’s 14th district in 2018.\n\nWhile Mr. Mamdani’s legislative record is relatively modest in terms of Bills passed, his colleagues acknowledge that his work helped shift the Assembly’s ideological emphasis to the left. If elected, Mr. Mamdani would be the city’s youngest Mayor since 1917 and the first Muslim to hold the post.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s victory was no mean feat. He had to overcome the challenge posed by a candidate with extensive political experience — former two-term New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo has deep establishment ties and was endorsed by multi-billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former U.S. President Bill Clinton, among others. He was also backed by a super Political Action Committee that raised $25 million to bankroll his candidacy. The fact that Mr. Cuomo had resigned from his gubernatorial duties a few years ago after being embroiled in sexual harassment cases did not deter him from attempting to obscure this record while running a conventional campaign that featured attack ads targeting Mr. Mamdani’s identity and views.\n\nGrassroots mobilisation\n\nMr. Mamdani overcame these challenges by relying on massive grassroots mobilisation — reportedly 50,000 volunteers organised by the DSA’s New York Chapter conducted a door-to-door campaign that reached an astounding 1.5 million doors. Focusing on one key issue — “affordability” in New York’s high-cost economy — Mr. Mamdani pledged to address this through a series of concrete measures. These included freezing rents for nearly a million New Yorkers in rent-stabilised apartments, providing free city buses (based on a pilot programme he had helped start as a lawmaker), creating city-owned grocery stores that would keep food costs low by buying wholesale and operating on city land, and providing childcare for infants and toddlers.\n\nThe focus on livelihood-based “bread-and-butter economic issues” helped his campaign build a broad coalition of support, including in neighbourhoods that were won by Donald Trump in the 2024 elections. Notably, Mr. Mamdani’s message was tailored to redirect working-class frustration away from the Right’s targets — immigrants and marginalised groups — toward a different culprit: billionaires. The endorsements by the doyen of the American democratic Left, Bernie Sanders, and its key public figure, AOC, also bolstered his candidacy.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Mamdani managed to register a strong win while unapologetically taking a pro-Palestine position, accusing Israel of committing “apartheid and genocide in Gaza”, supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, and openly embracing his Muslim identity. This stood in sharp contrast to the Democratic Presidential campaign in 2024, where candidate Kamala Harris tacked to the right of centre, refused to halt arms sales to Israel, and did not allow a Palestinian voice to speak at the Democratic Convention. In many ways, Mr. Mamdani’s campaign — focused on welfare issues while celebrating his identity as the son of immigrant parents and a practising Muslim — represented everything the Trump administration has demonised during its current tenure.\n\nSeen in this light, Mr. Mamdani’s victory could possibly be the biggest win for the democratic socialist movement that has taken root in U.S. cities since Mr. Sanders’s national campaign. It offers a boost to a demoralised American Left caught between the right-wing populism of Mr. Trump (which has attracted segments of the traditional working class) and what critics see as the vapid centrism of the Democratic Party establishment that refuses to change course, particularly on foreign policy.\n\nInevitably, the question arises: Is Mr. Mamdani’s win a blueprint for future success for the beleaguered Democratic Party? His campaign — combining modern social media tools with traditional door-to-door campaigning — managed to generate broad support across a sprawling urban metropolis, offering lessons for other Democratic mobilisations in similar environments across the U.S. A freewheeling, accessible style is clearly a more effective approach than the carefully scripted strategy that cost Democrats in 2024.\n\n\n\nYet, challenges remain. Republicans are already working to brand Mr. Mamdani as the radical face of the Democratic Party, while the media establishment that supports the GOP has sought to use his identity to tarnish his record, with one Republican Congress representative’s fundraising appeal branding him as a “Hamas Terrorist sympathiser”. His brand of democratic socialism may indeed prove a difficult sell in the small towns and red bastions of middle America.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Mamdani’s victory may be less a simple blueprint to be copied and more a mirror held up to the Democratic Party. It has forced a reckoning, proving that a campaign centred on economic justice and unapologetic principles can generate a powerful movement. The question for party leadership is not whether they can perfectly replicate a New York City race, but whether they are willing to embrace the grassroots energy, class-based populism, and bold vision that this stunning victory represents. The future of the party may well depend on their answer.","summary":"The Democrat ran a grassroots campaign focusing on livelihood-based ‘bread-and-butter economic issues’ and upholding principled positions, such as his strong opposition to Israel’s ‘genocide’ in Gaza, to take lead in the New York mayoral primary","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zohran-mamdani-manhattans-progressive-man/article69749418.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/o7kd1i/article69749419.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Zohran%20Mamdani_Art.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 20:10:00","author":"Donald Trump","authors":["Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.188},{"id":336240142,"title":"Why The Washington Post Is Drowning In Bad Headlines","text":"The Washington Post Building at One Franklin Square Building in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew ... More Harnik/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nI didn’t think I’d be back writing about the troubles at The Washington Post so soon, following my last piece from just a few days ago, but here we are.\n\nThat earlier piece, which you can read here, focused on the Post having lost tens of thousands of subscribers over the last several years, with the paper’s current average daily paid subscriptions now at a new low. Despite the financial backing of owner Jeff Bezos, the reality is that Post hasn’t been able to convert fleeting interest from readers into long-term loyalty; worse still, internal dysfunction and shifting editorial strategies continue to cloud the Post’s identity and future.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, two new developments suggest the challenges aren’t letting up anytime soon.\n\nAnother misstep at The Washington Post\n\nLet’s start with a newsroom experiment that executive editor Matt Murray detailed in a company memo. It’s a new initiative that will allow individuals mentioned in the Post’s stories to annotate those articles directly on the site. The movie is being framed as a way to “deepen the conversation” and keep reader engagement on the Post’s platform, rather than that discussion migrating away to X, Reddit, or elsewhere. But, come on: It’s an absolute certainty that this is going to end up backfiring in spectacular fashion.\n\nThis initiative is the kind of idea that looks fantastic on a whiteboard: Start letting some of the sources who are quoted in articles add annotations to the articles they’re mentioned in. More engagement = everybody wins. Or something like that.\n\nIn reality, the idea of real-time rebuttals next to reported journalism opens up an unnecessary Pandora’s box. What happens when a powerful figure – or anyone, really – uses the feature in bad faith to undermine verified facts? Or tries to insert spin into the conversation? Will readers trust the original reporting, or will the very presence of a sidebar reply create the illusion of “two sides” to a matter of fact? Reporters will technically be able to respond, but as I see it this risks adding “debate monitor” to their job description.\n\nThat the paper’s management decided to embark on such an initiative at all, meanwhile, should also put this next bit of negative news into context.\n\nA rebuke of The Washington Post’s Bezos era\n\nPamela Alma Weymouth, granddaughter of the late Post publisher Katharine Graham, has written a personal and extremely scathing commentary in The Nation about the situation at the Post — among other things, accusing Bezos of systematically dismantling the institution her grandmother once protected.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nShe lays the blame for much of the Post’s woes at the feet of the Amazon founder. “In the face of a more tyrannical Trump,” she writes, “Bezos has retreated. He’s muzzled his editorial page. Exceptional writers, editors, cartoonists have fled. Eight days before the election, the Post canceled a scheduled endorsement of Kamala Harris — breaking with decades of precedent. Four hundred Post journalists signed a protest letter. Two hundred and fifty thousand readers canceled their subscriptions.”\n\nThings got worse earlier this year, she continued, when Bezos dictated that Opinion writers would be expected to align with “personal liberties and free markets,” leaving little or even no room for dissenting views. Editor David Shipley and others resigned, and another wave of subscription cancellations followed. Weymouth continues: “If the free press can be manipulated by politicians, if truth is viewed as optional, if The Washington Post goes dark under Bezos, then we lose more than a legend. We lose the very thing that makes America a democracy.”\n\nWeymouth’s commentary is particularly damning in light of recent revelations about Bezos' companies engaging with Trumpworld while the Post, at the same time, shifted its own editorial voice. It’s the kind of rebuke that ought to cut deep, given that it’s rooted in the legacy of the family that once owned The Washington Post — their ownership now relegated to a bygone era of journalism.\n\nTo be sure, none of this means the Post is finished. There are still plenty of talented reporters who fill its newsroom, but decisions from the leadership have nonetheless put the paper in a precarious spot. Legacy isn’t a business model. Without a clear editorial mission and a bold plan to rebuild reader loyalty, the fact of the matter is that even a paper as storied as The Washington Post won’t be able to successfully right the ship — and avoid the inevitable.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"From a new newsroom experiment to a blistering family takedown, The Washington Post's identity crisis under Jeff Bezos keeps getting worse.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2025/06/28/why-the-washington-post-is-drowning-in-bad-headlines/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6860417b21d8640582196108/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 19:44:22","author":"Andy Meek,Senior Contributor","authors":["Andy Meek","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.112},{"id":336247732,"title":"Biden, Harris and Walz attend funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman","text":"Democratic former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman was honored for her legislative accomplishments and her humanity during a funeral Saturday, where former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined the over 1,000 mourners.Hortman was shot to death in a pair of attacks two weeks earlier by a man posing as a police officer that Minnesota's chief federal prosecutor has called an assassination.

It's about the hope that we have … that people can win elections, not just money,\" said celebrity Emily Ratajkowski as she endorsed Mamdani.\n\nVoters opted for the man with the shorter resume over someone with a problematic one. Cuomo had been backed by billionaires and as a former governor Cuomo had name recognition, but New Yorkers also could not forget the sexual harassment allegations levelled at him. \n\nMamdani's victory has energised the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. They've seized on his success as evidence that a bold left-wing platform can be electorally successful.\n\nBut that narrative is already being contested by centrist and moderate members of the party who argue a campaign like Mamdani's might work in inner cities, but will not translate to the suburbs of middle America which determine elections. \n\nEither way, Mamdani's win does a few things. \n\nIt gives progressives momentum, rattles the party establishment and presents an opportunity to Donald Trump and his Republican army. \n\nWho is Zohran Mamdani?\n\nA few short months ago, you would have struggled to find anyone who had heard of Zohran Mamdani outside of local politics and now he is being lionised and pilloried by some of America's biggest political players.\n\nHis life story became a big part of his campaign. He was born in Kampala in Uganda to a family of Indian ancestry before he moved to New York at age seven. \n\nHis mother, Mira Nair, is a well-known film director and his father is Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University, specialising in the study of colonialism.\n\nMamdani is married to artist and ceramicist Rama Duwaji who was attacked online by right-wing trolls throughout the campaign. The couple met on Hinge. \n\nIf the people of New York back Mamdani at the general election, he'd be the first South Asian and first Muslim mayor.\n\nHe would also be an anti-capitalism mayor in a city that was arguably the birthplace of the United States free market-loving economy. \n\nBefore his political career, Mamdani worked in film and as a writer. \n\nHe even had his own short-lived hip hop career as Mr Cardamom, with lyrics like: \"I'm your boss, I'm your f**king Nani. Got a doctorate bitch, so don't f**king try me.\"\n\nMamdani ran on a hyper progressive agenda. He has been promising free buses, rent freezes, tripling the production of rent stabilised housing and to develop a chain of city-owned grocery stores to bring down the prices of basics.\n\nBut perhaps the most contentious issue in this campaign was his position on Israel and Palestine, despite the New York mayor not having any foreign policy responsibilities.\n\nMamdani's long standing activism on behalf of Palestinians and staunch criticism of Israel was seized upon by his opponents. \n\nMamdani has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and practising apartheid. He's even said he'd arrest Benjamin Netanyahu, if the Israeli prime minister was to visit New York while he was mayor.\n\nNew York City, with an estimated 1.5 to 2 million Jews, is often considered to be the second largest Jewish city in the world, after Tel Aviv. \n\nThe conventional political view has been, until now, that to be successful in New York, a candidate needed to be pro-Israel.\n\nThat was the track Cuomo was running, describing himself as a \"hyper supporter of Israel and proud of it\". \n\nAndrew Cuomo came to this race with heavy baggage, which weighed down his popularity. He stood down as governor of New York state in 2021 after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women.\n\nThe Justice Department found Cuomo had repeatedly subjected women in his office to non-consensual sexual contact. Cuomo continues to deny he did anything illegal. \n\nBut Cuomo was well supported by the Democratic establishment. \n\nAnd he was backed by billionaires like former mayor Michael Bloomberg and investor Bill Ackman.\n\nBill Clinton also backed Cuomo, who'd once served as his secretary of housing urban development, with the former president saying: \"It is imperative that New York chooses a mayor who has the ability, talent, and experience to do the job.\"\n\nWhile Cuomo's campaign did its best to paint Mamdani as ill-equipped for the job of running a city with a $115 billion budget and that employs about 300,000 workers, the voters were not swayed.\n\nTrump's people see a political play\n\nRepublicans seem to think Mamdani's win and the Democrats that delivered it have handed them a major advantage in other races.\n\nThey are doing their best to elevate Mamdani to national prominence. \n\nVice President JD Vance has been calling him \"the new leader of the Democratic Party\".\n\nWhile President Trump has been calling Mamdani a \"100% Communist Lunatic\". \n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee labelled him as an \"antisemitic socialist radical\". \n\nWhile Mamdani rejects any claim he's an antisemite, he embraces the term socialist.\n\nBasil Smikle, a political analyst and professor at Columbia University’s School of Professional Studies, said heavy-handed attacks on Mamdani could backfire by energising \"a lot of the Democratic voters to want to push more against Trump\". \n\nMamdani has paid credit to another high-profile \"Democratic socialist\", Vermont senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, calling him \"the single most influential political figure\" in his life.\n\nSanders said Mamdani's victory was due to a \"brilliant campaign\" and claims Kamala Harris would be president today if she had followed the Mamdani playbook.\n\nIn addition to Sanders, perhaps Mamdani's most important endorsement came from Congressional representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , more commonly known as AOC.\n\nShe threw her weight behind his bid in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\n\"Assemblymember Mamdani has demonstrated a real ability on the ground to put together a coalition of working-class New Yorkers that is strongest to lead the pack,\" she said.\n\nAOC is the most high-profile member of the progressive wing of the party. She's been suggested as potential president candidate in 2028 or may launch a bid to unseat the long serving senator Chuck Schumer.\n\nBut while the progressive wing is basking in the glow of the unexpected New York victory, the party is split on what the win means.\n\nDemocratic strategist Tim Lim told Politico: \"For moderates and wealthy Democratic donors, the reaction is, this is horrible and it's going to ruin us.\"\n\n\"For centre-line Democrats who don't necessarily support Mamdani's policies, the reaction is, this is a rejection of the Democratic establishment and Mamdani ran a great campaign against a sex offender.\n\n\"And for progressives, they believe this is what happens when you listen to voters.\"\n\nFor his part, Mamdani seemed ready to embrace any role as a party leader, telling supporters in his victory speech that he would govern the city \"as a model for the Democratic Party – a party where we fight for working people with no apology\". \n\nHe vowed to use his mayoral power to \"reject Donald Trump's fascism\".\n\nThe November battles \n\nMamdani will go to the general election in the mayoral race this November. Next November, the United States will vote in midterm elections, which will be the first real test of national sentiment towards the second Trump presidency. \n\nBy November 2028, the Democratic Party will have to have figured out how to defeat whoever takes over the MAGA mission. \n\nWhile Mamdani's primary victory was a seismic shock to the party, it will be but a blip if he doesn't become mayor in November and that is by no means a lock. \n\nIt's a crowded field. He'll be facing the current Mayor Eric Adams who previously won as a Democrat before leaving the party when it was clear he would not win the primary. \n\nAndrew Cuomo is also leaving the door open to a run as an independent and there will also be a Republican flag-bearer.\n\nIt is also likely to be a well-financed contest. \n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman has already promised to bankroll a rival. He has claimed he and his allies are willing to spend \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to ensure Mamdani does not emerge victorious.\n\nWhile Mamdani's pledges to hike taxes and expand services won over New York's Democrats, it might be a different matter once Republicans and independents are given their chance to make a pledge to voters. \n\nThe ranked choice system New York uses for its elections, which is similar to Australia's preferential system, also rewards moderation so it is possible it will work against him when there are more centrist candidates competing.\n\nBut win or lose in November, Mamdani has delivered a message to the party's most powerful at a time when there is a vacuum of strategy and direction.\n\nBy running on a platform that represents, not the top 1 per cent, but the other 99, Mamdani pulled off a monumental political upset. \n\n\"Cost of living is the issue of our time,\" Neera Tanden, the chief executive of Democratic think tank Center for American Progress wrote on X in response to Mamdani's win. \n\nABC/Reuters","summary":"It was a primary race that pitted competing visions for the Democratic Party against one another, and in the end, the New York progressives emerged victorious.

It starts, “Lord make me an instrument of your peace.” After the service, Walz presented the children with U.S. and Minnesota flags that flew over the Capitol on the day their parents were killed. The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park and wounding Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin on June 14 made a brief court appearance Friday. He's due back in court Thursday. Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, Minn., surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest manhunt in Minnesota history. Boelter has not entered a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Friends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views and a supporter of President Trump. Prosecutors have declined to speculate on a motive.

Voters Who Re-Elected Donald Trump Now Sound the AlarmOne of the main concerns is deep cuts to Medicaid that many Trump voters say could cost them their homes, their health care, and even their loved ones, according to the Stitch Snitches report.Among those voicing out their concerns is Courtney Leader, a 36-year-old mother from Missouri, a deep-red state where Trump defeated former vice president Kamala Harris by 18 points, according to the report. Leader isn’t a political operative or an activist, but she's just a mom trying to keep her daughter, Cyrina, alive, as per the Stitch Snitches report.ALSO READ: California’s AB5 Law under fire, nail techs sue state over worker classification – what the law states?A Missouri Mother’s Plea: “This Isn’t a Luxury”She explained that, “This is not a luxury,” adding, “I do not have my daughter enrolled on Medicaid so we can have fancy things. I have her enrolled so we can keep her alive and keep her at home, which I think is the best option for her,” as quoted in the report.Live EventsCyrina relies on a specialised feeding formula that costs over $1,500 a month, which is more than the family’s mortgage and grocery bills combined, and without Medicaid, Leader says there’s no way they could cover the cost, according to the Stitch Snitches report. Leader asked, “Who’s going to protect us when they can’t get paperwork done in time and we lose coverage for a month or two?,\" and added, \"I’m worried that the red tape is going to affect our Medicaid because of just the oversight burdens. And that as a result, I’m going to lose my daughter, because she’s lost coverage before,” as quoted in the report.She has even written a letter to communicated about her concerns to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), a Trump supporter and key defender of the bill, she pleaded with him to consider the human cost, saying, “Without Medicaid, we would lose everything — our home, our vehicles, and eventually, our daughter,” quoted Stitch Snitches.ALSO READ: Pokrovsk in peril?

While Trump and Republican leaders insist the cuts only target “waste, fraud, and abuse,” the CBO’s analysis highlighted that the vulnerable populations—including children, seniors, and people with disabilities, will be directly impacted if the bill becomes law in its current form, according to the report.Some Republicans Express Quiet ConcernAccording to the Stitch Snitches report, the proposed Medicaid cuts have also led to concern among some GOP senators, who fear that millions of constituents could lose coverage. FAQsWhat is Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”?It’s a $3.8 trillion tax cut package that also includes significant cuts to programmes like Medicaid and food assistance. Why are people worried about Medicaid cuts?Many families, especially those with children, elderly, or disabled members, depend on Medicaid for life-saving care.

Cronkite, who was the face of \"CBS Evening News\" from 1962 to 1981, was the premier anchorman of America’s golden age of network news. In 1976, at the height of Cronkite’s reign as \"the most trusted man in America,\" CBS News president Richard Salant penned a 76-page document outlining CBS News standards. Page 58 is focused on editing and suggests the \"60 Minutes\" interview at the center of Trump’s lawsuit against CBS News would have been frowned upon during the Cronkite era. \"The objective of the editing process is to produce a clear and succinct statement which reflects fairly, honestly and without distortion what was seen and heard by our reporters, cameras and microphones,\" Salant wrote in the 1976 document, which has come to the attention of the Trump legal team. MEDIATOR IN TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AGAINST PARAMOUNT, CBS NEWS PROPOSES $20 MILLION SETTLEMENT Trump’s lawsuit alleges CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was criticized for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, she gave a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing her answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day. The raw transcript and footage released earlier this year by the FCC showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same lengthy response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special. CBS BLASTS TRUMP'S LAWSUIT AS ‘MERITLESS’ DESPITE RECENT $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT OFFER CBS News, which has denied any wrongdoing and stands by the broadcast and its reporting, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital when asked if the Cronkite-era standards have changed. \"If more than one excerpt from a speech or statement is included in a documentary broadcast, the order of their inclusion in the broadcast will be the same as the order of their inclusion in the speech or statement, unless the broadcast specifically indicates otherwise,\" Salant wrote in the 1976 CBS News Standards guide. When Cronkite died in 2009 at age 92, his Associated Press obituary said the famed anchor \"valued accuracy, objectivity and understated compassion\" and \"always aimed to be fair and professional in his judgments\" regardless of personal views on a topic. Two polls pronounced Cronkite the \"most trusted man in America\": a 1972 \"trust index\" survey in which he finished No. 1, about 15 points higher than leading politicians, and a 1974 survey in which people chose him as the most trusted television newscaster, according to the AP. ‘60 MINUTES’ PRODUCERS RAIL AGAINST TRUMP'S ‘BULLS---’ LAWSUIT, DREAD PROSPECTS OF PARAMOUNT MAKING SETTLEMENT Salant, who was running CBS News when \"60 Minutes\" was launched, was lauded by The New York Times when he died in 1993. \"He was credited with raising professional standards and expanding news programming at CBS,\" the Times wrote. CBS News, along with parent company Paramount, are currently in mediation with hopes of settling with Trump. The mediator recently proposed the network end the president's $20 billion lawsuit with a $20 million settlement, according to the Wall Street Journal. Last month, Trump rejected Paramount's $15 million settlement offer as he sought at least a $25 million payout as well as an apology. According to the Wall Street Journal, Paramount \"isn’t prepared\" to give one. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital’s Joseph A.

The state is going through wildfires, Trump’s tariffs, immigration raids, and military actions.Donors are also still mad about the billion-dollar campaign that failed to get her to the White House—and left behind a lot of debt. These donors want her to have a clear plan to actually win the governor’s race, according to the report by Politico. Live EventsHarris’s team says they understand the frustration but believe donors will back her if she runs.They point out that other Democrats running for governor have not raised much money, which could mean donors are waiting for Harris.She has been holding private meetings with her top supporters, especially in the Bay Area, where her political career started.

They think her campaign would highlight the problems of the Biden-Harris administration. Some think she might be blamed for not being honest about Biden’s health before he dropped out in 2024, as per the report by Politico. One Democratic fundraiser said her campaign would remind people of the “pathetic” 2024 race and Biden’s condition, which no one wants to talk about again. They said: “She still would probably lead, but honestly, no one is incredibly pumped.”Another Democrat running for governor, Antonio Villaraigosa, even accused Harris of being part of the Biden health cover-up. Her team knows she needs to address that issue early in any campaign so she can move on to other topics. Donors say she should not expect automatic support from the party. She’ll have to earn it, as stated in the report by Politico.Now what’s Next for Kamala? She’s seriously considering the 2026 Governor’s race — it’s her most urgent choice because of upcoming deadlines. She plans to make a final decision by late summer. Running for president again in 2028 is also still a possibility for her, as per reports.FAQsQ1. Is Kamala Harris running for California Governor?She might run in 2026 but hasn’t decided yet.Q2.

Andrew Cuomo, by nearly 10 points. \n\nZohran Mamdani ran an avowedly far-left campaign, one focused on kitchen table issues rather than the woke cultural battles we’ve become accustomed to from the left. \n\nInstead of promising to Defund the Police (though he supported that movement in the past) or hyping the historic nature of becoming the first Muslim mayor of New York City, Mamdani promised free busing, a rent freeze, government-owned supermarkets and free childcare — which he said he’d pay for by raising taxes on businesses and the rich.\n\nDespite the promise of redistributing from each according to his ability, to each according to his need, in an ironic twist, the socialist beat Cuomo handily with wealthy New Yorkers. Meanwhile, Cuomo crushed Mamdani by a staggering 19 points with New Yorkers who make under $50,000 a year. \n\nMamdani also lost in a big way in New York’s majority Black neighborhoods, which overwhelmingly chose Cuomo, as did neighborhoods with the highest Hispanic concentration. \n\nCuomo succeeded with voters without a college degree, while Mamdani absolutely slaughtered him among voters with advanced degrees. Mamdani’s support was strongest with “youthful, renter-heavy neighborhoods known for their left-leaning politics,” as The New York Times pointed out.\n\nGentrifiers of the World, unite!\n\nWelcome to the new Democratic Party, same as the old, with a slight twist: Instead of imposing cultural doctrine on working-class people of color with zero interest in their woke ideology, the Dems are now imposing a socialist economic agenda on those same recalcitrant normies who just won’t get with the program.\n\nMamdani’s success with the educated continues a decades-long political realignment in which the working class has been steadily leaving the Democratic Party for the GOP, a process that turbocharged under Donald Trump, while the Democrats’ base is now college-educated elites. \n\nNine of the 10 wealthiest congressional districts are currently represented by Democrats, as are 65% of Americans making over $500,000 a year. \n\nThe process culminated in the 2024 election with Kamala Harris winning the majority of Americans making over $100,000 a year, while Trump won with those making under. \n\nRather than a repudiation of the trendline in the Democratic Party, Mamdani’s success reveals that even when they talk about kitchen table issues, even when they talk about redistributing resources from the wealthy to the poor, progressives are doing so in a way that speaks to the wealthy and alienates working-class voters. \n\nMamdani knew how to perfect the lingo of trust fund socialism from personal experience: He himself is from the exact over-educated, over-credentialed, elite background that the Democrats now represent — whether they are pushing socialism or wokeness. \n\nThe son of a filmmaker and an academic and educated at a liberal arts college in Maine, Mamdani’s campaign staff was equally elite, overrepresented in Ivy League graduates, as reported in the Free Press. \n\nFollow The Post’s coverage of the NYC mayoral race\n\nZohran Mamdani victory in NYC mayoral primary is ‘political earthquake’ for the Democratic Party\n\nEric Adams rips socialist Zohran Mamdani as ‘snake oil salesman’ after shocking NYC Dem mayoral primary victory\n\nAndrew Cuomo concedes as Zohran Mamdani wins NYC Democratic mayoral primary in stunning upset\n\nJewish New Yorkers furious over bizarre pro-Zohran Mamdani texts evoking Oct. 7 attacks: ‘Disgusted’\n\nAndrew Cuomo staying on NYC mayoral election ballot — as critics slam ex-gov as ‘spoiler’ candidate\n\nThis is not to say that Mamdani’s campaign was totally devoid of cultural battles unpopular with working-class voters. Mamdani joined a protest against border czar Tom Homan at the state Capitol, shouting, “Do you believe in the First Amendment?!” as Homan disappeared down a corridor munching an apple. \n\nMamdani also opposes the existence of a Jewish state and defended the genocidal cry “Globalize the Intifada” as being nothing more than a call for Palestinian rights; at Bowdoin College, Mamdani founded his school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine.\n\nLike Free Palestine or Defund the Police, Zohran became a synonym for cool among young leftists, a brand for disaffected white college grads. And his victory signals where the Democratic Party might be going. \n\nWokeness is dead, but it’s been replaced by something equally at odds with the working-class voters the Dems lost to President Trump: a redistributionist economic socialism that appeals to the elites in the same way that the “anti-racism” of Robin DiAngelo and the Abolish ICE of AOC did. \n\nIt turns out, working-class New Yorkers, like working-class Americans more generally, don’t want government-run supermarkets any more than they want trans athletes in their daughters’ sports. They don’t want to abolish the police or ICE. They don’t want a rent freeze for already rent-stabilized apartments. \n\nThey want a fair shot at the American Dream. They want jobs that pay well, less immigration, good healthcare, and — most relevant to the mayor of New York City — safe streets. \n\nWill the Democratic Party ever learn? I wouldn’t bet on it. The party’s bigwigs have lined up behind Mamdani, with everyone from Chuck Schumer and Hakim Jeffries to Jerry Nadler and Bill Clinton posting in support of his victory. The media has tried to portray this as the right using Mamdani as the poster child for the Democratic Party, but they’re doing that all on their own. \n\nThe real lesson of Zohran Mamdani’s win is this. Though the topic has shifted from culture wars to economics, the Democratic Party still has not learned that the way to get working-class voters is simple: Listen.\n\nBatya Ungar-Sargon is the author of “Second Class: How the Elites Betrayed America’s Working Men and Women.”","summary":"New Yorkers woke up to a new reality on Wednesday: A proud socialist won the mayoral primary, beating out his nearest rival, former Gov.

The Pew Research Center poll, which the organization calls \"a study of the 2024 election, based on validated voters,\" said that Trump made up extensive ground with Hispanic voters, Black voters and Asian voters. It found that Trump significantly closed the gap on Hispanic voters, with 51% of them going to former Vice President Kamala Harris, and 48% going to Trump, a significant shift from the 2020 presidential election, when Trump fell behind with Hispanic voters to former President Joe Biden, 61%-36%. IMMIGRANTS ABANDON DEMS TO SUPPORT GOP IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN LARGE POLLING SHIFT Trump increased his support among Black voters by 7%, with 15% of Black voters supporting Trump in November, up from 8% during the 2020 presidential election. Asian voters, while still trending to the left with 57% supporting Harris, voted 40% for Trump, up from 2020, when 70% supported Biden and 30% went for Trump. The voters' level of education also played a role. Trump had a 14-point advantage, 56% to 42%, among voters who did not have a 4-year college degree, with the Pew Research Center reporting that Trump doubled his 2016 margin among these voters. Harris won college-education voters by a margin of 57% to 41%. IF THEY HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN, BLACK TRUMP VOTERS TELL CNN THEY’D STILL VOTE FOR HIM Voters who lived in rural areas also chose Trump overwhelmingly, 69%-29%, while 65% of urban voters chose Harris, and only 33% chose Trump. Trump also did well among religious voters, with almost two-thirds, or 64% of them who attended religious services monthly or more backing Trump, and only about a third, or 34%, voting for Harris. The 45th and 47th president also gained some ground with men, with 55% - 43% voting for him. Men under 50-years-old chose Trump 49% - 48%. In 2020, they chose Biden by 10 points, with 53% going for Biden, and 43% going for Trump. \"President Trump’s historic reelection and the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, special assistant to the president and principal deputy press secretary, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"The President continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans,\" Fields added. \"The American people voted for a return to common sense, and the President is delivering on every campaign promise supported by 77 million voters and is ushering in our Golden Age.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"New Pew Research poll revealed Trump&apos;s diverse voter coalition with increased support from Hispanic, Black and Asian voters, plus strong backing from non-college educated voters.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-poll-reveals-full-extent-trumps-gains-minority-voters-2024","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/10/931/523/black-voter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 14:53:22","author":"Rachel Del Guidice","authors":["Rachel Del Guidice"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.215},{"id":336185408,"title":"Shocking poll shows contenders for 2028 presidential race as new Trump approval ratings reveal what the US really thinks of him","text":"A new poll has revealed a significant change to Trump's approval rating, while also giving insight into the favorite candidates for the 2028 presidential election.\n\nThe 47th POTUS has introduced a ton of changes since returning to the Oval Office - some being more controversial than others.\n\nTrump has introduced countless executive orders and tariffs since being back in the White House, while he's also had a very public bust-up with former best buddy Elon Musk.\n\nThe president even ordered the US military to fire missiles at three nuclear sites in Iran last weekend, while Iran retaliated by firing rockets at a US military base in Qatar.\n\nBasically, it's been turbulent since Trump returned as president, and as a result, his approval ratings have suffered.\n\nA survey by the Emerson College Polling revealed that 45 percent of voters approve of Trump as president, while 46 percent disapprove and nine percent are unsure.\n\nWhile the figures are close, Trump had a 49 percent approval back in January.\n\nMeanwhile, 52 percent of those surveyed believe the US is 'on the wrong track' and 48 percent think the country is heading in the right direction under Trump.\n\nWhile Trump may have only been in office for just over five months, attentions are already turning to the next presidential election in 2028.\n\nA new Emerson College poll has detailed who the Democrats are favouring for their presidential candidate in three years time.\n\nAnd it's former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg who has surpassed former vice president Kamala Harris in the poll as to who Democrats are preferring for the presidential run.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting nearly a quarter of respondents said they are undecided about who they would support next time out.\n\nNonetheless, 16 percent said they would cast their ballot for Buttigieg, while 13 stated they would support Harris, despite her defeat at the hands of Trump last November.\n\nButtigieg served as Joe Biden's transportation secretary between 2021 and 2025, making him the first openly gay Cabinet secretary in US history.\n\nFor the Republicans, 46 percent support Vice President JD Vance, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio (12 percent) and Florida Gov.

No, I think we have a tremendous party.”\n\nTrump also denied plans to seek a third presidential term in that interview, saying he intends to be a two-term president. Though he previously claimed he wasn’t joking about serving a third term, which is unconstitutional, Trump later said those remarks were meant to troll the media.\n\nOn the Democratic side of Emerson College’s most recent survey, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg edges out ex-Vice President Kamala Harris with 16 percent to 13 percent in the Emerson survey. \n\nAlso in contention are California Governor Gavin Newsom at 12 percent and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro with 7 percent, though nearly a quarter of Democratic voters remain undecided.\n\nHarris’s support has notably dropped from 37 percent in November.","summary":"One figure in the GOP is emerging as the leading candidate to stand in 2028 – notwithstanding Trump’s hints at an unconstitutional third term","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-2028-election-b2778789.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/28/13/12/trump.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Q0UU84vj-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-28 14:06:05","author":"Erin Keller","authors":["Erin Keller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":336188884,"title":"GROVER NORQUIST: A Big Beautiful Bill For July 4 Will Make America Stronger","text":"It is fitting that President Trump aims to sign the Big Beautiful Bill by July 4: Americans will have the freedom to keep more of what they earn.\n\nThe bill provides across the board income tax cuts for American households and powerful, job-creating tax cuts for American businesses. The tax cuts will increase take-home pay and make America even stronger and more competitive.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans will send the bill to President Trump’s desk in the coming days.\n\nTo start, the bill prevents a $5 trillion tax increase on Americans. Thankfully the GOP has full control of the House, Senate, and Presidency, because if Kamala Harris had prevailed last November, the 2017 Trump tax cuts would expire on December 31.\n\nHarris threatened repeatedly to “eliminate” the Trump tax cuts. If that were to happen, every single American taxpayer would see their income tax rate increase back to the higher level of the Barack Obama years.\n\nThankfully President Trump campaigned and won vowing to make the Trump tax cuts permanent across the board. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Leading House Conservative Calls Senate’s Bluff On Trump’s ‘Beautiful’ Bill)\n\nThe permanence of the bill’s tax cuts is of chief importance.\n\nPermanently reduced tax rates and business expensing allows American companies to invest in productivity-increasing technology, purchase new trucks and plant and equipment and hire more employees secure in understanding what the tax rules are now and will be in the decades ahead. This also means businesses can afford to pay their workers more. The tax bill increases annual real wages per worker by up to $7,200 in the first four years of implementation, according to an analysis by the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nNext, the big beautiful bill enacts Trump’s no tax on tips promise. This includes tipped employees as well as independent contractors and the gig economy. It will help barbers, stylists, restaurant servers, bartenders, drivers, delivery workers, caddies and dozens of other traditionally tipped occupations.\n\nThe bill also expands the standard deduction, providing an income tax cut and a tax simplification at the same time.\n\nThe bill extends small business tax relief, expands the per child tax credit, ends the tax on overtime, and provides tax relief for seniors.\n\nThe bill also reins in the IRS by repealing Biden’s 1099-K IRS surveillance law. This IRS paperwork nightmare imposed by Democrats forces Americans to deal with invasive paperwork any time they use Venmo or PayPal for more than $600 in transactions in a given year.\n\nYou’ll no longer have to prove to an IRS agent that the Venmo transfer from your roommate to cover his part of the rent is not taxable income. Or the funds you collected for ticket purchases are not taxable. Same goes for the payment you received when you sold an old bike or lawn mower out of your garage.\n\nThe big beautiful bill will help the economy grow faster, creating more jobs and higher wages in the process.\n\nPresident Trump is a historic tax cutter, and this bill builds upon his success.\n\nWhen the corporate income tax rate was reduced by Trump from a highest-in-the-developed world 35% (even higher than China’s 25%) down to 21%, the economy grew substantially.\n\nBefore Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, many businesses “inverted” — they were bought by foreign companies and moved their headquarters overseas.\n\nWhy? Because our then-high tax rates and onerous laws required income earned overseas to be taxed again if it was brought back to the United States. That meant many companies were worth more if moved to France or Canada.\n\nNot now. Since the Trump tax reforms there have not been any large companies “inverting.” Now companies move to the United States.\n\nTrump’s signature on the big tax cuts will reward hard-working Americans and turbocharge American economic growth. And leave the Euroweenies in the dust.","summary":"It is fitting that President Trump aims to sign the Big Beautiful Bill by July 4","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/06/28/opinion-a-big-beautiful-bill-for-july-4-will-make-america-stronger-grover-norquist/","image":"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2215540167-scaled-e1748984604630.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 14:03:40","author":"Grover Norquist","authors":["Grover Norquist"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":336176158,"title":"Poll twist: Kamala Harris trails in 2028 race, but frontrunner fails with black voters - who is the person?","text":"Pete Butigieg, former US Transportation secretary might be the front runner for Democrat’s presidential nominee race, as new polls suggest he is ahead of Former VP Kamala Harris, with 16 percent of blue voters in his favourKamala Harris is in second place with 13% support.

Here’s How Much He Likely Did Pay","text":"Activists from the UK-based collective \"Everyone Hates Elon\" and Greenpeace Italy unfurled the banner in Venice earlier this week, ahead of Jeff Bezos' and Lauren Sánchez's wedding weekend.\nStefano Rellandini/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAhead of his Venice wedding, protesters called for the billionaire Amazon founder to pay more taxes. Here’s our estimate of how much tax Bezos has likely been paying—and what he’s done to lower his bill.\n\n“If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax,” read a 4,300-square-foot banner unfurled across Venice’s Piazza San Marco on Monday, days ahead of billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ wedding to former TV journalist Lauren Sánchez. “This isn’t just about one person—it’s about changing the rules so no billionaire can dodge responsibility, anywhere,” Clara Thompson, campaigner for environmental activist organization Greenpeace (which helped organize the protest), wrote in a press release. “The real issue is a broken system that lets billionaires skip out on their fair share of taxes while everyone else is left to foot the bill.”\n\nSo just how much in tax does Bezos really pay? The world’s fourth-richest man—now worth an estimated $231 billion—likely paid some $2.7 billion in taxes in 2024, per Forbes estimates. The lion’s share of that tax bill is the result of Bezos’ record year of share sales: he offloaded $13.6 billion worth of Amazon stock as the e-commerce giant’s share price soared 46% and pushed Bezos’ net worth to an all-time high. In just one year, he got nearly $60 billion richer—meaning his taxes amounted to just 4.5% of his increase in wealth last year. (Bezos owns a nearly 9% stake in Amazon worth $203 billion.) That’s because stock is only taxed when it’s sold, and not on its appreciation in value; activists like the protesters in Venice this week want that to change. Bezos also donated $2.5 billion worth of Amazon shares to nonprofits over the last three years, which enabled him to reduce his 2024 tax bill by as much as an estimated $600 million.\n\n“As long as they hold onto assets that gain in value, there’s no tax, no matter how rich they are on paper,” says Brian Schultz, tax partner at wealth management and consulting firm Plante Moran. Bezos didn’t pay any federal taxes in 2007 and 2011, per ProPublica reporting on leaked tax returns, and likely paid little in 2022 and 2023, two years when he didn’t sell any Amazon shares. (Amazon doesn’t pay dividends, which are also subject to taxes.)\n\nThe protesters in Venice say that Bezos—and billionaires like him—should be taxed on their wealth (as opposed to their income) or the appreciation of their unsold stock in order to pay their “fair share.” Per a 2018 UC Berkeley study based on Forbes data, families in the top 0.1% of Americans by net worth were estimated to owe just 3.2% of their wealth in taxes in 2019, while the bottom 99% were estimated to have owed 7.2%; since then, America’s richest have only gotten richer, and Bezos’ estimated tax bill for 2024 amounts to around 1% of his estimated net worth. If some of the plans to tax billionaires more that have been proposed recently were in effect, his tax bill for last year would have likely more than tripled but would still be a small fraction of his net worth.\n\nGot a tip? Contact Phoebe Liu at pliu@forbes.com or 678.834.4200 (phone/WhatsApp/Signal).\n\nBezos founded Amazon in 1994 and took it public in 1997. (Had he never parted with any of his stock, Bezos would still own a 22% stake worth more than $500 billion today.) Since then, Amazon hasn’t awarded Bezos additional stock and has paid him a modest salary—$81,840 in 2020, the year before he stepped down as CEO. He’s not just being humble. Having cash salaries as low as $1 is a common, tax-advantageous move among executives because, while cash income is taxed in the year the executive receives it, shares of company stock don’t get taxed until they’re sold for a profit. That means Bezos can defer paying taxes on the stock he’s owned for decades.\n\nIn 2023, Bezos announced his move to Florida with a sentimental video his dad took of him at Amazon’s first “office” (his garage in Seattle) and Bezos explaining how he wanted to be closer to his parents, who’d recently moved back to Miami. What he didn’t mention: The move also allowed him to avoid the newly-enacted 7% state capital gains tax in Washington, where he’d lived since 1994. The fact that he sold a record sum the first year he lived in Florida might be coincidental, but it saved him a bundle. The $13.6 billion from Bezos’ 2024 Amazon share sales was likely subject to the top 23.8% rate for federal taxes on long-term capital gains, resulting in an estimated $3.2 billion federal tax liability before deductions. Had he still lived in Washington, he likely would have paid nearly 31%, or another $1 billion in taxes. Like Washington, Florida has no state income tax. As Bezos, 61, nears the average American’s retirement age, the Sunshine State offers one other advantage: no state estate tax (and as for the federal estate tax, most billionaires are able to avoid that anyway).\n\nAmazon share sales aside, Bezos pays a smattering of other taxes. For example, property taxes: Over the last five years, Bezos spent more than $500 million to add several splashy homes to his real estate portfolio, including three (or possibly four) properties on Miami-Dade County’s “billionaire bunker,” Beverly Hills’ nine-acre Warner Estate and a secluded estate on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Bezos’ properties in Florida, Washington, California, D.C., New York and Hawaii cost him around $7 million in 2024 property taxes, per local government websites. (He also sold one of his Washington state properties for $63 million last year, which resulted in around $10 million in estimated taxes.)\n\nBezos could pay annual taxes on other investments. Since he made a reported $250,000 bet on Google in 1998, Bezos has invested in at least 108 startups—and now holds stakes in several high-profile AI companies, including humanoid robotics firm Figure AI and AI-powered search engine Perplexity. (Dow Jones & Co. sued the company in 2023 alleging large-scale illegal copying of copyrighted work; Forbes sent Perplexity a cease-and-desist letter accusing the company of using its reporting without permission in June 2024.) If any of the companies he bet on are acquired, conduct private share sales, pay dividends or go public, Bezos would need to pay capital gains taxes on that income. Additionally, if Bezos has other income-generating investments, like dividend- or interest-paying stocks or bonds, that would add to his tax bill as well, according to Matthew Lee, director of wealth strategies at investment manager Wilmington Trust.\n\nThen there are the tax deductions, mostly due to charitable contributions. Bezos is one of America’s top givers by dollar amount, per Forbes’ calculations, having given away more than $4 billion during his lifetime to climate, housing and education causes, as well as the Smithsonian and the Obama Foundation. Donors can immediately deduct up to 20% or 30% of their adjusted gross income via stock gifts to charitable organizations, regardless of whether those charities actually use the funds that year (and potentially more via charitable trusts, although Bezos isn’t known to use them). Donors can also carry forward unused deductions from the past five years.\n\n“Of course you have to have a desire to support charities,” says Plante Moran’s Schultz of wealthy philanthropists. “But if they’re going to donate to charity, there’s certainly incentive to try to make sure that it’s as tax beneficial as possible for the money that they’re looking to give.”\n\nHere’s how that likely applies to Bezos. Bezos had a capital gain of nearly $13.6 billion from selling Amazon stock in 2024. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 and 2023—when shares were down and when Washington was in the process of enacting its 7% state capital gains tax—and likely didn’t report nearly as much income in those years. That means Bezos’ charitable contributions from 2022 to 2024 could have been deductible on his 2024 tax return. According to securities filings, Bezos gifted $2.5 billion worth of Amazon stock to nonprofit organizations during that period—just under 20% of his estimated 2024 income. If all applied to his 2024 tax bill, the gifts could have reduced Bezos’ tax obligation by as much as $600 million.\n\nOne other way the ultra-wealthy often avoid taxes is by borrowing against their shares tax-free instead of selling them, which would trigger capital gains taxes. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously employs this approach with his Tesla shares. Amazon discloses in regulatory filings that directors like Bezos “may not pledge Amazon securities as collateral for a loan” unless the arrangement is “precleared with the Legal Department.” As Amazon’s executive chair, Bezos would be required to disclose pledged shares in regulatory filings, and hasn’t done so. Still, he could borrow against other stocks he owns.\n\nProposals for taxing the ultra-wealthy more do exist. In 2021, Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed an “Ultra-Millionaire Tax” that would impose a 6% annual wealth tax on fortunes above $1 billion, and claimed it would bring in nearly $3.75 trillion over a decade. During her 2024 presidential campaign, former vice president Kamala Harris expressed support for a proposal that people worth more than $100 million pay a minimum of 25% of their income (which would be expanded to include “unrealized capital gains”) in taxes.\n\nNeither proposal has been successful so far. But if enacted, Forbes estimates that Bezos would have needed to pay more than $10 billion in additional taxes under either Warren’s or Harris’ preferred approach. Neither sum would dent his fortune much at all. “Every handful of years, depending on the makeup in Washington, those proposals get resurrected,” says Wilmington Trust’s Lee. “But I think you’re seeing more politicians who seem to be interested in exploring those.”\n\nAs for his wedding? Getting married isn’t likely to affect his tax bill much, if at all. Bezos and Sánchez are so far above income thresholds that would make filing joint taxes financially advantageous for them. And especially because this isn’t a first marriage for either of them, almost all property is likely to be kept separate, taxed separately and bound to a strict prenuptial agreement, regardless of whether they file taxes jointly or not, says Lauren Crane, partner at family and matrimonial law firm Bender and Crane. In any case, Bezos is certainly saving enough on tax deductions to cover the costs of his and Sanchez’s star-studded wedding festivities, from canals to cakes.\n\nMore from Forbes\nForbesWhy The U.S. Should Copy Canada To Fix Its Broken Air Traffic Control SystemBy Jeremy BogaiskyForbesWill Mamdani’s Proposed Millionaire Tax Save Or Sink New York City?By Kelly Phillips ErbForbesHow This Hollywood Producer Turned Brad Pitt Into A $40 Million ‘F1’ AdBy Matt CraigForbesElon Musk Has Fired One Of His Top Tesla LieutenantsBy Alan OhnsmanForbesWhy The U.S. Should Copy Canada To Fix Its Broken Air Traffic Control SystemBy Jeremy Bogaisky\n\nGot a tip?

Questions mostly among conservative critics about Biden's mental acuity began as early as 2019 when he ran in the Democratic presidential primary, but it wasn't until his ill-fated debate against Donald Trump last year that his decline became undeniable. And in recent weeks, between revelations from tell-all books, the release of the Hur tapes and his Stage 4 prostate cancer diagnosis, the scandal has only grown in scale. Yet during Trump's first term in office, the legacy media did not hesitate to opine on the president's health and fitness for office. SHIELDING BIDEN: JOURNALISTS SHED LIGHT ON THE MEDIA'S COVER-UP OF A WEAKENED PRESIDENT The speculation about Trump's mental fitness began even before he was sworn into office. In November 2016, just days after Trump shocked the world with his election victory, The Atlantic's David Frum tweeted, \"Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Article 4. We’re all going to be talking a lot more about it in the months ahead.\" New York Times columnist Ross Douthat did just that in May 2017, penning a piece titled, \"The 25th Amendment Solution for Removing Trump.\" CNN's Brian Stelter was an early media pioneer in questioning Trump's fitness. Following the violence in Charlottesville in August 2017, he claimed to viewers that chatter about the president's mental acuity filled newsrooms. \"President Trump's actions and inactions in the wake of Charlottesville are provoking some uncomfortable conversations, mostly off the air, if we're being honest,\" Stelter began a monologue. \"In discussions among friends and family and debates on social media, people are questioning the president's fitness, but these conversations are happening in newsrooms and TV studios as well… Questions like these: Is the president of the United States a racist? Is he suffering from some kind of illness? Is he fit for office? And if he’s unfit, then what?\" BIDEN BOOK AUTHORS PRESSED ON WHY THE MEDIA FAILED IN COVERING COGNITIVE DECLINE SCANDAL Then-Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson similarly declared, \"It’s time to talk about Trump’s mental health.\" \"I have spoken with people who have known Trump for decades and who say he has changed. He exhibits less self-awareness, these longtime acquaintances say, and less capacity for sustained focus. Indeed, it is instructive to compare television interviews of Trump recorded years ago with those conducted now. To this layman’s eyes and ears, there seems to have been deterioration,\" Robinson wrote. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: MEDIA EMBRACED BIDEN WHITE HOUSE ‘CHEAP FAKES’ NARRATIVE LEADING UP TO ILL-FATED DEBATE Around the same time, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell theorized that Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner moved their family to Washington, D.C., after their father's inauguration because they were \"worried about the old man.\" \"The kids have been watching, especially in recent years, a decline in Donald Trump’s executive function,\" O'Donnell told his liberal viewers. \"What neurologists call executive function includes basic mental processes like attention control, cognitive inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility. A decline in executive function is the beginning of the process that eventually leads you to take the car keys away from Dad.\" \"Having personally watched Donald Trump become increasingly incoherent over the last several years, my first assumption was the kids were going to Washington because they knew Dad is utterly incoherent much of the time, and forgetful, and inattentive.\" In November 2017, The Daily Beast was confident in diagnosing Trump with \"narcissism\" and \"sociopathy,\" admitting its willingness to disregard the famed Goldwater Rule, the principle for psychiatrists to avoid diagnosing others without a proper examination and consent, writing that psychological experts told the outlet, \"Trump’s years of media output—books, television appearances, tweets, and more—made his case one that is jarringly different, and one in which the Goldwater Rule doesn’t apply.\" CREDIBILITY CRISIS: PRESS DISMISSED HUR REPORT ON BIDEN'S MEMORY ISSUES LONG BEFORE CONCERNS BECAME UNDENIABLE USA Today published an op-ed in May 2017 penned by psychologist John Gartner, who diagnosed Trump with \"malignant narcissism,\" writing, \"If you take President Trump’s words literally, you have no choice but to conclude that he is psychotic.\" \"Some say it is unethical to dare to diagnose the president, but hundreds of mental health professionals have come together to found Duty to Warn,\" Gartner wrote, promoting his group. \"We believe that just as we are ethically and legally obligated to break confidentiality to warn a potential victim of violence, our duty to warn the public trumps all other considerations.\" \"More than 53,000 people have signed our petition, aimed at mental health professionals, stating Trump should be removed under the 25th Amendment because he is too mentally ill to competently serve,\" Gartner continued. Time Magazine also posed the question, \"Should Doctors Speculate About the President’s Mental Health?\" \"Morning Joe\" co-host Joe Scarborough urged Trump's cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment in November 2017 over his \"erratic behavior\" as the president engaged in a tit-for-tat with North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un. \"If this is not what the 25th Amendment was drafted for- I would like the cabinet members serving America, not the president, serving America - You serve America and you know it!\" Scarborough shouted. \"You don't represent him! You represent 320 million people, whose lives are literally in your hands!… The people close to him during the campaign told me had early stages of dementia.\" \"Now, listen, you can get mad at me if you want to, but it is OK to say. When are we supposed to say this, after the first nuclear missile goes?\" Scarborough continued, before calling Trump a \"mentally unstable president.\" CNN's Jake Tapper jumped on the bandwagon, sounding the alarm over Trump's tweet taunting the dictator, saying his \"nuclear button\" is \"bigger.\" \"None of this is normal, none of this acceptable, none of this, frankly, stable behavior,\" Tapper said in January 2018. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORT ON BIDEN ‘SLIPPING’ WAS SMEARED BY MEDIA Days later, then-White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson was peppered with questions by reporters following Trump's physical exam, many of them probing the president's cognitive ability. \"Can you assess the president's mental fitness for office?\" NBC News correspondent Hallie Jackson asked. \"Are you ruling out early on-set Alzheimer's? Are you looking at dementia-like symptoms?\" then-ABC News correspondent Cecilia Vega pressed Jackson. \"Is there anything you're keeping from us for privacy reasons?\" then-CNN correspondent Jim Acosta asked. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: BIDEN'S LATE-NIGHT ALLIES GO QUIET AFTER DAMNING COGNITIVE DECLINE REVELATIONS Following that briefing, CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta openly declared that Trump had \"heart disease\" based on Trump's high coronary calcium score from data released by Jackson, even though Trump's own physician never made such a diagnosis. \"The president has heart disease. Those numbers qualify him for having heart disease, and he clearly needs a plan to try to prevent some sort of heart problem down the road,\" Gupta confidently told CNN viewers. Even before Trump's 2018 physical, Politico panned the White House for not giving him a cognitive exam, running the headline, \"Is Trump mentally fit? Don't count on his physical to tell you.\" \"If President Donald Trump were any other 71-year-old — covered by Medicare and having his annual wellness visit — he’d be checked on his cognitive functions and possible safety risks. But when the president goes for his physical exam Friday, the White House said his mental fitness won’t be tested. And there’s no guarantee that the public would find out the results of cognitive tests if Trump were to take them,\" Politico wrote. In January 2018, the media hyped allegations about Trump's mental acuity from Michael Wolff's book \"Fire and Fury,\" which alleged White House staffers spoke with each other about the president's fitness to serve. It was at that time that Trump famously referred to himself as a \"very stable genius\" while combating the claims. \"The tip toeing is over. The whispers are turning into shouts. President Trump’s fitness for office is now the top story in the country,\" Stelter told \"Reliable Sources\" viewers. \"Reporters and some lawmakers are openly talking about the president’s mental stability, his health, his competency.\" \"Many Americans are worried. And journalists need to cover that,\" Stelter urged his media colleagues. \"Does it seem likely in any way that members of the GOP will take this seriously, will want to take a look at the president's mental fitness?\" MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle asked. The Washington Post feasted on the Wolff news cycle with the headline, \"The White House struggles to silence talk of Trump’s mental fitness.\" CNN's website ran with \"Trump defends his sanity amid questions about his mental state.\" CBS News similarly went with, \"Trump defends mental fitness in wake of questions raised in new book.\" Frum of The Atlantic declared in April 2018 that Trump was \"unfit to command\" and linked his mental instability to national security. \"This president is not in command of himself,\" Frum wrote, later adding, \"The person nominally in charge is in no psychic state for his office. His condition is deteriorating—and with that personal deterioration, there also deteriorates America’s security and standing in the world.\" In September 2018, on the same day The New York Times published the infamous anonymous op-ed where the author declared they were \"part of the resistance inside the Trump administration\" (it was later revealed to be mid-level DHS staffer Miles Taylor), NPR published a report, \"What You Need To Know About The 25th Amendment,\" citing \"Another surreal twist in the midst of another frenetic week,\" prompting questions about the law. 10 YEARS LATER: HOW THE MEDIA COVERED TRUMP'S ENTRY INTO THE 2016 RACE FOREVER CHANGING AMERICAN POLITICS Later that month, The New York Times published a bombshell story alleging then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein floated secretly recording Trump and discussed the 25th Amendment with others in the administration, something Rosenstein denied at the time. In February 2019, \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley of CBS News discussed what had allegedly transpired with the ousted Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who said he had such discussions with Rosenstein. \"As you're sitting in this meeting at the Justice Department talking about removing the president of the United States, you were thinking what?\" Pelley asked. \"How did I get here, confronting these confounding legal issues of such immense importance, not just to the FBI but to the entire country. It was... It was disorienting,\" McCabe responded. In November 2019, the media erupted over Trump's unscheduled visit to Walter Reed Medical Center as the White House was obscure with its public statements. It was later revealed to have been for a routine colonoscopy. \"Trump’s weekend hospital visit draws a skeptical reaction,\" wrote The Associated Press. Politico at the time declared that, \"Yes, It’s OK to Speculate on the President’s Health.\" \"Given the record of this White House, and the long history of presidential medical cover-ups, it’s almost a responsibility,\" then-Politico writer Jack Shafer wrote. \"You don’t have to think that Trump was lying about his Saturday Walter Reed visit to insist that his health… should be a foundational issue in the 2020 campaign. Getting honest answers out of a politician about his or her health begins with asking the right questions. The right question to ask Trump is this: ‘What explains your unusual visit to Walter Reed?’\" The media also went wild speculating over Trump's health in June 2020 following his appearance at West Point, where he went viral for cautiously walking down a ramp and drinking a glass of water with both hands as he was speaking. New York Times star reporter Maggie Haberman authored the story, \"Trump’s Halting Walk Down Ramp Raises New Health Questions,\" telling readers, \"President Trump faced new questions about his health on Sunday, after videos emerged of him gingerly walking down a ramp at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and having trouble bringing a glass of water to his mouth during a speech there.\" Haberman even cast doubt on Trump's claim that the ramp was \"steep\" and \"very slippery,\" writing he \"offered a description that did not match the visuals\" and there \"was no evidence that the ramp was slippery, and the skies were clear during the ceremony.\" \"The president has frequently tried to raise questions about the health and mental fitness of his rivals, while growing indignant when his own is questioned,\" Haberman wrote. \"Most recently, he and his allies have questioned the mental acuity of the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is 77.\" CNN, MSNBC ERUPTED OVER TRUMP'S RAMP WALK – BUT VIRTUALLY IGNORE BIDEN'S STAIRCASE STUMBLE The Washington Post was equally skeptical of Trump with its headline, \"Trump tries to explain his slow and unsteady walk down a ramp at West Point.\" \"President Trump late Saturday tried to explain his slow and unsteady walk down a ramp at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, which had generated concern and mockery on social media, by claiming the walkway was ‘very slippery’ and that he was worried about falling,\" wrote Philip Rucker, one of The Post's top political journalists at the time. \"Elements of Trump’s explanation strained credulity. Trump’s claim that the ramp had been 'very slippery' was inconsistent with the weather, which on Saturday in West Point, N.Y., was sunny and clear-skied. The grass plain on which the commencement took place was dry.\" A separate Post report juxtaposed concerns about Trump's health with Biden's with the headline, \"As Trump casts Biden as ‘sleepy Joe,’ his critics raise questions about his own fitness.\" \"For Trump, who has tried to cast his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, as ‘sleepy’ and mentally absent, the attacks over his own wellness appeared to hit close to home,\" The Post wrote. Both The Times and The Post elevated mockery of Trump by liberal late-night hosts. CNN and MSNBC went wall-to-wall with coverage of Trump's cautious walk down the ramp. \"What's the matter with Donald Trump?\" MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace asked a panelist with a slight grin. \"Americans have every reason to question his health. Walking down a ramp, holding a rail, probably no issue. Now you know how it feels, don’t you? What goes around, comes around,\" then-CNN anchor Don Lemon taunted Trump. Tapper took a swipe at Trump for \"spending about 14 minutes talking about West Point and defending his wobbly walk down that ramp,\" while recapping the president's remarks from a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As Trump was being treated for COVID at Walter Reed Medical Center in October 2020, CBS News' Margaret Brennan pressed then-National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien on invoking the 25th Amendment during an exchange on \"Face The Nation.\" \"Have you and the team discussed a scenario in which at some point the president might have to transfer power if he can no longer discharge the powers and duties of his office?\" Brennan asked. \"No, that's not something that's on the table at this point,\" O'Brien responded. \"But it may be as you just said,\" Brennan interjected before O'Brien touted Trump's recovery. Brennan wasn't alone. There was a flurry of reports speculating about the 25th Amendment being implemented during Trump's bout with COVID like ABC News' \"What happens if Trump becomes incapacitated? The 25th Amendment could kick in,\" The Associated Press' \"AP Explains: Transfer of power under 25th Amendment\" and the liberal site Slate's, \"The 25th Amendment Needs an Update.\" Media chatter over the 25th Amendment resurfaced months later following the January 6 riot on Capitol Hill, less than three weeks before Biden was sworn into office. CNN, ABC News and CNBC all reported that members of Trump's cabinet were having discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment, though it was never ultimately pursued. Fast-forward to 2025. Trump was sworn back into office after defeating Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, all of which followed Biden's dramatic exit from the race last July. After turning a blind eye for much of the Biden era regarding presidential health and wellness, the legacy media revived its intense scrutiny of Trump in the heat of the 2024 election. Last September, The Los Angeles Times speculated about Trump's \"rhetorical walkabouts,\" suggesting it was a sign of \"cognitive decline.\" CNN's Abby Philip argued there was a \"double standard\" regarding the lack of attention towards Trump's mental acuity. In October, PBS News Hour took aim at Trump's \"rambling speeches,\" saying they \"raise questions about mental decline.\" NBC News sounded the alarm over Trump's behavior at one campaign event with the story \"Trump's bizarre music session reignites questions about his mental acuity,\" as did The New York Times with the headline \"Trump’s Speeches, Increasingly Angry and Rambling, Reignite the Question of Age.\" The Washington Post also asked, \"How big a political problem is mental acuity for Trump?\" The media continued speculating about Trump's health even throughout his second term. Last month, USA Today columnist Rex Huppke penned a piece titled \"Is Trump in mental decline? He sounds far worse than Biden ever did.\" The Daily Beast ran the headline, \"Trump Shows Signs of ‘Cognitive Decline’ Says Speech Expert.\" Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, the co-authors of the bombshell Biden book \"Original Sin,\" have said during their book tour that one of the lessons learned in reporting on Biden's cognitive decline is for journalists to intensely pursue the truth about a president's health going forward, including Trump's. \"This goes beyond Joe Biden. It should be relevant to Donald Trump and whoever comes after Donald Trump,\" Tapper said.

The Iowa Democrat also ran in 2022.Now, Bohannan is making her third go at the district in the 2026 midterms, when Democrats are hoping a 2018-style blue wave will carry them to victory in key races across the country. Democrats will need to win seats like this to retake control of the House of Representatives next November.Trump's tariffs are likely to loom over key races next year, but the issue could be particularly important in the Hawkeye State. Trump says tariffs are necessary to bring back jobs to the U.S. and close the trade deficit. But exports of agricultural goods are a lifeline for farmers in states like Iowa.On Thursday, the president said he signed a trade deal with China, but the full impact of how that deal may affect farmers remained unclear.Bohannan emphasized tariffs as a key challenge facing Iowa in an interview with Newsweek, in which she discussed her campaign.What to KnowBohannan said she views tariffs as a \"significant issue\" facing Iowa.\"I've already talked to some farmers who are very worried about the effect of tariffs and the trade war with China,\" she said. \"What we see is that China in the past has bought a lot of farm products from Iowa, and now China is seeking out other trading partners besides Iowa and besides the U.S., like Brazil for example.\"The U.S. has landed in a trade war with China, which faced the highest tariffs under Trump's plan. This has affected farmers in the state, as China is the largest importer of soybeans from the U.S., importing more than $12 billion worth of the agricultural product in 2024. China has sought new trading partners, a move that could create economic uncertainty and losses for soybean farmers in states like Iowa.Once the trade relationships with Iowa farmers have been \"severed,\" they will be hard to restore, Bohannan warned.Many residents in the district are also \"already struggling to get by\" due to the high cost-of-living, she said. Legislation supported by Republicans, such as Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" will only make those challenges worse, Bohannan said.Miller-Meeks told KHQA, a news station based in Quincy, Illinois, that Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill\" will address concerns, adding that tariffs are used as a \"negotiating tactic,\" and that manufacturers and small business owners have for years raised concerns about China's \"egregious trade practices.\"A poll that was published this week and released by the House Majority PAC showed Bohannan with an early lead over Miller-Meeks in the midterms, with 43 percent of voters supporting the Democrat and 39 percent backing the Republican. The poll surveyed 555 voters in the district from June 18-19, Politico reported.Bohannan on How Democrats Can Win Back Rural VotersBohannan outperformed Harris by eight points in Iowa's 1st District—which includes areas like Davenport and Des Moines suburbs, as well as large swaths of rural areas in southeast Iowa.The issue of winning back rural voters has been an existential question for the Democratic Party as they try to stop bleeding in Midwest and Great Lake states where their margins have diminished over the past decade. Iowa, which backed former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but has also backed Trump, is emblematic of that challenge.Bohannan overperformed last year by cutting into GOP margins in some of the rural counties in the district. She told Newsweek that Democrats can win back rural voters by getting out and talk to them \"where they are.\"\"That sounds simple, but the fact is that a lot of times, candidates don't take the time to go out to rural areas and small communities to connect with voters,\" she said. \"They go to the bigger cities and do big events, but they don't take the time to really go to these communities and talk to people and listen to people.\"She attributed those efforts to her performance in 2024.\"I actually spent time in these areas. I met with people to talk about what was happening in their public schools. What was happening with childcare and with water quality, and elder care in their communities,\" she said. \"People got to know me and got to trust me. They understand that I come from a very small rural community just like theirs. My family had to make very hard decisions about filling prescriptions after my dad got sick and lost his insurance or putting food on the table.\"What People Are SayingNational Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokeswoman Emily Tuttle, in a statement after Bohannan announced her campaign: \"When will Christina learn? Iowans have rejected her twice already, and now she has to run to the left to beat radical Bob Kraus and Bernie-bro Travis Terrell in the primary. There's no doubt whoever comes out of this liberal rat race will be sent packing when Iowans re-elect America First fighter Mariannette Miller-Meeks next fall.\"Christina Bohannan told Newsweek: \"One thing that's so interesting about Iowans is that we are fair minded, and we are willing to give people a chance regardless of political party if we believe that you're authentic, and you're willing to put Iowa first. So, in 2024, 33,000 people who voted for Donald Trump in this district also voted for me. I won two counties here that Trump won handily. What we see here is that Iowans really want somebody who is going to put Iowa first.\"What Happens NextThe race is expected to be one of the most competitive of the 2026 midterms. Both the Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball, two of the leading election forecasters, classify the race as a pure toss-up.Bohannan and Miller-Meeks are also set to face off against other candidates in primaries scheduled to be held on June 2, 2026. The general election is set for November 3, 2026.","summary":"\"I've already talked to some farmers who are very worried about the effect of tariffs and the trade war with China,\" Christina Bohannan told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/christina-bohannan-trump-tariffs-iowa-house-race-interview-2091347","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2672285/christina-bohannan-running-iowa-battleground-seat.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 09:00:01","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.131},{"id":336183726,"title":"Detailed demographic profiles of Trump and Harris voters in 2024 - Pew Research Center","text":"The composition of Republican and Democratic voters in the United States has changed since the 2020 presidential election, and the shifts have been even larger since the 2016 contest.\n\nDonald Trump’s voters overall were more racially and ethnically diverse in 2024 than in his prior campaigns, reflecting gains among Hispanic, Black and Asian voters. Conversely, Kamala Harris’ voters were somewhat less diverse than the voters who backed Joe Biden in 2020 or Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nDespite these changes, there continue to be wide differences in the makeup of the partisan coalitions.\n\nTrump voters were less racially and ethnically diverse, older and less likely to have a four-year college degree than Harris voters. And the sizable religious differences between those who voted for Republican and Democratic candidates persisted: Roughly eight-in-ten Trump voters (79%) identified as Christian, compared with about half (52%) of Harris voters.\n\nRacial and ethnic composition of Harris and Trump voters in 2024\n\nThe racial and ethnic composition of voters shifted only modestly over the past three elections, though the share of voters who are White and not Hispanic continued to tick lower. White voters made up 71% of all voters last year, down from 73% in 2020 and 74% in 2016.\n\nRelated: Explore long-term changes in the composition of registered voters in our report “Changing Partisan Coalitions in a Politically Divided Nation.”\n\nWhite non-Hispanic adults continued to make up a large majority (78%) of voters who supported Trump. However, this represents the lowest share in the past three presidential elections. White voters made up 86% of Trump’s coalition in 2020 and 88% of Trump voters in 2016.\n\nAnother 10% of Trump voters were Hispanic, while 3% were Black and 3% were Asian. The share of Trump voters who are Hispanic, Black, Asian or another race has roughly doubled since his 2016 election, from 11% to 20%, mostly because Hispanic voters now make up a larger share of his voters (10%, up from 6% in 2016). \n\nAmong Harris voters, 64% were non-Hispanic White, slightly higher than the share of Biden (61%) or Clinton voters (60%) who were White.\n\nAmong Harris voters, 16% were non-Hispanic Black, while another 11% were Hispanic. Asian adults accounted for 5% of Harris’ voters.\n\nEducational composition of 2024 voters\n\nAbout six-in ten voters in 2024 (59%) did not have a college degree. This share has steadily decreased over time as the share of Americans with a college degree has grown (in 2016, 63% of voters did not have a college degree).\n\nOverall, those who voted for Democratic candidates in recent elections have been more likely than Republican voters to have a college degree.\n\nHarris voters were about evenly split between those who do have a college degree (48%) and those who do not (51%). The share of Democratic voters who have a college degree has risen somewhat since 2016, when 43% had a degree.\n\nAmong Trump’s 2024 voters, two-thirds (67%) did not have a college degree, down slightly from 71% in 2016.\n\nHowever, the share of Republican voters who are White and have no college degree has substantially declined since 2016. \n\nIn 2024, White noncollege voters made up a narrow majority (51%) of Trump’s coalition. That is the smallest share in his three campaigns for the White House:\n\nIn 2020, 58% of Trump voters were White adults who did not have a four-year degree;\n\nIn 2016, more than six-in-ten Trump voters (63%) were White, noncollege voters.\n\nThere has been less change in the share of Democratic voters who are White with no college degree (29% in 2024 vs. 27% in 2020 and 26% in 2016). As was the case for Biden and Clinton supporters, White college graduates made up a larger share of Harris supporters (35%) than did White voters who did not have a college degree (29%).\n\nAge composition of 2024 voters\n\nThe age distribution of voters in 2024 was roughly the same as it was in the last two presidential elections. Overall, a majority of voters (56%) were ages 50 and older, while 44% were under the age of 50.\n\nYounger voters continued to make up a somewhat larger share of the Democratic coalition than the Republican coalition, but voters under the age of 50 made up a larger share of Trump’s coalition in 2024 than in 2016.\n\nAmong Democratic voters:\n\n52% of Harris voters were ages 5o and older, while 48% were younger than 50.\n\nThese numbers are similar to Biden and Clinton’s coalitions.\n\nAmong Republican voters:\n\n60% of Trump voters were 50 and older in 2024, down from 65% in 2016.\n\nVoters under 50 made up 40% of Trump’s coalition in 2024, up from 35% in 2016.\n\nRural, suburban and urban composition of 2024 voters\n\nThe community profiles of Harris and Trump voters have not fundamentally changed since 2020.\n\nSuburban voters made up the largest shares of both Harris (56%) and Trump (49%) voters in 2024. And while Harris voters were much more likely than Trump voters to describe their communities as urban (28% vs. 13%), rural voters made up a substantially larger share of Trump voters (36%) than Harris voters (16%).\n\nReligious composition of 2024 voters\n\nOverall, the religious composition of voters has shifted modestly since 2016. In 2024, roughly four-in-ten voters (43%) were Protestants, while about a quarter were religiously unaffiliated and 20% were Catholics. In 2016, Protestants made up 47% of voters.\n\nProtestants again made up a majority of Trump voters (54%) in 2024, compared with 32% of Harris voters. The share of Protestants making up each coalition has dipped slightly since 2016.\n\nReligiously unaffiliated voters (atheist, agnostic and those who describe themselves as “nothing in particular”) made up a much larger share of Democratic voters than Republican voters (39% vs. 15%).\n\nReligiously unaffiliated voters were a slightly larger share of Harris voters (39%) than Biden or Clinton voters (35% each).\n\nCatholics made up about one-in-five Trump voters (22%) and a slightly smaller share of Harris voters (18%).\n\nWhite Protestants made up a smaller share of Trump’s coalition in 2024 than they did in 2020 and 2016. In 2024, fewer than half of Trump’s voters (43%) identified as White evangelical (29%) or nonevangelical Protestant (15%). That is lower than in 2020 (51%) or 2016 (52%).\n\nBlack Protestants continued to make up a larger share of the Democratic coalition than the Republican coalition (12% vs. 2%). The share of Trump’s coalition that was made up of Protestants whose race or ethnicity is something other than White or Black has grown since 2020. In 2024, these voters made up 9% of Trump’s voters, up from 5% in 2020.","summary":"Detailed demographic profiles of Trump and Harris voters in 2024 - Pew Research Center","url":"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/06/26/demographic-profiles-of-trump-and-harris-voters-in-2024/","image":"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/06/PP_2025.6.26_validated-voters_featured.jpg?w=1200&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 07:56:04","author":"Reem Nadeem","authors":["Reem Nadeem"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":336183728,"title":"Behind Trump&#39;s 2024 Victory- Turnout, Voting Patterns and Demographics - Pew Research Center","text":"In his third run for president in 2024, Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris by 1.5 percentage points overall, winning 312 Electoral College votes and the national popular vote for the first time.\n\nTrump won with a voter coalition that was more racially and ethnically diverse than in 2020 or 2016, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of the 2024 electorate.\n\nAmong Hispanic voters, Trump battled to near parity in 2024 (51% Harris, 48% Trump) after losing to Joe Biden 61%-36% in 2020.\n\nTrump won 15% of Black voters – up from 8% four years earlier. \n\nTrump also did better among Asian voters. While a majority of Asian voters (57%) backed Harris, 40% supported Trump. This was a narrower margin than Biden’s in 2020 (70% to 30%).\n\nThese shifts were largely the result of differences in which voters turned out in the 2020 and 2024 elections. As in the past, a relatively small share of voters switched which party’s candidate they supported.\n\nIn 2024, Trump benefited from higher turnout among those who voted for him in 2020. He also held an edge over Harris among voters who did not vote four years earlier – a group that was considerably more diverse than those who voted in both elections.\n\nAnd while Trump improved his performance among several groups in 2024, many of the demographic patterns in voting preferences that have dominated American politics for the last several decades remained evident last November:\n\nEducational divide. In each of his campaigns, Trump has held an edge among voters without four-year college degrees. But his 14-point advantage among noncollege voters (56% to 42%) was double his margin in 2016. Harris won voters with college degrees by 57% to 41%, but that was smaller than Biden’s lead among this group in 2020.\n\nA wider urban-rural gap. Trump won voters living in rural areas by 40 points (69%-29%), which was higher than his margins in 2020 or 2016. Harris’ advantage among voters living in urban areas was nearly as large (65% voted for Harris, 33% Trump). \n\nContinued differences by religious attendance. Nearly two-thirds of voters who attend religious services monthly or more (64%) voted for Trump, while only about a third (34%) supported Harris. Harris held a narrower advantage (56%-43%) among the larger group of voters who attend services less frequently.\n\nFor more on voting patterns, refer to Chapter 2.\n\nFrom Biden 2020 to Trump 2024: A tale of differential turnout and changing voter preferences\n\nWhile most of those who voted in 2020 cast ballots again in 2024, a larger share of Trump’s voters (89%) than Biden’s (85%) turned out.\n\nAnd a larger share of those who did not turn out in 2020 – but did in 2024 – supported Trump (54%) than Harris (42%).\n\nWhat 2020 voters did\n\nBetween 2020 and 2024, 85% of those who backed Trump in 2020 did so again in 2024. About one-in-ten of his 2020 voters (11%) didn’t turn out in 2024, and 4% voted for Harris or someone else. \n\nHarris received 79% of Biden’s 2020 voters. Compared with Trump’s 2020 voters, a larger share of Biden’s didn’t vote in 2024 (15%), and 6% voted for Trump or another candidate.\n\nWhat new and returning voters did\n\nMost adults who were eligible to vote in 2020 – but declined to do so – stayed home again in 2024. But among those who did turn out, Trump had the edge. Among all 2020 nonvoters (including those who were too young and ineligible to vote in 2020), 14% supported Trump in 2024 while 12% supported Harris.\n\nStability and change\n\nRoughly three-quarters of eligible adults did the same thing in 2024 as they did in 2020: voted for a candidate of the same party or did not turn out.\n\nAnd about a quarter of eligible adults did something different in 2024 than in 2020: They switched their vote choice, voted in 2024 when they had not voted in 2020, or did not vote in 2024 after voting in 2020.\n\nHarris would not necessarily have benefited from higher voter turnout\n\nWhen asked how they would have voted, people eligible to vote who did not do so were fairly evenly split in their preferences: 44% said they would have supported Trump, while 40% said they would have backed Harris.\n\nThis is a stark contrast to 2020, when those who didn’t vote expressed a clear preference for Biden over Trump (46% to 35%). Democrats have held an edge among nonvoters in prior elections dating back to at least the 1960s – though there is some evidence this advantage had declined in recent elections. \n\nAs a result, if all Americans eligible to vote in 2024 had cast ballots, the overall margin in the popular vote likely would not have been much different.\n\nIn contrast, if all eligible Americans had voted in 2020, Biden’s margin of victory would likely have increased.\n\nOther key findings\n\nNaturalized citizens – immigrants who hold U.S. citizenship – who voted in the election split their votes about evenly, with 51% voting for Harris and 47% for Trump. In 2020, naturalized citizens favored Biden by 21 percentage points: 59% to 38%. In 2024, naturalized citizens made up 9% of voters.\n\nTrump made gains among men – especially men under 50. Men favored Trump by 12 points (55%-43%) after being closely divided in 2020. In particular, men under 50 split their votes fairly evenly this year (49% Trump, 48% Harris). In 2020, this group backed Biden by 10 points (53% Biden, 43% Trump).\n\nEven in an era of high-turnout elections, many eligible Americans remain on the sidelines. The 64% turnout rate in 2024 was the second highest since 1960, behind only 2020. However, about a quarter of Americans eligible to vote (26%) have no record of voting in any of the last three national elections (2020, 2022, 2024). These Americans are disproportionately young and much less likely to have four-year college degrees than those who vote more frequently. \n\nFor more on voter turnout, refer to Chapter 1.\n\nIn-person early voting has grown in popularity. Nearly a third of 2024 voters (32%) cast their ballot in person prior to Election Day, up from 27% in 2020. Another 34% cast their ballot in person on Election Day.","summary":"Behind Trump&#39;s 2024 Victory- Turnout, Voting Patterns and Demographics - Pew Research Center","url":"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/06/26/behind-trumps-2024-victory-a-more-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-voter-coalition/","image":"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/06/PP_2025.6.26_validated-voters_featured.jpg?w=1200&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 07:54:59","author":"Reem Nadeem","authors":["Reem Nadeem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.267},{"id":336183730,"title":"How voting patterns changed in the 2024 election- A detailed analysis - Pew Research Center","text":"For the most part, voting patterns across demographic groups in the 2024 presidential election were not substantially different from the 2020 and 2016 elections. But Donald Trump’s gains among several key groups of voters proved decisive in his 2024 victory.To explore voting patterns among subgroups over time, refer to detailed tables.\n\nHispanic voters were divided in 2024, a major shift from 2020 and 2016. In 2020, Joe Biden won Hispanic voters by 25 percentage points, and Hispanic voters supported Hillary Clinton by an even wider margin in 2016. But Trump drew nearly even with Kamala Harris among Hispanic voters, losing among them by only 3 points.\n\nBlack voters also moved to Trump but remained overwhelmingly Democratic.Trump nearly doubled his support among Black voters between 2020 and 2024: 8% voted for him in 2020 vs. 15% last year. Still, 83% of Black voters backed Harris.\n\nMen – especially men under 50 – backed Trump by larger margins. Men supported Trump by a wider margin than in 2020. Trump narrowly won men under age 50, a shift from 2020 when men in that age group favored Biden by 10 points.\n\nAs in prior elections, a change in voters’ partisan allegiances – switching from the Democratic to the Republican candidate or vice versa – proved to be a less important factor in Trump’s victory than differential partisan turnout. In the overall electorate and among key demographic groups, Republican-leaning eligible voters simply were more likely to turn out than Democratic-leaning eligible voters in 2024. \n\nAnd despite some notable changes in the coalitions, many familiar divisions in demographic voting patterns were once again evident. For example, voters with at least four-year college degrees and urban residents voted for Harris by wide margins. By contrast, Trump retained sizable advantages among noncollege voters and voters living in rural areas.\n\nGender and race in voting preferences in 2024\n\nMen favored Trump by 12 percentage points in the 2024 election, while women favored Harris by 7 points. Trump made gains among men compared with 2020 and held roughly steady among women:\n\n55% of men voted for Trump in 2024, up from 50% of men in 2020.\n\n46% of women voted for Trump in 2024, compared with 44% of women four years earlier.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nA 55% majority of White voters cast ballots for Trump in 2024. An identical share of White voters favored Trump in 2020, and 54% selected him in 2016.\n\nWhite men favored Trump by a margin of 20 points in the most recent election. White women favored Trump by a narrower 4-point margin.\n\nThough most Black voters continued to prefer the Democratic candidate, a larger share of Black voters cast ballots for Trump in 2024 than in 2020 or 2016. Roughly eight-in-ten Black voters (83%) reported voting for Harris in 2024, while 15% favored Trump. In 2020, 8% of Black voters reported voting for Trump, and just 6% of Black voters favored him in 2016.\n\nBlack men and women alike were more likely to vote for Trump in 2024 than in 2020. One-in-ten Black women and 21% of Black men voted for Trump in the most recent election.\n\nIncreased shares of Black voters who favored Trump were driven not by individuals shifting their preferences, but by changes in who turned out to vote. While some Black voters did indeed switch from Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024, these defections were largely canceled out by Black voters who switched in the opposite direction.\n\nNearly half of Hispanic voters backed Trump. His support among Hispanic voters was 12 points higher than in 2020 (48% in 2024, 36% in 2020). And the share voting for the Democratic candidate fell from 61% to 51%.\n\nIn 2024, Hispanic women and Hispanic men were divided in their preferences for president. In 2020, Hispanic women were more likely than Hispanic men to vote for the Democratic candidate.\n\nAgain, these changes were primarily driven by changing turnout patterns: 9% of eligible Hispanic voters voted in 2020 but not in 2024, and these voters favored Biden in 2020 by roughly two-to-one (69% to 31%). By contrast, among Hispanic eligible voters who voted in 2024 but not in 2020, 60% voted for Trump in 2024 and 37% voted for Harris.\n\nAsian voters favored Harris in 2024, with 57% voting for her. Four-in-ten Asian voters (40%) cast ballots for Trump, up from 30% in 2020.\n\nAsian men and women favored Harris by nearly identical margins (16 and 17 points, respectively).\n\nAge and the 2024 vote\n\nConsistent with other recent elections, younger voters tended to favor the Democratic candidate while older voters tended to favor the Republican.\n\nVoters ages 18 to 49 favored Harris by 7 percentage points in 2024, compared with a 17-point margin for Biden in 2020. Changing vote patterns were driven in part by defections among young voters: 8% of Biden’s 2020 voters under 50 switched to Trump in 2024, while 4% of voters in this group went from Trump to Harris.\n\nThe share of voters ages 50 and older who favored Trump was essentially unchanged across the two most recent presidential elections: 54% voted for Trump in 2024, compared with 52% in 2020.\n\nVote margins shifted among men under 50. In 2024, men under 50 were divided in their preferences: 49% voted for Trump, while 48% supported Harris. By contrast, in 2020, Biden won men under 50 by 10 points (53% to 43%).\n\nAge cohorts\n\nThe group of voters who were under age 50 in 2024 is not identical to the group of voters who were under age 50 in 2020: Some voters aged out of this group, while other young adults became newly eligible to vote. Looking at age cohorts – groups of people defined by when they were born as opposed to how old they are – allows us to see how the same subset of voters have changed over time.\n\nMost age cohorts of voters saw only small shifts in their candidate preferences between the 2020 and 2024 elections. However, those born in the 1980s and those born in the 1990s or 2000s stand out: Members of both groups became more likely to favor Trump between 2020 and 2024.\n\nDefections played a significant role in the changing voting patterns of those born in the 1980s: 8% of 2020 Biden voters in this group switched their votes to Trump in 2024, while just 2% of 2020 Trump voters born in the ’80s switched their votes to Harris. Among those born in the 1990s or 2000s, changes in who turned out to vote accounted for the shift in Trump’s favor.\n\nEducation and the 2024 election\n\nAs has been the pattern through several elections, voters were sharply divided in 2024 by whether they have a college degree. Voters with a four-year degree or more education – who constitute about 40% of all voters – favored Harris by a double-digit margin (16 percentage points), while those without a college degree favored Trump by nearly as much (14 points).\n\nCollege graduates and non-college graduates alike were slightly less likely to vote for the Democratic candidate compared with four years earlier.\n\nVoters with postgraduate degrees remained a strong Democratic group. Voters with postgraduate degrees favored Harris by roughly two-to-one (65% to 33%), which is similar to Biden’s and Clinton’s advantages in the past two elections. Harris led more narrowly among those with no more than a four-year degree, while Trump won by large margins among those with less formal education.\n\nEducational differences among White and Hispanic voters, but not Black voters. White noncollege voters were about 20 points more likely to support Trump than those with a four-year degree; that is similar to the difference four years ago. Noncollege Hispanic voters also were more likely to back Trump than Hispanic voters with college degrees, but the gap was smaller than among White voters. There were no meaningful educational differences among Black voters.\n\nParty and ideology in the 2024 election\n\nAmong people who voted, more than nine-in-ten Republicans (95%) voted for their party’s candidate in the 2024 election, and an identical share of Democrats voted for Harris. Including those who lean toward one of the two major parties, 92% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents voted for Trump, while 94% of Democrats and Democratic leaners voted for Harris.\n\nIn 2020, 95% in each party also voted for their party’s nominee.\n\nIndependents (including those who lean toward one party or the other) were evenly divided in 2024, with 48% voting for Harris and 48% for Trump. Four years ago, this group favored Biden by 9 percentage points.\n\nAs in past elections, ideology was closely related to vote choice:\n\n97% of conservative Republicans and Republican leaners voted for Trump.\n\n82% of moderate and liberal Republicans and Republican leaners voted for Trump.\n\n90% of conservative and moderate Democrats and Democratic leaners voted for Harris.\n\n98% of liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners voted for Harris.\n\nCommunity type and voting preferences in 2024\n\nThe urban-rural divide, already a major factor in presidential elections, grew in 2024 as rural voters favored Trump by an even larger margin than they did in 2020.\n\nNearly seven-in-ten validated voters who describe their communities as rural (69%) voted for Trump in 2024, while 29% voted for Harris. In 2020, 65% of rural voters favored Trump and 34% favored Biden. In 2016, 59% voted for Trump and 34% cast ballots for Clinton.\n\nTrump benefited from rural voters defecting to him in addition to changing turnout patterns: 7% of Biden’s rural 2020 voters who voted in both elections converted into Trump voters in 2024, while just 3% of Trump’s rural 2020 voters switched to Harris.\n\nTrump also benefited from changing turnout patterns – though not from significant defections – among suburban voters. Suburban voters continued to favor the Democratic candidate, but by a smaller margin than in 2020 (a 4-point margin in 2024 vs. 10 points in 2020).\n\nWhile Harris maintained the Democrats’ substantial advantage among urban voters, she did not make any gains within this group to offset her losses among suburban and rural voters. Urban voters favored Harris by roughly a two-to-one margin (65% vs. 33%) in 2024, just as they favored Biden by roughly two-to-one in 2020 (66% vs. 32%).\n\nReligion and the presidential election\n\nReligious groups voted along familiar lines in 2024, even as Trump gained among Protestants, Catholics, and those who reported attending religious services on at least a monthly basis.\n\nProtestants\n\nTrump’s margin among all Protestant voters increased to 26 percentage points in the most recent election (from 19 points in 2020), with 62% of Protestants favoring him. Trump’s gains among Protestants included small but significant gains from defectors: 5% of Protestants who voted for Biden in 2020 switched to Trump in 2024, while just 3% of Trump’s 2020 Protestants went to Harris.\n\nTrump also gained – through changes in turnout – among Black Protestants and among Protestants of a race or ethnicity other than White or Black.\n\nWhite evangelical Protestants continued to overwhelmingly favor Trump: 81% voted for Trump in 2024, compared with 83% in 2020. And nearly identical majorities of White nonevangelical Protestants voted for Trump in 2024 (58%) and 2020 (57%).\n\nTrump won a majority of Catholic voters, taking 55% of the Catholic vote to Harris’ 43%. Four years earlier, Catholics split almost evenly: 50% voted for Biden and 49% for Trump.\n\nAs with Protestants, Trump benefited from a small advantage among Catholic defectors: 7% of 2020 Biden voters converted to Trump voters in 2024, while just 4% of Catholics who favored Trump in the earlier election shifted to Harris. The remainder of Trump’s gains with this group came from changes in turnout.\n\nThe religiously unaffiliated\n\nUnaffiliated voters continued to favor the Democratic candidate, with 70% voting for Harris and 28% voting for Trump. Four years earlier, 71% of religiously unaffiliated voters selected Biden and 26% selected Trump.\n\nAttendance at religious services\n\nTrump in 2024 won a larger share of voters who attend religious services at least once a month than he did in 2020. The same was true among voters who attend less frequently.\n\nAmong frequent attenders, Trump’s share of voters increased to 64% from 59% in 2020. Among less frequent attenders, it increased to 43% from 40%.\n\nVoting patterns among naturalized citizens\n\nFor the 2024 and 2020 presidential elections, we have sufficient data to look at vote choice among citizens who report having been born in another country – in other words, naturalized U.S. citizens.\n\nNaturalized citizens were closely divided in the 2024 election: About half (51%) voted for Harris and 47% voted for Trump.\n\nThis marked a shift from four years ago, when naturalized citizens backed Biden by a wide 59%-38% margin.\n\nWhile a small share of naturalized citizens switched from voting for Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024, these defectors were canceled out by voters who switched from Trump to Harris. Trump’s gains among naturalized citizens were instead driven by different voters turning out to cast ballots across the two elections.\n\nRoughly two-in-ten naturalized citizens who voted in 2024 had not voted in 2020 (22%), and a 57% majority of this group voted for Trump in 2024. Meanwhile, among the naturalized citizens who voted in 2020 but dropped off in 2024, 67% were Biden voters in the earlier election.\n\nRace and ethnicity among naturalized citizens\n\nWhite, Hispanic and Asian naturalized citizens each shifted at least somewhat in Trump’s direction between 2020 and 2024, due primarily to changes in turnout:\n\n55% of White naturalized citizens voted for Trump in 2024, compared with 41% in 2020.\n\n51% of Hispanic naturalized citizens voted for Trump, up from 39% in 2020.\n\n46% of Asian naturalized citizens voted for Trump, an increase from 35% in 2020.","summary":"How voting patterns changed in the 2024 election- A detailed analysis - Pew Research Center","url":"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/06/26/voting-patterns-in-the-2024-election/","image":"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/06/PP_2025.6.26_validated-voters_featured.jpg?w=1200&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 07:42:42","author":"Reem Nadeem","authors":["Reem Nadeem"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":336268928,"title":"‘A marker of luxury and arrogance’: why gravity-defying boobs are back – and what they say about the state of the world","text":"It was, almost, a proud feminist moment. On inauguration day in January, the unthinkable happened. President Trump, the biggest ego on the planet, was upstaged by a woman in a white trouser suit – the proud uniform of Washington feminists, worn by Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in solidarity with the traditional colour of the suffragettes. In the event, the white trouser suit barely got a mention. The show was stolen by what was underneath: Lauren Sánchez’s cleavage, cantilevered under a wisp of white lace. The breasts of the soon-to-be Mrs Jeff Bezos were the ceremony’s breakout stars. The only talking point that came close was Mark Zuckerberg’s inability to keep his eyes off them.\n\nCall it a curtain raiser for a year in which breasts have been – how to put this? – in your face. Sydney Sweeney’s pair have upstaged her acting career to the point that she wears a sweatshirt that says “Sorry for Having Great Tits and Correct Opinions”. Bullet bras are making a sudden comeback, in sugar-pink silk on Dua Lipa on the cover of British Vogue and nosing keen as shark fins under fine cashmere sweaters at the Miu Miu show at Paris fashion week. Perhaps most tellingly, Kim Kardashian, whose body is her business empire, has made a 180-degree pivot from monetising her famous backside to selling, in her Skims lingerie brand, push-up bras featuring a pert latex nipple – with or without a fake piercing – that make an unmissable point under your T-shirt. Not since Eva Herzigova was in her Wonderbra in 1994 – Hello Boys – have boobs been so, well, big.\n\nIt is oddly tricky to discuss boobs without sounding as if you are in a doctor’s surgery or a fraternity house. The word breasts is rather formal. Boobs is fond and familiar, which feels right, but sniggery, which doesn’t. Bosoms are what you see in period dramas. Knockers, jugs, melons, hooters, fun bags? Whatever we call them, they are full of contradictions. Men see them and think of sex; babies see them and think of food. They contain a liquid without which the human race could not until recently have survived, but they are also one of the most tumour-prone parts of the body. You can admire them in the Uffizi, the Louvre and the National Gallery, but they are banned on Instagram (Free the nipple!). They are nursing Madonnas, and they are Madonna in a conical bra. They are topless goddesses and top shelf; entirely natural yet extremely rude; and they are, right now, absolutely everywhere.\n\nThere is a whole lot going on here. In America, the impact of the Trump administration is going way beyond policy, reshaping culture at a granular level. The Maga ruling class has a thirst for busty women in tight clothes, which fuses something new – what Zuckerberg has called “masculine energy” – with nostalgia for 1950s America. (The “again” in Make America Great Again may not have a date stamp, but it comes with a white picket fence.) As a symbol of fertility, full breasts are catnip to a regime obsessed with breeding and keen to limit reproductive freedoms.\n\nBoobs are in the eye of the storm of the current gender fluidity rollback, too. Nothing says boys will be boys and women should look like women more than Bezos’s Popeye biceps next to Sánchez’s lace-edged curves. They used to say that a picture was worth a thousand words; in today’s ultra-visual culture, that rate of exchange has steepened. The fact that a culture that was, until a few years ago, sensitively exploring gender as a complex issue has now regressed to the level of teenage boys watching American Pie for the first time says everything about how things have changed.\n\nSince 1962, when Timmie Jean Lindsey, a mother of six from Texas, became the first woman in the world to have silicone implants, breasts have been a lightning rod for the battleground between what is real and what is fake. The debate that catapulted Pamela Anderson to fame in the 1990s has become one of the defining issues of our time. It turns out that breasts, and beauty, were just the start. Artificial intelligence has jumped the conversation on. From Mountainhead to Black Mirror, we are now talking not just about real boobs v fake ones but about real brains v fake ones. In the battle between old-school flesh and blood and the prospect of a new, possibly improved, version of the human race, breasts have been leading the culture for 63 years.\n\nIn a nutshell, the world is losing its mind over the girls. “The State of the Union is … boobs” was the New York Post’s succinct verdict on the charms of Sweeney, while Amy Hamm wrote in the National Post that they were “double-D harbingers of the death of woke”. On inauguration day, onlookers were divided between outrage at an inappropriate level of nudity and admiration for how Sánchez’s “Latina auntie” energy showed her, um, balls.\n\nAll of which makes it a weird time to have breasts. When writer Emma Forrest saw the author portrait taken for the jacket of her new novel, Father Figure, her first thought was, “Oh wow, my boobs look huge.” She is wearing a plain black T-shirt, “so that must be OK, right? It’s not like I’m wearing a corset. I feel I should be allowed to have people review my books without having an issue with my boobs. But who knows.”\n\nBreasts have always had the power to undermine women. After a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, Sarah Thornton found herself with much bigger breasts than she had wanted – having asked for “lesbian yoga boobs”, she woke up with D cups – and wrote her book, Tits Up, to make peace with her “silicone impostors” by investigating their cultural history. Breasts, she writes, are “visible obstacles to equality, associated with nature and nurture rather than reason and power”. Since she was a teenager, Forrest has lived with “the assumption that having big breasts means being messy, being sexually wild, having no emotional volume control. I have had to learn to separate my own identity from what other people read on to my body.” It’s Messy: On Boys, Boobs and Badass Women is the title of Amanda de Cadenet’s memoir, in which she writes about developing into “the teenage girl whose body made grown women uncomfortable and men salivate”, recalling the destabilising experience of having a body that brought her overnight success – she was a presenter on The Word at 18 – while simultaneously somehow making her the butt of every joke.\n\nIf the length of our skirts speaks to the stock market – short hemlines in boom times, long when things are bad – breasts are political. Thirty years after the French Revolution, Eugène Delacroix painted Liberty Leading the People with a lifesize, bare-breasted Liberty hoisting the French flag, leading her people to freedom. A century and a half later, women burning their bras at the 1968 protest against the Miss America pageant became one of the defining images of the feminist movement – never mind the fact that it never happened. (Protesters threw copies of Playboy, and some bras, in a trash can, but starting a fire on a sidewalk was illegal.) Intriguingly, decades when big breasts are in fashion seem to coincide with times of regression for women. Think about it. The 1920s: flat-chested flapper dresses and emancipation. The 1950s: Jayne Mansfield and women being pushed away from the workplace and back into the home. The 1970s: lean torsos under T-shirts, and the women’s liberation movement.\n\nSarah Shotton started out as an assistant in Agent Provocateur’s raunchy flagship store in Soho, London, in 1999, when she was 24, and rose to become creative director of the lingerie brand in 2010. Her 15 years in charge have seen Agent Provocateur rocked by the changing tides of sexual politics. In 2017, the year #MeToo hit the headlines, the company went into administration, before finding a new distributor. Shotton says, “I have always loved sexy bras, and it’s what we are known for. But there was a time when it felt like that wasn’t OK. Soon after #MeToo, we had a campaign lined up to shoot and the phone started ringing with all the agents of the women who were supposed to be in it, pulling their clients out, saying they didn’t want to be seen in that way.”\n\nBut the brand’s revenues have doubled in the past three years. “Last year we shot a film with Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch, where she’s in really sexy lingerie and he’s playing pool. I remember saying, ‘This is either going to go down like a ton of bricks or people are going to love it.’” It seems as if they loved it: the company’s sales are expected to hit £50m this year. “I think a younger generation now want what we had in the 1990s and 2000s,” Shotton says, “because it looks like we had more fun. My generation of women had childhood on our BMX bikes, then when we were in our 20s, your job finished when you left the office and you could go out drinking all night if you wanted to. I think we really did have more fun. Life just didn’t feel as complicated as it does now.” The bestselling bras, she says, are currently “anything plunging and push-up. Racy stuff. Our Nikita satin bra, which is like a shelf for your boobs and only just covers your nipples.”\n\nThe legacy of the 1990s, when feminism and raunch became bedfellows, has left the world confused about breasts. Before that, the lines were pretty simple – the flappers throwing off their corsets, the feminists protesting over Page 3. But Liz Goldwyn, film-maker and sociologist (and granddaughter of Samuel Goldwyn Jr), whose first job was in a Planned Parenthood clinic and who collects vintage lingerie, doesn’t fit neatly into any of the old categories. “Third-wave feminists like myself grew up in the riot grrrl and burlesque days, where we embraced corsets and kink along with liberation and protest,” she says. Goldwyn collects, loves and wears vintage lingerie, while abhorring Spanx. “I would rather go to the dentist than wear shapewear, but I find nothing more satisfying than to colour-coordinate my lingerie drawers.” Wearing a corset, she says, “makes me breathe with more presence”.\n\nBreasts have always been about money and class as well as sex and gender. The Tudor gentlewomen who wore dresses cut to expose their small, pert breasts were proudly indicating they had the means to afford a wet nurse. Sánchez’s inauguration outfit – tiny white Alexander McQueen trouser suit, lots of gravity-defying cleavage – “taps into the fact that people who are that wealthy can have the impossible,” Forrest says. “It is pretty difficult to have a super-slim body and big breasts. Her body is a physical manifestation of something much bigger, which is the hyper-wealthy living in a different reality to the rest of us. The planet might be doomed, but they can go to space. It’s a ‘fuck you’ marker of luxury and arrogance.” The vibe, Goldwyn agrees, “is very dystopian 1980s Dynasty meets ‘let them eat cake’. I would never disparage another woman’s body, but I have no problem disparaging her principles … in claiming to stand for women’s empowerment, yet attending an inauguration for an administration that has rolled back reproductive freedoms.”\n\nSurgery – the blunt fact of boobs being a thing you can buy – has crystallised the idea of breasts as femininity’s biggest commercial hit. (They are at times referred to, after all, as prize assets.) The primitive – survival of the fittest, in the thirsty sense of the word – is now turbocharged by capitalism.Breast enlargement is the most popular cosmetic surgery in the UK, with 5,202 procedures carried out in 2024, according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.\n\nWhen Jacqueline Sanchez Taylor interviewed women in 2010 about their experiences of breast augmentation for her research into the sociology of cosmetic surgery, “a lot of young women told me they were doing it for status”. Not to show off, but to show “they had made it. They felt they were being good citizens: going out there and making money, but also wanting to play the part of being feminine.” Breasts, Sanchez Taylor says, “say everything about who a woman is: about femininity and fertility, class and age.” They are at the centre of the industrial complex that has grown up around female beauty. “I remember sitting in a consultation with a woman and her surgeon, and him saying cheerfully, ‘Oh yes, you’ve got fried egg breasts. But we can fix that.’”\n\nFake is no longer scandalous or transgressive. The vocabulary of plastic surgery has been gentled and mainstreamed to become the more palatable cosmetic surgery. The older women of the Kardashian family have been coy about having had work, but 27-year-old Kylie Jenner recently shared on social media the details of her breast surgery – down to the implant size, placement and name of surgeon. Unreal is here to stay, and the new battle line is between perfection and imperfection. The generation growing up now, who have never seen a celebrity portrait that wasn’t retouched, have never used a camera that doesn’t have filters, take 20 selfies and delete 19 of them, have an intolerance of imperfection. To put it bluntly: normal looks weird to them.\n\nSo it seems natural – even if it isn’t really natural – that celebrity boobs are getting bigger even as celebrity bodies are getting smaller. “We are in a really weird place with the body, particularly in America,” says Emma McClendon, assistant professor of fashion studies at St John’s University in New York, who in 2017 curated the New York exhibition The Body: Fashion and Physique. “What we are seeing now is definitely not about the bigger body. It is a very controlled mode of curviness, which emphasises a tiny waist.” (Very 1950s coded, again.) “GLP-1 weight-loss drugs are having a cultural impact on all of us, whether or not you or people you know are on them,” McClendon says. “The incredible shrinking of the celebrity body that is happening in America is creating this idea that your body is endlessly fixable and tweakable.” Hairlines can be regrown, fat melted, wrinkles erased.\n\nFor most of the past half-century, fashion has held out against boobs. With a few notable exceptions – Vivienne Westwood, rest her soul, adored a corset-hoisted embonpoint – modern designers have mostly ignored them. Karl Lagerfeld insisted his models should glissade, ballerina style, and disliked any curves that veered from his clean, elongated lines. And yet in the past 12 months, the bullet bra has come back. A star turn on the Miu Miu catwalk was presaged last year by a cameo in the video for Charli xcx’s 360, worn by photographer and model Richie Shazam, and by influencer and singer Addison Rae, whose lilac velvet corset creamed into two striking Mr Whippy peaks at a Young Hollywood party last summer. To seal the revival, none other than the queen of fashion – Kate Moss – wore a bullet bra under her Donna Karan dress in a viral fashion shoot with Ray Winstone for a recent issue of Perfect magazine.\n\nPerhaps the bullet bra, which can be seen as weaponising the breast, is perfect for now. “Fashion is the body, and clothes turn the body into a language,” McClendon says. The bullet bra is steeped in a time when “domestic femininity was repackaged as glamour”, Forrest says. “A postwar era, coming back from scarcity and lack and hunger, when Sophia Loren was sold as a kind of delicious luxury truffle.”\n\nGoldwyn is a fan. “A perfectly seamed bullet bra lifts my spirits (and my breasts) if I am in a foul mood,” she says. “I hope we can reclaim it as symbolic of resistance, defiance and armour.” In the backstage scrum with reporters after she had made bullet bras the centrepiece of her Miu Miu catwalk show, Miuccia Prada said the collection was about “femininity”, then she corrected herself: “No – femininities.” Prada has been using her clothes to articulate the complexities of living and performing femininity for decades, and this season it led her to the bullet bra. “What do we need, in this difficult moment for women – to lift us up?” she laughed, gesturing upwards with her hands, surrounded by pointy-chested models. “It’s like a new fashion. I think the girls are excited.”\n\nHalf a millennium after Leonardo da Vinci painted the Madonna Litta, his 1490 painting of the Virgin Mary baring her right breast to feed Christ, which now hangs in the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia, another Madonna found her breasts in the spotlight. In the late 1980s, Jean Paul Gaultier was experimenting with conical bras in his Paris shows. “He took inspiration from his grandmother’s structured undergarments,” says fashion historian Amber Butchart, “and used them to herald self-liberation. I don’t generally like the word empowering – it doesn’t tend to mean much – but that was very much the idea.” In 1989, while Madonna was preparing for her 1990 Blond Ambition world tour, she phoned Gaultier and asked him to design the wardrobe. On the opening night, in Japan, Madonna tore off her black blazer to reveal that iconic baby-pink satin corset with conical cups. “Do you believe in love? Well, I’ve got something to say about it,” she declared, before launching into Express Yourself. The silhouette, which could be seen all the way from the cheap seats, would end up scandalising the pope and costing the world’s biggest female pop star a lucrative Pepsi deal. Boobs have always been good at capturing our attention, and they have it right now. Hello again, boys.","summary":"Breasts have always been political – and right now they’re front and centre again. Is it yet another way in which Trump’s worldview is reshaping the culture?\n\nIt was, almost, a proud feminist moment. On inauguration day in January, the unthinkable happened. President Trump, the biggest ego on the planet, was upstaged by a woman in a white trouser suit – the proud uniform of Washington feminists, worn by Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in solidarity with the traditional colour of the suffragettes. In the event, the white trouser suit barely got a mention. The show was stolen by what was underneath: Lauren Sánchez’s cleavage, cantilevered under a wisp of white lace. The breasts of the soon-to-be Mrs Jeff Bezos were the ceremony’s breakout stars.

But last year it equaled its original chart position and saw a global resurgence due in large part to it being used in a pivotal scene, which Alexander coined to Billboard as the “sadly oft true to life” Saltburn. The song was also covered by Interscope Aussie indie duo Royel Otis. Their version hit #1 on Billboard’s Alternative Airplay chart and became one of Australia’s biggest songs of 2024, whilst sparking a global bidding war.\n\nAlexander originally planned “Murder On The Dancefloor” to be the 1st single for his band’s critically acclaimed platinum debut, Maybe You’ve Been Brainwashed, Too. But after writing “You Get What You Give” not only did “Murder” not become a single it was abandoned for inclusion on their debut LP.But in March last year Alexander shared a snippet of his original “Murder On The Dancefloor” demo in a viral Guardian interview just before “soft releasing” his demo’s full length version on DSP’s in support of Kamala Harris the week she accepted the Chicago DNC Presidential nomination. The song also honored Doug Emhoff and Michelle Obama both sharing “You Get What You Give” as their “walk on” music at the DNC’s August, 2024 convention when they spoke in immediate succession.This year’s BMI Award for “Murder On The Dancefloor” coincides with Alexander winning the rights organization’s coveted song of the year award two decades back for his Santana/Michelle Branch “The Game Of Love“, which also won a Grammy for best pop collaboration with vocals. This year’s BMI song of the year winner was Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things”.Alexander, who sadly lost his mom in March, was going through boxes and came upon a lost DVD of his band’s only live “hatless” performance of his mid 2000’s Santana classic. A song both Tina Turner and Macy Gray sang, and Michelle Branch won a Grammy for, but Gregg’s live version has never been seen online!Says Alexander: “Sophie’s ‘Murder On The Dancefloor’ resurgence tragically happened between 2024’s untimely passing of my dad in mid-May and the following March loss of my heartbroken mom, as often happens when a family caretaker spouse unexpectedly passes. “So after seven weeks by my mom’s hospital bedside, alongside “Unwritten” author and New Radical Danielle Brisebois and my big sister too, when the phone rang and BMI’s Barbara Cane surprised me “Murder” was winning a BMI award—-she also shared wise personal advice. “Which is: anyone hospitalized can hear and feel you are there! So they will benefit from their fave music playin’ and hearing words of support. So always speak aloud of life’s best memories— because your loved ones can still hear you amidst your love and eminent security!“This inspired me to drive to Public Storage to sift through dozens of ‘boxes of memories.’ Like 80’s solo writing tapes and, to wax poetic, yoga-nurse bic pic lisa p GPP Municipal receipts! 90’s reels and ‘house bros’ played ‘Buisness!’ loan gestures!? Even 2000’s nut The Mob hoe ‘JT5 bus assault toys!’ Troll’s racist voicemail rolls from years of yore—that’s a quadruple rhyme!“But most blessedly CD’s of mom’s fave 70’s Carpenters tunes to play her—instead of the heart wrenching tapes my retch sobbing dad made weeks before passing. To frankly shed light on the ‘disowned stalker heathen Aiuto,’ to quote my dad and means ‘Help in Italian!’, and those will shake down hour vids ghostwriters visits dad encountered last May.\n\n“So when I stumbled upon a DVD of Dani and my only New Rad-era filmed “hatless” performance we felt a brief respite from those events. Us soon blastin’ music at BMI’s office whom christened it a sweet time capsule of my sarcastic “No Mayo!” mom’s fave song of mine, ‘The Game Of Love.’ “Watch in memoriam of last month being the one year mark of my lovably unique dad Tony’s passing.

It will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety’s YouTube channel.\n\nNeither Biden nor Harris is expected to speak. Harris expressed her condolences earlier this week to Hortman’s adult children, and spoke with Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said.\n\nThe scene at the Capitol\n\nHortman, a Democrat, was the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans to lay in state at the Capitol. It was the first time a couple has been accorded the honor, and the first for a dog. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. The Hortmans’ caskets and the dog’s urn were arranged in the center of the rotunda, under the Capitol dome, with law enforcement officers keeping watch as thousands of people filed by. Many fought back tears as they left.\n\nAmong the first to pay their respects were Walz, who has called Hortman his closest political ally, and his wife, Gwen. Biden, a Catholic, visited later in the afternoon, walking up to the velvet rope in front of the caskets, making the sign of the cross and spending a few moments by himself in silence. He then took a knee briefly, got up, made the sign of the cross again and walked off to greet people waiting in the wings of the rotunda.\n\nLisa Greene, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker.\n\n“She was just amazing. Amazing woman. And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,” Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. “She was such a leader. She could bring people together. She was so accessible. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.”\n\nBut, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also “a boss.”\n\n“She just knew what she was doing and she could just make things happen,” she said.\n\nA hearing takes a twist\n\nThe man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a short court appearance Friday for what the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, has called “a political assassination.”\n\nVance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history.\n\nAn unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. He agreed. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result.\n\n“Your honor, I haven’t really slept in about 12 to 14 days,” Boelter told the judge. And he denied being suicidal. “I’ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.”\n\nAtwal told the court that Boelter had been in what’s known as a “Gumby suit,” without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. She said the lights are on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slam frequently, the inmate in the next cell spreads feces on the walls and the smell drifts to Boelter’s cell.\n\nThe attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity and let him communicate better.\n\nThe case continues\n\nBoelter did not enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. According to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans’ home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers’ homes.\n\nHis lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole.\n\nFriends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.","summary":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris will join the mourners Saturday at the funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed in a pair of attacks that authorities have called…","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/biden-to-attend-funeral-for-former-minnesota-house-speaker-hortman-who-was-killed-in-shooting/article_c92b0118-5ccc-54f2-b3b7-a0588ee2c533.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/59/559aac54-b82c-5f90-801e-d10b742f2872/685f6c4beb4d2.image.jpg?crop=1617%2C849%2C0%2C115&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 04:10:59","author":"Steve Karnowski The Associated Press","authors":["Steve Karnowski The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":336040506,"title":"Biden to attend funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Hortman, who was killed in shooting","text":"Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris will join the mourners Saturday at the funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed in a pair of attacks that authorities have called an assassination and that also left her husband dead and a state senator and his wife seriously wounded.\n\nBiden also paid his respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul, a few hours after the man charged with killing them while disguised as a police officer June 14 made a brief court appearance in a suicide prevention suit.\n\n The service \n\nThe couple’s private funeral, at the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis, is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday.

He then took a knee briefly, got up, made the sign of the cross again and walked off to greet people waiting in the wings of the rotunda.\n\nLisa Greene, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker.\n\n“She was just amazing. Amazing woman. And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,” Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. “She was such a leader. She could bring people together. She was so accessible. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.\" \n\nBut, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also “a boss.\" \n\n“She just knew what she was doing and she could just make things happen,” she said.\n\n A hearing takes a twist \n\nThe man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a short court appearance Friday for what the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, has called “a political assassination.” \n\nVance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history.\n\nAn unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. He agreed. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result.\n\n“Your honor, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,\" Boelter told the judge. And he denied being suicidal. \"I’ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.”\n\nAtwal told the court that Boelter had been in what's known as a “Gumby suit,” without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. She said the lights are on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slam frequently, the inmate in the next cell spreads feces on the walls and the smell drifts to Boelter's cell. \n\nThe attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity and let him communicate better.\n\n The case continues \n\nBoelter did not enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. According to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans’ home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers’ homes.\n\nHis lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole.\n\nFriends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.","summary":"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to attend the funeral of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman on Saturday","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/joe-biden-minnesota-kamala-harris-tim-walz-minneapolis-b2778674.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/28/05/Minnesota-Lawmakers-Shot_87461.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 04:06:18","author":"Steve Karnowski","authors":["Steve Karnowski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":336036646,"title":"Don Bacon, House GOP lawmaker critical of Trump’s handling of Ukraine war, won’t seek re-election: reports ","text":"Rep.

Axios reports that he will make the announcement on Monday, citing two sources familiar with the matter.The news website based in Arlington, Virginia, also says, citing a source close to the issue, that Republicans have two potential contenders to fill Bacon's seat: Douglas County Sheriff Aaron Hanson and former Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert.Bacon has served Nebraska in Congress since 2017, winning multiple competitive races in the state's 2nd Congressional District, an area that has seen increasingly close contests between Republicans and Democrats in recent election cycles.The district seat encompasses the city of Omaha, among others, and was won by both former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and ex-President Joe Biden in 2020.Bacon has distinguished himself by criticizing both the far-right faction in the House and President Donald Trump. The Nebraska Republican has publicly opposed the president on key issues like questioning his tariff powers.Margins this close in the House mean that any vacancy, particularly in a swing district like Bacon's, could significantly impact the party's legislative agenda and ability to pass bills.Republican leadership, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, has emphasized the stakes, saying that this Congress represents a mandate handed down by Trump's decisive election win.Punchbowl News was the first to report Bacon's impending plans.What People Are SayingMadison Andrus, spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in a statement on Friday: \"The writing has been on the wall for months. Nebraskans are tired of the false promises that Republicans are trying to sell and they want real results.\"Andrus added, \"Don Bacon's decision to not seek reelection in 2026 is the latest vote of no-confidence for House Republicans and their electoral prospects. Next November, Nebraskans are going to elect a Democrat who will actually deliver for them.\"What Happens NextThe contest to replace Bacon is expected to attract significant national attention and funding from both major parties. Democratic and Republican candidates are likely to contest the newly open seat in a high-profile, expensive race.The official field of candidates will form over the coming months, ahead of the 2026 primary and general elections. Further leadership and committee shifts in the House may follow, as the composition of Congress changes with each new vacancy.","summary":"Nebraska Republican Don Bacon is set to announce his retirement on Monday, according to multiple news outlets.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-retire-democrats-eye-potential-house-seat-reports-2091920","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2673252/don-bacon.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 02:20:54","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.127},{"id":336016864,"title":"Fresh-faced internet star Deja Foxx is dubbed 'the next AOC' who wants to revolutionize the Dems","text":"Social media activist Deja Foxx has been dubbed the 'next AOC' as she runs to fill a vacant Congressional seat in Arizona. \n\nThe 25-year-old made her name as an abortion rights activist and built a legion of over 200,000 Instagram followers with her snazzy social media posts and advocacy work. \n\nShe launched her campaign for Arizona's 7th District seat in April, which is vacant following the death of Democrat Congressman Raúl Grijalva from cancer in March aged 77. \n\nHer efforts have quickly been compared to that of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known as AOC, when she ran on an ultra-liberal platform to unseat longtime New York Congressman Joe Crowley in 2019. \n\nAOC was four years older at the time than Foxx is now, and rode a wave of liberal outrage at President Trump during his first term to become a prominent member of 'The Squad' in Washington DC. \n\nShe is running on a similar platform to the one that got AOC elected, and has made abortion rights and criticizing the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade - which codified the right to an abortion federally - central pillars of her campaign. \n\nFoxx also named AOC and firebrand Democrat Jasmine Crockett as her inspirations in Congress, saying they 'best represent the values of the party.' \n\nHowever, she remains a longshot to win the Democrat primary when voters head to the polls in July. \n\nFoxx gained just five percent support in a Public Policy Polling survey compared to 49 percent for Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the deceased congressman they are running to replace. \n\nDespite trailing heavily in the race, Foxx has said she is undaunted by the polling numbers, and hopes to replicate AOC when she overcame huge odds to defeat Crowley six years ago. \n\nShe has noted that her support is made up of small donors and her average contribution is around $29, saying she is rejecting big super PAC money like AOC before her. \n\nAlthough she is only 25, Foxx has made her youth a key selling point, telling Newsweek that 'if everybody who told me I was too young went and told somebody that they were too old, we would be in a vastly different, political structure right now.' \n\n'Age is a defining factor in our political system, like it or not, it just is,' she said, and pointed out that the seat she is running for 'opened up because somebody passed away while in office.' \n\nThe advanced age of many lawmakers in Washington DC has been growing as an issue in recent times, with Grijalva becoming the third Democrat in Congress to die in office this year. \n\nSince 2022, eight members of Congress have passed away. \n\nFoxx first rose to prominence as an abortion rights activist in 2017 when she was just 16 years old, as footage of her confronting then-Arizona Senator Jeff Flake at a town hall went viral. \n\nShe berated Flake over cuts to Planned Parenthood, and catapulted her viral fame into becoming a social media influencer, often sharing similar clips of her confronting Republicans online. \n\nRecalling her start in politics, she told Newsweek: 'I was a teenager living with my boyfriend, working at a gas station. We relied on Title X funding', referring to the federal program that supports services like Planned Parenthood. \n\nShe said she often used 'Planned Parenthood centers to get the birth control that I needed to take control of my body and my future when I had no money, no parents and no insurance. \n\n'And this is just one of those ways that policymakers often disconnected from their constituents, vote without ever thinking about the consequences for real people.' \n\nShe says on her campaign website she experienced homelessness during a turbulent adolescence, but rose to become the first in her family to attend college, earning a full ride to Columbia University in New York to study political science. \n\nWhile at Columbia, Foxx joined Kamala Harris' first run for the presidency in 2020 and went on to lead her 2020 campaign influencer strategy. \n\n'What it taught me is a lesson that I took in to 2024 and that I'm taking into my own special election here in 2025 as I stick my head up to lead and to run — which was what it means to be fearless,' she said. \n\nAfter Harris lost the 2024 election in a landslide, Foxx said she decided to run for Congress because she 'felt a deep sense of responsibility.' \n\n'It wasn't enough for me to just work the behind the scenes of campaigns or in front of the cameras,\" she said, adding 'I needed to give them someone they could get excited about, or we would stand to lose our generation.","summary":"The 25-year-old made her name as an abortion rights activist and built a legion of over 200,000 Instagram followers with her snazzy social media posts and advocacy work.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14855329/Deja-Foxx-Arizona-Congress-new-AOC-Democrat.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/28/01/99804313-0-image-m-20_1751070752896.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:44:41","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":336014672,"title":"Don Bacon, House Republican Who Often Criticizes Trump, Won’t Seek Re-election","text":"Representative Don Bacon, the five-term Nebraska Republican who represents a centrist district in a deeply red state, will not seek re-election, according to a person familiar with his plans, handing Democrats a prime opportunity to pick up a seat in the closely divided House.\n\nMr. Bacon’s official announcement is expected on Monday, and his departure is not unexpected.
