In a CNN appearance, the lawmaker argued that UAW support for Trump’s tariffs is misguided, noting that even if some elements of Trump’s policy are good, overall, they will hurt American families. \"Look, I respect them [UAW]. But the tariffs – if they wanted to do something about auto – should have been much more pinpointed and isolated than this massive assault on American families, all to help the billionaires,\" Schumer told CNN host Dana Bash. WALL STREET FIRMS SEE RECESSION RISK RISING OVER TARIFFS, TRADE WAR UAW president Shawn Fain praised Trump for enacting major tariffs on foreign-made automobiles and parts earlier this month. As reported by the Detroit Free Press, Fain told an audience at Wayne State University in Detroit, \"Yes, I disagree with Donald Trump on virtually everything, but [tariffs are] one thing I don’t disagree on.\" Fain, who has been a fierce critic of Trump – expressing support for former Vice President Kamala Harris’s White House run during the Democratic National Convention last year – added that the Democratic Party hasn’t done the work to protect the American auto industry. \"We’ve begged Democrats, politicians for years, to do something to get these companies in line,\" he said, also noting that he’s not afraid to praise Trump on the issue, even if the president is a Republican. TRUMP IS 'ALWAYS UP FOR A GOOD NEGOTIATION,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS, AS APRIL 2 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS LOOM \"I’m not going to sit here now and say that since he’s a Republican or because he’s Donald Trump, I’m going to say, ‘screw you.’ That’s not how we do things. It’s having integrity,\" Fain said. Trump instituted 25% tariffs on outsourced cars and auto parts last week, which is primed to hit domestic brands like Chevrolet – which now produces vehicles in Mexico like the popular Equinox, and shuttered its major Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in 2020. However, Schumer suggested that UAW is ignoring the negative effects of Trump’s tariff policies on the whole country while focusing on the good it affords them. \"Look, there are certain tariffs that – pinpointed, careful, aimed at things that other countries are doing badly at us – makes sense. This is not that. This is across the board, 10% on everything, in addition to what other tariffs he‘s put on,\" the Senate Minority Leader said. When Bash asked about whether the auto tariffs by themselves are good, he replied, \"Well, look, you have to look at it in the whole context of things. When there‘s such chaos in America, I think fewer Americans are going to buy cars - American cars or otherwise - because it‘s so chaotically done. So, I think it hurts everybody.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Bash also asked Schumer about how he has been responding to Democratic lawmakers questioning his leadership in recent weeks after he broke party ranks and voted for a GOP-approved continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down. Schumer replied by stating that he and the Democratic Party are looking ahead and taking the fight to Trump with a united front. \"We are now focused on the future, and we are focused on showing how awful this administration is,\" he said. \"And you‘re going to find all of us [Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.], myself, and the whole Democratic Party united on what to do, and going forward, and going after Trump day in and day out, showing the American people that Trump has betrayed them, that he’s broken his promises, and that we’re on the side of working people, and he’s on the side of billionaires.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called out the UAW union on Friday for praising President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign automobiles and parts.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/schumer-slams-united-auto-workers-union-praising-trump-tariffs-hurt-everybody","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/schumer-cnn.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:09:48","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":307816460,"title":"Unfortunate update on WWE legend's Hall of Fame induction - Reports","text":"There has been an unfortunate update regarding a legend being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

I won’t be a stranger, and I’ll be reading your unparalleled work every single day,” Robinson, who has worked at the Washington Post for over four decades, concluded.\n\nThe columnist’s announcement comes after Bezos’ decision to overhaul the newspaper’s editorial pages.\n\nIn February, Robinson reacted to the changes, telling MSNBC’s Morning Joe, “This is not the way we have worked to produce what is, I believe, objectively the best opinion section in American journalism.”\n\n“I think it’s a mistake journalistically, I think it’s a mistake as a business proposition but, you know, it leaves us with choices and decisions to make about our futures,” he added.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in late October, less than two weeks before the 2024 presidential election the Washington Post‘s editorial board announced it would not be endorsing any candidates in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nBezos had reportedly ordered the non-endorsement amid early vote trends appearing to favor Trump. The decision was the first time in 36 years the Post chose not to endorse a presidential candidate — a major blow to then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Amazon founder — who has several large contracts with the U.S. government — was later seen with his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, attending President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.\n\nRobinson is not the only Washington Post writer to exit the newspaper.

Sheila Jackson Lee, a well-known member of the Black Congressional Caucus, called Lee a ‘ghetto bitch’.\n\nLoomer has described herself ‘pro-white nationalism’, believes 9/11 was an ‘inside job’ and has accused Governor Ron DeSantis’s wife Casey of ‘exaggerating’ her breast cancer.\n\nShe has suggested that at least two of America’s worst mass shootings were staged.\n\nEven for Teflon Don, this woman — hair freshly dyed hot pink — seems way too dangerous. It says something when eight members of his most loyal inner circle promptly leaked details of this meeting to the press.\n\nIt is all too reminiscent of last September, about six weeks out from the election and just off the back that disastrous Trump-Kamala debate.\n\nTrump’s campaign, up until then steady, was seeming to falter – and not least because he made the decision to allow Loomer, an 9/11 conspiracist, to accompany him on his private jet to September 11 memorial services.\n\nThat’s when a friend of Trump, who speaks to him every week, told me of their serious concern and disgust over Loomer’s closeness.\n\n‘The truth is no one’s in charge. He’s not taking good advice because there isn’t any. It’s embarrassing.’\n\nLoomer — and if you believe in nominative determinism, this woman is the looming threat that won’t go away — clearly offers Trump something no other member of MAGA-land does.\n\nKanye West? Completely ousted. Antisemite Nick Fuentes? A distant memory.\n\nBut Loomer, who has been photographed pushing her breasts against Trump’s chest and has been invited to his private balcony at Bedminster, clearly has the president’s ear like no other.\n\nNo wonder Melania seems to prefer New York.\n\nAccording to the Times, Loomer sauntered into the Oval with a stack of documents that named NSC members she wanted fired. Walz, who reportedly joined the meeting later, was described as practically neutered.\n\n‘[He] briefly defended some of his staff,’ the Times reported, ‘though it was clear he had little if any power to defend their jobs.’\n\nLet that sink in: Loomer, a professional agitator with no role in this administration, had more power in that meeting than Trump’s own national security adviser.\n\nIf Trump wants to push back against the liberal media narrative that the lunatics are running the asylum, this isn’t the way.\n\nAmong those present at the 30-minute Oval Office meeting were Vice President JD Vance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose brother died in 9/11 attacks — how he could be forced to sit in the same room with Loomer is beyond me — and Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles, who was instrumental in removing Loomer last September, when she was otherwise Velcroed to Trump’s side.\n\nIt was Wiles, Trump’s affectionately nicknamed ‘Ice Maiden’, who reportedly stopped Trump from hiring Loomer last year.\n\nWhat on earth is Trump thinking now?\n\nLoomer is surely his biggest liability, but perhaps that’s exactly why he likes her. She appeals to his inner chaos agent.\n\nAfter all, this is a week that saw Trump’s tariffs wreak havoc on the stock market – and Elon Musk exit his role, reportedly sooner than anticipated.\n\nOne can only imagine the looks of disbelief in that meeting as Loomer, a crackpot who once got caught jumping Nancy Pelosi’s fence, dictated whose heads should roll at the NSC.\n\nHer presence was either completely spontaneous or sprung by Trump on his unsuspecting staff. As the Times reported: ‘It was not clear how she was invited to such a sensitive meeting with the president’.\n\nTruly, this beggars belief.\n\nWhat other influence does Loomer exercise with her special access to the president? Foreign policy? Trade and tariffs? The expunging of rivals for his favor?\n\nIt was Loomer, after all, who went after Musk last year for his stance on granting H-1B visas to the best and the brightest, calling Indian migrants ‘third-world invaders’.\n\nThis is not a fine mind at work. Nor does she seem particularly emotionally mature. Loomer is nothing more than a click-baiting race hustler and xenophobe with zero scruples.\n\nSay what you will about Trump, but he’s not dumb. Nor is he self-destructive.\n\nExcept, apparently, when it comes to Loomer.\n\nHe flirted with losing the 2024 election, in its final weeks, by bringing her along those 9/11 memorial events, offending MAGA Republicans and voters.\n\nEven Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who said ‘I don’t often agree with Marjorie Taylor Greene’, publicly joined the controversial congresswoman last year in urging Trump to cut Loomer loose.\n\n‘The history of this person is just really toxic’, Graham told Huffpost. ‘I mean, she actually called for Kellyanne Conway’s daughter to hang herself.’\n\nLoomer has zero shame.\n\nIn fact, this March, Loomer established her own opposition research firm, called — what else? — ‘Loomered’.\n\nSpoiler alert: Getting Loomered isn’t a good thing, as Trump himself once pointed out when he lauded her at a Mar-a-Lago event, singling her out in the crowd.\n\n‘You don’t want to be Loomered,’ Trump said. ‘If you’re Loomered, you’re in deep trouble.’\n\nThe President would do well to heed his own words.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nShe&#8217;s back!

The book, \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" published by William Morrow and Company, claims that Obama was never a Democratic Party loyalist. Instead, the authors allege, Obama curried favor from a group of \"Black professionals\" for his campaigns, unlike former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and former President Joe Biden. Additionally, Obama’s creation of Organizing for Action — a nonprofit that launched in 2012 following Obama’s re-election to advance his legislative priorities — fractured the Democratic Party, according to the book, authored by political journalists Jonathan Allen of NBC News and Amie Parnes of The Hill. \"Though Organizing for Action never realized his vision, it competed with the party for power and money,\" the book said. \"He left the Democratic Party far weaker than he found it. Or, as one Black party operative put it, ‘Obama destroyed that s---.’\" KAMALA HARRIS WAS ‘VERY ANNOYED’ WITH OBAMA AS SHE SOUGHT HIS ENDORSEMENT, BOOK REVEALS The book also detailed how the Clintons, along with Biden and former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile and a few other party operatives, sought to \"rebuild the party infrastructure\" following Obama’s 2016 departure from the White House. This meant preventing far-left Democrats from seizing control of the party and ensuring party loyalists ran the show, according to the book. \"By helping install party loyalists at the national and state committees over the course of years, these establishment Democrats kept progressive outsiders at bay. ‘You know who did that?’ said one Black Biden ally familiar with the maneuvering. ‘Bill and Hillary motherf---ing Clinton,’\" the book related. \"Fight,\" released Tuesday, also revealed how Obama remained hesitant to back former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election to replace Biden, amid concerns about his mental fitness. The book claimed that Obama didn’t believe Harris had the capacity to beat now-President Donald Trump in the November 2024 race, frustrating Harris. Ultimately, Obama endorsed Harris five days after Biden announced he would not run for office again in the 2024 race — a delay that offended Harris and required some \"mending\" between the two Democrats, a source close to Obama said, Allen and Parnes wrote. A spokesperson for Obama's press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Even so, Obama's wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, appeared at the Democratic National Convention in August 2024 after Harris clinched the party's nomination. TENSIONS ALLEGEDLY RISE BETWEEN BIDEN WHITE HOUSE AND HARRIS CAMPAIGN: 'TOO MUCH IN THEIR FEELINGS' \"Kamala Harris is more than ready for this moment,\" Michelle Obama said at the convention. \"She is one of the most qualified people ever to seek the office of the presidency and she is one of the most dignified — a tribute to her mother, to my mother, and probably to your mother, too, the embodiment of the stories we tell ourselves about this country.\" Meanwhile, Democrat strategists predict that Barack Obama’s influence over the Democratic Party is waning, and some have suggested he is out of touch with the appeal of Trump. For example, political commentator and author Ben Burgess wrote an op-ed after Obama delivered a speech at the Obama Democracy Forum that part of the \"problem\" is Obama doesn’t understand why Trump won the 2024 election and that the American public should stop listening to the former president. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"​​Obama’s characteristic rhetorical virtues were on full display,\" Burgess wrote in December 2024 for MSNBC, following Obama’s speech. \"He was a constitutional law professor before he was a politician, and he still sounds like one. At the same time, he was a once-in-a-generation talent as a political communicator.

The reader summary is as follows:\n\nA BILL to be entitled an Act to amend Chapter 5 of Title 42 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to correctional institutions of state and counties, so as to prohibit the use of state funds or resources for certain treatments for state inmates; to provide for the adoption of rules and regulations by the Board of Corrections relating to such prohibitions and exceptions; to provide for a definition; to provide for related matters; to provide for an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.\n\nAccording to reports, this would include funds going toward “gender-affirming” care for prisoners, which is leftist speak for surgical mutilation, puberty blockers, and hormone therapy.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), who has made a name for herself standing up against illogical pro-transgender policies catering to the far-left, shared the video of the walkout with the caption, “Did anyone let them know not to come back?”\n\nAccording to 11Alive, most Democrats were absent for the vote, but the measure passed 100 to 2.\n\nRep. Tanya Miller, a Democrat who criticized the legislation, said in an interview that she believes Republicans are “coming up with solutions to problems that don’t exist.”\n\nGeorgians, she continued, are “worried about everything from Social Security to the Department of Education, and how it’s going to impact their children.”\n\n“They’re worried about the fact that they can’t afford rent, they can’t afford to buy a home. We have citizens who cannot make a living wage. So we have put forth legislation designed to fix those problems. Many of those, in fact, all of those, I would venture, with the exception of a handful, did not even get a hearing,” she claimed, asserting that real problems “continue to be ignored in pursuit of largely culture wars by Republicans.”\n\nShe also called members of the General Assembly viewing the legislature as “Donald Trump’s vengeance machine.”\n\n“They have spent an inordinate amount of time this session focused on Donald Trump’s priorities, focused on harming, I guess, Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies,” she said, pointing to the “Trump effect” which she said has made things difficult.\n\nThe pushback against leftist culture — from transing kids to parental rights — were big pieces of Trump’s platform and why he defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in November.","summary":"Democrat lawmakers this week staged a walkout to protest a measure that would effectively stop taxpayer dollars from going toward transgender surgeries for inmates.\n\n\nThe post Democrat Lawmakers in Georgia Stage Walkout to Protest Bill Stopping Taxpayer Funds for Transgender Surgeries for Inmates appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/04/democrat-lawmakers-in-georgia-stage-walkout-to-protest-bill-stopping-taxpayer-funds-for-transgender-surgeries-for-inmates/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/lusk-second-image-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 21:08:25","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":307810898,"title":"Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer says, as shareholder, tariffs are 'not good'","text":"President Trump's new tariffs on goods that the U.S. imports from over 100 countries will have an effect on consumers, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer told CNBC on Friday. Investors will feel the pain, too.\n\nMicrosoft's stock dropped almost 6% in the past two days, as the Nasdaq wrapped up its worst week in five years.\n\n\"As a Microsoft shareholder, this kind of thing is not good,\" Ballmer said, in an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin that was tied to Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebration. \"It creates opportunity to be a serious, long-term player.\" \n\nBallmer was sandwiched in between Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and current CEO Satya Nadella for the interview. \n\n\"I took just enough economics in college — that tariffs are actually going to bring some turmoil,\" said Ballmer, who was succeeded by Nadella in 2014. Gates, Microsoft's first CEO, convinced Ballmer to join the company in 1980.\n\nGates, Ballmer and Nadella attended proceedings at Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, campus on Friday to celebrate its first half-century.\n\nBetween the tariffs and weak quarterly revenue guidance announced in January, Microsoft's stock is on track for its fifth straight month of declines, which would be the worst stretch since 2009. But the company remains a leader in the PC operating system and productivity software markets, and its partnership with startup OpenAI has led to gains in cloud computing.\n\n\"I think that disruption is very hard on people, and so the decision to do something for which disruption was inevitable, that needs a lot of popular support, and nobody could game theorize exactly who is going to do what in response,\" Ballmer said, regarding the tariffs. \"So, I think citizens really like stability a lot. And I hope people — individuals who will feel this, because people are feeling it, not just the stock market, people are going to feel it.\"\n\nBallmer, who owns the Los Angeles Clippers, is among Microsoft's biggest fans. He said he's the company's largest investor. In 2014, shortly after he bought the basketball team for $2 billion, he held over 333 million shares of the stock, according to a regulatory filing.\n\n\"I'm not going to probably have 50 more years on the planet,\" he said. \"But whatever minutes I have, I'm gonna be a large Microsoft shareholder.\" He said there's a bright future for computing, storage and intelligence. Microsoft launched the first Azure services while Ballmer was CEO. \n\nEarlier this week Bloomberg reported that Microsoft, which pledged to spend $80 billion on AI-enabled data center infrastructure in the current fiscal year, has stopped discussions or pushed back the opening of facilities in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nJPMorgan Chase's chief economist, Bruce Kasman, said in a Thursday note that the chance of a global recession will be 60% if Trump's tariffs kick in as described. His previous estimate was 40%.\n\n\"Fifty years from now, or 25 years from now, what is the one thing you can be guaranteed of, is the world needs more compute,\" Nadella said. \"So I want to keep those two thoughts and then take one step at a time, and then whatever are the geopolitical or economic shifts, we'll adjust to it.\"\n\nGates, who along with co-founder Paul Allen, sought to build a software company rather than sell both software and hardware, said he wasn't sure what the economic effects of the tariffs will be. Today, most of Microsoft's revenue comes from software. It also sells Surface PCs and Xbox consoles.\n\n\"So far, it's just on goods, but you know, will it eventually be on services? Who knows?\" said Gates, who reportedly donated around $50 million to a nonprofit that supported Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' losing campaign. \n\n— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed to this report.\n\nWATCH: There will be many LLM winners, says infrastructure investor Morrison","summary":"Despite tariff impact, Microsoft's top shareholder said he's a long-term believer in the company, given its opportunity in compute and intelligence.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/former-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmer-on-trump-tariffs-not-good.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108126998-1743795925801-gettyimages-2207879590-MICROSOFT_COPILOT.jpeg?v=1743795967","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2025/M04D01/7000371364/1743482380-39158899327-hd_L.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-04 21:04:26","author":"Jordan Novet","authors":["Jordan Novet"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":307810004,"title":"Trump Pits Laura Loomer Against Susie Wiles in White House Power Struggle","text":"It is the behind–the–scenes battle for power that has the White House on tenterhooks. \n\nThe Ice Queen vs. The Hot Mess.\n\nWith Melania Trump largely absent from the president’s inner circle, Susie Wiles has been the matriarch of the West Wing, known by her admiring colleagues as the “Trump whisperer” for her ability to contain his worst impulses.\n\nAs the first woman White House chief–of–staff, she has quietly reined in the warring factions within Trump 2.0 with a quiet discipline that has become her hallmark.\n\nBut it could only hold together for so long.\n\nStruggling to prevent leaks and blunders from overshadowing her boss’ agenda, Wiles got a break earlier this week when Trump agreed to finally distance himself from Elon Musk and his around-the-clock social media posts.\n\nThen in walked Laura Loomer.\n\nWiles had been among those suggesting the president should keep the conspiracy theorist and “investigative journalist” at arm’s length after she accompanied him on several trips in 2023.\n\nBut now she’s back. If “moderate Republican” Wiles was the whisperer, Loomer was the MAGA wrecking ball. \n\nWith her granny demeanor and smock frocks, 67–year–old Wiles had the calm authority of her sportscaster father Pat Summerall, who announced 16 Super Bowls, more than anybody else on network television, and kept the more effusive John Madden in check. His was a voice the nation trusted. The same went for his daughter amid the mayhem of the Trump revolution.\n\nWiles is old school. She paid her dues, learning her political ropes as a scheduler for President Ronald Reagan, working on the Bush–Quayle ticket in 1988, and on election campaigns for Jack Kemp, Mitt Romney, and Ron DeSantis before ascending to become Trump’s 2024 election campaign co-manager.\n\nBut sources in the administration suggest that Donald Trump is tuning out Wiles’ calm voice of reason. The going is getting tough for the president, and he is looking for a little diversion. She is among the very few able to give him bad news. But right now, he doesn’t want to hear it.\n\nPerfect timing for Loomer, 31, in her Hervé Léger bandage dresses and MAGA evangelism, to sweep into the limelight.\n\nShe was first introduced to Trump by his closest aide, Natalie Harp, 34, known by Trump staffers as the “human printer”, and she has become one of the president’s most outspoken advocates, even if she wasn’t always welcome in the White House.\n\nLoomer has been described as a 9/11 “truther”–once sharing a video on X saying, “9/11 was an Inside Job!”–and was even reprimanded by Marjorie Taylor Greene after she posted a message saying that if Kamala Harris won the election, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.” Greene called the post “extremely racist.” \n\nWiles stays hidden; she doesn’t join the exodus to Mar-a-Lago every weekend. She’s about as visible to the public at the White House as Melania. \n\nLoomer is the opposite. She handcuffed herself to a Twitter office after she was banned from the platform and jumped over Nancy Pelosi’s fence as a protest against the then Speaker’s immigration views.\n\nThe self-styled journalist has a history in politics, making two unsuccessful Florida congressional runs, but she is better known for her inflammatory remarks. She has called herself a “proud Islamophobe” and yet she still traveled on Trump’s plane, and he considered her for a campaign role before being warned off because of her wilder conspiracy theories.\n\nHer weekly Rumble show is called “Loomer Unleashed.” And that’s what Trump’s inner circle–and Wiles, in particular–are scared of.\n\nAs different as the two women may be, there are some similarities in the tale of the tape.\n\nThey can both hold a grudge.\n\nLoomer didn’t see the joke when Bill Maher suggested that she was having an adulterous fling with Trump and sued him for defamation.\n\nWiles was furious when DeSantis got Trump to fire her before the 2020 election campaign after she ran the Florida governor’s successful 2018 campaign and then called it the “biggest mistake” of her career. When DeSantis ran against Trump in the presidential primary, she got revenge by dismantling his bid and posting on X (now deleted) a single word when he quit. “Bye, bye.”\n\nThey aren’t Elon Musk’s biggest fans.\n\nWiles was reportedly driven to distraction by Musk’s relentless, undisciplined tweets and his eccentric behavior while understanding his usefulness, especially during the campaign.Loomer publicly sparred with Musk over his support for skilled migration visas she believes breach the “America First” MAGA philosophy, but has later praised him.\n\nThey get stuff done.\n\nWiles got Trump elected. Doesn’t get much bigger than that.Loomer got Trump to withdraw Hunter Biden’s Secret Service protection after getting photos of him with his family. And she didn’t waste any time after being allowed back into the Oval Office, persuading the president to fire six National Security Council officials after presenting him with a list of people she said were disloyal.\n\n“With Melania absent, both women see themselves as important female support for the president, but they can’t work together,” said one Washington insider. “At the moment, Susie is not looking so invincible, and Loomer has moved right back into the president’s orbit. But this fight is very far from over.’\n\nWily Wiles vs. Loony Loomer. \n\nThe winner will have Trump’s ear... and be the most powerful woman in the country.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Victoria Sunday/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesIt is the behind–the–scenes battle for power that has the White House on tenterhooks. \n\nThe Ice Queen vs. The Hot Mess.\n\nWith Melania Trump largely absent from the president’s inner circle, Susie Wiles has been the matriarch of the West Wing, known by her admiring colleagues as the “Trump whisperer” for her ability to contain his worst impulses.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-pits-laura-loomer-against-susie-wiles-in-white-house-power-struggle/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/WRYUHH2J3JHO3PFNBPW3IVDYNI.jpg?smart=true&auth=f0dc8680e46ca56274a196a754334644a6422214ecd5e70fedbc0bf3fb055e61&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 20:58:20","author":"David Gardner","authors":["David Gardner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":307796094,"title":"As Steve Hilton mulls a run for California governor, he’s promoting his book — and criticizing Democrats","text":"As he considers a run for California governor, Fox News commentator Steve Hilton spoke to a friendly crowd in Yorba Linda on Thursday, April 3, where he took aim at the state’s growing list of Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls.\n\nHilton, who was born in the U.K. and has been a U.S. citizen since 2021, appeared at the Nixon Library as part of his “Califailure” book tour, in which he argues that homelessness, high costs of living, high taxes and the housing crisis in California are the result of decisions driven by political ideologies.\n\nDrawing from his book during the evening discussion, Hilton criticized the state’s leadership and took shots at several Democrats, including Gov. Gavin Newsom and gubernatorial hopefuls, former U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Rep. Katie Porter.\n\n“Every day now, there seems to be a new one popping out, saying they’re running for governor,” Hilton said, referring to Becerra, who launched his campaign the day before Hilton’s event.\n\nCalifornia has not elected a Republican governor since Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served from 2003 to 2011 after winning a recall election. Today, Democrats hold a supermajority in both chambers of the state legislature and every statewide office.\n\nHilton said his decision on whether to run for governor would come “much sooner” than former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has said she will decide if she’ll jump into the race by the end of this summer.\n\nBut Hilton said he wants to ensure that he can mount a serious and effective campaign.\n\n“I would only do it on the basis that it would be something that would be an effective campaign that will win because we need to turn things around in California,” he said in an interview before the event.\n\n“Everyone can see that we need change,” Hilton said. “You’ve got Democrat candidates announcing all the time, but I don’t understand how Democrats think that they’re the solution to the problems that they themselves created.”\n\nHilton said he’s putting together a policy platform and assessing financial support to determine whether the pieces are in place.\n\nOn Thursday, he blamed Democrats for excessive regulation when it comes to building homes, which he pointed to as the state’s most urgent problem.\n\n“It’s just impossible for people to even imagine owning their own home. That used to be the ‘California dream’ as we think about it — very basic things, a good job that pays enough to raise your family in the home of your own in a safe neighborhood with a good school, so your kids have a better life than you. Owning your home is an absolutely central part of that,” Hilton said.\n\nHe also criticized the role of labor unions in California politics, arguing they often hold too much influence over lawmakers.\n\nHe referenced last year’s state race in the 37th Senate District between Sen. Josh Newman and Steven Choi, a Republican who ultimately won.\n\nDuring the race, AFSCME 3299, the University of California’s largest employee union, heavily invested in supporting other Democrats in the March primary after Newman declined to back outright a constitutional amendment that would have strengthened the rights of UC employees. In the general election, the union spent nearly $1 million to oppose Newman.\n\n“The Democrat in the race had the temerity to disagree with the union on one of their policy demands. So they said, right, we’ll show you, we’re going to take you out as a warning to any other Democrat not to step out of line,” Hilton said.\n\nBut Hilton’s speech wasn’t all barreling into California’s problems.\n\n“We’re the home of doers and dreamers and creators and people who just want to do their own thing, live their life the way that they choose,” he said. “That’s what inspired me. California means to America what America means to the world.”\n\nOn the possibility of facing Harris in a gubernatorial contest, he said, “I say bring it on. Let’s beat her again.”\n\nRic Grenell, President Donald Trump’s envoy for special missions and another potential California gubernatorial candidate, has said he may enter the governor’s race if Harris decides to run. Porter, meanwhile, has said she would exit should Harris jump in.\n\nHilton’s appearance at the Nixon Library on Thursday was part of a promotional tour for his new book, “Califailure”, which was published in late March.","summary":"On possibly facing former Vice President Kamala Harris in a gubernatorial contest, Hilton said, \"I say bring it on.\"","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/04/04/as-steve-hilton-mulls-a-run-for-california-governor-hes-promoting-his-book-and-criticizing-democrats/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OCR-L-HILTON-040501-1.jpg?w=1024&h=727","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 20:43:57","author":"Hanna Kang","authors":["Hanna Kang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.08},{"id":307800438,"title":"‘The Map Is Not Great’: Chris Cillizza Says Even If Trump Tariffs Massively ‘Backfire,’ Dems’ Senate Hopes Are Slim","text":"Former CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza said Friday that even if President Donald Trump’s tariffs cause significant damage, Democrats still have dismal odds of retaking the Senate in 2026.\n\nU.S. stocks plunged Thursday and Friday after Trump on Wednesday unveiled a slate of tariffs on the world. A viewer asked Cillizza on his livestream about whether “the tariffs backfir[ing] as badly as some economists are saying they could” might provide Democrats with the chance to win the Senate, but the former CNN analyst explained why that would be unlikely. (RELATED: Trump Endorsement Could Make Or Break Key GOP Gubernatorial Primary)\n\n“They need to net four seats, okay, because JD Vance is the vice president, president of the Senate breaks ties, so you got to have a clear majority if you’re Democrats. You can have 51 seats. There are 22 Republican seats up to 13 Democratic seats. Of those 22, 21 of them are in states that Donald Trump won last November so it’s not a great playing field,” Cillizza said. “The only one that’s in a state [former Vice President] Kamala Harris won is in Maine, Susan Collins, and she’s going to be a huge target. So the problem becomes, it’s like you have to fish in waters that are not super friendly to your party.”\n\n“So like, one example, North Carolina. Thom Tillis is running. I could see that being a real race because I think Roy Cooper, the popular former Democratic governor, is probably going to run. So I think that that’s a race. It is a state Trump won, but that’s a real race,” he continued. “It starts to get dicier after that. Remember, they need four. So let’s assume they don’t lose any of their own, which, look, Georgia is going to be a big race for Democrats, so is Michigan, Minnesota and New Hampshire maybe, but Georgia and Michigan are going to be huge, huge races that they’d have to hold.”\n\nCillizza said even if Democrats are able to secure Maine and North Carolina, they still do not have strong chances of gaining a majority.\n\n“I guess the next one would be in Ohio, where John Husted is the appointed senator. Ohio’s a tough state — maybe. Okay, that’s three. Now you have to find me another winner out of this group,” he said. “I’m going to go in alphabetical order: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming.”\n\n“I mean, Iowa’s probably the best bet there, maybe Florida. It’s just the map is not great for them. It just isn’t for Democrats,” Cillizza concluded. “And so it’s like, could I think of a path? Sure, but man, you got to go through some pretty red states to get there.”\n\nCillizza also previously argued in March that Democrats face an uphill battle to regain Senate control after Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s announcement that she would not seek reelection. Her announcement followed similar announcements by Democratic Sens. Gary Peters of Michigan and Tina Smith of Minnesota.\n\n“Even if we don’t see another retirement in the Democratic side, these three retirements already, I think, have crushed the hopes of Democrats who wanted to try to win back the Senate in 2026,” Cillizza said at the time.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It says something when eight members of his most loyal inner circle promptly leaked details of this meeting to the press.\n\nIt is all too reminiscent of last September, about six weeks out from the election and just off the back that disastrous Trump-Kamala debate.\n\nTrump's campaign, up until then steady, was seeming to falter – and not least because he made the decision to allow Loomer, an 9/11 conspiracist, to accompany him on his private jet to September 11 memorial services.\n\nThat's when a friend of Trump, who speaks to him every week, told me of their serious concern and disgust over Loomer's closeness.\n\n'The truth is no one's in charge. He's not taking good advice because there isn't any. It's embarrassing.'\n\nLoomer — and if you believe in nominative determinism, this woman is the looming threat that won't go away — clearly offers Trump something no other member of MAGA-land does.\n\nKanye West? Completely ousted. Antisemite Nick Fuentes? A distant memory.\n\nBut Loomer, who has been photographed pushing her breasts against Trump's chest and has been invited to his private balcony at Bedminster, clearly has the president's ear like no other.\n\nNo wonder Melania seems to prefer New York.\n\nAccording to the Times, Loomer sauntered into the Oval with a stack of documents that named NSC members she wanted fired. Walz, who reportedly joined the meeting later, was described as practically neutered.\n\n'[He] briefly defended some of his staff,' the Times reported, 'though it was clear he had little if any power to defend their jobs.'\n\nLet that sink in: Loomer, a professional agitator with no role in this administration, had more power in that meeting than Trump's own national security adviser.\n\nIf Trump wants to push back against the liberal media narrative that the lunatics are running the asylum, this isn't the way.\n\nAmong those present at the 30-minute Oval Office meeting were Vice President JD Vance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose brother died in 9/11 attacks — how he could be forced to sit in the same room with Loomer is beyond me — and Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, who was instrumental in removing Loomer last September, when she was otherwise Velcroed to Trump's side.\n\nIt was Wiles, Trump's affectionately nicknamed 'Ice Maiden', who reportedly stopped Trump from hiring Loomer last year.\n\nWhat on earth is Trump thinking now?\n\nLoomer is surely his biggest liability, but perhaps that's exactly why he likes her. She appeals to his inner chaos agent.\n\nAfter all, this is a week that saw Trump's tariffs wreak havoc on the stock market – and Elon Musk exit his role, reportedly sooner than anticipated.\n\nOne can only imagine the looks of disbelief in that meeting as Loomer, a crackpot who once got caught jumping Nancy Pelosi's fence, dictated whose heads should roll at the NSC.\n\nHer presence was either completely spontaneous or sprung by Trump on his unsuspecting staff. As the Times reported: 'It was not clear how she was invited to such a sensitive meeting with the president'.\n\nTruly, this beggars belief.\n\nWhat other influence does Loomer exercise with her special access to the president? Foreign policy? Trade and tariffs? The expunging of rivals for his favor?\n\nIt was Loomer, after all, who went after Musk last year for his stance on granting H-1B visas to the best and the brightest, calling Indian migrants 'third-world invaders'.\n\nThis is not a fine mind at work. Nor does she seem particularly emotionally mature. Loomer is nothing more than a click-baiting race hustler and xenophobe with zero scruples.\n\nSay what you will about Trump, but he's not dumb. Nor is he self-destructive.\n\nExcept, apparently, when it comes to Loomer.\n\nHe flirted with losing the 2024 election, in its final weeks, by bringing her along those 9/11 memorial events, offending MAGA Republicans and voters.\n\nEven Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who said 'I don't often agree with Marjorie Taylor Greene', publicly joined the controversial congresswoman last year in urging Trump to cut Loomer loose.\n\n'The history of this person is just really toxic', Graham told Huffpost. 'I mean, she actually called for Kellyanne Conway's daughter to hang herself.'\n\nLoomer has zero shame.\n\nIn fact, this March, Loomer established her own opposition research firm, called — what else? — 'Loomered'.\n\nSpoiler alert: Getting Loomered isn't a good thing, as Trump himself once pointed out when he lauded her at a Mar-a-Lago event, singling her out in the crowd.\n\n'You don't want to be Loomered,' Trump said. 'If you're Loomered, you're in deep trouble.'\n\nThe President would do well to heed his own words.","summary":"Laura Loomer, the 31-year-old conspiracy theorist and far-right activist whose closeness to President Trump threatened to derail his 2024 campaign, popped up again this week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14572349/trump-laura-loomer-truth-relationship-MAUREEN-CALLAHAN.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/04/20/96927569-0-image-m-21_1743795794949.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/03/4730919170971812468/1024x576_MP4_4730919170971812468.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-04 19:46:19","author":"Editor,Maureen Callahan","authors":["Editor","Maureen Callahan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.427},{"id":307797470,"title":"LeBron James mocked with bizarre Kamala Harris comparison after rambling podcast appearance","text":"LeBron James mocked with bizarre Kamala Harris comparison after rambling podcast appearance\n\nREAD MORE: Basketball legend announces their retirement after 10 seasons \n\nBy DANIEL MATTHEWS\n\nPublished: 20:26 BST, 4 April 2025 | Updated: 20:30 BST, 4 April 2025\n\nLeBron James has been mocked - and compared to Kamala Harris - after a rambling clip of the NBA legend appeared on social media.\n\nThe second season of James' Mind the Game podcast, which he now co-hosts with two-time NBA MVP Steve Nash, dropped this week.\n\nThe opening episode has amassed more than 1.2million views on YouTube in just three days but one particular video of the Lakers star has gone viral on X.\n\nSeveral separate clips of LeBron discussing his 'process' appear to have been stitched together to produce a 30-second video that has drawn scorn on social media.\n\n'What I did not know or what I didn't have, I didn't have enough accumulative hours put in on perfecting the process,' James said. \n\n'My process was where it needed to be or even if I had enough time for my process to be where it needed to be.'\n\nLeBron James has gone viral over rambling comments he made about his 'process'\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers star was compared to former vice president Kamala Harris\n\nHe added: '(I) was understanding and had the ability - as far as my capacity - to understand the process, to unlock the process and then go after it and just stay there, stay that course.'\n\nControversial sports columnist Jason Whitlock was among those to taunt the Lakers superstar, claiming he was 'tapping into his inner Kamala Harris'.\n\nThe former vice president was accused of speaking in 'word salads' ahead of last year's presidential election.\n\nDuring one infamous interview on CBS '60 Minutes', she gave a 179-word answer to a question about Israel.\n\nAnd Whitlock was not the only person to compare LeBron and the former vice president.\n\n'Kamala vibes,' one fan said on social media.

The order also barred WilmerHale employees from federal buildings, banned them from communicating with government employees and prevented them from being hired at government agencies.\n\nOther elite law firms which engaged in the lawfare campaign which sought to derail Trump’s campaign for a second term have been hit with similar sanctions, leaving them to choose whether to fight the orders or cut a deal with Trump to remove the restrictions.\n\n“The nakedly political prosecution only added to the momentum propelling Trump back to office, and in our country voters, not judges, get the final word,” Daniel McCarthy wrote in an April 1 op-ed for RealClearPolitics. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s “convictions couldn’t stop the Republican from running, and winning.”\n\nBack in the White House, Trump responded by threatening the powerful firms engaged in lawfare with losing access to government privileges, from security clearances to permission to enter federal buildings. Trump’s executive orders would put a major crimp in the firms’ lobbying activity.\n\n“(It’s surprising that progressives, who often view lobbying as inherently corrupt, didn’t cheer Trump on for this.)” McCarthy noted.\n\nTrump’s order on WilmerHale states:\n\nWilmerHale rewarded Robert Mueller and his colleagues — Aaron Zebley, Mueller’s “top aide” and “closest associate,” and James Quarles — by welcoming them to the firm after they wielded the power of the Federal Government to lead one of the most partisan investigations in American history. Mueller’s investigation epitomizes the weaponization of government, yet WilmerHale claimed he “embodies the highest value of our firm and profession.”\n\nMueller’s “investigation” upended the lives of public servants in my Administration who were summoned before “prosecutors” with the effect of interfering in their ability to fulfill the mandates of my first term agenda. This weaponization of the justice system must not be rewarded, let alone condoned.\n\nWhile the American voters sided with Trump, French voters didn’t even get a chance on populist Marine Le Pen’s candidacy.\n\nA Paris court convicted Le Pen, National Rally leader and presidential frontrunner, of embezzlement and sentenced her to four years imprisonment, which will likely be served on probation with an electronic tag rather than in jail, and a fine of 100,000 euros. The court also banned Le Pen from running for public office for five years.\n\n“What a judge in France has just done by disqualifying Marine Le Pen from running in that nation’s next presidential election is what Democrats dream of doing here,” McCarthy wrote. “The controversial populist was ahead in the polls, but now Le Pen isn’t even eligible to run, thanks to a court that found her guilty of using European Union funds to pay for political expenses.”\n\nLe Pen insists the spending was legitimate, “but as things stand French voters won’t get to decide for themselves who’s right,” McCarthy added.\n\nTrump wrote in a post to Truth Social:\n\nThe Witch Hunt against Marine Le Pen is another example of European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent, this time going so far as to put that Opponent in prison. It is the same “playbook” that was used against me by a group of Lunatics and Losers, like Norm Eisen, Andrew Weissmann, and Lisa Monaco. They spent the last nine years thinking of nothing else, and they FAILED, because the People of the United States realized that they were only Corrupt Lawyers and Politicians.\n\nI don’t know Marine Le Pen, but do appreciate how hard she worked for so many years. She suffered losses, but kept on going, and now, just before what would be a Big Victory, they get her on a minor charge that she probably knew nothing about – Sounds like a “bookkeeping” error to me. It is all so bad for France, and the Great French People, no matter what side they are on. FREE MARINE LE PEN!\n\nWhat happens once Trump is gone?\n\n“Had he lost last year’s election, Trump would likely have been sent to prison by his enemies, and other Republicans would have been next on the legal hit list,” McCarthy wrote. “If Democrats win back the House next year, they’ll use Congress’ investigative powers to turn this administration inside-out, forcing testimony on every contentious policy and practice that Trump officials have implemented since Day 1.”\n\nIf the GOP doesn’t hold the White House in 2028, “the kinds of political prosecutions that would have happened this year if Kamala Harris had won will take place four years from now,” McCarthy noted.\n\n“Voters said no to lawfare as loudly as possible last November, awarding Trump every presidential battleground state, a popular-vote plurality and GOP control of both chambers of Congress.\n\n“But to break bad habits of lawfare will take more than one election cycle.”\n\nSupport Free Press Foundation\n\n Lawfare matters: Against the odds, U.S. voters sided with Trump; French voters neutralized, WorldTribune.com\n\nLawfare matters: Against the odds, U.S. voters sided with Trump; French voters neutralized added by Editor Two on April 4, 2025\n\nView all posts by Editor Two →","summary":"by WorldTribune Staff, April 4, 2025 Real World News Late last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at the law firm WilmerHale, where Robert Mueller worked before and after he served as special counsel in the Russiagate hoax.

I think that Barack Obama has a lot of influence.\"\n\nThe allegation made by the morning show host reportedly left Clooney livid, a journalist named Chris Whipple claimed in his new book about the Biden campaign – which the journalist shared with Substack The Red Letter.During a phone call with an MSNBC producer that reportedly lasted several hours, Clooney allegedly yelled: \"How the f*** could you let her link me with Barack Obama, saying he made me write the op-ed?\"\n\nThe Hollywood actor allegedly became even more frustrated when the producer denied any involvement in Brzezinski's claims.\n\nClooney referred to the producer as his \"friend\" but continued to yell: \"You f----- me...You should have stood up for me.\"\n\nThe producer allegedly responded: \"George, this is not a f------ movie. There's no script.\"After Clooney and the producer went back and forth, the MSNBC employee told the actor they would try to \"take care of it\" the next day.\n\n Clooney allegedly responded: \"This is a morning talk show on a cable channel. Nobody gives a f*** if we say he should get out or he should stay in.\"Over the years, Clooney has made it known he's an extremely passionate Democrat and has voiced his support during Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Biden's presidential campaigns.\n\nAfter the debate between President Trump and Biden back in June 2024, Clooney penned an op-ed a few weeks after for the New York Times where he called for the former president to abandon his presidential campaign, writing: \"We are not going to win in November with this president.\n\n\"On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris ended up stepping in and ran against President Trump during the 2024 presidential election—and lost.\n\nAfter the humiliating election was over, Clooney ended up getting the blame for Harris' election defeat by angry liberals.At the time, liberals took to social media to rip Clooney's negative influence.\n\nOne wrote: \"Trump should not forget to thank the Hollywood celebrities. Especially George Clooney.\" \n\nAnother added: \"Someone bring me George Clooney.\"\n\nA separate Democrat supporter wrote on X: \"This is all George Clooney’s fault.\"","summary":"George Clooney \"lost it\" when he was grilled on Morning Joe about the New York Times op-ed that \"brought down\" former president Joe Biden.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/george-clooney-lost-it-grilled-morning-joe-op-ed-brought-down-ex-president-joe-biden/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/LQmVz6XDW/0x0/george-clooney-morning-joe-screaming-1-1743792479945.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 19:19:02","author":"Lauren McIver","authors":["Lauren McIver"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.337},{"id":307787330,"title":"Military families keep taking it on the chin [Asinine]","text":"Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

Turns out the military vote is actually difficult to quantify and current data is pretty sorely lacking. If the data in that article is still accurate, Service Members in OCONUS (Outside Continental United States) vote at an extremely low rate (20%) due to the difficulties in absentee balloting, while some other articles I can find suggest that military people lean GOP, but that's more likely because the deep red states contribute a LOT of service members...\n\nI think it's probably safe to assume that the military as a whole probably has a slight conservative lean, but I'd bet far more of them fall into the category of \"Huh, what? Who's the election about?

Parnes discussed reporting in her new book, \"FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" which she co-authored with NBC reporter Jonathan Allen. The book tackles the 2024 presidential campaign and the chaos that unfolded after former President Biden withdrew from the race and Harris took his place at the top of the Democratic ticket. While continuing to discuss the confusion within the Harris campaign on election night, Parnes said that Walz was sitting in his hotel room \"stunned.\" KAMALA HARRIS WAS ‘VERY ANNOYED’ WITH OBAMA AS SHE SOUGHT HIS ENDORSEMENT, BOOK REVEALS \"He has no words. And people are kind of explaining to him, same thing with her. And she's like, are you sure? Have we done a recount? Should we do a recount?\" Parnes said on the podcast, recounting how Walz and Harris reportedly reacted to their defeat. \"They thought that they were going to win. And so, you know, when they come back now and say, 'Oh no, we didn't really have a chance.' No, that's not what they were thinking. They thought they were going to win,\" she added. Harris campaign staffers felt \"gaslit\" by leadership about Harris' chances at winning after being told that \"things were looking good\" for the candidate ahead of the election, according to Parnes. Harris also \"bought the hype\" that she was doing better than she was, the author said. TOP KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN ADVISOR ADMITS SHE WAS FLOORED BY DEMOCRAT'S MAJOR FLUB ON 'VIEW' \"Kamala Harris was looking at her crowd size, and they felt like the vibe was strong and people were saying, 'Oh, we have more boots on the ground. We're doing better in fundraising,'\" Parnes continued. \"And she bought all of that. She bought the hype, and so did a lot of people in the campaign.\" According to the book, Harris reportedly told friends in the aftermath of her defeat that she could've won the election if she had more time and if Biden hadn't run for re-election. \"She could have won, she told friends, if only the election was later in the calendar — or she got in earlier. In other words, Joe Biden was to blame,\" the authors wrote. Friends of Harris said that she believed Biden's unpopularity and her late entry into the race tanked her campaign. CARVILLE SAYS KAMALA HARRIS DIDN'T GIVE A REASON TO VOTE FOR HER, HAS TO BE 'A LOT BETTER CANDIDATE' IN 2028 However, not all of Harris' friends believed time would've helped, according to the book. \"That is f---ing bonkers,\" one Harris friend reportedly said. \"If Election Day was October first, we might have actually somehow pulled it off. Shorter was actually better, not longer.\" One Harris advisor said the candidate's problem was \"substance,\" not a lack of campaign time. \"I don't think we needed more time… We needed more substance. And she did not have more substance,\" the advisor is quoted in the book. The book also revealed that former President Obama hesitated to endorse Harris, believing she couldn't win against Trump. \"He didn’t think that she was the best choice for Democrats, and he worked really behind the scenes for a long time to try to have a mini-primary, or an open convention, or a mini-primary leading to an open convention, did not have faith in her ability to win the election,\" co-author Jonathan Allen told MSNBC this week. \"As it turned out, she didn’t win, but he was really working against her,\" Allen continued.

Hunter Biden Didn’t Help.","text":"“In the weeks leading up to the debate, we had sources—both of us—ask us if we were going to do a book,” Parnes says. “And we both said, ‘No, no, we’ve been there, done that.’”\nFight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House arrived this week, loaded with, well, insider details about how Biden, Trump, and Kamala Harris tried to win the presidency: Biden aides laying down strips of fluorescent tape to help guide the president’s walk through a New Jersey fundraiser; Trump surprisingly turning away from chaos and turning down Corey Lewandowski’s bid to oust rival campaign aides; and Harris being hamstrung by Biden’s insistence that there be “no daylight” between the two Democrats.\nI spoke with Allen and Parnes at a moment when the consequences of the 2024 election were hitting hard, everywhere from Wall Street to Kyiv. In the interview, edited for length and clarity, the two described how they discovered more Democratic dysfunction than was apparent at the time, and how Trump’s team kept its candidate under control. Mostly.\nVanity Fair: The opening scene of the book describes a series of power players as they watch the fateful Biden-Trump debate. Where were the two of you that night?\nJonathan Allen: I was at Shelly’s Back Room on F Street Northwest in Washington, smoking a cigar, watching the debate, and calling and texting with sources.\nAmie Parnes: I was at home. My phone was blowing up. I think I had maybe 50 text exchanges that night with freaked-out lawmakers, strategists, basically everyone—Republicans, Democrats. I often go back and look at those messages because they were surreal.\nAt that point, in June 2024, President Biden’s physical and mental capacities had long been a central issue in the campaign. Was his terrible debate performance still a surprise to you?\nParnes: It was just stunning to watch.\nAllen: We’d been watching Biden’s decline for a long period of time and, honestly, thought he had lost his fastball some when he was running in 2020. And it was still so shocking to see the leader of the free world so bereft of coherent thought.\nYour book describes the lengths to which the president’s longtime inner circle—including first lady Jill Biden and senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti—went to hide that decline. Who was most responsible?\nParnes: All of them. It’s pretty remarkable how they kept him very closed off. He was a shell of himself. When he entered the White House, he was so, so different from the man who I covered as vice president, a guy who would hold court in the Naval Observatory with reporters until the wee hours.\nHow large a part of the equation was Hunter Biden?\nAllen: Most people have looked at Hunter Biden as somebody that his father has had to deal with. And what we really found in the reporting here is that Hunter Biden is somebody that his father wanted to deal with on political issues, that Hunter was, as was described to us by one source, his father’s closest political adviser, which is mind-blowing. I mean, if you’re seeking—and I don’t mean this to knock Hunter Biden in an untoward way, but it is not clear that he has the best record as somebody you would lean on for judgment.\nThe book doesn’t use the word cover-up to describe the effort to conceal the extent of Joe Biden’s deficits. Was it one?\nAllen: I think our view is that there is more complexity to it. Largely, the people who are closest to the person in power are people who do not tell that person things they don’t wanna hear…If you were going to stand up and say something, you would be thrown out of the room. That basically happened with Anita Dunn toward the end.\nWhat we saw was a lot of bad decision-making and, perhaps at the very top, people putting their own interests, and what they believed were Joe Biden’s interests, above the interests of the Democratic Party and the country. And so that’s a failure. That’s a moral failure, but maybe not a criminal one, which is what the term cover-up sort of implies, a criminal conspiracy, and we didn’t reach that threshold.\nDozens of reporters pursued the truth about Biden’s age and health; I wrote about it way back in May 2023. Yet did we, the mainstream media, still blow it?\nParnes: No, I don’t think we missed it. I think we were all onto it. But the problem is, I think [the Biden camp’s] response was kind of unethical in a way. When I called the White House and I tried to do a story on the president’s exercise routine—which is something that every president has sort of put out, minus Trump, maybe—that was pretty low-hanging fruit, and that should have been a sign to me at the time—and I think it was—the fact that they couldn’t even tell me what he did, if anything. Those were all signs that something wasn’t right there.\nA common frustration for readers of presidential campaign books is, “Now you tell us! Why didn’t you report this a year ago instead of saving it to sell books?”\nAllen: I think we started our interviews in August, but the vast majority we did were postelection, for a variety of reasons. No, we didn’t hold anything back for the book that would have been material to the election at all. Amie and I both did significant reporting during the year, or during the election, on all of these aspects.\nOne of the book’s revelations is the effort by Biden’s team, when the president was trying to hold on to the nomination, to criticize Kamala Harris’s prospects as a replacement. How much did the vice president’s camp know about that undermining at the time?\nAllen: We don’t have deep reporting on this, but I suspect they were somewhat aware, because they’re all talking to the same people; they have the same donor bases. What is shocking is the brazenness with which Joe Biden’s top aides were attacking the sitting vice president of the United States and the person clearly most likely to take over if Joe Biden stepped aside, basically attempting to drown her in order to keep his head above water at a time when it should have been clear to them that he was not capable of beating Donald Trump. And when I talk about the brazenness, I mean they sent electronic messages to people trashing the vice president, saying if you keep pushing on Joe Biden to get out, you’re going to end up with Kamala Harris, and that’s going to be a huge mistake.\nYou explore one of the highest-profile mysteries of the subsequent Harris campaign: why it never responded to the Trump campaign’s trans-bashing TV ad.\nParnes: Bill Clinton was watching football games and watching that ad, and his blood was boiling so much that he calls the top brass of the campaign—not only [campaign chair] Jen O’Malley Dillon, but others—to complain and say, Why aren’t you doing anything about it?\nAllen: They basically told him, Your political instincts suck, and our data say that this is an ineffective ad…It’s sort of the victory of ridiculous data over common sense. I think that that’s been a common theme in recent campaigns for Democrats.\nOn the Republican side, one piece of conventional wisdom during 2024 was that Trump was running a more professional campaign than his first two. Was that actually true, or was his campaign leadership just better at containing his craziness?\nAllen: Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita played important gatekeeper roles in terms of limiting the influence of some of the more provocative people around him. I think they also did a pretty good job of locking down the leaks that we’ve come to expect from Trumpworld…Look, I mean, you can’t control Trump. He’s going to do what he’s going do, but I think the attitude of Susie Wiles and the people around her was, If he’s gonna lose because he does something, that’s one thing, but him losing because the campaign is not pointed in the direction of supporting him is another thing, and the latter would be unacceptable, and anybody who risked the latter would have been gone.\nOne of the benefits of this being your third presidential campaign book is that you’ve observed Trump over the course of 10 years. What was the biggest difference in him this time around?\nAllen: He learned. He’s a guy who’s also pretty up there in age, and not everybody continues to want to learn as they get older. But what he learned was that part of the reason he lost in 2020 was that he hurt himself in some ways by leaning so heavily toward his base…The Project 2025 thing, that’s something you would normally have expected him to lean into because he was such a base politician. And yet he basically said, I have nothing to do with Project 2025. Now, I think his supporters and his critics both knew very well that if he got elected, he was going to follow Project 2025 almost word for word. But in terms of how he presented himself to the broader public, he moved away from that.\nHow has the political media environment changed most since 2015?\nAllen: I think there are fewer and fewer people that want to hear objective truth.

During the Trump interview, Akaash occasionally chimed in to give Trump a chance to appeal to moderate voters.\n\n He did also have a few fawning moments, telling Trump it was an “honor” to sit down with him and praising his tariffs on China.\n\n “Everybody I speak to, every race, creed, whatever, they don't just like you, they love you,” Akaash marveled at one point. “And I talk to people on both sides about your policies.”\n\n Despite telling Trump during the interview that he “might actually vote” after speaking with him, Akaash insists in his wife’s TikTok that he did not vote for Trump.

Politics is ugly, bro, it just f------ sucks.”\n\n “I don’t believe in endorsing candidates. I’m a comedian,” he added. “And I didn’t want to go to the inauguration either.

If they did well because they were persuading prior Trump backers to vote for Democrats, that would be a good sign for their 2026 chances. But that’s not what mostly happened.\n\nDemocrats have overperformed their expectations in special and spring elections for most of the Trump era. Their increasing tilt toward highly educated white people, who tend to vote more regularly, means the lower the turnout, the higher the share of Democrats in the special election electorate.\n\nThe June 2017 special election for South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District is a case in point. Turnout was extremely low in this historically safe GOP seat, a mere 18.34%. The Democrat held Republican Ralph Norman to a mere 51%, a 3-point margin. \n\nThe same two candidates squared off in the 2018 midterm elections. That election was the GOP’s worst in over a decade, costing it 40 House seats. But here, the higher turnout for a general election propelled Norman to a comfortable victory of 15.5 points.\n\nThis happened to a lesser extent in another House special election in the 2018 cycle. Ohio’s 12th District was a historically Republican seat, but GOP nominee Troy Balderson beat Democrat Danny O’Connor by less than a point in August. \n\nFast forward to November of the same year when the two men squared up for a rematch. Turnout leaped from 208,000 to over 342,000, and Balderson expanded his margin to more than 4 points.\n\nThat dynamic was at play Tuesday evening in Florida and, to a lesser degree, Wisconsin.\n\nThe electorates in the two Florida seats were significantly less Republican-leaning than those in the 2024 general election, according to the New York Times. The electorate in the closely watched Florida 6th District race was 5 points less Republican than in the 2024 general election. The contest in Florida’s 1st District was even more pro-Democratic, with an electorate that was 10 points less GOP than in November.\n\nThe Wisconsin electorate also tilted to the left. Democrats who voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris turned out much more than Republicans who voted for Trump, according to a New York Times analysis. This fits a long-standing pro-Democratic turnout pattern in Wisconsin’s April Supreme Court elections.\n\nThere were also some race-specific effects that likely boosted progressive Susan Crawford in that contest. The Democratic-backed candidate for state superintendent of public instruction beat her GOP-supported challenger by less than 6 points, much less than Crawford’s 10-point margin. Given that abortion was an issue in the court race but not the education one, it’s quite plausible that pro-abortion Trump supporters voted leftward for the court but rightward for the superintendent.\n\nThe midterm electorates even in Wisconsin will be significantly larger than they were on Tuesday. That will redound to the GOP’s benefit up and down the ballot.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the party should rest easy. Midterm outcomes are directly tied to a president’s job approval rating. Analysis of the last four midterm elections shows that the president’s party should expect to garner most of the vote from those who approve of the president’s performance. They will be lucky, though, to get over 10% of those who disapprove.\n\nThat’s true regardless of which party occupies the White House. In 2018, House Republicans got 88% of the vote from people who approved of Trump’s job but only 8% of those who disapproved. In 2022, Democrats got 94% of people who liked then-President Joe Biden but only 12% of those who did not.\n\nThat means savvy observers will be looking at Trump’s job approval ratings rather than extrapolating from comparatively low-turnout special election results.\n\n2026 MIDTERM ELECTIONS BEGIN TO TAKE SHAPE AS DEMOCRATS LOOK TO BREAK UP GOP TRIFECTA\n\nRepublicans will have a decent night in 2026 if Trump’s job approval rating is 46% or higher on Election Day. It will be a good night if it approaches his current 48% average approval — and it will be a terrible night if it reaches Biden’s 44% level or drops even lower.\n\nIt’s fun to get high on your own supply, but it’s not very useful to do that as a serious political strategist or analyst. Democrats misread the 2024 electorate by thinking their own biases in favor of abortion rights and the purported danger Trump posed to democracy would move swing voters. If they believe their own spin regarding the special election results, they could be making an even worse mistake come next year.\n\nHenry Olsen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a veteran political analyst.

However, as he turns his attention to a potential 2028 presidential run, he’s said that his new podcast venture is an attempt to hear both sides of “the most pressing issues of the day.”\n\n Denying that hosting conservative firebrands like Kirk and Bannon is an attempt to manufacture viral moments or appeal to potential Republican voters, Newsom recently told Semafor that his podcast is “just exploring the other side,” including the GOP’s recent election success.\n\n “Why are they kicking our ass?” he explained of his interview goals. “Why are these guys so successful? They are. I mean, I’m sorry, Democrats, they are.”\n\n ”[Conservatives] feel like we talk down to them, that we talk past them,” Newsom continued. “It’s the elitism of being so f**king judgmental and being so quick to dismiss people. So what I’m trying to do is acknowledge that criticism. I feel that sometimes, too.”\n\n One insider told THR that Guilfoyle’s possible influence on Newsom’s decision to reach across the aisle “doesn’t surprise me at all.”\n\n PEOPLE reached out to Newsom's office for comment.\n\n The former couple married in December 2001, and Guilfoyle was by Newsom’s side when he was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003. They ultimately separated in 2004 and their divorce was finalized in February 2006.\n\n Newsom went on to marry documentary filmmaker Jennifer Siebel in 2008 and the couple share four children. Meanwhile, Guilfoyle made a right turn — personally, politically and professionally. She went to work for Fox News from 2006 to 2018 before becoming enmeshed in the Trump family.\n\n After being considered for the press secretary position in Trump’s first administration, Guilfoyle began campaigning for his reelection in earnest after she started dating Donald Trump Jr. in 2018 – following his split from then-wife Vanessa Trump.\n\n Giulfoyle and Don Jr. made many appearances together on the president’s behalf, including speeches at the Republican National Convention in both 2020 and 2024. They got engaged on Dec. 31, 2020, but broke things off in late 2024 as a newly reelected President Trump appointed Guilfoyle to become the United States’ ambassador to Greece.\n\n However, despite Guilfoyle’s pivot towards conservative politics, THR’s sources say that she and Newsom maintained a relationship through the years.\n\n “Gavin has had a decent professional connection — or maybe transactional is the word — with Kimberly before she started dating Donald Trump Jr.,” one insider claimed. “He wasn’t fazed by her political transformation, and he’d talk to her every once in a while. As far as I know, there wasn’t a year that they didn’t talk.”\n\n Newsom has yet to officially announce any plans for his post-gubernatorial political career, though it’s thought that he would be a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential ticket in 2028 — especially if Kamala Harris decides to run for California governor in 2026 and forgo another attempt at the White House.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​.\n\n On March 6, conservative radio host Dana Loesch made an appearance on Fox News, where she warned host Jesse Waters that Democrats may be using Newsom to appeal to centrist voters in the next presidential election.\n\n “They can't go any further left,\" she said of the Democratic Party. \"They have to go all the way to the middle, and Gavin Newsom is how they're floating it.\" \n\n \"So he hosts this podcast… He establishes relevancy for himself beyond 2026 when he terms out,” she continued. “He has this platform, and he's going to use it as a marketing tool to help leverage him into the White House.\"","summary":"Guilfoyle joined Fox News and entered a serious relationship with Donald Trump Jr. after getting divorced from Newsom, though a new report claims she's spoken to the California governor every year since","url":"https://people.com/gavin-newsom-got-help-ex-wife-kim-guilfoyle-report-11709136","image":"https://people.com/thmb/0Qk5tKrv5_f7AB-lAecpB5CnEc0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(748x324:750x326)/gavin-newsom-kimberly-guilfoyle-newsom-election-night-party-040425-1-4e9e6a7b80394ed38c02bc58318d447a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 17:20:54","author":"Meredith Kile","authors":["Meredith Kile"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.063},{"id":307731626,"title":"Trump Is Apparently Taking National Security Advice From Unqualified Racist Laura Loomer","text":"Source: Julia Beverly / Getty In today’s episode of Trump’s “Meritocracy” Is Really A MAGA-tastrophe, President Donald Trump appears to be taking some of his cues from loud and proud racist Laura Loomer, who, like many of his closest cohorts, is not qualified to advise the president of two-ply toilet paper, let alone the president of the United States. According to Axios, several members of Trump’s National Security Council were fired Thursday, just one day after Loomer paid a visit to the White House and urged Trump to fire several specific NSC staffers. Now, Trump, of course, claims Loomer had nothing to do with his decision, which an inside source told Axios was “being labeled as an anti-neocon move,” which sounds like Trump fired members of his National Security Council because they were not ideologically compatible with his administration. “We’re always going to let go of people — people we don’t like or people that take advantage of [us] or people that may have loyalties to someone else,” Trump told reporters Thursday on Air Force One. As for Loomer’s involvement, the president claimed, “She makes recommendations…and sometimes I listen to those recommendations…I listen to everybody and then I make a decision.” Only under the current administration can people who have never held political office or worked in the federal government in any capacity — people whose only qualifications included being white, vehemently bigoted and passionately MAGA-fied — rise to the level of having the commander-in-chief’s ear. Mind you, last year, when Trump was still a candidate, he went from having Loomer on his campaign trail to trying to distance himself from her because it turned out her racism was so loud even deranged white nationalist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was offended by her. (Actually, I’m pretty sure Loomer and MTG were already beefing and that’s the only reason the Georgia lady who hates Muslims and loves Jan. 6 terrorists was pretending to be mad at Loomer for making some stupid-a** joke about VP Kamala Harris making the White House “smell like curry.”) But just like Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025 while he was still campaigning, only to make it the blueprint for just about every executive order he has signed since Jan. 20, he only needed to distance himself from rabid racists until he was back in the Oval Office. Now, he’s in for another four years, so he can openly embrace white supremacists like Loomer, who called Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee a “ghetto b*tch” immediately after she died following a battle with pancreatic cancer, and called Harris, New York AG Letitia James, and Fulton County DA Fani Willis “meritless DEI Shaniquas.” Imagine that, a white woman whose entire political background begins and ends with her failed bid to represent Florida’s 21st congressional district in the state House is out here connecting Black women with extensive resumes to DEI while using the stereotypical name “Shaniqua,” which is certainly a racial epithet coming out of her mouth. This is what Trump does. He talks a big game about “merit,” but he has filled his cabinet with white people, mostly white men, who are woefully underqualified for the positions they hold, and they prove their incompetence every single day. Hell, just last month, Trump appointed TurningPoint USA founder Charlie Kirk to the U.S. Air Force’s board of visitors. Why? Has Kirk ever served in the military? No. Has he ever served in the government in any capacity? No. In fact, what has he ever done besides serve as a mediocre white man and vehemently anti-Black racist who dropped out of community college but still had the caucasity to complain that prominent Black women with extensive resumes were serving in the government due to DEI? It’s almost as if there’s a pattern here.

On this morning’s episode of The View, Griffin and her co-hosts discussed the slew of books being released about the final fraught months of the 2024 presidential election, when Biden finally caved to public pressure and dropped out of the race, leaving Kamala Harris to launch her own campaign against President Trump. \n\nAs the panel dissected claims by people like Biden aide Ron Klain — who alleged there was concern about Biden’s ability to prep for debates and wrote that he would doze off by the pool sometimes — Griffin said we are living under a second Trump administration because of Biden’s refusal to drop out of the race until July 2024. \n\n“We’re in a moment where a lot of people are scared, they’re nervous, they’re worried that we’re seeing America fundamentally changed,” Griffin began. “And a reason for that, not just a little asterisk, is that Joe Biden did not win, did not step aside in time to allow someone else to win.”\n\nShe continued, “I do think it’s a story that warrants some reflection, because even beyond the electoral consequences of Trump winning and what we’re gonna experience the next four years, I think there’s also, what I’m struck by — and I think highly of Biden,” she noted clarifying, “People always think I’m so critical just because I think he needed to step aside and give someone else a chance.”\n\nShe then suggested his reluctance to suspend his presidential campaign made him similar to a certain Donald J. Trump: “He does start to come off, the more we’re learning, like, ‘I alone can fix it.’ It almost comes off Trumpian,” Griffin suggested. \n\nAs for Ana Navarro, she said she wants nothing to do with books about the 2024 campaign and doesn’t have any interest rehashing the mess. \n\n“These are not normal times,” she declared. “I’m not interested in palace gossip from a year-and-a-half ago.” \n\nThe View airs weekdays at 11/10c on ABC.","summary":"No matter their politics, Griffin thinks Biden and Trump have one key trait in common.","url":"https://decider.com/2025/04/04/alyssa-farah-griffin-trump-biden-the-view/","image":"https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trump-afg-biden.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wEaM9pYw-QVS3bn7S.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-04 15:57:25","author":"Greta Bjornson,mliss1578","authors":["Greta Bjornson","mliss1578"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":307719758,"title":"AOC's Chances of Beating Chuck Schumer in New York—New Poll","text":"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would hold a lead over Senator Chuck Schumer if she challenged him ahead of his next election, according to a poll released Friday.Newsweek reached out to Ocasio-Cortez and Schumer for comment via email on Friday morning.Why It MattersSchumer, a New York Democrat, faced a wave of backlash from Democratic voters last month over a procedural vote to advance a GOP-backed bill to temporarily fund the government. Democrats criticized him for advancing the vote with little fight, yielding no concessions from Republicans on the bill. It comes as many Democrats were already frustrated with what they viewed as a feeble response to President Donald Trump's administration.Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive member of Congress representing parts of Queens and the Bronx in New York, has been floated as a potential opponent against Schumer. The new poll suggests she may be in a position to take him on in a few years if he chooses to seek reelection.What to KnowThe poll, conducted by Data for Progress among 767 likely New York Democratic primary voters from March 26 to 31, showed Ocasio-Cortez with nearly a 20-point lead in a hypothetical 2028 primary matchup between the two. The margin of error associated with the sample size is plus or minus 4 percentage points.Fifty-five percent of respondents said they would pick her over Schumer, while 36 percent said they would stick with the incumbent. An additional 9 percent said they aren't sure who they would vote for.Other polls on the race, which is still three years away, haven't been conducted, so it's unclear whether these results will be replicated.\"The results indicate that Schumer has left himself vulnerable to a primary challenger in 2028, and that Ocasio-Cortez could be a strong candidate to defeat the incumbent New York senator. New York Democrats—and Democrats nationwide—clearly want a leadership that fights harder to defeat Trump and the MAGA agenda,\" the poll reads.The poll also found that most New York Democrats want their elected officials to be doing more to oppose Trump. Eighty-four percent of respondents said elected Democrats aren't doing enough to resist him, while only 10 percent said they are doing enough.New York has long been seen as a safely Democratic state, with the liberal New York City propelling the party to power in most statewide races for decades. But Republicans have gained ground in the state in recent years, with former Vice President Kamala Harris carrying it by less than 13 points last year.What People Are SayingBhaskar Sunkara, president of The Nation, a progressive magazine, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"Replacing Chuck Schumer with AOC would be an incredible upgrade. I guess we'll have to wait four more years...\"Matt Stoller, director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, wrote on X: \"I've never seen Democratic voters genuinely angry at their leaders before.\"MSNBC contributor Rotimi Adeoye wrote on X last month: \"I don't want a 'left v moderate' ideological primary for Schumer. I want Pat Ryan, AOC, Daniel Goldman, and anyone else with fresh energy to primary Schumer. We need a new generation of leaders, not someone who has imaginary friends and uses them to understand swing voters.\"What Happens Next?Schumer, 74, isn't up for reelection until 2028, and he hasn't confirmed if he plans to run again. Ocasio-Cortez, 35, also hasn't made clear her future plans. She has also been floated as a potential presidential candidate for 2028 if Democrats choose to go down a more progressive route.","summary":"A poll published on Friday showed Schumer trailing the progressive congresswoman by nearly 20 points in a hypothetical 2028 matchup.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-poll-chuck-schumer-new-york-senate-primary-2055454","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2621275/aoc-chuck-schumer-primary-poll.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 15:52:23","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.461},{"id":307734662,"title":"Kamala Harris calls out organizations for 'capitulating' to Trump days after Doug Emhoff's law firm cut a deal with the White House","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday issued a veiled rebuke at Big Law firms that have cut deals with President Donald Trump.\"We're seeing people stay quiet,\" Harris said during a speech before the Leading Women Defined Summit. \"We are seeing organizations stay quiet.

Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff from 2019 to 2023, when Haugh was nominated to lead the NSA along with the U.S. Cyber Command. \n\nAfter Trump lost the 2020 election, Milley became concerned Trump was preparing to stage a coup, CNN reported. He condemned the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and told journalist Bob Woodward that Trump was “a fascist to the core.” \n\nIn January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revoked Milley’s security detail and security clearance over his disloyalty to Trump. \n\nBut Haugh, a cyber professional with more than 30 years of military service, seemed to have avoided the administration’s wrath—at least at first, according to the Post. Last month, he hosted Trump’s megadonor and advisor Elon Musk at the NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. \n\nIt was the first time Musk visited a U.S. intelligence agency and reportedly went well. \n\nIn 2018, Haugh ran an offensive against Russian election interference. \n\nRanking Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees called the decision to remove Haugh “disturbing.” \n\n“At a time when the United States is facing unprecedented cyberthreats… how does firing him make Americans any safer?” Sen.

We've been waiting for a long time, April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to 'Make America Wealthy Again'.\n\n\"For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered from nations, near and far, from both friend and foe alike.\"\n\nPot calling the kettle black, anyone?\n\nAnyway, during his speech, stocks across the world began to tumble as investors raced to invest in safer bets such as gold, leaving some of the most wealthiest companies out of pocket.\n\nWhile this is bad news for many organizations, it’s also bad news for other countries, who will now be paying more to import and export goods, forcing consumers to make hard choices about where their dollars should be spent.\n\nIn a strange twists, it appears that Kamala Harris, the Democrat who lost during Trump’s 2024 election, knew all along that this was going to happen, and she even talked about it during the pair’s election battle live on TV.\n\nIn a clip by CNN posted to Reddit, viewers were horrified to see just how right she was about what was to come from Trump’s plans.\n\nIn the video, you can hear Harris state: “What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump’s plan would make the economy worse, mine would strengthen the economy. What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump’s plan would actually explode the deficit.”\n\nShe added during the argument between her and Trump: “16 Nobel laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation, and by the middle of next year, would invite a recession. You just have to look at where we are and where we stand on the issues, and I’d invite you to know that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you, because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.”\n\nHer speech resonated with many since the ‘Liberation Day’ talk Trump had about tariffs and his focus on taxing other nations.\n\nOne person stated: “She warned us all so many f***** times. It's a shame 27% of the population refused to listen.”\n\nAnother wrote: “Yea, but the recession came in just 4 months, not 6. Checkmate libs.”\n\nSomeone else said: “Trump said if I voted for Kamala the economy would be destroyed and the stock market would crash.\n\n“Here we are less than 3 months into his presidency and he’s been proven right. Lol.”\n\nPaul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, spoke to CNN about the ramifications of Trump’s tariffs, and it could really set everyone on path for a recession too.\n\nHe stated that the American economy was ‘in a very good place’ at the beginning of the year, but now, ‘if these tariffs continue as they are, (it will) probably tip into recession’ that will ripple outwards.\n\nThe recession will in turn increase inflation, as a JPMorgan analysist said: “This year’s cumulative tariff hike should be viewed as a US tax increase of roughly $660 billion. The impact on inflation will be substantial.”","summary":"![CDATA[Kamala lost her race for the presidency against Donald Trump]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/resurfaced-footage-kamala-harris-predict-trump-global-tariffs-056650-20250404","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt30cf07039777ec75/67efe9092ab6d2d4396fdac3/resurfaced-kamala-harris-video-trump-predicting-tar","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 14:56:08","author":"Britt Jones","authors":["Britt Jones"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":307797888,"title":"Maryland Lawmakers Pass Bill to Study Reparations","text":"Lawmakers in Maryland this week overwhelmingly approved a measure to study reparations for slavery.\n\nA synopsis of the measure states that the Maryland Reparations Commission would “study and make recommendations relating to appropriate benefits to be made to individuals whose ancestors were enslaved in the State or were impacted by certain inequitable government policies.”\n\nAs such, the commission would be tasked with submitting what the synopsis describes as a “preliminary report by January 1, 2027, and a final report of its findings and recommendations to the Governor and the General Assembly by November 1, 2027.”\n\nLawmakers in the House passed the measure in a 101-36 vote, sending it to Democrat Gov. Wes Moore, who has said he will consider the measure but has yet to commit to signing it. He told reporters that the “history of racism in this state is real,” adding that it is “still very much being felt and they’ve been structurally felt within the state of Maryland.”\n\nDemocrat Baltimore County Delegate Aletheia McCaskill said earlier this year that the commission would “evaluate a range of reparations proposals that will not only consider financial restitution, but will also explore strategies to support and uplift vulnerable communities that continue to suffer the lingering and evasive effects of discriminatory practices rooted in systematic racism,” per the AP.\n\nReports showcase that some of the potential reparations could include not only monetary compensation but “statements of apology,” assistance with purchasing a home, and more.\n\nPrior to losing the 2024 presidential election to President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on “The Breakfast Club” and definitively stated that reparations “has to be studied.”\n\n“So, to your point — I am running to be a president for all Americans,” Harris said at the time. “That being said — I do have clear eyes about the disparities that do exist and the context that they mean in history, to your point.”\n\n“So, my agenda — first of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. There is no question about that, and I’ve been very clear about that position,” she added.\n\nRepublican New York City Councilwoman Vickie Paladino is among those who have criticized the practice of studying reparations, deeming it a waste of time and money for her state.\n\n“You know, waste more money, Mike. You know, I just rattled off problems that really matter to this city, ok, and they want to create a task force to study reparations for black residents,” she said during a September appearance on Breitbart News Daily. \n\n“New York City is at the forefront of ensuring equal rights for all, regardless of race.

Interestingly, Kamala Harris's husband Doug Emhoff works at the firm -- Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Kamala Harris too spoke up against the administration after her long absence. “Fear has a way of being contagious. When one person has fear, it has a way of spreading to those around them and spreading. And we are witnessing that, no doubt,” Harris said.

Have we in fact violated our own values, our own code, violated the law in some fashion?” Obama said. “If not and you’re just being intimidated, you should be able to say, well that’s why we’ve got this big endowment. You know, we’ll stand up for what we believe in, and we’ll pay our researchers for a while out of that endowment, and we’ll give up the extra wing or the fancy gymnasium.”\n\nObama’s warning comes as several top academic institutions, including Harvard, Columbia University, and the University of California, Los Angeles, have conceded they have not conducted a “perfect” response to antisemitism on campuses and rolled out campaigns to further protect Jewish students. \n\nObama also spoke to some of the country’s leading law firms that the White House cut ties with over concerns they had become partisan machines weaponizing the legal system against conservatives and Trump. Several of those firms, including Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher, negotiated their way back into Trump’s good graces with deals that pledged to “be fair and nonpartisan for all” and represent the “full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society, whether ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal.’”\n\nObama slammed the White House for cutting ties with the firms, which included prohibiting any government contracts with Weiss’ law firm.

Book claims ex-VP had to fake surprise as Obamas made her work for what should've been a surefire endorsement","text":"Kamala Harris' path to becoming the Democratic nominee was not as easy as it appeared on the outside. A new political memoir reveals her deep frustrations behind the scenes, particularly with Barack Obama. What appeared to be a warm endorsement turned out to be days of tense negotiations.According to a new book, former Vice President Kamala Harris was very annoyed with former President Barack Obama when she asked for his support to replace former President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket in 2024, as quoted in a report by Fox News.Why did Barack Obama hesitate to endorse Kamala Harris?Despite mounting pressure and support from top Democrats, Obama hesitated before endorsing her.Authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes wrote, As the hours passed, and it became evident that she was well on her way to seizing the nomination by storm, Obama's opposition to her grew more confounding. “A confidant said that Harris was ‘very annoyed’ with him. They shared a large number of political allies and donors. The other members of the group joined her. The Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House book, which was released earlier this month, describes how Harris won over important Democrats to his cause after Biden withdrew from the race.ALSO READ: Who is Natalie Winters, White House reporter barred from National Press Club membership amid uproar over her bold wardrobe choices? According to the authors, Barack Obama believed Harris couldn't defeat Donald Trump, so he didn't want her to run in Biden's place.But the book claims that Obama talked to Harris over the course of the following few days and discovered that his actions against Biden and Harris could diminish him in the eyes of Democratic elites. Obama's reputation for Democratic Party loyalty was also at stake, according to Parnes and Allen. After Joe Biden withdrew from the race, Obama waited five days before endorsing Harris. Did Obama try to block Harris’s nomination?In his Tuesday interview with MSNBC, Allen talked about the book and how Obama tried to sabotage Kamala Harris by attempting to set up an open primary. President Obama absolutely did not think that Joe Biden should continue, according to our sources close to President Obama, Allen stated. He also opposed Kamala Harris taking Biden's place. He didn't believe she was the best option for Democrats, so he spent a lot of time working behind the scenes to try to have an open convention, a mini-primary, or a mini-primary followed by an open convention.What happened during the video call with the Obamas?They recorded a video of Harris receiving a call from Barack and Michelle Obama to post online after some back and forth about how to best highlight Obama's endorsement, with Harris campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon concerned about money, as per a report by Fox News.Kamala Harris had to pretend to be shocked and excited by what should have been a clear endorsement from both Obamas in order to appear genuine. To reach an agreement on the most basic political act, days of intense negotiations were required. The script and the entire frame were intended to elevate the Obamas by giving the impression that she was pleading for their approval, Allen and Parnes wrote. However, Kamala Harris had placed the greatest emphasis on the unity's appearance. Therefore, the endorsement's authenticity and quality suffered, the authors stated, as per a report by Fox News.FAQsWhy was Kamala Harris upset with Barack Obama?She believed his delay in endorsing her, despite their common allies, was unnecessary and politically confusing.Did Obama truly not want Harris to run?According to the book, he believed she couldn't beat Trump and advocated for an open primary.","summary":"Kamala Harris faced challenges in securing Barack Obama's endorsement for the 2024 Democratic nomination.

That'd be crazy,\" Kenan Thompson, who joined SNL at age 25 in 2003, tells Entertainment Weekly.\n\n Now 46 and in his 22nd season, Thompson surpassed previous record-holder Darrell Hammond's benchmark of 14 seasons long ago. He spent years determined to reach 20, which he hit back in 2022. Then he made it to the show's current landmark 50th season and celebrated at an anniversary special that included many of his former castmates, long past their time on the show. What target does the \"What Up With That?\" star have his sights on next?\n\n \"I guess the only other milestone would be just to be the forever cast member. Just never leave the show,\" he says. \"I don't really know. Thirty [seasons] is like, okay, that's just another number kind of thing. Twenty was just such a thing that nobody had ever done. People had gotten into their teens before, but nobody had gotten all the way up to 20. And then I was close to doing it. Once I started getting into 17, I was like, well, if I can, I would love to stick around till 20. And now here we are at 22, so I don't know.\"\n\n So, who's likelier to leave first, Thompson or someone else whose departure has been long-speculated, show creator Lorne Michaels? \"That's a great question,\" the cast member replies. \"I have no idea. I feel like we'll both just ride until the wheels fall off.\"\n\n The SNL star is speaking with EW on behalf of his new GERD Is No Joke campaign with Phathom Pharmaceuticals to raise awareness about the condition and treatment options such as Voquezna.\n\n After about a decade of experiencing acid reflux, which he attributes to \"comings and goings of poor diet choices,\" like drinking soda instead of water, Thompson was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). More than 65 million Americans are affected by the chronic condition, in which stomach acid flows into the esophagus, causing irritation and heartburn, among other symptoms.\n\n \"It was highly uncomfortable and it definitely started to affect my work in certain ways,\" he explains. \"If you're not sleeping well or not able to do your job, that can bring on sadnesses. I'm not necessarily prone to depression, but I can see how those things can be triggers. I wanted a serious kind of solution, so thank God I was able to find Voquezna thanks to my doc.\"\n\n One of the Emmy winner's recurring symptoms is blowing his voice out fairly easily, not ideal for a live performer.\n\n \"All of a sudden I was hoarse or I was raspy. That's not good when you're supposed to be speaking to the back of the house,\" he observes.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n \"I sing the warm-up before the show actually comes on, and that's kind of my major gauge, whether or not I can talk normally afterwards. And that's when I know if I'm in my better health zone or not,\" Thompson says. \"There were some cold opens where I was very raspy and hoarse and voice crackly because I had just finished singing and my throat hadn't had a chance to calm down yet, but we had to go right into the show.\"\n\n Thankfully, the Good Burger star's voice didn't fail him as he got to enjoy reuniting with former costars Maya Rudolph and Andy Samberg, who made frequent cameos earlier this season as 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff. \n\n \"It is so nice to have your buddies back and engage their different senses of humor,\" he says of reuniting with Rudolph, who joined the cast four seasons before him, and Samberg, who started two seasons after and has been gone for well over a decade, just to put Thompson's longevity into perspective.\n\n \"It's the best when they come because they make it that much more comfortable,\" he reflects. \"It's just one less thing to stress about. You feel a more settled kind of energy because there's just more pros in the building. There's more people to turn to in case something goes left. It's nice to have people that have that kind of pedigree in the room, on top of laughing, man.\"\n\n One of those laughs came during the Ariana Grande-hosted episode last October when Samberg joined his former costar in a sketch set in the Italian Renaissance and replied to Thompson's lute player by saying, \"Ah, yes-a, Kenan.\" Thompson couldn't contain his laughter at being called his real name by his old friend.\n\n \"I have a habit of enjoying things in the moment. So anything that I find humorous, I'll respond to that,\" the former Nickelodeon star admits of breaking with Samberg.\n\n \"I have to get better at not…\" He stops himself and changes his mind, \"Or maybe not. Because it is a live show. If we were doing it filmed and trying to do the perfect version, then I would just play everything straight and do it by the book. The fact that it is live allows me to still be a human being and not be overstressed about it all.\"\n\n Learn more about Thompson's GERD Is No Joke campaign here.\n\n Saturday Night Live airs Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET/8:30 p.m. PT on NBC and Peacock.","summary":"\"I feel like we'll both just ride until the wheels fall off,\" Thompson, now in his 22nd season, tells EW when asked if he or Lorne Michaels will leave first.","url":"https://ew.com/snl-star-kenan-thompson-plans-to-be-forever-cast-member-11706618","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/WRVsbiswl-Tw_YeKc9IV6P2OHPE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kenan-thompson-snl-040425-3a-a69a591401f441b78b8ba24dfd2cfce2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 14:21:58","author":"Jillian Sederholm","authors":["Jillian Sederholm"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":307693818,"title":"Who is Laura Loomer? Far-right Trump activist behind 9/11 conspiracies and an ISIS ‘fan club’","text":"Far-right activist Laura Loomer has moved in and out of President Donald Trump’s inner circle, and her latest apparent move shows that she appears to have his ear again. \n\nLoomer recently met with Trump shortly before a series of top security officials were fired.\n\nThe National Security Agency’s director and several National Security Council staff members were dismissed Thursday, while the NSA deputy was reassigned to another role. The firings came the day after the fervent Trump supporter reportedly urged the president to dismiss them over what she said was “disloyalty.”\n\nVice President J.D. Vance, chief of staff Susie Wiles, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Sergio Gor, director of the Presidential Personnel Office, were also at the Oval Office meeting, where Loomer presented “research findings,” according to reports. \n\nHere is a look at Loomer and her controversial past as she returns to have influence with Trump:\n\nLaura Loomer, 31, is a right-wing activist, known for her controversial social media presence. Born in Arizona in 1993, she has a podcast called “Loomer Unleashed” on Rumble, a platform known for streaming far-right figures.\n\nLoomer has also been involved in politics as a fierce advocate of Trump. She ran for Congress twice in 2020 and 2022 in South Florida and lost both races..\n\nRecently she criticized Trump’s advisors and allies in what she said was a White House “vetting crisis” allowing his team to subvert his agenda.\n\nLoomer is thought to have the President’s ear, even though Trump’s campaign and administration previously sidelined her. \n\nShe says she was invited to Mar-a-Lago after challenging Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was due to oppose Trump in the 2024 GOP presidential primary.\n\nLast year she went with Trump as he marked the anniversary of 9/11 and was spotted exiting a plane around the same time Trump landed in Philadelphia to debate former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nLoomer claims to have been invited to the event as a guest, but never officially joined the campaign.\n\nHowever, those appearances caused concerns for some given Loomer’s controversial statements. After she was spotted with the former president, Semafor reported that Trump’s campaign was concerned about the far-right provocateur “exacerbating Trump’s weaknesses,” according to a source close to the campaign.\n\nTrump even comment on social media distancing himself from Loomer\n\n“Laura Loomer doesn't work for the Campaign. She's a private citizen and longtime supporter. I disagree with the statements she made but, like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the Radical Left Marxists and Fascists violently attack and smear me, even to the point of doing anything to stop their Political Opponent, ME! I am now in California, which Democrats like Comrade Kamala Harris and Governor Gavin Newscum have completely DESTROYED. I will turn it all around and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! -DJT.”\n\nLoomer has been criticized for her history of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant posts and supporting 9/11 conspiracy theories. \n\nNotably, she shared a video on X saying “9/11 was an Inside Job!” She has also describing Islam as a “cancer” and she has used the hashtag “#proudislamophobe.”\n\nThe self-styled investigative journalist worked with Project Veritas and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's Infowars.\n\nIn last year’s presidential campaign, she said that if Trump lost to Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, then “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.”\n\nIn December she publicly feuded with Elon Musk over the use of skilled migration visas, saying they go against the “America First” agenda.\n\nShe has been banned or suspended from multiple online platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter over hateful comments to minority communities.","summary":"Laure Loomer is thought to have the president’s ear, even though Trump’s campaign and administration have previously sidelined her","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/laura-loomer-trump-far-right-b2727295.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/04/14/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ycDaAiU0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-04 14:19:35","author":"Steffie Banatvala","authors":["Steffie Banatvala"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.045},{"id":307686424,"title":"Kamala Harris Can’t Resist Taking a Shot at Trump Chaos","text":"Kamala Harris stopped short of saying “I told you so” as she railed against the recent actions of the Trump Administration at a summit in California, the first time she has spoken out in months. \n\nThe former vice president and presidential candidate, who took on Trump in 2024 after Joe Biden dropped out of the race, was speaking at the Leading Women Defined Summit in California on Thursday, and couldn’t resist taking a shot at her political foe. \n\n“There is a sense of fear that is taking hold in this country, and I understand it,” she said in a clip obtained by MSNBC. “We are seeing people stay quiet.

During the speech, Obama called Trump's behavior \"contrary to the basic compact we have as Americans\" and called on students to do more in order to resist Trump's policies. \"It has been easy during most of our lifetimes to say you are a progressive, or say you are for social justice, or say you are for free speech, and not have to pay a price for it…And now we’re in one of those moments when…it’s not enough just to say you’re for something.

He later then fired the director of the National Security Agency and his deputy director, several outlets reported, with Loomer posting on X about it on Friday morning with a screed of ad hominem attacks against Democratic appointees.\n\nIt was the latest sign of Loomer’s influence, even as she has faced criticism for entertaining 9/11 conspiracy theories and her history of anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim posts.\n\nHere’s what to know about Loomer and what both she and Trump said about the latest incident.\n\nLoomer, 31, has been involved in politics as an advocate of Trump. She twice unsuccessfully ran for Congress, in 2020 and 2022, in south Florida and had been known for staging protests including handcuffing herself to a Twitter office after the service banned her and jumping a fence at a home owned by the then House speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nLast year, Loomer accompanied Trump on his 9/11 anniversary travels in New York and Pennsylvania and was also seen walking out of the plane the previous day after the then Republican presidential candidate landed in Philadelphia to debate his electoral opponent, then US vice-president Kamala Harris. Loomer said she was invited those days as a guest.\n\nLoomer said she never officially joined the campaign after Trump’s allies preferred he would keep his distance from her.\n\nLoomer has been banned from numerous social media platforms, including Facebook. She posted during last year’s presidential campaign that if Harris beat Trump, “the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center”, alluding to Harris’s Indian and Jamaican heritage.\n\nIn December, she publicly sparred with billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, a native of South Africa, over their opposing positions on the use of skilled migration visas.\n\nThe conservative activist says such visas go against the “America First” agenda. Her account on X, formerly Twitter and now owned by Musk, was temporarily suspended, but she’s back on it now.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump ended Secret Service protection details assigned to Democrat Joe Biden’s adult children after a report from Loomer with photos showing Hunter Biden’s protective detail while in South Africa.\n\nLoomer has a podcast called Loomer Unleashed on Rumble, a platform known for streaming far-right figures. The influencer frequently makes anti-Islam and anti-immigrant posts on social media and made extremely racist and sexist attacks against Harris. She once shared a video on X that said “9/11 was an Inside Job!”\n\nDuring last year’s election after her racist posts about Harris, Trump said, “Laura’s been a supporter of mine” and that she had “strong opinions”, but denied knowledge of her comments. He would later post on his Truth Social account that he disagreed with her comments.\n\nTrump denied on Thursday that Loomer had anything to do with officials being ousted from their jobs at the national security council, calling her a “very good patriot and a very strong person”.\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One as he made his way to Miami that she had only made recommendations.\n\n“Sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody,” Trump said, adding: “She’s usually very constructive. She recommended certain people for jobs.”","summary":"The white nationalist has been in Trump’s orbit for years, although the White House has tried to sideline her at times\n\nLaura Loomer, a rightwing extremist and political influencer known for her incendiary social media presence, appeared to have been sidelined at points by Donald Trump’s election campaign and then by his new administration.\n\nBut she has long had the US president’s ear and may have it again, at least for now.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/who-is-laura-loomer","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868c1263aeb932c785aac39f7b0d1191e4bde59d/0_234_7008_4205/master/7008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 13:34:31","author":"Guardian staff and agency","authors":["Guardian staff and agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":307695332,"title":"Kamala Harris has honest message for Trump voters as she speaks out for first time in months","text":"Kamala Harris spoke about the fear felt around the US under the Trump administration and made a slight dig at voters during a speech. \n\nFollowing her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election, like many losing candidates, former vice president Kamala Harris faded into the background.\n\nReturning to the White House, Donald Trump has made it clear he was going to be doing things differently to the former Democratic leader Joe Biden.\n\nHis latest move, enacting major tariffs on nations around the world, has certainly been shocking, and saw allied nations bracing for the fallout of this decision.\n\nHarris appeared to touch on this fear of the uncertainty in a speech at Leading Women Defined Summit in California this week (April 3).\n\nDuring this speech, she spoke on the importance of being courageous despite this fear and also warned of further issues along the road under Trump’s administration.\n\nShe said: “When one person, when a few stand with the courage, that is the courage exhibited by the leaders in this room every day.\n\n“To have the courage to say I feel fear, the courage to say what is happening is wrong, the courage to say that there is a way that we must chart to get through this.\n\n“Understanding our power in the democracy that we still have if we hold on to it.\n\n“Courage is contagious.”\n\nHarris went on to condemn Donald Trump’s administration and the way they are running the nation.\n\nShe continued: “We are seeing organizations stay quiet, we are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats, and these are the things that we are witnessing each day in these last few months in our country.\n\n“It understandably creates a great sense of fear because you know there are many things we knew would happen, many things...\n\n“I’m not here to say I told you so.”\n\nHarris then burst into laughter as did the crowd while also giving her applause.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin spoke about Harris’ speech and growing frustrations towards Trump’s team with MSNBC’s Jen Psaki.\n\nHe echoed similar sentiments to Harris and addressed critical comments from voters that the Democrats had ‘disappeared’ since losing the election.\n\nHe said: “I was telling everybody back when they were complaining about ‘where is the Democratic leadership...it takes a while to fully absorb the shock of these events.\n\n“We are talking about a full-blown attempt at an authoritarian takeover of our country and a purge of federal workers and we are being hit on all fronts.\n\n“But now everyone is in a fighting mood.”\n\nHe then continued to speak about an upcoming demonstration that is set to take place in Washington DC.","summary":"![CDATA[Kamala Harris called on Americans to be courageous under Trump's leadership]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/kamala-harris-donald-trump-voters-speaks-out-661245-20250404","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt103dfabda63af413/67efd29bf9b58b1dd8eb1f9f/kamala-harris-speaks-out-first-time-months.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 13:16:20","author":"Gerrard Kaonga","authors":["Gerrard Kaonga"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.001},{"id":307666654,"title":"Kamala Harris breaks silence to send a message to Trump","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is not shying away from the national stage just yet.\n\nHarris has been keeping a low profile since her devastating loss to President Donald Trump last fall. Since then, she has reportedly been considering whether to make a run for California’s gubernatorial race next year or wait to make another presidential bid in 2028.\n\nShe vowed to remain in the fight to combat Trump during a rare event in Southern California on Thursday, The Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n“We can’t go out there and do battle if we don’t take care of ourselves and each other,” she said during the Leading Women Defined conference at an oceanfront resort in Dana Point, California. \n\n“I’ll see you out there. I’m not going anywhere,” she added.\n\nHarris has also been quiet about Trump’s return to office despite some Democrats speaking out against his unprecedented moves in office. His latest announcement on tariffs has shocked global markets and garnered backlash on both sides of the aisle. \n\nThe Los Angeles Times noted that she did not address Trump by name, but said there was “fear” taking hold in the country. \n\n“There is a sense of fear that is taking hold in our country, and I understand it,” Harris said. “These are the things that we are witnessing each day in these last few months in our country, and it understandably creates a great sense of fear. Because, you know, there were many things that we knew would happen, many things.”\n\nShe also appeared to make a reference to her failed 2024 campaign, according to The Times. \n\n“I’m not here to say, ‘I told you so,‘” she said. “I swore I wasn’t going to say that.”\n\nOur journalism needs your support.
