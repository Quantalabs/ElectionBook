Flack passed away at the age of 88, per a report by the AP on Monday.\nHarris shared a picture of her with Flack and said on her X account, “Roberta Flack was a dynamic woman and a remarkable artist. She was a Howard alum, pianist, school teacher, Grammy record-setter, and a musician I loved throughout my life. Doug and I send our prayers to Roberta’s loved ones and all those who have been touched by her artistry.”\nRoberta Flack created a lasting HBCU legacy during her time at Howard University. Born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, in 1937, Flack demonstrated exceptional musical talent from a young age. At just 15, she was awarded a music scholarship to Howard University, a remarkable feat that made her one of the youngest students in the institution’s history.\nPer comments in a 2010 feature done on Flack by NBC Washington, Flack learned to play piano before even learning how to read. Her skills helped her as she gained admission into one of the most prestigious universities in the country. She began her studies as a piano major but later shifted her focus to voice, eventually becoming an assistant conductor for the university choir, where her talents continued to shine. Her leadership and direction of a production of Aida earned a standing ovation from the Howard University faculty.\nWithin a year, she was conducting the Delta Sigma Theta vocal quartet, accompanying pop, jazz, and opera singers, and assisting the university’s choir conductor. During this time, she officially changed her major from piano to voice. To make extra money, she taught private piano lessons and played the organ at her parent’s church, taking over a role previously held by her mother, per a feature on her life by PBS. Before graduating, she changed her major again to music education as she moved to start her teaching journey.\nAfter graduating from Howard University at just 19, she began graduate studies in music. However, her father’s sudden death forced her to leave school and take a teaching job to support herself. She taught music and English in Farmville, North Carolina, continuing her teaching career, and also gained experience as a student teacher at a school near Chevy Chase, Maryland.","summary":"Former U.S. Vice President and Howard University alumna Kamala Harris took to her social media on Tuesday to pay tribute to Roberta Flack.

This overhaul coincides with the Trump administration’s massive overhaul of federal agencies, as well as CBS News potentially settling a suit with Trump over its editing of an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris and shortly after ABC News settling a lawsuit filed by the president. \n\n Kelly, who was fired from Fox News and later from NBC News, where she hosted Today for two years until 2019, was quick to gloat about the end of Reid’s time at the cable news network.\n\n “Remember when Joy Reid laughingly mocked ‘White women tears’ as pathetic and offensive to her? Who’s crying now, Joy?” she wrote on X (formerly Twitter) over the weekend. “Good riddance to the absolute worst person on television, and shame on NBC for letting it go on this long.”\n\n Lemon, who knows the sting of a public firing after he was let go from his nighttime show on CNN last year and then dumped by Elon Musk after the journalist asked less-than-friendly questions while interviewing the mogul for a show on X, was quick to come for Kelly on his YouTube show. He called her a “racist” who doesn’t support women and ultimately told her to “go fuck herself”\n\n “No, Megyn Kelly, the worst person on television was fired from NBC and the Today show a few years ago, and that’s Megyn Kelly,” he told her and his audience. “The worst person who is not on television anymore is you.”\n\n The former CNN anchor then laid into Kelly for the notorious moment where she shrugged off the idea of wearing blackface as part of a Halloween costume. \n\n “Girl bye… Look who’s crying now, what she said to Joy Reid, look who’s crying then with the crocodile tears,” he said on his online show. “Had she learned from that, she wouldn’t spend almost every day being a racist, proving the point that she was crying about and that people called her then, because then I would say, ‘You know what, she learned!’ I was actually friendly with Megyn Kelly, and then when people show you who they are, you better f—ing believe it.”\n\n In conclusion, Lemon evoked his resume as a newsman and his life as a minority in America while dressing her down with a final blow. \n\n “Let me just say to Megyn Kelly,” Lemon said. “In my 30-some years as a journalist and my 50-some years as a person of color: Go fuck yourself. OK?”","summary":"\"Go fuck yourself,\" the former CNN anchor told the ex-Fox News and NBC personality after she dragged Joy Reid.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/don-lemon-megyn-kelly-spar-over-joy-reid-msnbc-dismissal-1236147021/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/lemon-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 22:23:55","author":"Kevin Dolak","authors":["Kevin Dolak"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":294332722,"title":"21 staffers resign from DOGE rather than help Musk","text":"Twenty-one employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.”\n\n“We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.”\n\nThe employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them.\n\nThe mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation.\n\n“Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,\" Leavitt said. \"President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.”\n\nThe staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law.\n\nAll had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service.\n\nTrump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nAccording to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology.\n\n“Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.”\n\nEarlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government's ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote.\n\n“These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.”\n\nThose who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE's government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday.\n\n\"We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,\" they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.”\n\nThe slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government.\n\nAfter the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since.\n\nLast week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei.\n\n\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage.\n\nStill, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff.\n\nOf the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues.\n\n\"I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,\" Kamens said.\n\nU.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector.\n\n“‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nUSDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology.\n\nIt has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people.\n\nAP video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed from Boston. \n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

His last was 2021’s Landslide, which he wrote right after 2019’s Siege: Trump Under Fire, which, of course, came out just a year after the publication of his blockbuster page-turner Fire and Fury in 2018.\n\n Today, we’re getting the not-so-long-awaited All or Nothing, which details the backroom shenanigans behind how 45 managed against all odds to get elected 47. Trump may not be one of Wolff’s biggest fans — “a total LOSER,” the president raged on Truth Social last weekend — but The Hollywood Reporter has seen some early pages detailing Trump’s on-again-off-again relationship with News Corp mogul Rupert Murdoch, and Wolff does, as always, spill the tea.\n\n You’ll probably recall how Murdoch turned on Trump after Jan. 6, only to have second thoughts after it became clear that Trump could actually get back into the White House. Wolff recounts in excruciating detail Murdoch’s attempts to rekindle their old magic. He reports that Murdoch phoned so often that Trump started cracking jokes about how the 93-year-old Aussie “could not remember that he had called him the day before.” There’s also a cringy moment when Murdoch introduces Trump to his new, fifth wife, Elena Zhukova. “She’s Russian!” Murdoch brightly tells him, playing the Slav mate card.\n\n According to Wolff, Murdoch’s attempts to re-woo Trump sometimes went awry. In March, Murdoch thought he’d please the then-candidate by ordering the New York Post to run a headline about Trump attending a wake for a slain New York police officer while at the same time presidents Biden, Obama and Clinton groveled for cash at nearby $25 million fundraiser. As Wolff writes, though, Trump “seemed to miss the point of the headline, sorely pissed and disbelieving about the $25 million. ‘How could that fucking be?” he reportedly yelled at aides. “This is fake. It’s gotta be fake. If they’re really doing such good business, what does that mean? It means I have shitty people.’”\n\n There’s also inside dish on what Trump’s circle made of their boss’s cozy friendship with Fox News star Sean Hannity, particularly after Jan. 6, when the channel’s owner was still ticked off at Trump. “To many in Trump-world,” Wolff writes, “observing the Trump-and-Hannity byplay, Trump, in refusing to understand that Fox News was no longer his safe space, was the innocent figure, the big, good-hearted quarterback on the high school team. And Hannity was the kid with all the angles, easily playing the dopey big guy.”\n\n And there’s intel on how Murdoch lobbied for Trump to pick former secretary of state Mike Pompeo as his vp instead of JD Vance (“There was almost no earthly possibility”) as well as some fly-on-the-wall reporting from a meeting Trump called with Murdoch and his top lieutenants during the campaign, during which Trump complained about Fox News allowing Kamala Harris ads on its airwaves. “Trump focused on Murdoch, assailing him for having fired Roger Ailes, the Fox founder whom Murdoch had dismissed in 2016 over sexual harassment charges,” Wolff writes. “Ailes, Trump insisted, would never have screwed him like this.” There’s even more from another meeting around the same time with the editorial board of Murdoch’s The Wall Street Journal. “Trump read from a list of grievances he had with the paper, enumerating a ten-year litany of all the times the Journal had been wrong and he had been right,” Wolff wrote.\n\n Indeed, there’s enough Trump craziness on these pages to keep Wolff fans amused — and horrified — for at least the next six months. Right about when his next book should be coming down the pike.","summary":"'Fire and Fury' author Michael Wolff's new page-turner, out today, is packed with revelations about Trump's comeback, including a desperate campaign by Rupert Murdoch to regain the president's trust.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/trump-all-michael-wolff-or-nothing-1236146837/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/michael_wolff_on_real_time_with_bill_maher.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 20:58:31","author":"Benjamin Svetkey","authors":["Benjamin Svetkey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":294312532,"title":"Exclusive: Alex Cooper’s Unwell Network no longer hosting Alix Earle’s ‘Hot Mess’ podcast","text":"Hot mess, indeed.\n\nAlix Earle’s “Hot Mess” podcast has been dropped by Alex Cooper’s Unwell Network.

Speculation of a rift grew when Earle skipped an Unwell Super Bowl party in New Orleans even though she was in town.\n\nIn August 2023, Cooper announced that she was launching the Unwell Network and signed Earle to join the fold. The network was positioned as a production shingle that could speak to Gen Z audiences with “unique voices that embrace social challenges and personal insecurities through honest conversation.”\n\nUnwell’s initial talent signings also included “Pretty Lonesome” host Madeline Argy, who, alongside Cooper and Earle, would “develop a variety of multiplatform concepts and projects” across such silos as pop-culture, beauty, fashion and lifestyle.\n\nThe Unwell Network is a subsidiary of Tending, the media company Cooper founded with her fiancé, Matt Kaplan of ACE Entertainment. In August 2024, Cooper inked a deal with Sirius XM that includes Unwell Music (Cooper’s own music channel) and Unwell on Air (“The Daily Dirty” and “The Dialed In Show”).\n\nDespite Earle’s exit, Unwell has a deep bench. In February, the network signed Grace O’Malley to launch her “DisGRACEful” podcast. Cooper’s network also includes Harry Jowsey’s “Boyfriend Material” and Owen Theile’s “In Your Dreams.” And Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” continues to land huge guests.

MSNBC's ratings slumped after the 2024 election, but they have rebounded since Trump's inauguration on January 20. Her show was long seen as a fixture on the network.Her commentary, which has routinely criticized Trump and Republicans, has often gone viral on social media.What To KnowTroye, a Republican who has emerged as a vocal Trump critic in recent years, praised Reid in a Substack post after MSNBC made her departure from the network official on Monday.Troye described the cancellation as \"a tremendous loss for them and a disheartening signal to all who believe in honest, transformative dialogue.\"\"Few experiences have been as defining as my time as a guest on Joy Reid's show, The Reid Out,\" she wrote. \"Joy's fearless discourse and unwavering commitment to truth reshaped my understanding of what the media could be. Her show was more than just a program—a battleground for ideas, a place where the truth was spoken, scrutinized, and celebrated.\"Troye noted that Reid was the first person in the media who acknowledged Troye's identity as a Latina.\"On her show, when I spoke about my Mexican mother and my roots, she didn't shy away from highlighting that aspect of who I am,\" she wrote. \"That recognition was both transformative and deeply personal—especially for someone who as a conservative had long been pigeonholed by preconceived notions.\"Troye served as a homeland security and counterterrorism adviser for Pence before resigning in August 2020. Since then, she has frequently criticized Trump and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race.The news that MSNBC was canceling The Reidout drew mixed reaction from pundits. While many on the left lamented the cancellation, some conservatives celebrated her departure.What People Are SayingJournalist Karen Attiah on X, formerly Twitter: \"Over the course of my career, Joy Reid has been one of the few to give me and so many other Black voices consistent airtime.

Meanwhile, Americans are moving out of the largest blue states like California and New York.This means Democratic-leaning states are poised to lose seats in Congress next decade, giving Republicans an advantage in presidential races as the Electoral College number for each state is made up of its entire congressional delegation.What To KnowTexas and Florida are joined by North Carolina, South Carolina, Arizona, Indiana, Colorado, Tennessee and Oklahoma in having the strongest net migration numbers in 2023, according to the report from StorageCafe.Of those, only Colorado voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race and is viewed as a solidly Democratic state.Arizona and Georgia are purple states that backed former President Joe Biden in 2020 but flipped back to President Donald Trump in November.On the other hand, California and New York were followed by Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Michigan and New Hampshire as the states that lost the most residents in 2023.Most of those states voted for Harris. Louisiana is a solidly Republican state, while Michigan and Pennsylvania are swing states that backed Trump in November.Politics, however, are not viewed as a key driver for internal migration patterns. Instead, issues like cost of living and housing affordability tend to shape migration trends, according to the report.The report highlighted that Colorado is a \"mecca for remote workers, coming in third for attracting the largest number of people working from home in 2023\" but is one of the most expensive states to buy a home.\"About 27% of employees relocating to Colorado are remote workers, and a significant 43% of them have higher education. For many of those, as well as other high-income earners, Colorado's quality of life and signature blend of natural attractions and outdoorsy lifestyles often outweigh affordability,\" the report reads.Many of the states people are leaving, such as California and New York, are among the most expensive places to buy a home. California has been in a years-long housing crisis because of high costs, low inventory and relatively few new houses being built, locking out many potential homeowners.What People Are SayingDoug Ressler, a business intelligence manager at Yardi Matrix, in the report: \"Skyrocketing housing costs in traditionally expensive markets are pushing families to seek more affordable and spacious alternatives. The Sun Belt continues to attract a significant share of movers, cementing its status as a top migration destination, despite some fluctuations in recent years.\"William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Newsweek in December: \"When it comes to deciding when to move, it's sort of like the last election. It's a pocketbook thing.

Though the resolution doesn’t explicitly target Medicaid, skeptical lawmakers warn there are few alternatives to achieve the $880bn in cuts assigned to the energy and commerce committee.\n\nIf the budget measure doesn’t pass by the 14 March deadline, the government faces a shutdown – and Democrats are committed to not voting it through.\n\n“Let me be clear, House Democrats will not provide a single vote to this reckless Republican budget,” said the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, from the steps of the US Capitol on Tuesday surrounded by Democratic lawmakers and advocates protesting the vote. “Not one, not one, not one.”\n\nWith Democrats united in opposition, House speaker Mike Johnson’s slim Republican majority cannot afford more than one defection. Several moderate Republicans from vulnerable districts have expressed concerns, particularly those with constituents heavily reliant on Medicaid.\n\nEight House Republicans, including the California representative David Valadao and the New York representative Nicole Malliotakis, warned in a letter to Johnson last week that “slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities”.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican Don Bacon, representing a district that backed Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate in November, has demanded leadership to prove the proposal “won’t overly cut Medicaid”.\n\nOpposition to the House budget resolution has been steadily building over the last few weeks. During last week’s recess, constituent anger over Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs as well as Elon Musk’s efforts to dismantle the federal government boiled over at town halls and congressional offices across the country.\n\nAt an earlier Capitol Hill rally on Tuesday, Senator Chris Murphy assailed the Republican budget bill as the “most massive transfer of wealth and resources from poor people and the middle class to the billionaires and corporations in the history of this country”.\n\nHe continued: “You’re talking about $880bn of cuts to Medicaid … That means that sick kids die in this country. That means that hospitals in depressed communities and rural communities close their doors, right? That means that drug and addiction treatment centers disappear all across this country.”\n\nThe vote comes after the Senate passed its own budget bill last week – a less contentious one that Trump does not support as much as the House’s. House leadership must now navigate competing demands within their caucus: some members want deeper tax cuts while others seek steeper spending reductions or protection for social programs.\n\n“There may be more than one [defector], but we’ll get there,” Johnson said on Monday. “We’re going to get everybody there. This is a prayer request. Just pray this through for us because it is very high stakes, and everybody knows that.”","summary":"Budget central to Trump’s agenda might get stalled before 14 March deadline as lawmakers warn of nearly $1tn in cuts\n\nHouse Republicans are planning to vote on Tuesday on a spending blueprint central to Donald Trump’s agenda, but the package faces potential derailment over nearly $1tn in Medicaid cuts that could fracture their slim majority.\n\nThe fiscal year 2025 proposal includes approximately $4.5tn in tax cuts alongside increased spending for defense and border security.

That has always been the case. But something's changing: America's wealthy aren't just purchasing more than everybody else — they're increasingly propping up the entire U.S. economy with their spending.\n\nThe economy \"depends more than ever on rich people,\" said The Wall Street Journal. Households making more than $250,000 represent just the top 10% of all earners, but a new report from Moody's Analytics reveals they now account for nearly half of all consumer spending. That's a \"record in data going back to 1989,\" when that same cohort was responsible for a mere 36% of spending. The wealthy have increased their spending faster than the rate of inflation, said the Journal, but \"everyone else hasn't.\" The result is that rich folks are \"powering America's economy,\" said Quartz.\nCredit card delinquencies are rising\n\nThe American economy would appear to be \"humming along\" with low unemployment, said NBC News. But the economic picture looks worse \"under the hood\" as a \"stark\" wealth divide grows ever wider and the Americans who are not at the top of the food chain are \"facing increasing financial difficulties.\" For those folks, taking on debt is one of the prime ways of keeping up: Lower and lower-middle families have used credit cards to \"maintain purchasing power.\" They can't always keep up. Missed payments on credit card debt \"have grown to the point that they are now higher than pre-pandemic levels,\" said FICO's Can Arkali.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

People buying stuff accounts for 70% of the gross domestic product. But there is a distorting effect when that spending is weighted so heavily toward the rich. \"Maybe we'd have fewer people working in really high-end hotels and resorts and a lot more people working in elder care and child care,\" said Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute. And it's not clear that wealthy households can sustain the economy on their own. If their spending is \"being driven by record stock prices, I wouldn't count on that for sustaining long-term economic growth,\" said Moody's Mark Zandi.\n\nInequality is 'unifying but divisive'\nWidening income inequality could have political ramifications. The gap was a \"major driver behind Americans' votes in the 2024 election for both Democrats and Republicans,\" said Ipsos. About a third of 2024 voters said Donald Trump was best equipped to tackle the gap, while 39% gave the nod to Kamala Harris. Voters \"haven't yet unified behind a single party or candidate\" to solve the issue, making the topic \"unifying but divisive.\"\n\nThere is a link between \"economic inequality and the erosion of democratic norms and institutions,\" researchers Eli G. Raua and Susan Stokes said in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Even \"wealthy and longstanding democracies\" are vulnerable to democratic erosion as the income gap widens. The bigger the disparity in a democratic country, the \"more at risk it is of electing a power-aggrandizing and norm-shredding head of government.\"\n\nExplore More\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nJoel Mathis, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nJoel Mathis is a writer with 30 years of newspaper and online journalism experience.

De Niro's grandson Leandro did however pass away from an accidental drug overdose in July 2015. \n\nDe Niro insisted to Vanity Fair that despite comparisons between his character's 'age and whether he's fit - that had nothing to do with what happened with Biden.' \n\nThe Kamala Character \n\nEarly in the series, viewers learn that Mullen decided to forego another election campaign and stepped aside after four successful years in the White House. \n\nHis replacement Evelyn Mitchell, played by Angela Bassett, was seen by many as a portrayal of Kamala Harris, with some even saying she was written as woke Netflix's hopes for how the election would play out. \n\nMullen defers to his replacement as soon as he re-enters the White House to tackle the terrorist attack, and to show their closeness Mitchell even offers him a seat back at the Revolute Desk for their meeting. \n\nNewman even told Vanity Fair that upon its release this week, 'I'm obviously disappointed as a Democrat that we didn't win.' \n\nBut while some couldn't look past a black woman replacing the Biden-like character at the helm, Newman insisted the plotline was written long before Harris became the nominee, and he said he 'did not expect a black woman to become the candidate.’\n\nAlthough viewers were likely to see Angela Bassett’s character as a portrayal of Kamala Harris, Newman said she was ‘if anything, in my mind, more based on Michelle Obama or something.’\n\nNewman claimed that he hoped releasing the political show a month after the inauguration would mean it 'didn’t get lost in the jet wash of political reportage that’s going to come out.' \n\nBut the producer's hopes at avoiding the fray of politics has not come true, as viewers have gone as far as to claim the proximity of some aspects of the show to real life was Netflix's prediction for how the election may have played out. \n\nOne commenter noted De Niro's fervent support for the Democratic Party during the election and hatred of Donald Trump, saying it was 'very telling that De Niro... got behind a show where a president doesn't seek a second term, a black woman is elected instead, and he's now got dementia.' \n\n'I was waiting for the new president to start cackling like a hyena,' they added, noting Harris' distinctive laugh. \n\n'The real question: What did Netflix know, and when did they know it?' another said. \n\nConspiracy theories and media hosts \n\nConspiracy theories are rife in the series about the terror attack, and when Mullen first arrives at the scene of a subway disaster caused by the power grid going down early in the first episode, he is heckled by wild accusations. \n\n'This is an insurance scam,' one woman yells, before another claims the victims are all 'crisis actors.' \n\nThis theme ramps up after Mullen takes the job to investigate the terror attack, where he reluctantly takes on Patriot Act-like powers of surveillance and authority. \n\nRadio host Evan Green becomes his main public adversary, shown as an inflammatory commentator in the mold of right-wing figures such as Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan. \n\nWhile Zero Day's showrunners may reject direct comparisons to real figures, it is clearly intended to make a point about our fractured political scene today. \n\n'Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro - I don’t think that it’s exclusive to the right, but there is a certain type of independent provocateur that they seem to have perfected,' Newman said after the show's release. \n\n'It feels like it could happen. Based on how you feel about the election, this is either going to be an aspirational story about people who can find their way to the truth, even when it’s really hard, or a cautionary tale of the perils of the deep state and absolute power corrupting absolutely,' he said. \n\n'For me, it's a little bit of both.' \n\nThe show has divided opinions early in its release, with some critics praising the all-star cast and production value while others scathed it as overly political. \n\nIt also faced several poor reviews, with Slate describing it as 'a pundit-brained muddle designed to exploit national anxieties while studiously avoiding any hint of a point of view, riffing on recognizable figures but ignoring the context that produced them.' \n\nVulture described the story as 'meant for an era that did not come to pass' after the election. \n\n'Even if the show were narratively inventive or spectacularly acted, neither of which it is, the story of an elderly former president who might be suffering from debilitating dementia but hides it after a cyberterrorism attack to maintain his superpowerful position defending the U.S. from myriad attackers is an astonishing display of liberal hubris and immediately irrelevant,' the outlet scathed.","summary":"As soon as Netflix 's hit political miniseries Zero Day landed on screens over the weekend, viewers quickly drew comparisons to the end of Joe Biden 's turbulent presidency.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14434085/Zero-Day-Biden-DeNiro-Kamala-Netflix-show.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/25/19/95569079-0-image-m-25_1740510398651.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/13/8765503176866773237/1024x576_MP4_8765503176866773237.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-25 19:11:08","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":294295334,"title":"Technology staffers resign en masse, say they refuse to ‘dismantle critical public services’ for Musk and DOGE","text":"WASHINGTON — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.”\n\n“We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.”\n\nThe employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them.\n\nThe mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation.\n\n“Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,” Leavitt said. ”President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.”\n\nThe staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law.\n\nAll had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service.\n\nTrump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nAccording to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology.\n\n“Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.”\n\nEarlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote.\n\n“These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.”\n\nThose who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday.\n\n“We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.”\n\nThe slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government.\n\nAfter the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since.\n\nLast week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei.\n\n“This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage.\n\nStill, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff.\n\nOf the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues.\n\n“I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said.\n\nU.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector.\n\n“‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nUSDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology.\n\nIt has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people.\n\nLeavitt, the White House press secretary, is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on first- and fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.\n\n--Brian Slodysko and Byron Tau/The Associated Press","summary":"The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/02/technology-staffers-resign-en-masse-say-they-refuse-to-dismantle-critical-public-services-for-musk-and-doge.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/OOVTCZIU6FGZ5FTXZE45FQ7LMI.jpg?auth=2cf781bb9e924f2314c36b2b92bf4f72c094072ec27ceeb63e095ec2678a366c&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 19:10:28","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":294297364,"title":"Ramaswamy in fray for Ohio governor with Trump’s ‘total’ backing","text":"Washington, Feb 26 (SocialNews.XYZ) Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech billionaire, is running for Governor of Ohio State and he secured US President Donald Trump's \"complete and total endorsement\" right away.\n\n\"Today, I am honoured to announce that I am running to be the next governor of a great state at the heart of the greatest nation known to mankind -- the state where I was born and raised, the state where Apoorva and I raise our two sons today -- a state whose best days are still ahead,\" Ramaswamy said at a rally in Cincinnati on Monday.\n\nApoorva is Vivek Ramaswamy's wife and they have two children.\n\nShortly after his announcement, President Trump posted his support on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\n\"VIVEK RAMASWAMY is running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio.

And over the weekend, some Republican members of Congress faced angry constituents during visits to their districts.\n\nReporters from The New York Times asked dozens of people of both parties and around the country about Musk's role in the government so far. Here are some of the responses, from those who welcomed the swift actions, others who expressed concern and questioned Musk's authority, and some who seemed baffled by what the unelected businessperson was doing.\n\nDamian Conley, 51\n\nCaledonia, Wisconsin\n\nVoted for Trump in 2024\n\n\"If he's doing what he says he's doing -- looking for government cuts and waste -- I'm all for it, because our deficit can't keep going the way it's going again,\" Conley said of Musk.\n\n\"If he's, I don't know, skirting the system and trying to cut stuff that doesn't need to be cut, then I'm going to have problems with it.\" Conley, who voted for Barack Obama before sitting out 2016 and 2020, said he was still waiting and watching. \"It's too early in the presidency to know what's going happen.\"\n\nMatt Shockley, 54\n\nTucker County, West Virginia\n\nVoted for Trump\n\n\"He's just an employee,\" said Shockley of Musk: If he does a bad job, they'll fire him. \"Pay attention to what he's doing, not what he's saying and some stupid chain saw he's running around with.\"\n\nEmily Ainaire, 33\n\nDover, New Hampshire\n\nVoted for Kamala Harris\n\n\"I don't understand why there aren't more people questioning it and just letting it happen,\" she said. \"He was just dropped in there, and everybody said, 'Sure.'\"\n\nDavid Hite, 63\n\nBay Area, California\n\nVoted for Harris\n\n\"Is he the right guy or the wrong guy for that job? I don't know, but decisions have got to be made to reduce debt and spending,\" Hite said. \"I'd just like to see those decisions be made transparently, really well-explained, and the data that they're seeing more proactively available.\"\n\nMichael Borg, 61\n\nLoudoun County, Virginia\n\nVoted for Trump\n\n\"I think he's highlighted some things, like with USAID and other agencies that are important, but I also think that there are things that USAID has done that are good,\" said Borg, who initially opposed Trump in 2015 before supporting him in 2024. \"There's got to be a balance. So, the pendulum for decades was in one direction; now it's swung to another. And I think there'll be a balance.\"\n\nScott Meyer, 62\n\nDavis, West Virginia\n\nVoted for Trump\n\n\"I laughed so hard that they scream like they do about the ways that Elon's got access to your information,\" said Meyer. \"Did people forget he did PayPal and all that stuff, and everything else that they just freely gave up? They didn't think about, like, when you signed up on Zelle to put money in your phone. You just gave it all up, and you give it up daily, without a care in the world.\"\n\nMaggie Keane, 32\n\nThomas, West Virginia\n\nVoted for Harris\n\n\"He's not an elected official. It's very much overstepping.

He and Donald Trump are actively dismantling the government for their own twisted reasons.\"\n\nDannie Hinton, 60\n\nLouisville, Kentucky\n\nVoted for Trump\n\n\"I am torn,\" said Hinton, adding that while he trusts Trump, Musk sometimes scared him. \"He is a businessman and a genius, but I don't know what his intentions are. Everybody in politics needs to be more clear about what they want.\"\n\nElliot Baker, 75\n\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire\n\nVoted for Harris\n\n\"Elon Musk is a brilliant man, and we need brilliant men. He's a creator. He's created a bunch of stuff which has benefited us. But he has, I think, gotten caught up in his own comic book. And power, it does corrupt.\"\n\nKen Gordon, 64\n\nMonterey, California\n\nDid not vote\n\n\"If they didn't do it how they're doing it, would we have gotten anywhere?\" said Gordon, who voted for Trump in 2016, Biden in 2020, and did not vote in 2024. \"Or would we just be sitting around a table with everybody hemming and hawing and talking about doing something versus just going in there and slashing and burning what we need to slash and burn?\"\n\nHe added, \"If we're gentle, I don't know if it would work.\"\n\nBob Beaudette, 79\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\n\nVoted for Trump\n\n\"If he's really finding all this fraud, more power to him. Finding Social Security payments to people who are over 100 years, if someone still getting a paycheck, that's ridiculous,\" he said, acknowledging that some claims about abuse, such as the checks to centenarians, had been disputed. \"Hopefully the truth will emerge.\"\n\nNoah Beljaars, 21\n\nFlagstaff, Arizona\n\nVoted for Harris\n\n\"My dad voted Republican and has a more optimistic view of Musk. I think what he's doing is unconstitutional at best, and he's borderline fascist.\"\n\nTim Schock, 58\n\nSpring Valley, California\n\nDid not vote\n\n\"So it's OK for us to go and get audited, but it's not OK for the government to get audited? Too bad. Because I'm the employer, and they're the employees,\" said Schock, who said he would have voted for Trump but was out of state during the election. \"If I'm getting 45 cents out of every dollar I make going over to this-and-this project and that-and-that project, well, I have the right to know why and where it's going.

USDS was established over a decade ago to improve services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. \n\nAll of those resigning Tuesday previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service.\n\nThe slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favourite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. \n\nAttorneys general from several states led by Democratic officials have filed suit, arguing that DOGE is illegally accessing confidential information. A judge on Monday, in relation to a suit filed by unions representing federal workers, agreed to temporarily bar the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management from disclosing records containing sensitive personal information to DOGE representatives. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Greenbelt, Md., ruled that the Privacy Act was likely violated by disclosing people's personal information to DOGE without their consent.\n\nDespite its name, DOGE is not an official government department, which traditionally have been established by acts of Congress. Trump and Musk have said that \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars are already being saved, but they have not provided detailed support for those claims.\n\nDOGE published an updated list Monday of nearly 2,300 contracts that agencies terminated in recent weeks across the federal government. Data published on DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" shows that more than one-third of the contract cancellations, 794 in all, are expected to yield no savings. That's usually because the total value of the contracts has already been fully obligated, which means the government has a legal requirement to spend the funds for the goods or services it purchased and in many cases has already done so.\n\n\"It's like confiscating used ammunition after it's been shot when there's nothing left in it. It doesn't accomplish any policy objective,\" said Charles Tiefer, a retired University of Baltimore law professor and expert on government contracting law. \"Their terminating so many contracts pointlessly obviously doesn't accomplish anything for saving money.\"\n\nFederal workers experienced more confusion when Musk demanded they explain their recent accomplishments by the end of Monday or risk termination. Even as that happened, the Office of Personnel Management informed agency leaders that their workers were not required to respond by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. ET Monday.\n\n\"'Move fast and break things' may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don't go well, the damage is compartmentalized.

According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitor badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. \n\n\"Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,\" the staffers wrote in their letter. \"This process created significant security risks.\"\n\nEarlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off.

As a result, Bezos went on to work for Banker’s Trust. He worked there for two years and even held the position of vice president.\nAfter his stint with Banker’s Trust, Bezos went on to work for D.E. Shaw, which is a hedge fund company. During his tenure at D.E. Shaw, Bezos was exposed to the potential of the business opportunities on the Internet.\nJeff Bezos creates Amazon\nH. Darr Beiser/USA TODAY\nAs a result, Bezos had the idea of selling books online. After leaving the firm, due to disagreements regarding the idea, Bezos and his wife started their online bookstore called Amazon in 1994.\nAlthough Amazon was initially a bookstore, Bezos had expanded the company’s product lines with the hope that Amazon would be an “everything store.” Because of this, it wasn’t long before Amazon started selling other products such as music, movies, housewares, electronics, toys, and other merchandise.\nIn 1997, Bezos turned Amazon public with an IPO. In that same year, Bezos’ net worth reached $120 million. Due to the growth of online shopping, Bezos became a billionaire just a year later.\nWith the growth of the firm, Bezos and Amazon also launched Amazon Web Services in 2002. Amazon Web Services provided cloud computing platforms for various entities. In fact, Amazon Web Services secured a lucrative $600 million deal with the Central Intelligence Agency. Bezos also launched other subsidiaries such as Amazon Prime and Amazon Kindle.\nIn July 2024, Amazon won the NBA media rights deal starting in the 2025-26 season and running through 2036. The deal will pay the NBA $1.8 billion.\nBezos’ annual paycheck amounted to $81,000 as Amazon’s CEO and founder. The rest of his lucrative earnings stem from the company’s stock holdings. Since Amazon went public in 1997, Bezos has sold around $27 billion worth of Amazon stock. This includes a sale of six million shares in 2010 that was worth $793 million.\nJeff Bezos founds Blue Origin\nBut despite Amazon being his most successful venture, Bezos stepped down as the firm’s CEO in July 2021. Nevertheless, he still retained 10% all of Amazon’s shares, which still makes him the company’s largest shareholder. Thus, it still allows him sufficient power to be in the firm’s driver’s seat.\nAlthough Bezos is no longer the CEO of Amazon, he still is a billionaire with a lot of cash to spend. As one of the richest men in the world, Bezos invested $7.5 billion and founded Blue Origin. Blue Origin is a private spaceflight company that aims to send people to space. In 2021, Bezos announced that tourist sales to space reached $100 million worth of tickets.\nFurthermore, it was also revealed that Blue Origin was one of the firms to get contracted by NASA to develop concepts for NASA’s Artemis 3 mission. Unfortunately, the firm missed out on the $2.9 billion deal to SpaceX, a firm by billionaire rival Elon Musk.\nComing down without a fight, Bezos’s Blue Origin sued NASA, only to suffer a defeat in the court ruling. Nevertheless, NASA and Blue Origin are penciled to collaborate in their mission to land on the planet of Mars.\nJeff Bezos purchases the Washington Post\nBesides Blue Origin, Bezos also bought media outlet, The Washington Post in 2013. He shelled out $250 million. According to sources, Bezos purchased the news organization due to his belief in journalism as a critical aspect of democracy.\nIn 2024, Bezos came under a lot of criticism when he prevented the Washington Post editorial board from endorsing Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who ended up losing the race to Republican Donald Trump. Bezos’ decision caused Washington Post Editor-at-large Robart Kagan to resign along with many other staffers.\nBezos has also made popular investments in the past. Some of which include a $15 million investment to social media company Twitter, Inc. Moreover, he also invested in Synchron, a startup brain-computer interface firm.\nBased on reports, Synchron is geared towards helping people with paralysis to operate gadgets and technology with their mind. Bezos’ other investments include Business Insider, Airbnb, Inc., Ula, and Uber Technologies, Inc.\nIn 2019, Bezos suffered a huge loss to his net worth after divorcing his wife Mackenzie Scott. Scott received $36 billion worth of Amazon shares in resolution. But while Bezos lost a huge amount of money, he still has a $225.5 billion net worth, though the billionaire did announce that he was planning to donate his fortune in the future.\nWhile the donation is still up in the air, recent events have shown that Bezos is unlikely to donate that. Apart from starting a new life with reporter Lauren Sanchez, who he became engaged to in May 2023, Bezos also poured $500 million into a megayacht.\nNevertheless, were you at all stunned by Jeff Bezos’ net worth in 2025?","summary":"Jeff Bezos&#8217;s net worth in 2025 is $223 billion.

The workers were all originally part of the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) until a month ago, when the government agency was hijacked and rebranded as DOGE by President Donald Trump.\n\n“We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” the group wrote in a letter seen by the AP. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.”\n\nThe U.S. Digital Service was founded during Barack Obama’s presidency to work on vital government programs on the tech side. But Musk essentially created a Frankenstein agency by giving the USDS a new face and bringing in a bunch of teens and 20-somethings to rummage through the machinery of government, without any care for privacy rights or national security.\n\nDOGE has been taking a chainsaw to the federal government at the behest of Musk, a billionaire who runs the pseudo-agency despite the fact that court filings by the U.S. Department of Justice insist he’s not actually the group’s administrator. Just yesterday a federal judge again asked a government lawyer who was running DOGE, but the lawyer insisted they didn’t know.\n\nDOGE has been unilaterally canceling countless contracts across the government, while Musk tweets hundreds of times per day about how he’s rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. In reality, Musk has never presented evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse, instead highlighting programs he simply doesn’t like and cutting them without the proper authority to do so. And the billionaire continues to make his way through the government to slash and burn in a process that has touched every agency from the Department of Homeland Security to the National Park Service.\n\nAbout 40 people were laid off from DOGE/USDS shortly after Trump took power, including one politically active worker named Jonathan Kamens, who believes he was fired for endorsing Kamala Harris for president in 2024 and criticizing Musk’s approach with coworkers.\n\nIronically, the AP notes that many people who worked at the Digital Service were highly critical of the way that government operates and were doing their best to reform the system. But even people who wanted major changes to tech systems within the U.S. government believe Musk is acting recklessly.\n\nThe AP spoke with Cordell Schachter, who was working as the CIO at the U.S. Department of Transportation until a month ago when she was roped into the DOGE group of miscreants.\n\n“‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk.

Trump is the 47th President of the United States after surviving two assassination attempts. He’s also a businessman and television personality. \nTrump previously served as the 45th President of the United States of America before losing his reelection bid to former President Joe Biden in 2020. As a businessman, Trump is the principal owner of The Trump Organization. Here’s a closer look at Donald Trump’s net worth in 2025.\nWhat is Donald Trump’s net worth in 2025?: $5 billion (estimate)\n\nDonald Trump’s net worth in 2025 is $5 billion, according to Forbes. \nTrump was born in Queens, a borough of New York City. He studied elementary at Kew-Forest School. Afterwards, Trump went to the New York Military Academy for boarding school. Trump initially attended Fordham University, but he eventually transferred to University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. Here, he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics. \nWith a privileged background, Trump already started to earn money as early as 3 years old. Coming from his father’s wealth, Trump earned an annual salary of $200,000 per year in today’s dollars. By the time he was 8, Trump increased that salary to $1 million. \nIn 1999, when Fred Trump passed away, his children, including Donald Trump, received a total amount of $413 million in the form of inheritance and dividends. This amount also included a building sale that allowed Trump to earn approximately $177.3 million, which is $236.2 million in modern rates. \nDonald Trump begins working in Trump organization\nAfter graduating college, Trump worked for his father at The Trump Organization. The Trump Organization earned a lot of money from owning and renting housing in New York City neighborhoods such as Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens. \nGiven Trump’s background in real estate, he continued to launch projects under his name, one of which was the Commodore. Although the building initially took a $1.5 million loss due to an economic crisis, with the help of The Trump Organization, the building was renovated and largely improved its financial performance. \nEventually, Trump would sell 50 percent stake of the building to his partners, the Pritzker family. From the transaction, Trump earned a revenue of $142 million. \nFurthermore, Trump also launched the Trump Tower. The tower is a 58-foot skyscraper and residential building located on Fifth Avenue. While the Commodore and Trump Tower were some of his popular buildings, Trump’s other real estate properties include casinos, luxury hotels, and golf courses. \nIn New York City alone, Trump’s properties include Trump World Tower, Trump Place, 40 Wall Street, and Trump International. Among these, from 2014 to 2015 in 18.5 months, Trump International earned the most with $18.37 million based on The Wall Street Journal. \nOutside of New York, Trump also owns Trump Winery, Trump Doral, Trump Chicago, Trump International Golf Links in Scotland, and many more. It’s also worth noting other owners of hotels and condominiums using the Trump name also pay The Trump Organization in order to operate. \nIn 2016, it was revealed that Trump had assets amounting to $1.4 billion. In late 2022, Forbes went through all of Trump’s properties and put a value on them while also tracking his net worth over time. \nDonald Trump’s earnings from The Apprentice\nTrump has also appeared in various TV shows and movies, including Home Alone 2 and has also engaged in wrestling. But among his works in filmography, Trump found most success from starring in The Apprentice. Based on reports, Trump earned $197 million from the show. \nOn top of that, he earned another $230 million from licensing deals, sponsorships, and seminars. But more importantly, Trump’s appearances in The Apprentice also played a critical role in catapulting his successful presidential campaign. \nDonald Trump wins presidential election\n\nBREAKING: Donald Trump wins the 2016 presidential election, CBS News projects. #Election2016 https://t.co/H9n7JKbYS7 pic.twitter.com/1cL3uFtgXz\n— CBS News (@CBSNews) November 9, 2016\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Trump earned a stunning victory that established him as the 45th President of the United States. He also became the first U.S. president to be a billionaire. \nAs POTUS, Trump earned an annual salary of $400,000. While there were claims that Trump reportedly donated his paychecks to federal agencies, he still remained profitable from his properties and business dealings. In fact, under his presidency, foreign diplomats often paid for Trump’s hotel properties. \nDonald Trump loses reelection bid\nTrump’s presidential term came to an end in the 2020 Presidential Elections. Not only did Trump lose to Joe Biden, but he also became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice, although he was acquitted in both cases. Trump’s presidency featured numerous scandals, and that hasn’t stopped since he lost to Biden. \nIn the aftermath of the 2020 Election, there was the infamous Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol that featured Trump supporters entering the building, some violently, in an attempt to keep him in power. There have been ongoing investigations into what role Trump played in those efforts as he continues to deny he actually lost.\nFurthermore, Trump has been under fire in a classified documents scandal, with the FBI raiding his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida in 2022, which led to Trump’s arrest in June 2023.\nDonald Trump is indicted multiple times, convicted of felonies\n\nThe mug shot https://t.co/0Jz3xrC12M pic.twitter.com/EtcX0BXRjw\n— Jon Passantino (@passantino) August 25, 2023\n\nTrump become the first ex-president to be indicted with a New York grand jury voting to indict him for his role in a hush money payment case involving porn star Stormy Daniels.\nThe case went to trial, and Trump was convicted of all 34 counts for improper use of campaign funds, something that rarely results in more than a fine. Sentencing was delayed until after the 2024 election, and with Trump winning now, he is not expected to receive jail time, and if he does, it will certainly be appealed in a process that will probably take years.\nTrump’s supporters contended that this is all political theater trying to prevent Trump from winning the presidential election and now possibly an attempt to prevent him from his duties when he takes office again.\nIn June 2023, Trump was indicted in Florida for mishandling of classified documents. On Aug. 1, 2023, Trump was indicted once again, this time by a grand jury in Washington, D.C., led by special prosecutor Jack Smith. Both cases have now been dropped after Trump was declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election.\nOn Aug. 25, 2023, Trump was indicted a third time in Georgia on charges that he worked to overturn the election results there in 2020.\nAssassination attempts on Donald Trump during 3rd presidential campaign\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was escorted off stage by Secret Service during an incident at a Pennsylvania rally Saturday that seemed to leave him bleeding from near his right ear, though Trump’s campaign has said he is fine following the incident. https://t.co/DZCitea3bU pic.twitter.com/qMcIuYT7Yy\n— Forbes (@Forbes) July 13, 2024\n\nIn November 2022, Trump announced he was once again running for president. Despite the criminal cases and the backlash from the Jan. 6 incident, he easily won the GOP nomination.\nIn July 2024, Trump was at a rally in Pennsylvania when a man on a roof of a nearby building took eight shots at him with an assault rifle before Secret Service shot and killed the potential assassin. One bullet pierced Trump’s right ear but missed his skull.\nSecret Service jumped in to protect Trump, but he managed to get back up, pump his fist, and yell “fight, fight, fight!” before they rushed him off stage and to his vehicle. Unfortunately, three people in the crowd were shot, including one that died.\nIn September 2024, another man had an assault rifle with him at a Florida golf course that Trump was playing golf. Secret Service spotted him and chased him off before police eventually found and arrested him.\nDonald Trump wins second presidential term\nTrump originally was running against Biden, who was running for re-election but dropped out in July 2024 after a poor debate against Trump raised health and age concerns. Biden supported Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democrat nominee. Harris became the nominee but did not go through the normal primary process.\nTrump easily won the election, claiming 312 electoral college votes, including all seven “swing” states and the popular vote by more than 2 million votes. The Republicans also won control of the House of Representatives and the Senate, although by narrow margins.\nAfter Trump won the election, judges threw out his felony conviction and the other cases pending against him. Any conviction of Trump now that he’s president will have to come through the impeachment process. Due to extreme cold in Washington, D.C., Trump’s inauguration was moved indoors to the Capitol building on Jan. 20, 2025, which happened without incident.\nAs a businessman and politician, Trump has certainly emerged as one of the most polarizing figures in America. Nevertheless, were you at all stunned by Donald Trump’s net worth in 2025?","summary":"Donald Trump&#8217;s net worth in 2025 is $5 billion.

[+] partners.\n\nThrough Black History Month and all year long, I’m so grateful to know phenomenal students, graduates, faculty, and staff of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). These individuals are not only seeking the American Dream. They are driving it. They have been ever since February 1837, when the nation’s first HBCU, Cheyney University, was established.\n\nI often find that graduates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) don’t just show up as simply an alum of their school. They are pride-filled and powerful connectors who want to see the next generation of leaders emerge from everywhere. They are focused not on the “I” but on the “we.” They are their brothers’ and sisters’ keepers. The keepers of the dream. The ones whose eyes are on the prize.\n\nThis is on display in so many interactions. An HBCU alum might remember your family friend’s daughter, who is now a high school junior—is she planning to tour their alma mater and other HBCUs? Is their church member’s younger cousin still planning to apply? And definitely the elementary school teachers, like me, are reaching out to former students who are now in high school–do they know the steps to apply?\n\nThis generosity and openness is no accident. HBCUs don’t just provide a phenomenal education. They provide a powerful alumni network. They offer a strong community, and it’s a community that has been giving to each other and to the nation for centuries by unveiling merit and expanding opportunity.\n\nHBCUs build strong, generous networks\n\nSo many of our nation’s greatest dreamers, doers, thinkers, and leaders have attended HBCUs–like Chadwick Boseman, Samuel L. Jackson, Taraji P. Henson, Kamala Harris, Alice Walker, Thurgood Marshall, Oprah Winfrey, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., just to name a few. Many lesser-known leaders have made, or are making waves too–and they’re not keeping their knowledge, or their power, to themselves. They share what they know and they spread opportunity to all of America.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nElon Musk’s Federal Worker Emails: Musk Says Employees Will Get Second Chance To Respond If Trump Says So\n\n‘Don’t Buy The Dip’—Stark Bitcoin ETF Warning Adds To ‘Extreme’ Fed Price Crash Fear\n\nMedicaid Cuts Threaten A Key House Vote On Trump’s Agenda Today—Here’s Why The GOP Is Divided\n\nAt Braven, the organization I lead, we know that this type of generosity of network and community building can change the world. We see it all the time. I’ve written here about the power of mentorship. We know one-on-one support from alumni and faculty transforms students’ lives. And when we zoom out to the contribution of HBCUs at scale, their impact is undeniable. There are just around 100 HBCUs, but a full 40% of our nation’s Black engineers, 80% of Black judges, and 50% of Black professors at non-HBCUs graduated from an HBCU.\n\nThese schools are engines of economic mobility for their students, their families, their communities and our nation. They’ve also created billions in economic impact. And while HBCUs typically enroll Black students, they are and have always been open to all students.\n\nHBCUS are engines of economic mobility\n\nI’m not surprised HBCU alums are eager to celebrate their schools and want to share their legacies with the younger generations. HBCUs are not only academic accelerators but also economically transformational for students. Despite ongoing conversations around the value of a bachelor’s degree, they remain a strong investment.\n\nThe nonprofit UNCF has looked at this for HBCUs in particular. They’ve calculated an economic and social mobility rate for colleges, which measures the share of students at that school who move from the lowest 40% of income-earning families and enter the top 60%. They found that the average mobility rate of HBCUs is more than double the national average for colleges overall. This means more young people are entering their HBCU from a low-income background and graduating heading to the middle class. We know that HBCU graduates are set up to earn 57% more over their lifetime than if they didn’t get their college degree.\n\nHBCUs bring billions in national impact\n\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities aren’t just engines of economic mobility and wealth for students. They are engines of economic success for the nation at large, preparing talent that can fill critical jobs in every sector and every industry. The UNCF has measured this, too; if HBCUs were a Fortune 500 Company, they’d be in the top 50 for job creation. Historically Black Colleges and Universities collectively create over 136,000 jobs in their regional economies–more than the number of jobs at big companies like Dell and Intel. They also bring in $16.5 billion annually in economic impact. This economic engine and job-creation from HBCUCs drives our country and multiplies the American Dream.\n\nHBCUs need investment\n\nDollar for dollar, HBCUs are simply one of the best higher education investments that can keep our country strong. They have built that economic impact, fueled those economic mobility rates, and created their powerful alumni community. They have done all this even with far fewer resources than many other colleges and universities. Between 2015 and 2019, for instance, Ivy League schools, on average, received 178 times more funding from philanthropic foundations than HBCUs. So it’s perhaps no surprise that HBCUs’ endowments are roughly 70% less than other schools.\n\nBraven is proud to partner with HBCUs\n\nBraven is a proud partner of two HBCUs, Spelman College and Delaware State University (DSU). Through Braven, both colleges offer a career-accelerating course that helps students write resumes, grow their networks and connect to strong job and internship opportunities. Since partnering with Braven in 2021, the Spelman Pathways: Creating Your Path to Life and Career Excellence initiative has served over 1,700 Fellows and provided them with the skills, networks, confidence, and experiences to secure strong new opportunities for their careers.\n\nTogether, a program like Braven and an HBCU can transform not just the economic prospects of students, but their sense of self. Hannah Baumgardner, who experienced Braven at Spelman in 2023, told us this:\n\n“Thanks to the Braven experience at Spelman College, I have a newfound appreciation of myself, my potential, and my power. Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to shape my professional self into an unwavering force, a woman certain of how she can enhance a team and a workplace. I now have fierce confidence and a network of peers and mentors to rely on for guidance, encouragement, and support.”\n\nHannah Baumgardner\n\nI am so glad Hannah feels this way. She had all this power and potential inside her already. Braven simply helps enhance the impact of her Spelman education, which has helped her become that “unwavering force” she describes. And Black history, like HBCUs themselves, is full of those “unwavering forces” and powerful leaders. So this Black History month, like every month, I’m grateful for the immense contributions of Black people to keep our nation great. I can’t wait to meet the next generation of leaders, like Hannah, who are graduating from HBCUs. They confirm my deep belief that our history is proud and the future for all of America is bright. Thanks to the legacy and impact of HBCUs, it is full of young leaders who are “unwavering forces,” too.\n\nBraven additionally has opportunities for those who have graduated from any college to get involved. To help impact students' lives and serve as a transformative role model, volunteer to become a Leadership Coach or Professional Mentor today.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are engines of economic mobility and wealth for students and the nation.

It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation.\n\n“Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,\" Leavitt said. \"President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.”\n\nThe staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law.\n\nAll had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service.\n\nTrump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nAccording to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics.

APPLE UNVEILS HISTORIC $500B INVESTMENT IN US MANUFACTURING This is not the first time technology has sparked controversy over what was perceived as a slight against President Donald Trump. A video went viral in September showing the Amazon Alexa virtual assistant explaining reasons for voting for then-Vice President Kamala Harris while refusing to provide similar responses for Trump. Representatives from the online shopping giant briefed staffers from the House Judiciary Committee about the incident and explained that Alexa uses pre-programmed manual overrides created by Amazon’s information team to respond to certain prompts from users, according to a source familiar with the briefing. For example, Alexa would tell users who asked for reasons to vote for Trump or then-President Joe Biden, \"I cannot provide content that promotes this specific political party or candidate.\" Prior to the release of the viral video, Amazon had only programmed manual overrides for Biden and Trump, failing to add Harris because very few users were asking Alexa about reasons to vote for her, the source said. REP. JIM JORDAN REQUEST AMAZON BRIEFING OVER ALEXA'S TRUMP CENSORSHIP Amazon became aware of the issue with Alexa's pro-Harris responses within one hour of the video being posted on X and going viral. The company fixed the issue with a manual override for such questions about Harris within two hours of the video going up, according to the source. Before the fix was deployed, Fox News Digital prompted Alexa with questions asking for reasons to vote for Harris and received a response saying that \"she is a female of color with a comprehensive plan to address racial injustice and inequality throughout the country.\" TRUMP, MUSK ENDORSE VIVEK RAMASWAMY FOR OHIO GOVERNOR The source said that Amazon apologized for Alexa's display of political bias at the briefing and said that while it has a policy that aims to prevent Alexa from \"having a political opinion\" or \"bias for or against a particular party or particular candidate… obviously we are here today because we did not meet that bar in this incident.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The tech giant has since audited its system and has manual overrides in place for all candidates and a number of election-related prompts.

Zero Day offers both a skeptical and aspirational answer to the question.\n\n Netflix‘s conspiracy political thriller starring Robert De Niro, which is now streaming all six episodes, tackles truth and accountability in a post-truth era. A crippling cyberterrorism attack called a zero day event (a cyber breach targeting unknown vulnerabilities) downs dozens of U.S. systems for an entire minute, causing widespread catastrophe and the deaths of more than 3,000 people. Former President George Mullen (played by De Niro), who is described as being the last nonpartisan POTUS, leads a Zero Day Commission to uncover, by any means necessary, how and why this happened, and prevent it from happening again.\n\n What Mullen discovers is that the zero day perpetrators are not from foreign soil. The attack was home grown — too close to home for Mullen. The co-conspirators were a group hailing from Big tech, like CEO Monica Kidder (Gaby Hoffman), and the U.S. government — including the Speaker of the House (played by Matthew Modine) and Mullen’s own daughter, Rep. Alexandra Mullen (Lizzy Caplan). \n\n An ideological Alexandra tells her father that her intentions were actually to unite the broken country. She rails about how America is so divided that Congress hasn’t passed a single piece of legislation in 18 months. She never intended for anyone to get hurt. Dreyer similarly explains that they wanted to cut off the political fringe on both sides, expose a vulnerability that has been mistaken for freedom and then restore “a shaken faith in our ability to govern.”\n\n Mullen is faced with an impossible choice when it comes to sharing his commission findings. Despite a plea from the current president (Angela Bassett) to not reveal the full truth, Mullen lays it all out in front of Congress and Americans watching at home. He reads a speech written to him by his daughter, who has decided to turn herself in. He then returns to an empty home, his wife (Joan Allen) having left him, with the idea of losing two children (after they lost their son to an overdose) being too much to bear. \n\n “George Mullen does the right thing, and it costs him everything except his integrity,” co-creator, co-showrunner and executive producer Eric Newman explains to The Hollywood Reporter of the ending and its larger takeaway. “The people who want these jobs to govern us have to understand that that is what is asked of them.”\n\n Both Newman and co-creator/executive producer Noah Oppenheim, the former president of NBC News, who created the series with New York Times journalist Michael S. Schmidt, agree that “the mechanism for which we determine truth is collectively broken,” which makes their ending even more compelling. Zero Day also intentionally doesn’t identify political parties, so as to not distract from the series. “One of the themes that we wanted to tackle from the very beginning was the question of what people in power are willing to do when they think they’re saving the country,” adds Oppenheim.\n\n When speaking to THR about his first TV role, De Niro agreed on the nonpartisan message. “It had to be more about an honesty between people in order to get anything done,” he said of his character. The limited series begs the question of how Zero Day‘s version of America will pick up the pieces after this crisis, but Newman and Oppenheim won’t be plotting that future. “It was always important to Bob that his character makes a sacrifice to do the right thing, which makes it almost impossible for him to go on in any leadership capacity,” says Newman of the series truly being limited. De Niro also compared filming Zero Day to shooting three movies at once, and said he wasn’t sure how quickly he’d be returning to TV.\n\n So, the minds behind Zero Day now offer viewers a chance to digest and think about the version of America they put forth. Below, in a chat with THR, Newman and Oppenheim discuss the parallels to real-life politicians and others in their orbit — some they predicted, but many they couldn’t possibly have — while revealing the research that went into their cautionary tale in hopes it ends up being aspirational.\n\n I understand that Zero Day came out of a meeting you two had years ago, when Noah was still president of NBC News. Can you tell me when that meeting was and your seed for the show?\n\n ERIC NEWMAN: November of 2021, we had a meeting. At the time, Noah had already had a number of conversations with his childhood friend Mike Schmidt about a story he had been trying to run down about an investigation that was hindered by someone’s mental acuity. I had asked Noah about where we were going as a country with our respective relationship with the truth, and his answer was alarming to me. He said that what should be objective fact becomes subjective, and there are competing truths that, despite being mutually exclusive, somehow coexist because people refuse to see it any other way. The combination of that idea, and the idea that Mike and Noah had been discussing, created the perfect story device to tell this story about the truth in a post-truth era.\n\n You then pitched the show to Robert De Niro. How much of the idea was formed when you brought it to him?\n\n NEWMAN: Bob got it instantly. We met Bob and sat down over dinner and told him the story, and he instantly was like, “That sounds great. I’d like to read that.” And, by the way, if I had a dollar for every time someone said, ”I can’t wait to read that,” I’d be a rich man. But in his case, he read it immediately and he loved it. He understood completely what we were trying to say and the themes the show presents and posits.\n\n So, you had your former president with De Niro’s George Mullen, and then you would go on to cast Angela Bassett as the show’s current president. Who were both of these presidents based on?\n\n NOAH OPPENHEIM: Neither of them are based on any one individual, but they both tap into important themes and emotional truths that we were trying to represent in a character. President Mullen is a figure who the country turns to in the aftermath of this catastrophic attack. People are terrified, seeking reassurance and comfort. You needed an actor who could immediately embody that dignity, reassurance and confidence. There’s a pretty short list of people who can do that. Bob brings with him this long history with the audience so that immediately when you see him walk into the Oval office and he is handed the weight of this responsibility you think, “That makes sense. Here’s a guy who can handle the task of recomforting the country, and who also has the inherent toughness to track down the truth.” That’s what also makes it so unsettling, when you start to see the cracks and you realize he may not be the guy everyone thinks he is.\n\n With Angela, you needed a current president who had the self confidence to hand the reins over to somebody else in this moment, and who had so much else going on. She has an agenda in the show that is not immediately clear. When she hands over the investigation to President Mullen, she has the reasons that she states openly for doing so, and then she has the reasons that she’s holding back from him and from the audience. So that is somebody who immediately when you see them in the Oval office behind the desk you think, “this person belongs there.” They are incredible in all the scenes they have together, you feel like you have two titans going head to head.\n\n I’m very curious about all of the research that went into plotting Zero Day. I’ve read that veteran Washington staffers consulted on the series, and that De Niro brought in Cold War-era CIA sources for his preparation as Mullen. \n\n OPPENHEIM: What Eric has done in all of his shows, from Narcos to Painkiller, is that he’s really made a commitment to authenticity. He was hugely insistent that this show reflect that as well, even though it’s taking place in a fictional world. We’ve had the benefit that I’ve spent this other life and career in journalism. I’ve spent 25 years covering politics and so I’m fortunate enough to know and have been present behind closed doors in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in government agencies. Then Mike Schmidt still to this day covers politics. So we really tapped into all of our networks of experts currently and formerly serving government officials to find out, how would this actually unfold? What would these conversations really sound like? We wanted it to be as real as possible.\n\n In the series, in the days and weeks after the attack, we see that America is on the brink of societal collapse. In your research and in making this show, what’s scarier: the world of Zero Day or our current world?\n\n [Both laugh]\n\n NEWMAN: We talk about that all the time. Because I’m not a pessimist but I try to be self-aware, I’m thinking, what is the thing where we could come up short? Is the reality that we face scarier than the reality of our show? I think no, but we could get there pretty quickly. The pace at which things move and things happen, and the cascading nature of shit going south, anything can happen. There have been 20 things that if you had told me in 1999 were going to happen in the next 25 years I would have said you’re out of your mind, you don’t know what you’re talking about. And here we are.\n\n Eric, how did having partners in Noah and Michael S. Schmidt (co-creator and EP), given their political journalism backgrounds, help you fact check. What were some things you changed?\n\n NEWMAN: There were numerous things that we would get right after [these conversations]. Noah knows this world better than anyone. Between Noah, Mike, Eric Schulz, who worked in communications for Obama and continues to, and Jeremy Bash [former chief of staff at the CIA and the Pentagon under Obama], there were a lot of people who were able to say, “Yeah, that’s not how it works.” We are replicating a world that exists right now and so there’s no shortage of people who can offer their consulting services.\n\n OPPENHEIM: If anything, we’ve been most surprised by the number of things we were writing that felt, at the time, were a little bit of a leap. Like, here were going to take some creative liberty for the purpose of entertainment and drama, and now those things have actually played out in the real world. Literally half a dozen instances where writing it we were like, “Ok, this is where we’re going to have some fun with it.” And then we proceeded to see the real world catch up to that.\n\n I was going to ask you about that because you have the parallel between De Niro’s cognitive state being questioned and former President Joe Biden stepping back from reelection. [Note: Zero Day wrapped filming in June of 2024 before Biden would ultimately step down to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris.] Are there other examples you can share, particularly with this show coming out so soon after President Trump’s reelection?\n\n OPPENHEIM: We just came out of a presidential election where we had two of the oldest candidates in history, so the idea of people in power facing cognitive challenges is not specific to President Biden. However, the way in which that came front and center during the campaign was certainly something we could not have anticipated when we were writing Mullen’s storyline. Obviously, the controversy and dilemma over what happens when the child of a powerful person commits a crime and then their parent is in a position to potentially save them from the consequences, is something we’ve seen play out in a really interesting way. And then, one of the themes that we wanted to tackle from the very beginning was the question of what people in power are willing to do when they think they’re saving the country. How many norms they’re willing to blow through and how many laws they are willing to break if they feel like their cause is righteous? Those are both timeless questions, and also very timely.\n\n NEWMAN: There’s a great quote that I love that originated from Goethe, the German philosopher, which is that if you give someone a choice between disorder and injustice, they will chose injustice every time. What people do in crisis, what they’re willing to do and, perhaps more significantly, what they’re willing to have done to them when their order is threatened and when they’re scared. When whatever system of government, likely some supremacy, is threatened, people will do anything. They will give up almost anything to feel security. Nothing that anyone does in our show do we believe is something someone wouldn’t do. And not only would they do it, they would have a justification that in the right light would make sense to you.\n\n Some of the characters are very of this exact moment, particularly with the tech leaders.\n\n NEWMAN: Obviously, we don’t want any people in the tech world making any decisions about what we can and can’t do, and I certainly wouldn’t want anyone having access to my tax records or whatever, but the Elon Musk thing is a bit of a surprise.\n\n OPPENHEIM: If anything, what this has shown is the extent to which history rhymes. There’s this notion that you see these patterns repeating themselves and whether it was the robber barons of the 19th century or these tech billionaires of today, this tension between the rich and powerful in this country and our democratic institutions has always existed. It’s been interesting to see how an idea that we were writing about three years ago is playing out today. That doesn’t mean that we’re prophetic in any way, that’s just been a throughline of American history.\n\n You tackle fears around Big tech, disinformation, a divided country, distrust in the government… but then you deliver this aspirational ending that we don’t typically see in political thrillers. Is Zero Day a cautionary tale or is it hopeful? Where do each of you land on that and what you want people to take away?\n\n NEWMAN: For me, it’s undeniable that the mechanism for which we determine truth is collectively broken, or at least we’re using a different metric or translator. I believe what that means is that the pressure is on what do you do with that information, your truth. The right thing becomes even more important. Actually being able to make a difficult decision, do the right thing, even when you’re not entirely sure what the truth is, there’s still an objectivity in that. The character of George Mullen does the right thing, and it costs him everything except his integrity. The people who want these jobs to govern us have to understand that that is what is asked of them.\n\n OPPENHEIM: I’m so glad you found it to be an optimistic ending, because that is the intent. As Eric said, as broken as our institutions and our media landscape may be, each and every one of us does still have a moral compass. All of us make a series of decisions every day when we wake up in the morning. It could be how we conduct ourselves when we go to the grocery store or when we go pick up our kids at school. But all those decisions, small ones, add up and we can be decent and kind and generous to our neighbors if we choose.\n\n There’s a message for everyone in this show, but it does feel like De Niro’s character is speaking to politicians saying, “This is the person you could be.” Has there been any buzz in political circles about the show and do you hope politicians watch?\n\n NEWMAN: Noah knows this world better than I do. I know a few of these people. I don’t know what they watch but yes, of course. You hope it prompts some conversation. We’re doing press now and people are asking interesting questions about how we see art and what art’s role is in times like this when there is such a disconnect. Our hope is that people will watch it without feeling it’s political and understand the message, even if it’s from their own lens.\n\n It’s something I’ve said to you a number of time about Narcos, the thing that really surprised and pleased me about Narcos was that from either side — the side that believes the drug war is a battle we have to win and can win, or the side, like me, that believes in the futility of the drug war and the fact that we will never solve a problem by attacking the supply and ignoring the demand — both sides were able to be educated to the extent of the proliferation of cocaine and how much we are importing into this country. Similarly, they might not agree on how to do it but I don’t think you can watch our show and not think there’s something wrong with our civilization that we’ve moved this far away in terms of our interpretation of the truth. That’s my hope. Whether they are politicians or voters, they look at it and go, “Wow that does feel like our world and we need to start to address this in some way.”\n\n OPPENHEIM: The reality is that the places where these conversations would have been had 25 years ago no longer exist. Or they don’t exist in such a way that you can have a conversation between two sides where anyone is persuaded. So ironically, for better or worse, a thriller on Netflix that is built first and foremost to be entertaining is probably one of the few places where you are going to get people with all sets of beliefs all having a shared experience. Maybe that’s a place where people can start to collectively think about the problems that we confront.\n\n You don’t identify political parties in Zero Day, was that an easy decision to make or did you debate it?\n\n OPPENHEIM: It was an easy decision because we’re not making any partisan statement with the show. Our hope was to build something that plays as a really compelling whodunnit, that plays as a propulsive thriller and keeps people entertained through six episodes. Trying to put partisan labels on individual characters frankly is a distraction from that. It’s also about multi-dimensional people and, having been around politicians as long as I have, there are very few of them who fall cleanly into the bucket of hero or villain. They are all complicated and if you put a partisan label on somebody it’s an obstacle to complexity.\n\n We never get an answer on if President Mullen was cognitively declining, if he was poisoned by a neurological weapon or if he was simply cracking under immense pressure. Why did you leave that open ended?\n\n NEWMAN: Like the theme of our show, it is open to interpretation. You can see what you want to see and it doesn’t change where we end up. It was an interesting experience for me. You have to make a decision when you write something and at some point, Noah and I decided that it was happening. Whether we ever truly confirm it and provide incontrovertible evidence that it’s happening or not, for us it was happening. When I watch it now, it’s an interesting thing. Even though we decided, I kind of feel like it wasn’t happening!\n\n OPPENHEIM (Laughs)\n\n NEWMAN: Taxi Driver is one of my favorite movies ever. There’s a sequence at the end that I’m convinced is a dream. I had the opportunity to ask Paul Schrader, who wrote Taxi Driver, about the scene. I said, “Was that a dream?” He said, “No, it’s not a dream.” And honestly, I don’t agree with him! I think that’s the way we experience stories. There is some subjectivity to interpretation.\n\n OPPENHEIM: It’s not only how we experience stories but how we experience life. Two people can go into a room, have a conversation and emerge with a completely different understanding of what took place inside that room. You multiply that at scale and you add in the technological revolution that’s taken place in the last 20 years and that’s what’s landed us here. You could take even the same set of facts to some extent and, depending on how you arrange them — which ones you omit, which ones you prioritize — come away with a completely different understanding of what has happened. Like Eric said, whether or not it was a weapon or whether or not it was something going on inside Mullen, it doesn’t change the impact it had on the course of the investigation. And even if we said one thing, if it were convenient or comforting to a group of people to believe the other thing, they would believe the other thing.\n\n What did you base Proteus on? The show’s neurological weapon.\n\n OPPENHEIM: It’s inspired by the phenomenon dubbed Havana syndrome, which is these American diplomats beginning with the U.S. and then in Cuba waking up with symptoms that mirrored brain trauma. It’s happened subsequently in Vienna and in locations all over the world impacting CIA officers and senior U.S. diplomats, and there’s an ongoing and still open debate within the U.S. intelligence community whether this is the result of most likely Russia using some kind of neurological weapon against government officials or whether it’s some sort of mass hysteria or some sort of other explanation. But it’s still very much a heatedly debated topic and a very real thing.\n\n Zero Day is a limited series. You leave us in a place where you could certainly follow how the country picks back up after this crisis. Is this series definitely done?\n\n NEWMAN: Right now it feels like we said what we need to say and could only muck it up by doing more! We may one day call each other and be like, “What if this happens…?” It was always important to Bob that, at the end of the day, his character makes a sacrifice to do the right thing, which makes it almost impossible for him to go on in any leadership capacity. It’s a great world though, we had fun in it. So I think we definitely would revisit the political thriller conspiracy story. We’d do anything with Bob because we love him. It was a great cast and team. We loved working with [Zero Day director] Lesli Linka Glatter, she’s truly the hardest working woman in show business. It’s not an easy thing to say we wouldn’t continue, but at the same time, no immediate plans.\n\n When did you write the finale?\n\n NEWMAN: We were supposed to shoot in June of ‘23 and the strike derailed us on our first day, so we had written the finale certainly I think by the spring of ‘23.\n\n Did you make any changes when you came back to filming?\n\n OPPENHEIM: Not dramatic. Nothing major, no.\n\n When you imagine the next day after Zero Day ends, is it a country healing after the truth or one that remains divided?\n\n OPPENHEIM: (Laughs) We might have two different opinions about this. Looking at the world that we live in, I think you wake up the next day and Speaker Dreyer [Matthew Modine] is a hero to half the country. He claims he’s been falsely accused. I think you have a media ecosystem that is claiming this was all George Mullen’s fever dreams and that he’s maligning his political opponents. It’s possible that Alexandra Mullen [Lizzy Caplan], whether she wants to be or not, has become a hero and a martyr, and I think you have another set of people who are trying to fight back but who have lost the moral high ground because of the abuses of the Zero Day Commission and probably have much less of a leg to stand on in trying to combat that. Doesn’t look pretty to me!\n\n NEWMAN: I’m slightly more optimistic. I agree with everything Noah says except I think that in the center of it all is a strengthening of the middle. Certainly, if you’re inclined to believe those are the bad guys and we’re the good guys, you’ve calcified further into that position. And the converse is true. But I also think there is a group in the middle that’s like, “Wow, we got a problem here. This is a constitutional crisis.” Our favorite characters to write were Roger Carlson, Jesse Clemons’ slightly scumbaggy lobbyist, and Matthew Modine because he’s kinda right. There’s nothing he says that you don’t say, “Yeah I would kind of like to see that. If you told me that you’ll get rid of your fringe crazies and we’ll get rid of our fringe crazies and everything will be fine, I like that idea. I can support that.” There’s no way to do that without undermining the very thing that we would be saving. It’s that old Vietnam adage that you have to burn the village to save it, and that just doesn’t work.\n\n OPPENHEIM: I like your optimism, though, about the middle being reinvigorated. The funny thing about leadership is that you don’t know where it’s necessarily going to come from next. That is the beauty of imagining what the world looks like the day after: the character who could emerge from the aftermath who has watched this all happen and realized, “If we don’t do something to fix all of this, we’re going off a cliff.” And how that person gets a handle on things and has their voice heard.\n\n Comparisons have been made to your characters: Alexandra Mullen (Lizzy Caplan), a rising AOC-esque star; Evan Green’s (Dan Stevens) radical host, like Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro; and Angela Bassett’s President Mitchell, Kamala Harris. Are these characters more like amalgamations? \n\n OPPENHEIM: There aren’t any one-for-one comparisons for any of them. They’re all composites and all inspired by a collection of people.\n\n NEWMAN: That was all by design. Any time we have in an interview suggested someone, it was more in answer to someone being put forward. The last thing we wanted was someone to say, “That’s so clearly so and so,” and that includes the tech space. There are a variety of types in the tech space, from Peter Thiel to Elon Musk, who do different things, but the relationship between tech and politics is the same as the relationship between John D. Rockefeller and politics, and Andrew Carnegie and politics, and so and so.\n\n OPPENHEIM: It’s also important to say that these characters are not archetypes designed to represent specific forces in our government or in our culture. They’re hopefully people. Alexandra Mullen is the daughter of a beloved former president. That’s a unique burden to bear if you are trying to carve your own path in public service, and that’s not something that I think there is a specific real-world parallel for.\n\n Zero Day is now streaming on Netflix.","summary":"Netflix's political thriller starring Robert De Niro imagines what would happen if our fragmented country faced a major terrorist attack.

She’s looking down on me right now. Smiling.

Will Anyone Else? | Opinion","text":"Something is fundamentally broken in America. And you can get a hint of it in the way Americans think about and interact with news about the world. Especially news about politics.A fascinating new study from public opinion firm Change Research puts its finger on the problem: \"navigating a sea of bias, sensationalism, and misinformation exhausts and annoys significant portions of voters.\" The researchers show that it's this basic aggravation with the way we get information that is at the core of a lot of voter behavior. Americans have grown weary; not just of the news, but also of the entire miserable chore of learning about it.Which explains the stunning statistic that the share of Americans saying they closely follow news dropped 13 points in the past eight years, and that today, only one-third of us pay any real attention to the world around us. Like singles on a dating app wading through a sea of creeps, duds, and weirdos until they quiet-quit the dating pool out of sheer exasperation, people are opting out of news out of frustrated fatigue.Except that when Americans swipe left on current events, the consequences are a lot more disastrous. President Donald Trump actually won the last election only because so few voters were paying attention: voters who said they barely follow news favored him by 19 points in 2024; those who follow news \"a great deal\" favored Vice President Kamala Harris by 6.Those Americans seeing the past month of chaos, rising prices, surrender to our enemies, and the trail of death and disease that Trump has created might be screaming, like Adam Sandler in The Wedding Singer, that they wish all of this had been brought to their attention yesterday... as in, before the election. Except it was. Anyone taking even a little bit of interest knew this was coming.As voters in a republic who are supposed exercise self-determination, that's on us. Mostly. But it's also on the media. Because they're the ones who are supposed to help the citizenry make informed decisions so that we can govern ourselves. And they're the ones that have made reading news feel like jumping into the trash compactor in Star Wars: wading through muck, waiting for some cyclopean alien eel to jump out and drown you. What a wonderful smell we've discovered.Is there any way out of the cesspool? It depends on whether media organizations figure out the secret.What they need to see is that the thing that is ultimately broken in America is trust. Stacks of research show that trust in institutions has been cratering and news media are among the biggest losers in the great American confidence die-off.But there are a few clever media entities that are thriving right now, and it's highly likely that a major reason is that they've recognized ways to address some of the root causes—perceptions of bias, sensationalism, misinformation, and financial motivations—behind people's loss of faith.For example, the Philadelphia Inquirer is tackling reader skepticism of media motivations by leaning into their not-for-profit ownership as a contrast to their competitors. They've successfully branded themselves as a paper that's more willing to shoot straight with readers because they're less driven by the balance sheet. That differentiation directly attacks one of the biggest sources of loss of reader trust—the feeling that what they're reading is dripping with sensationalism. Articles look less like click-bait if the newspaper doesn't seem like it has quite the same need to chase clicks.Substack is following a different trust-based model, and it's clearly resonating. It allows subscribers to develop a direct, social media-like connection with creators, so they can feel like they are getting more unvarnished analysis with less suspicion of platform owner bias. Creators also often mix the DIY Substack vibe with the name-brand professionalism of big-name-media by straddling both worlds. The smarter media outlets have seen this as a good thing, a win-win way to build greater reader trust for themselves by tapping into the creators' direct audience connection. Both of us are becoming such straddlers, and one of us (Schecter), a former Daily Beast columnist, is literally starting his own Substack right now (feel free to come give feedback on this article in his 12-hour livestream happening today, or hit Robison's).To be sure, this list is neither complete nor perfect, and these steps are necessary but may not be sufficient. But the take-home is clear: if news media is going to reverse the tune-out trend—which is something this country desperately needs—the table stakes are being much clearer about getting biases out in the open and helping people feel like they at least know what they're getting.And they can't just hope that it will happen; Walter Cronkite ain't walking through that door, so they've got to work for it... If they do, the marketplace may even reward them.Matt Robison is a writer, podcast host, and former congressional staffer.Cliff Schecter is a columnist and Democratic consultant.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.","summary":"Something is fundamentally broken in America.

It suggests the agency’s spending be refocused to better combat China. \n\nTrump’s swath of executive orders from behind the resolute desk are also reflected in the tracker. \n\nSo far, the tracker estimates Trump has achieved 88% of the objectives put before the Executive Office of the President, including removing words relating to “sexual orientation and gender identity … from every federal rule, and agency regulation” and replacing the staff on the National Security Council. \n\nWhile just an estimate, the Project 2025 tracker helps show just how intertwined the current administration is with the Heritage Foundation’s long-term goals for America. \n\nProduced by Reddit users rusticgorilla and mollynaquafina, it was originally posted on r/Keep_Track, part of the community’s effort to produce “non-partisan” and “truth-seeking” coverage of the second Trump administration. \n\nOne of the tracker’s creators, rusticgorilla, explained their motivation behind the tracker, pointing to Trump’s “supposed” flip-flopping on his attitudes to Project 2025.\n\n “Last year, Trump attempted to distance himself from the conservative blueprint, saying that his campaign had ‘nothing to do with Project 2025‘ and that he had ‘no idea who is behind it.’”\n\n“Today, his administration is stuffed full of Project 2025 contributors, and his executive orders are ripped straight from the playbook’s pages.”\n\nInternet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

He said Americans were likely not waiting around for lawmakers and commentators to make the same old arguments to criticize the president. \"They’re tired of it, and our Democratic voters are tired of watching us moan and groan to cover up our impotency out of power. They want us to be smarter than that,\" he added.

Revealed: her overheard date night conversation with Travis Kelce that will send fans into a frenzy","text":"A little over two weeks ago, on the eve of the Super Bowl, Taylor Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce headed out for a pre-game date night, perhaps to settle the nerves.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs tight end chivalrously pulled out a chair for his superstar girlfriend, fellow diners at Lilette – a trendy French restaurant near the Mississippi in New Orleans – spotted Kelce gently stroking Swift's lower back.\n\nThen, as the couple – who were joined for the evening by Kelce's teammate Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany – ordered burger and fries, conversation turned to an important topic: children.\n\n'There was lots of baby talk,' a source told the Daily Mail, 'since Patrick and Brittany have just had their latest [child], Brittany was showing pictures and they were all talking about how happy they were.' \n\nIt's a delicious morsel of gossip that will no doubt send Swift's army of devoted fans searching for meaning.\n\nFor now, with her 149-date, 21-month Eras Tour done and dusted, there has been much speculation over what the busiest woman in pop will do next.\n\nThe truth, as the Mail can reveal, may surprise those millions of fans who have become accustomed to a constant stream of new content.\n\nInsiders say that Taylor, at the age of 35, is taking a 'gap year' and will be focusing on her relationship with Travis. \n\nAnd there may be much to look forward to on that front: namely a Swift-Kelce marriage and perhaps even the patter of tiny feet.\n\nYes, sources close to Taylor confirm that she is 'not against' the idea of marriage and children.\n\n'Taylor's friends believe that now is the perfect time in her life to marry and have children. They have expressed this to her, and she is not against it at all. Taylor has never felt love like this. It is unconditional,' a source said.\n\n'Nothing will ever be able to trump the Eras tour and she is so proud of that, but it took a lot out of her,' another insider revealed. 'For the first time in years Taylor has no definitive plan, she is taking a year off. That means that she will not be doing any tours or shows. [Travis and Taylor] are both in it for the long haul and they both want the same things, which is a forever romance and a family.'\n\nTaylor and Travis started dating in the summer of 2023, first meeting in New York before Taylor then attended his victorious Kansas City Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears at the Arrowhead Stadium, watching from the stands with his mother.\n\nSince then, it's been a whirlwind romance, followed obsessively by fans and the media alike. And the couple have certainly enjoyed playing to the crowd.\n\nLast summer, Kelce appeared on stage at one of Taylor's shows in London. On another occasion, the singer adapted her lyrics to shout out Kelce, who was watching in the crowd.\n\nAfter a string of failed romances with the likes of actors Joe Alwyn and Tom Hiddleston, Taylor seems to have decided it's time to settle down.\n\nAnd her parents, Andrea and Scott Swift, couldn't be happier.\n\nOne friend said: 'Although there is no pressure, [Andrea and Scott] believe that Travis would make a great father.'\n\nIt's a feeling that seems to be shared by the Kelce clan.\n\nTravis's parents, Donna and Ed Kelce, are said to be hopeful that the 35-year-old tight end will 'settle down and have kids'.\n\nTravis is reportedly 'constantly compared to his older brother Jason', who has three children with his wife Kylie, and another on the way.\n\n'Jason and Kylie want their kids to grow up with cousins,' a family source said.\n\nAt 35, Travis is nearing the end of his glittering NFL career and will no doubt be planning for the future.\n\n'Travis and Taylor have both achieved everything that they ever wanted – massive success and enough money for ten lifetimes. The only thing that they do not have is a family of their own,' a source said.\n\nTaylor's gap year may also see her step back from politics.\n\nIn both the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections, Swift was vocally critical of Donald Trump, choosing instead to endorse Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and encouraging her fans to vote Democrat.\n\nBut now, sources close to her say she be will more tight-lipped going forward.\n\n'Taylor is not going to change her views ever, regardless of who is in office,' a source said. 'But the Eras tour taught Taylor a lot about the world and about America. She respects the fact that others do not share the same views as her.","summary":"A little over two weeks ago, on the eve of the Super Bowl, Taylor Swift and boyfriend Travis Kelce headed out for a pre-game date night, perhaps to settle the nerves.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14382673/Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce-baby-date-overheard.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/19/12/95072805-0-image-m-98_1739968060450.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2023/11/12/2946509154944071345/1024x576_MP4_2946509154944071345.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-25 14:16:15","author":"Editor,Isabelle Stanley,Russ Weakland","authors":["Editor","Isabelle Stanley","Russ Weakland"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.513},{"id":294217276,"title":"Comment on Bermudian With Kamala Harris At Awards by Joe Bloggs","text":"Bermudian With Kamala Harris At Awards\n\nBermudian model Darius Dio recently shared a moment in the spotlight with Kamala Harris at the NAACP Image Awards, escorting the former Vice President onstage.\n\n“Still processing the fact that I got to be part of the NAACP Image Awards,” Mr Dio posted on social media. “Sharing a stage with so many icons was unreal.

Gavin Newsom immediately positioned himself as the leader of the opposition.\n\nNewsom called a special legislative session, seeking money for lawsuits to “safeguard California values.”\n\n“The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack — and we won’t sit idle,” Newsom said in a statement. His office declared that “This is the first of several actions by the Newsom administration, in partnership with the Legislature, as the governor begins shoring up California’s defenses against an incoming federal administration that has threatened the state on multiple fronts.”\n\nTrump responded with a post on his Truth Social website, saying, “Governor Gavin Newscum is trying to KILL our Nation’s beautiful California” and “stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to ‘Make California Great Again.’”\n\nTwo months later, Newsom’s tune began to change as horrendous wildfires erupted in Los Angeles and it became evident that California would need many billions of dollars in federal aid.\n\nOutgoing President Joe Biden promised help but Trump, visiting the state just four days after his inauguration, said aid could hinge on California changing some policies. Newsom wasn’t invited to greet Trump but showed up anyway to make nice with the man he had denounced so many times as evil incarnate.\n\nHe later signed bills to finance anti-Trump litigation and aid to immigrants while publicly praising Trump for considering a wildfire aid package.\n\nLast Friday, Newsom dispatched a letter seeking $39.7 billion from Congress, saying, “We are eternally grateful and we are confident that if we work together, Los Angeles will continue to serve as a beacon to the world and securely place the city on solid ground in the coming years as it hosts the FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympics — and thrive for the century to come.”\n\nTrump must be laughing about Newsom’s obviously insincere flattery and being able to make the governor jump through his hoops.\n\nSo what is Trump demanding in return for federal aid? On his way to California on Jan. 24, Trump stopped in North Carolina, where reporters asked that question.\n\n“I want to see two things in Los Angeles: Voter ID, so that the people can have a chance to vote,” Trump replied, “and I want to see the water released, so that it can come down into Los Angeles and throughout the state.”\n\nThe first mirrors Trump’s oft-expressed but unproven allegation that blue states such as California tolerate voting by undocumented immigrants and other ineligible persons. The second continues his insistence that California is denying farmers the water they need for crops and Southern California the water it needs to fight fires.\n\nThose aren’t the only potential conditions that Trump or Republicans in Congress may impose on federal aid.\n\nAs Newsom was delivering his request to Washington, Trump advisor Ric Grenell was telling a conservative political gathering that “there will be conditions” on aid, specifically mentioning reducing or eliminating the California Coastal Commission’s power over development in the coastal zone.\n\nThe situation is a high-stakes poker game between two egocentric politicians and a reminder that while Newsom often refers to California as a “nation-state” with global influence, it’s still very dependent on Washington when disaster strikes.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"The situation is a high-stakes poker game between two egocentric politicians and a reminder that while Newsom often refers to California as a “nation-state” with global influence, it’s still very dependent on Washington when disaster strikes.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/25/trump-newsom-play-high-stakes-game-over-billions-in-federal-wildfire-aid/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LDN-L-FIRE-TRUMP-VISIT-0125-10.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 13:26:43","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":294191262,"title":"Trump and Macron's awkward handshakes at White House meeting go viral","text":"US President Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanual Macron are arguably two of the most awkward world leaders when they meet.\n\nThe pair have gone viral again for their hilariously awkward interactions, as shown in the photos below.\n\nNeither leader has shaken the other’s hand without appearing uncomfortable.

Is this why he wouldn't release his medical records?' another questioned.\n\nOne critic even went as far as to compare his health to that of Queen Elizabeth II in the days before she passed - despite there being no indication from officials that Trump is ill.\n\n'Queen Elizabeth had similar bruising on her hands when they kept dragging her out to entertain various people in the last week of her life,' one X user wrote.\n\n'Glad Getty Images is paying attention to Trump's health since the doctors around him are claiming he's the healthiest man in history.'\n\nAnother sarcastically joked that 'Trump's hand got bruised because he put his tiny hand on Macron's knee without consent', referencing one of the awkward encounters he and the French president shared on Monday. \n\nMailOnline has approached the White House for comment about the bruise. \n\nThe duo's first awkward handshake occurred as they were meeting for a press conference Monday afternoon.\n\nTrump and Macron gripped onto each other for an excruciating 12 seconds as they reunited outside the White House and posed for photos. \n\nThe second awkward encounter took place inside Trump's Oval Office, when he shouted over the French leader and placed his hand on his leg, resulting in Macron turning the physical contact into another handshake. \n\nSitting alongside the French president, Trump said Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky would visit the White House this week or next to conclude a deal to share the war-torn country's natural resources. \n\nLater, the third uncomfortable shake of the day happened during a news conference, which appeared to show Trump oddly twisting Macron's arm before they locked fists and faced the audience. \n\nTrump seemed in good spirits as he spent the day alongside a smiling Macron, with the pair going viral on social media for their prolonged handshakes - which appear to have become tradition. \n\nBody language expert Judi James referred to the shake outside the White House on Monday as a 'death clasp'. \n\n'With the eyes and the fate of the world currently resting on their shoulders,' James told DailyMail.com, 'this latest handshake greeting was always going to be riddled with signals of superior power and dominance.' \n\nMonday's first grab-and-grin was the latest in a long line of elongated shakes between the two leaders, which started eight years prior. \n\nDuring a May 2017 meeting ahead of the NATO summit in Brussels, Trump and Macron gripped hands so tightly that their knuckles turned white and their jaws clenched. \n\nMacron said at the time that the clinch of a handshake was 'not innocent' and meant to be a 'moment of truth' showing his US counterpart that the French leader would not be intimidated. \n\nThey shared several more bizarre handshakes during Trump's first term, which ended in January 2021. \n\nIn December 2024, after Trump won reelection over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, he and Macron were reunited in Paris for the reopening of the Notre Dame, which had been severely damaged in a April 2019 fire.","summary":"Photos of the bruise emerged after Trump, 78, met with French President Emmanuel Marcon at the White House on Monday to discuss a possible end to Russia 's war against Ukraine.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14433593/social-media-bruise-donald-trump-handshake-emmanuel-macron.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/25/11/95563019-0-image-a-48_1740483913453.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/25/5068176925483908071/1024x576_MP4_5068176925483908071.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-25 11:46:54","author":"Editor,Natasha Anderson","authors":["Editor","Natasha Anderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":294161258,"title":"Internet slams Kamala Harris over ‘you can smell the smoke’ LA wildfire remarks: ‘Drunk person trying to sound profound’","text":"Former US vice president Kamala Harris addressed the devastating wildfires in California earlier this month while visiting the fire-ravaged region, describing the destruction as something that could be “felt” in the air.A week after the massive fire tore through most of California, including nearly all of Pacific Palisades, Harris was asked by a reporter about the ongoing crisis.— EndWokeness (@EndWokeness) \"You can feel it.

And Elon is said to have personally gone to extreme measures to sire as many offspring as he can - allegedly offering his semen to friends and acquaintances.\n\nThe billionaire is known for being outspoken, famously aligning himself with right-wing politics with a key role in the new administration of returning US president Donald Trump. So it's perhaps no surprise to learn the pro-natalist, which means he follows a pro-birth ideology that puts recreation at the centre of humanity, has made comments on the issue that have proved highly controversial...\n\n\"Population collapse is coming... Earth is almost empty of humans,\" wrote Elon in a recent tweet. \"Instead of teaching fear of pregnancy we should teach fear of childlessness,\" he added.\n\n\"Population collapse due to low birthrates is a much bigger risk to civilisation than global warming,\" the 53-year-old claimed in a tweet back in 2022. \"(And I do think global warming is a major risk).\"\n\nIn February last year, the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, posted: \"I'm doing my best to encourage more people to become parents and ideally have three or more kids, so humanity can grow. The population collapse in most countries is a tragedy. Sales of adult diapers should never exceed sales of baby diapers!\"\n\nAnd Elon isn't satisfied with offering his fans words of encouragement to go forth and populate - he takes a very personal interest in spreading his own genes far and wide. According to The New York Times, he has offered his semen to friends including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s running mate Nicole Shanahan, who is said to have declined. \n\nThe publication also reported guests at a dinner party attended by the billionaire in 2023 witnessed his offer to provide sperm to \"a married couple he had met socially only a handful of times\". The intimate gathering, hosted by a Silicon Valley tech executive, saw the pair reveal they were having difficulties conceiving, leading to Elon making his brazen offer. The outspoken Tesla CEO was also said to have boasted about his many children at the event.\n\nNo stranger to confrontation, Elon has also turned on Taylor Swift. The popstar last year endorsed US Presidential candidate Kamala Harris with a sign off of \"Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady\", in response to Vice President-elect JD Vance's assertion that Democrats were \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\" back in 2021. \n\n\"Fine Taylor . . . you win . . . I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life\", Elon replied to the pop star's statement. He was subsequently branded \"creepy\" and \"weird\" by her fans. \n\nThe businessman has six children with his first wife, the Canadian novelist Justine Wilson. Tragically, the former couple lost their first child, son Nevada Alexander, in 2002. Nevada died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) when he was just 10 weeks old, with Justine subsequently telling Marie Claire: \"I buried my feelings ... coping with Nevada's death by making my first visit to an IVF clinic less than two months later. Elon and I planned to get pregnant again as swiftly as possible. Within the next five years, I gave birth to twins, then triplets.\"\n\nJustine and Elon went onto welcome twins Vivian and Griffin through IVF in 2004 and triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian in 2006. In 2020 he had X Æ A-Xii with 36-year-old musician Clare Boucher, known as Grimes, followed by Exa Dark Sideræl, who they welcomed with the help of a surrogate in 2021 and Techno Mechanicus in 2022. \n\nThe billionaire is dad to twins Strider and Azure with 39-year-old project director Shivon Zilis, who were born in 2021, in a cross over with his on-off relationship with Grimes. They welcomed a third child last year, with the name not confirmed. \n\nOn Valentine's Day, author Ashley St. Clair claimed Elon had become a father for the 13th time, tweeting: \"Five months ago, I welcomed a new baby into the world. Elon Musk is the father.\" The mogul is yet to confirm or deny her claim. \n\nWhen it comes to the reason for Elon's obsession with procreation, his South African father, Errol Musk, also a pro-natalist, told Sky News last November: \"We are here to continue being here. We should all be worried about declining populations, any country with any industry should be worried.\"","summary":"Billionaire Elon Musk's obsession with increasing the global birth rate is said to have led to making unusual offers to family and friends - and he's confronted a global superstar too","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/elon-musks-extreme-breeding-rants-34743284","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34743827.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_US-POLITICS-TRUMP-MUSK.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 11:06:56","author":"Vikki White","authors":["Vikki White"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.353},{"id":294316764,"title":"Kamala Harris’ First Move Post-White House Exit?

Then Putin Called","text":"But if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn’t show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat—quick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin “had a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,” one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence.\nThere were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America’s federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow—one of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever.\nYou probably heard something about the swap. It’s the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States—and sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn’t learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time.\nThe escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don’t have to squint too hard to see his scheme—which ultimately netted $93 million—as a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It’s kidnapping, hostage taking, and it’s effectively all being done on President Vladimir Putin’s orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged—to get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn’t at the very top of Moscow’s trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit.\nThey had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin’s propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company’s software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of Telegram channels for a Kremlin worried about the “introduction of unverified or knowingly false information,” according to one local news report.\nKlyushin’s rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (“The company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,” a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow’s Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia’s spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an “eco-activist” (for planting “several spruces in the yard”) and a “pet-lover” (his “favourite pet is a dog”). “Broad-minded, well-read, educated,” gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin “is like getting a lesson from a guru.”\nMoscow is filled with entrepreneurs who get rich by cozying up to the government; Klyushin seemed to reach another, higher level. He and M13 allegedly became so close to Moscow’s power brokers that an independent media outlet suggested he was one of the people behind an anonymous, inside-the-Kremlin Telegram channel with nearly 200,000 followers. Klyushin denied the allegation and successfully sued the outlet over the insinuation.\nKlyushin’s most consequential professional connection was with Ivan Ermakov, an internationally infamous hacker. It’s unclear when the two men met, but by April 2018 they were friendly enough to go heli-skiing together. Ermakov, a then 32-year-old with large, youthful brown eyes that made him look a decade younger, had recently served in Unit 26165 of Russia’s main intelligence directorate, the GRU. In cybersecurity and political circles, the unit was known as “Fancy Bear.” It was notorious for hacking into the networks of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, acts that helped throw the 2016 US election to Trump. Ermakov conducted some of Fancy Bear’s break-ins personally, American prosecutors alleged in 2018. This was around when Ermakov and Klyushin were attending the World Cup together in Sochi. Ermakov was indicted again that October for a series of Fancy Bear hacks around the 2016 summer Olympics. Ermakov made it onto an FBI most-wanted list. Klyushin kept a copy of the FBI poster in his iCloud account.\nAt the time, Ermakov was obtaining information that would be central to Klyushin’s next big business venture: making money in the American stock market. According to encrypted chats later obtained by prosecutors, Klyushin would soon open a brokerage account through a Danish company, which Ermakov and an M13 employee appear to have used to make trades in a broad range of stocks—real-estate firms, natural gas concerns, food service businesses. At first, the endeavor didn’t go well. The chats show transactions being mistimed, information about companies miscommunicated, and price movements misunderstood. “The market behaves strangely,” says Ermakov. “We suck,” complains one M13 employee. The trades that did succeed, though, tended to have a common theme: They happened right before the companies released their regularly scheduled public earnings reports. It was as if Klyushin’s contacts had access to privileged information.\nWhich, prosecutors say, they did.\nA rarer, potentially more destructive kind of insider trading involves finding a choke point in the flow of financial information and obtaining confidential data about dozens, hundreds, even thousands of companies at once. That’s what happened in the early 2010s, when a Ukrainian hacker broke into press release distributors like PR Newswire and exfiltrated before-it’s-public information on dozens of different companies. That hack allegedly resulted in around $30 million in illegal profits. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, Klyushin kept a printout about the PR Newswire hacker in a pink, translucent folder. He—or someone—snapped a photo of the article next to a bottle of rosé.\nKlyushin and Ermakov’s insider trading scheme started, investigators believe, in early to mid 2018. (The details below were drawn from court records, trial transcripts, and evidence submitted during a later trial.) That’s when some awfully strange behavior started occurring in the networks of Donnelley Financial Solutions—a document management firm that prepares earnings reports for big, publicly traded companies. On May 9, the account of a longtime Donnelley employee, Julie Soma, started downloading a flurry of confidential financial reports that had been prepared for client companies. That was something she’d “never” do, Soma later testified. The browser and operating system information associated with her account’s burst of activity also didn’t match her normal behavior. Plus, all of this was happening late at night, way past the hours Soma typically worked from her home in Richland, Washington.\nSeveral other accounts also displayed atypical behavior, and at least one Donnelley-linked laptop, in London, was found to have a suspicious tool on it. This program, which allowed the computer to be remote-controlled, tried to collect usernames and passwords inside Donnelley’s networks, then cover its tracks by deleting the system logs. Finally, the tool attempted to connect the laptop to a bogus site, “investmentcomp.com”—a classic hacker trick to covertly collect data from a victim’s system.\nIn November, a Donnelley competitor was hit too. At Toppan Merrill, investigators later discovered that a program called DirBuster was making multiple guesses per second to identify file names and network paths. Other malicious software echoed what was happening on the Donnelley machines.\nKlyushin’s investments, meanwhile, were expanding. He bought stock in semiconductor manufacturers, roofing suppliers, a firm that makes boats for wakeboarding. At almost every turn, Mikhail Irzak and Igor Sladkov, two associates of Ermakov’s from St. Petersburg, bought those same stocks. (Irzak, Sladkov, and Ermakov were all also indicted.) The volume of their trades often dwarfed Klyushin’s. When he purchased 1,350 shares of Tesla just ahead of its earnings report that fall, the St. Petersburg duo bought 16,300. Klyushin netted an estimated $9,000 from the deal; they got more than $145,000. Prosecutors never established a direct link between Klyushin and Ermakov’s friends from St. Petersburg. But one of those buddies had an internal M13 messaging app in his iCloud account, even though he was never an employee or client of the firm. An economist for the US Securities and Exchange Commission later put the odds of the group’s trading patterns being a coincidence at less than one in a trillion.\nThe scheme attracted more investors. Ermakov and Klyushin shared their tips with the new clients and took a 60 percent cut of anything those outside investors made. One newcomer ran an audiovisual and IT company; M13 had recently pitched it on a whitehat hacker-for-hire package. Two other investors were described by Klyushin’s attorneys as old friends of his: former mining executive Aleksandr Borodaev and Boris Varshavskiy, who received the “Gold Badge of Distinction of Russian Coal” and briefly served as the minister of ecology and natural resources for a region in southern Siberia. “I did the math for Boris,” Klyushin texted Ermakov in May 2019. “The profit comes to 198% … Boris earned $989k on $500k … They don’t even ask why.” (Neither Borodaev nor Varshavskiy was charged in the US. It was not established at trial that either of them knew about the insider trading scheme.)\nErmakov responded with a thumbs-up and three laugh-cry emojis. The pair grew closer—hitting the sauna, going out to dinners with the M13 crew. They texted about their favorite TV shows. Klyushin was really into Billions, about a hedge fund manager who made it big off of insider trading.\nOn July 16, 2019, the Julie Soma account at Donnelley Financial downloaded an upcoming press release from the sneaker company Skechers. The document—one of more than 2,000 files illicitly downloaded using Soma’s credentials—showed that business was booming in the second quarter, well above what the market was expecting. “We buy SKX today,” wrote Ermakov on the morning of July 18 in the encrypted chat, referring to Skechers’ symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. The St. Petersburg pair snatched up 130,000 shares; Klyushin, almost 50,000; his mining buddies, 77,500. The earnings officially dropped at 4:05 pm ET that day. SKX shot up from $34 to $39. Klyushin’s crew liquidated almost all of their positions immediately.\nKlyushin was pumped. “So … What did we earn today? Our comrades are wondering,” he wrote in the encrypted group chat, and he posted photos of Borodaev and Varshavskiy. Ermakov, who months earlier was fine texting about the outside investors, was growing wary. He told Klyushin to knock it off. “Vlad, you are exposing our organization. This is bad,” he wrote. “That’s how they get you and you end up as a defendant in a court room.”\nA similarly nightmarish story had recently unfolded for Paul Whelan, another former US Marine. He had gone to Russia for the wedding of a buddy when FSB agents burst into his hotel room and accused him of espionage. He was sent to a gulag that housed World War II prisoners and was given a job sewing buttons on winter uniforms. Cold showers were allowed, once a week. Meals consisted of “bread, tea, and a watery fish soup that seemed better suited as cat food,” according to The New York Times.\nReed and Whelan were two of four US citizens arrested by Russian authorities during Trump’s first term, all on what appeared to be the flimsiest of pretenses. The Kremlin made it clear to the White House that some or all of the Americans would be let go—if the US government gave up some notorious Russian criminals in return. Moscow and Washington had been exchanging captured spies for six decades, off and on. This was something different. This had all the hallmarks of a ransom operation.\nAfter further analysis of the market patterns, it became clear that the illicitly traded companies had something else in common: Their financial filings were all published by either Donnelley or Toppan Merrill. When investigators approached the two companies, executives didn’t believe they’d been hit. The companies launched internal investigations in which their own employees were scrutinized.\nThe feds, meanwhile, conducted a series of “pen registers”—which reveal the connections between accounts, but not their contents—to try to figure out who in Russia was orchestrating the trades. They zeroed in on the duo from St. Petersburg. Mikhail Irzak claimed to be a marketer. According to public records, Igor Sladkov was a rather prolific entrepreneur, with his hand in restaurants, residential real estate, nonalcoholic beverages, and media buying. The investigators got a warrant to access Sladkov’s iCloud. Inside the account, they found a screenshot of a Snap Inc. announcement about upcoming company earnings—time-stamped from before it was released. It was textbook inside information. “So: smoking gun,” Frank says. “He was cooked.”\nWhen the feds examined Sladkov’s WhatsApp account, they saw that he had been communicating constantly with a figure well known to US law enforcement: the twice-indicted former intelligence officer Ivan Ermakov. “You come across someone who is alleged to have an immense hacking pedigree,” says Kosto. “All of a sudden, you have a path to explaining: How has this happened?”\nAt 7:54 am Eastern time on November 6, 2019, the Julie Soma account at Donnelley downloaded a copy of Roku’s third-quarter financial results. The company was going to notably miss its targets. Everyone in M13’s orbit started shorting their Roku shares or trading other financial instruments based on Roku’s stock. As soon as the earnings came out, Roku’s price dropped from about $140 per share to less than $120. Klyushin and his investors cleared nearly $9 million in profits.\nKlyushin, though, was getting exhausted. “I am fucking tired rushing all the time. Need a rest,” he texted Ermakov. He consoled himself in Ermakov’s company—and a little retail therapy. Klyushin went apartment shopping with Ermakov, and bought himself a 78-foot, $4 million yacht from a shipyard in Cyprus. “At this point I want nothing except the boat,” Klyushin texted Ermakov in February 2020. “My pleasure is the boat and trading.”\n“Then you need nothing. Enjoy your life,” Ermakov responded. “I’ve read somewhere that if you keep buying while you have everything, it means you’re unhappy.”\nKlyushin answered, “Honestly I get a bigger kick when I check apartments for you, with you, the fact that we can walk home together and have a beer, or play golf, or simply send everyone to hell, knowing that you are close.”\nThey didn’t know it at the time, but they had only a few months left together to trade. By then, Toppan Merrill had introduced two-factor authentication to its system, effectively locking the hackers out. Donnelley had cut off access to Julie Soma’s compromised account. Employees at Klyushin and Ermakov’s brokerage firm were getting suspicious too. In an April Skype call with an executive at Denmark-based Saxo Bank, Klyushin and another M13 employee asked for more banking privileges. The Saxo executive politely pushed back—and then asked why so many of Klyushin’s best trades seemed to happen right around the release of earnings’ reports.\nThe M13 employee offered that it was the company’s media-monitoring prowess that gave them the edge. “It’s, ahem, first mass media. Second social media. And, uh, third, it’s, ahem, information investment sites,” the employee said.\n“We have an application,” Klyushin added, more smoothly, “which we are planning to launch onto the international market together with Swiss [investors], which in no way will be connected to the Russian Federation.” That way, M13 will be “open [to] investors from Europe and America.”\nIf M13 really was developing a specialized program for traders, there’s scant evidence of it. But the idea of recruiting Western investors to trade on ill-gotten tips—that part was true. Klyushin and Ermakov were once photographed at a party with Anselm Schmucki, a Swiss citizen who ran the Russian office of DuLac Capital, a Zurich-based investment firm. “The goal was to offer this service to international clients—you know, whoever Anselm worked with,” Max Nemtsev, one of Klyushin’s lawyers, tells me.\nSchmucki declined to comment for this story. His former business partner, Domino Burki, insists their firm, DuLac, did nothing wrong. As for Schmucki himself—well, Burki can’t be so sure what went on in Moscow. “I just feel that Anselm is not a criminal,” he tells me. “He was a wheeler-dealer.” (In 2023, the UK foreign secretary and the US Treasury Department sanctioned Schmucki, with the latter claiming he worked with “a company with suspected links to Russian organized crime and money laundering.” The Treasury Department added, “Schmucki controls a global network of shell companies”—at least one of which was based in Edinburgh, Scotland—“and has had close financial relationships with an individual charged with financial crimes.”)\nKlyushin’s photo with Schmucki was just one of the hundreds of thousands of files that US prosecutors sifted through as investigators obtained warrants for the iCloud accounts of Ermakov, Klyushin, and the rest of the M13 operation. Other images grabbed their attention too: the screenshot of Ermakov trading with Klyushin’s account; the earnings reports, downloaded days before they became public; the small fleet of Porsche convertibles, like the one he drove in his wedding video; the encrypted chats that were backed up to Klyushin’s iCloud. This was enough evidence for an open-and-shut case, from Ermakov’s warning about ending up in a “court room,” which proved criminal intent, to the specific dates, times, and prices of the trades made with stolen information. One other photo stood out: a Russian Medal of Honor, given to Klyushin on June 14, 2020, and signed by one “V. Putin.”\nThe day after Klyushin got his medal, Paul Whelan, the former US Marine, found himself standing in a glass cage in a Moscow City Court, dressed in a blue-gray sweater. He held up a sign: “Sham trial! Meatball surgery!” referring to the manufactured espionage charges against him and the emergency hernia operation he had undergone weeks earlier. He implored then president Trump to save him. Two men in ski masks, plaid shirts, and holstered pistols stood by his side while the judge handed down his sentence: 16 years in a gulag turned labor camp.\nA month and a half later, Trevor Reed received his nine-year sentence and was also sent to a horrific facility. He refused to work. They locked him in solitary confinement and eventually took away his books. He went on hunger strike. After that, he told CNN, “I started to get sick. I really at that point was consistently sick until I left. I started to cough up blood, and I coughed up that blood for a period of about three and a half months every day, multiple times a day.”\nErmakov, already under two US federal indictments, had the good sense to stay in Russia. Klyushin, on the other hand, really wanted to experience the thrill of heli-skiing again. And this time, he had to do it in the Alps. This time, he’d take his wife. They’d celebrate their anniversary.\nIn the US, prosecutors began preparing their criminal complaint against Klyushin. The FBI reached out to Swiss authorities. On Sunday, March 21, 2021, Klyushin and his wife took off from Moscow in a private jet. “You’re literally holding your breath,” Frank told CNBC. The Klyushins landed about four hours later at Sion airport, in Switzerland. “He was actually in ski gear, getting off the plane ready to board a helicopter,” Frank said. “The Swiss agents were waiting for him. They swooped in.”\nThis is the point in the story when things get a little murky, a little strange. Klyushin was taken to a jail in Sion in handcuffs and leg irons, according to the local press. He was kept in solitary confinement and held without bail. But “he was not afraid or anything. He was in quite a relaxed mood,” says Oliver Ciric, the Swiss lawyer who quickly signed on to Klyushin’s case. Ciric—a multilingual expert on Russian responses to Western sanctions, and, improbably, an honorary consul of the Republic of Vanuatu—told the press that his client was arrested only after he refused advances by British and American intelligence operatives, first in a bar in the south of France and later in Edinburgh, Scotland. The implication was that these alleged spies were trying to pump Klyushin for information about his Kremlin contacts—or recruit him as an agent. It wasn’t a crazy claim, given Klyushin’s proximity to the Putin administration. But Ciric had no evidence to back it up.\nOn April 7, the Kremlin asked the Swiss to extradite Klyushin back to Moscow. The man was a wanted criminal, the Russians claimed, accused of wide-scale financial fraud. That was odd, given how much the Kremlin was paying Klyushin’s company. Stranger still was Klyushin’s willingness to go along with the extradition request, since he’d presumably have to face the infamously brutal Russian justice system. The American government asked for Klyushin to be sent to the US 12 days later. That request was granted in late June. Everyone involved agreed that the process was unusually quick—high-profile extradition cases can drag on for years. “It’s completely out of the standard procedures,” Ciric says. “This is something that we attribute to the pressures, political pressures.”\nIn June of that year, at a lakeside villa near Geneva, Putin and US president Joe Biden discussed a potential prisoner swap. It was a topic long under discussion, through a number of channels—formal exchanges by diplomats, less formal discussions by a shifting network of outside lawyers and advocates. No agreements were reached that day. But the two countries opened up a new channel, this one between the CIA and its Kremlin counterparts.\nAfter a series of appeals, Klyushin was sent to the US in December and held at Plymouth County jail. A trial date was set for about a year later. For a case of this complexity, that, too, was awfully quick. In part, that’s because of an agreement between the Justice Department, Klyushin’s defense lawyers, and the presiding judge, Patti Saris.\nEach side, for their own reasons, wanted to downplay Klyushin’s contacts in Russian government and society. Saris, for her part, was worried that too much talk about these connections could be prejudicial to the jury. The prosecutors, according to Frank, wanted to “focus on the actual facts of the insider trading.” Klyushin’s American lawyers, meanwhile, did a 180 on the earlier defense of him, never mentioning the supposed approaches by Western intelligence or why those spy agencies might be interested in their client.\nSo the trial never detailed who Klyushin’s investors were—folks like Aleksandr Borodaev and Boris Varshavskiy, the guy who won the Russian gold medal for mining. Nor did the trial lay out how many Russians benefited from the scheme. It neglected to mention that when Klyushin shared photographs with Ermakov in August 2019 of a safe filled with $3 million in $100 bills, that safe was located inside the Russian Ministry of Defense.\nThe trial was over in 16 days. Klyushin was found guilty on all charges. Not that he seemed to care.\nBout was a real-life supervillain, fueling conflicts from Afghanistan to Angola. Yaroshenko had agreed to smuggle 8,800 pounds of cocaine. Griner, on the other hand, had been held for the better part of a year for possession of less than a gram of hash oil. Reed was falsely accused of hitting a Russian cop one time. Of course, everyone was happy to see wrongly detained American civilians let go. But what message did it send to Putin, that he could trade Bout’s freedom for Griner’s? Yaroshenko’s for Reed’s? Doug London, a 34-year veteran of the CIA, says that while the trade was politically popular, it may not have been in the US’s long-term interest. “Russia was emboldened by this,” he tells me. “They’re just going to take more hostages, and they’re just going to arrest more people.”\nKlyushin was convicted on Valentine’s Day, 2023. About six weeks later, on March 29, Russian authorities effectively kidnapped Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, and accused him of being a spy. A worldwide outcry ensued. So did talks to make a trade that could bring him home.\nDepending on whom you believe, Klyushin was frequently discussed as the negotiators met along their various tracks—or he wasn’t mentioned at all. The Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was deeply involved, or had nothing whatsoever to do with any talks. The State Department was stitching an international coalition to free the next set of Western prisoners, or was spinning its wheels on the margins. The CIA was leading the talks on the American side, or, as one of 10 sources put it, merely “delivering the mail” for the Biden White House, which was calling all the shots. Making matters even more complex: Many of the 24 people who were eventually freed in August’s massive prisoner exchange had their own advocates, all trying to negotiate with governments and with one another. One American prisoner even had two sets of representatives, each of which shit-talked the other to me.\nThe CIA and the White House declined to comment on the record for this story. The State Department—whose top official for hostage affairs is so far from camera-shy that he once starred on a reality show—declined, as well. But after speaking to my sources and reading through the various official leaks, a few common threads emerged. Putin’s top priority, by far, was to get back another one of his killers: a hit man named Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence for carrying out an assassination in Berlin. (According to Gershkovich, Putin’s Department for Counterintelligence Operations deliberately “used” him and Whelan as trade bait to secure the release of Krasikov.) The Germans were open to it, if some high-profile Russian dissidents were freed. The Russians would agree to that if more of their operatives were released, like that deep-undercover couple in Slovenia—and Klyushin.\nIt’s not hard to see why; Klyushin was a key contractor for Putin’s propaganda chief, so valued he got a medal from the Russian president himself. Additional hints of Klyushin’s value emerged in the months following his conviction, if you knew where to look. Klyushin’s friends Borodaev and Varshavskiy, the mining types, were put on the US sanctions list as part of the effort to “curtail Russia’s ability to exploit the international financial system.” Then there’s the broad array of unnamed Russian nationals who benefited from the M13 operation, and the mysterious Russian government official whose safe Klyushin filled up with $100 bills. Take a half-step back, and it’s plain that M13’s hack-and-trade effort was part of an attempt to fund Moscow’s economy through the back door, despite every US effort to shut it.\nOn July 31, 2024, an official Kremlin news service reported that Klyushin had suddenly gone missing from a US prison database, along with three other Russian nationals. Two of the Russians—a hacker and an electronics smuggler—were soon back behind bars. Klyushin and two others were loaded on a plane by men in baseball hats and balaclavas and were flown first to Ankara, then to Moscow. Meanwhile, Whelan, Gershkovich, and the other prisoners held in Russia were met in a tearful, triumphant scene at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland by family, colleagues, Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris. “I had on clothes that I had worn in 2018 when I’d been arrested. You know, they hadn’t been washed. They were too big for me,” Whelan told CBS.\n“I waved at people that were waving at me, and then I gave the president a salute as the commander in chief.” Whelan continued. “I thanked him for getting us home.”\nWatching from afar, Frank admitted to feeling just the tiniest bit conflicted amid the rapture of seeing Whelan and Gershkovich, the best-known of the freed American prisoners, back on US soil. “I was a reporter, and to have a fellow reporter held hostage like that, it’s pretty horrendous. And so I think we were thrilled to have a role in creating the opportunity for him to come home. On the flip side of that, it’s a guy who’s actually a criminal”—Klyushin—“going free to get people out who are completely innocent. I think we were gratified that he spent three years in jail at least before he went back,” says Frank, who recently joined a business litigation firm. “But yeah, there’s obviously a little bit of a mix of emotion.”\nIn the images of his arrival at Vnukovo Airport, in Moscow, the man Frank chased for the better part of three years looks exhausted, with deep circles under his eyes and his brown hair largely turned to gray. His 5 o’clock shadow is now well past 7:30. Wearing an open-collared khaki shirt and matching pants, Vladislav Klyushin descends the stairs stiffly. He waits for the undercover couple and their kids to receive flower bouquets. Then Klyushin shakes the hand of Vladimir Putin, who gives him a one-armed embrace.\n\nLet us know what you think about this article.
