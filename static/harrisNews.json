Kennedy Profile in Courage Award at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum on Sunday night for his actions that day.\n\nIn announcing that Pence would receive the award - which has previously gone to former President Barack Obama and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky - the JFK Library said Pence put 'his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power,' according to Politico.\n\nCaroline Kennedy, the former president's daughter, and her son, Jack Schlossberg, also said in a statement that Pence's decision to certify the election results - even as protesters called for him to be hanged - was an 'example of President Kennedy's belief that an act of political courage can change the course of history.'\n\nBut when MSNBC hosts discussed the award on The Weekend in the hours before the ceremony was set to start, Jonathan Capehart said he was 'most looking forward to' President Trump's reaction 'because it's totally going to be...'.\n\nHe then stopped talking, and instead mimed Trump's head exploding.\n\nCo-host Elise Jordan agreed, acknowledging: 'Truth Social is going to be lighting up.' \n\nTrump, whose first term in office had just ended, pressured his then-vice president in January 2021 to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president claimed the vote was marred by fraud. \n\nBut Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority.\n\nWhen he then stood before Congress on January 6 to accept the 2020 presidential election results, he and legislators from both parties were confronted by an angry mob - many of whom took specific aim at Pence for refusing to use his role to throw out the controversial Electoral College votes from the swing states.\n\nSome Trump supporters even erected makeshift gallows and chanted 'hang Mike Pence.' \n\nDuring the House select committee on January 6th hearings, it also came out that a confidential informant on the Proud Boys had told the FBI that if members of the group had found Pence that day they would have killed him.\n\nStill Pence refused to leave the Capitol, hiding out in a garage-like structure deemed a secure location within the complex. \n\n'The vice president did not want to take any chance that the world would see the vice president of the United States fleeing the United States Capitol,' his counselor to the vice president Greg Jacob testified to committee members in 2022. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump continued to push what has been called the 'big lie' that he lost the election and hit out at his vice president. \n\n'Mike Pence didn´t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,' Trump wrote at the time on X as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building.\n\nStill, Pence stayed at the US Capitol to continue the ceremonial election certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory once the rioters were cleared. \n\nBut his decisions that day left Pence in the political wilderness.\n\nHe tried running against Trump for the 2024 nomination, but only stayed in the race through October 2023. \n\nTrump - the far-and-away frontrunner - wouldn't even participate in the GOP primary debates - so the two men never met onstage.\n\nPence then refused to endorse Trump once he secured the nomination - but also wouldn't endorse the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nInstead, his political action committee financed advertisements ahead of the 2024 election pushing Americans to vote for Republicans on issues. \n\nIt now remains unclear how much Pence has spoken with Trump since the January 6, 2021 certification.\n\nBut last year, the president chose Ohio Sen. JD Vance, rather than Pence, to serve as his running mate for his second term in office as he continued to claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\n'Against all odds, I did great in 2016. 2016, how great was that?' Trump told graduates at the University of Alabama on Thursday night, according to the Alabama Political Reporter.\n\n'And then I did much better in 2020,' he claimed. 'Sorry the election was rigged... it was a rigged election. And then in 2024, I made it too big to rig.'\n\nIn private, though, Trump has apparently admitted he lost the 2020 election, according to comedian Bill Maher - who recently sat down with the president.\n\n'I don't remember exactly what we were talking about, but it must have been something to do with the 2020 election because I know he used the word \"lost\" and I distinctly remember saying \"Wow, I never thought I'd hear you say that,\"' Maher recounted on his show, Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\n'He didn't get mad,' the talk show host continued, claiming the president is 'much more aware than he lets on in public.","summary":"Jonathan Capehart, an MSNBC host, warned Americans on Sunday that President Donald Trump will go ballistic as one of his former allies who later betrayed him gets a prestigious award.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14677861/Trump-Mike-Pence-JFK-Profile-Courage-Award.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/04/23/98024781-0-image-m-16_1746398890738.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 23:53:24","author":"Associated,Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Associated","Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":317833956,"title":"House Republican Stefanik edges closer to run for New York governor","text":"WASHINGTON >> Republican U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik said on Sunday that she is “strongly considering” running for governor of New York next year, potentially pitting her against incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul.\n\n“New Yorkers, not just Republicans, but independents and Democrats as well, are yearning for a new generation of leadership to bring common sense back to our state.

They're in total disarray. They have a new person named Crockett. I watched her speak the other day. She's definitely a low IQ person. And they said she's the future of the party.\"In response, Crockett wrote on X: \"For you to be in charge of the WHOLE country, you sure do have my name in your mouth a lot. Every time you say my name, you're reminding the world that you're terrified of smart, bold Black women telling the truth and holding you accountable. So keep talking...\"Crockett assumed her seat representing Texas' 30th Congressional District in January 2023 and has also been a target for Republicans where she has fired back multiple times.In January, the Texas representative got into a verbal spat with Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, during a contentious House Oversight Committee meeting. The argument between the two started as the House voted to ban transgender athletes from women's sports at federally funded institutions.During the meeting, Mace asked Crockett if she wanted \"to take it outside.\"Mace had objected to Crockett referring to her as \"child\" during her speech, responding, \"If you want to take it outside, we can do that.\"In February, when asked what she would want to say to Musk, she responded with \"F*** off.\" The now viral video posted to X by \"Call to Activism\" showed the encounter followed by laughs.In the beginning of March, she apologized to the world following the tense televised meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump and Vice President JD Vance.Later that month, she encouraged a Tesla Takedown movement, posting to X: \"On March 29, it's my birthday, and all I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down.\"When called out by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, she doubled down on her stance, saying she was planning to attend one of the Tesla Takedown demonstrations.Last month, MAGA comedian Terrence K. Williams mocked her online by sharing a video titled: \"Who wore it best, me or Jasmine Crockett.\" In the video, he's seen wearing a wig, pegs to look like fake nails, and glasses that look like the pair Crockett wears.The congresswoman also received backlash after calling Texas Governor Greg Abbott \"Governor Hot Wheels\" during a press conference in March.She later said she was referring to his deportation methods rather than his disability. He was paralyzed in 1984 when a tree fell on him while running.What People Are SayingKhary Penebaker, a former Democratic National Committee (DNC) member, said on X: \"Trump can't stop crowing about @RepJasmine because fearless Black women torch his paper-thin ego. Keep her name rolling, Don—it spotlights your terror of truth & your party's allergy to accountability. We're here, we're loud, & we're voting. Deal w/ it convict.\"Conservative political commentator Tomi Lahren responded to a video of Trump's interview on X and simply wrote: \"LOL.\"Prior to Trump's statements, former Vice President Kamala Harris praised Crockett and other politicians during a speech April 30 posted by PBS News Hour: \"And I will tell you the courage of all these Americans inspires me. And I have been inspired. By movements like the one in Wisconsin that put Susan Crawford on the Supreme Court. By the State of the People Power Tour that is aiming to ignite a grassroots movement to lift up voices and advance freedom and justices. And ty leaders across the spectrum including Congressional Leaders like Corey Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Cross, AOC, and Bernie Sanders.

Military Recruitment’s Up\n\nThe US “military is seeing its biggest recruitment surge in more than a decade,” cheers Rob Maness at the Association of Mature American Citizens, “and it’s no mystery why”: After Team Biden spent years turning “our armed forces into a woke Marxist social experiment,” President Trump’s “bold, unapologetic America First vision is inspiring the country’s young patriots to step up.”\n\nThe Army has a “groundswell of young people eager to join.”\n\nThey want to “fight for the United States,” not attend “diversity seminars” or “learn how to use ‘preferred pronouns.’”\n\nThey “crave meaning — something bigger than themselves. The military offers that.”\n\nAnd they’re “inspired by a president who projects strength.” As someone who’s served, he writes, “I’ve never been prouder.”\n\nPolitics beat: Dems’ Empty Agenda\n\nThe Democratic Party “is still floundering to find its way in a second Trump term,” snarks Ingrid Jacques at USA Today.\n\nThe lameness isn’t just Tim “Walz’s ‘code talk’ messaging and [Kamala] Harris’ elephant-circling strategy.”\n\nDems have “failed to present any credible alternatives on the pressing issues that the president is tackling — including border security, trade and the deficit.”\n\nThus a poll asking voters “whom they think is doing a better job handling the country’s main problems,” “40% said Trump. Just 32% said congressional Democrats.”\n\nYet 2028 hopeful Gov. JB Pritzker (D-Ill.) just “called for a ‘bold’ agenda” but “his recommendations left a lot to be desired,” with no more than a call for “for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption.”\n\nNo: “Raging against Trump and his supporters has repeatedly failed for Democrats. And it will again.”\n\nFrom the right: Homeless Sex-Offender Horrors\n\nA new report shows that “sex offenders account for more than 20% of the unsheltered homeless population in 20 states, and more than 10% in 32 states,” notes Devon Kurtz at City Journal — and the median share is 20% nationwide.\n\nKeep in mind, “States’ registries consist primarily of people who have committed serious offenses like rape or the sexual abuse of a child” and sex offenders commit new sex crimes after prison release at two to four times the rate of other offenders.\n\nYet “the US Department of Housing and Urban Development allows publicly funded programs” to keep sex offenders in facilities that help women and children, even as “academics reject the connection, insisting that the homeless pose no elevated crime threat.”\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"President Trump’s move “to restrict public funds to NPR and PBS” is “is a moment the media should use for long-overdue self-reflection,” explains Jonathan Turley at The Hill.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/04/opinion/the-suicide-of-the-press-media-double-denial-on-joes-decline-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/newspress-collage-ope9f5kyy-1746388132380.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1746373818&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/cp7tcfzP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-04 20:07:48","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":317827068,"title":"Pollster: Media Pushing Fake Polls to Pressure Congress","text":"Friday, during Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” Trafalgar Group pollster Robert Cahaly called out so-called “fake polls” intended to pressure congressional Republicans to back away from the support of President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\n“You know, it was interesting to watch the focus group, Robert, with Van Jones, that I had in the opening monologue,” host Sean Hannity said. “And you know, people are not regretting voting for Donald Trump and then to watch their polls to say, yeah, if the election were held again today, Trump would still wipe the floor with Kamala Harris or probably any other Democrat for that matter. So, on the one hand, they’re trying to say one thing, to create a false image. Why are they doing that? Are they trying to divide Trump with congressional Republicans and senators to stymie his agenda?”\n\n“That’s exactly why they’re doing it, Cahaly replied. “They realize that, you know, Washington is full of political animals, and if they can convince, you know, the people in Congress that Trump is somehow becoming more toxic, then they can damage his agenda. But the fact is, the people in Congress are smart. They know what a real poll is. They know what a fake poll is. They’ve seen this. I mean, it would be like if you had a prognosticator who continued the last three years called the postseason wrong, you don’t listen to what they say in the — in the regular season, you just discard it, and so, it’s really this is a media consumption thing. I keep hearing about hard data and soft data. Well, the soft data is flawed.”\n\nHe continued, “I mean the hard data is what you’ve been talking about that this — all this talk of the economy is in huge trouble, the public doesn’t think that, in this talk that people regret their votes for Trump, the Van Jones focus group showed it, the Frank Luntz focus group showed it, it’s all be — they’re not backing off their decisions.

He said many bureaucrats will “slow policy,” simply ignoring the president’s orders.\n\nA recent poll found that a whopping 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nFurthermore, a recent Foundation for Government Accountability study found that Democrat employees outnumber Republican employees by a 2-to-1 margin across federal agencies. In the 2024 presidential election, 84% of the money that federal employees gave in political contributions went to Harris.\n\nSean Higgins, a research fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, also highlighted the threat of employees slow-walking the president’s agenda.\n\n“It’s easy to throw sand in the gears for something you don’t like, and that’s one of the reasons why things run so slowly in the government,” he told The Daily Signal. \n\nHiggins noted that while analysts are familiar with the problem, no comprehensive study has shown exactly how many political appointees “burrow in.”\n\nHowever, the Office of Personnel Management keeps a record of how many political appointees request—and receive—nonpolitical “career” placements.\n\nAn Overview of the Data\n\n“OPM is committed to upholding merit system principles and preventing improper conversions from political to career positions,” McLaurine Pinover, an Office of Personnel Management spokeswoman, told The Daily Signal in a statement Friday. “This year, we launched a new review process to strengthen oversight and improve transparency in how agencies allocate career-reserved SES [Senior Executive Service] positions in the federal civil service, and we are closely reviewing all previous political conversions.” \n\n“Our goal is to ensure all career appointments are based on merit,” she added.\n\nThe Daily Signal analyzed the available records, finding that the period between Jan. 1, 2024, and Jan. 20, 2025, had the largest number of political appointees approved to “burrow in.” Forty political appointees had been approved for “career” positions during that roughly yearlong span, with 17 approved just between Oct. 1 and Jan. 20.\n\nThe data includes yearly reports for non-presidential election years, and quarterly reports for presidential election years, with the final report for each presidential year lasting until the Jan. 20 inauguration of the new president. \n\nThe data shows higher numbers of political-to-career position placements during the Biden administration than during the first Trump administration. Eleven political appointees burrowed in during 2023, 23 burrowed in during 2022, and 33 did so in 2021. This brings the Biden administration total to 107.\n\nDuring the election year-plus period Jan. 1, 2020, to Jan. 20, 2021 (Trump’s last year of his first term), 29 political appointees burrowed in. Seventeen did so in 2019, 7 in 2018, and 15 in 2017, yielding a Trump 45 administration total of 68.\n\nThe archived reports do not go back as far as the beginning of 2016, but the period between Oct. 1, 2016, and Jan. 20, 2017, during the Obama administration shortly before Trump took office, had a rather low number—only 8 political appointees burrowed in.\n\nA few caveats: Some of the political appointees who appear in these reports had switched to career positions earlier than they appear in the Office of Personnel Management’s reports—the reports merely include dates that the switches were approved, and they often mark that a bureaucrat made the move before the office approved it. Due to these delays, Trump political appointees received approval during the Biden administration and Obama appointees appear in the lists during the Trump administration.\n\nRequests to burrow in are rarely denied, but it does happen, and when a request is denied or in process, the Office of Personnel Management withholds the name from the report.\n\nThe Daily Signal combed through the report for Oct. 1, 2024, to Jan. 20, 2025, and a few names illustrate the phenomenon of President Joe Biden’s appointees burrowing in ahead of the Trump administration. Some of these political appointees applied to burrow in long before Trump’s election, but the Office of Personnel Management under Biden approved most of them after Trump’s victory. The final example comes from earlier in 2024, but illustrates a leftist ideological bent among some of the bureaucrats who burrowed in.\n\nKerry Doyle\n\nKerry Doyle, a lawyer, worked for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security under Biden, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nShe requested to move from DHS to the Justice Department, becoming an immigration judge. The Office of Personnel Management received the request on July 31 but processed it on Dec. 15. Doyle went from making $168,000 annually to $176,548.\n\nAs an attorney at ICE and DHS, she would have represented the Biden administration amid policies that, critics say, allowed more than 9 million illegal aliens to enter the country.\n\nDoyle was about to be sworn in at the Chelmsford immigration court in Massachusetts but received an email from the Executive Office of Immigration Review in February, firing her, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nPrior to her service in the Biden administration, Doyle had served as managing attorney at Church World Service, one of the nonprofits that went on to receive federal funding to move immigrants across the country during the Biden administration. She also worked as a scheduler and legislative assistant for Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va.\n\nMargot Benedict\n\nMargot Benedict, who started as an attorney at the Justice Department in July 2021, rose to become senior counselor to Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2024, according to her LinkedIn profile. According to the law firm Morrison Foerster, which currently employs Benedict, she first received an offer for a career position in 2023. She became a trial attorney for counterintelligence and export control in January 2024 after the Office of Personnel Management approved the transfer on Nov. 17.\n\nBenedict had received $116,653 annually in her previous position, and she received a pay raise to $131,243 in the transfer to a career position.\n\nThe Trump administration fired her in March.\n\nBefore joining the Biden administration, Benedict had interned with the left-leaning National Women’s Law Center and served as a law clerk for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s ranking member, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. She also worked for three years at Montgomery Foerster, where she returned after the Trump administration fired her.\n\nElisa Santana\n\nElisa Santana, who joined the U.S. Agency for International Development in August 2022, applied to switch to a career position at the Department of Commerce. The Office of Personnel Management received her request in September and approved it on Dec. 15.\n\nShe went from making $104,604 annually to a salary of $106,382.\n\nSantana posted on LinkedIn that she lost her job last week.\n\nBefore joining USAID, Santana worked for Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and before that, for Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas.\n\nTara Boggaram\n\nTara Boggaram, a director of strategy execution at the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, asked to switch to a career position as project finance specialist at the same body. The Office of Personnel Management received the request in late October and approved it on Jan. 12.\n\nBoggaram took a pay cut, from $136,780 to $111,032. \n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, she still works at the International Development Finance Corporation. She previously worked as a field organizer for Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke’s failed 2018 U.S. Senate campaign.\n\nRuirui Kuang\n\nRuirui Kuang, an adviser to the International Development Finance Corporation board of directors, requested a career appointment at the same place. The Office of Personnel Management received on Nov. 7 and approved on Jan. 12 her transition to become managing director of pipeline management and execution.\n\nLike Boggaram, Kuang took a pay cut—from $145,617 annually to $125,133.\n\nKuang previously worked in the Obama White House as an innovation specialist on the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team from February 2015 to August 2016.\n\nSusan Wang, a senior implementation adviser in the Biden White House Office of Management and Budget, requested a career position. The Office of Personnel Management received her request on Nov. 18 and approved her transition to attorney adviser in the DOJ’s office of legal counsel on Jan. 6.\n\nWang took a hefty pay bump, from $62,500 to $104,604. \n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Wang interned with then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., worked as a field organizer for the Obama campaign in 2012, and served as digital chief of staff for the Biden Presidential Inaugural Committee.\n\nMegan Doherty\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management received a request for Megan Doherty, a deputy assistant administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development, to switch to a career position on Nov. 21. On Jan. 12, the Office of Personnel Management approved her request to become vice president of programs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nDoherty received a substantial raise in the transition, going from $126,370 annually to $200,000.\n\nOn March 15, Trump signed an executive order calling for the elimination of several federal entities, including the Wilson Center. Mark Green, the center’s president and CEO, resigned on April 1, a day after the Department of Government Efficiency visited the center. Only five employees reportedly remain at the center, and it seems likely Doherty is one of them.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Doherty spent seven years at the National Democratic Institute, an ostensibly nonpartisan nonprofit that admits to having a “loose affiliation with the Democratic Party” and has received more than $1 million from the Foundation for Open Society (part of the foundation network of Hungarian American billionaire George Soros now run by his son, Alex). She served on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council as director for North Africa.\n\nAndrea Delgado-Fink\n\nAndrea Delgado-Fink’s name did not appear in the Oct. 1-Jan. 20 report, but earlier in the 2024 reports. Even so, she also illustrates the general trend of the previous seven names.\n\nFink, who appears to still be serving as deputy regional forester at the Forest Service, switched from her political appointee role as chief of staff for natural resources and the environment for Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in October. She received a pay bump from $112,980 to $131,243. \n\nBefore joining the administration, Fink worked at the environmentalist group Earthjustice from 2012 to 2019. She joined the Biden-Harris transition team in November 2020 and joined the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council in March 2021, according to her LinkedIn profile. Her “environmental justice” past suggests she may oppose Trump’s efforts to reverse Biden’s policies on climate change.\n\nA Pay Raise for Doing the Same Job?\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management list included multiple political appointees who applied for career positions but did not receive official approval or denial before Jan. 20, the end of the Biden administration. It also included many approvals that the office did not receive until months or years after federal agencies had already processed them, which indicates that many more Biden political appointees may have “burrowed in” before Trump took office.\n\nIn most cases, political appointees received a pay bump when switching to a career position.\n\nHiggins, the Competitive Enterprise Institute research fellow, noted that the pay may prove “motivation for people to burrow in this way.”\n\n“If you can get yourself $15 grand more a year while still essentially doing the same job, why wouldn’t you?” he asked.","summary":"Left-leaning federal bureaucrats aim to oppose President Donald Trump from within the administrative state, and some Biden administration appointees have attempted to &#8220;burrow in&#8221; to...

Rashida Tlaib is doing a text blast to raise funds for a super PAC backing Zohran Mamdani for mayor — but not everyone is pleased with the solicitation.Tlaib’s pitch recently showed up on the mobile phones of prospective donors courtesy of the pro-Mamdani group New Yorkers for Lower Costs.Mamdani, as with the Michigan congresswoman, is an ardent foe of Israel and supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against the Jewish state.\n\n“Zohran, who’s led hunger strikes for a cease-fire [in Gaza] and workers’ rights, isn’t raising any more money for his campaign under New York City’s public financing system,” Tlaib said in the solicitation.\n\nThe Mamdani campaign has already hit the maximum fundraising cap under the system after raising thousands of small donations that qualified it for the 8 to 1 in public matching funds.New Yorkers for Lower Costs has raised about $60,000 in its efforts to date, although that’s a pittance compared to the more than $4 million secured by the Fix The City super Pac supporting Democratic mayoral front-runner and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.“Andrew Cuomo, who’s on the legal team defending [Israel] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu for war crimes in Gaza, has millions pouring in from his billionaire-backed super Pac,” Tlaib complained in the ad for Mamdani.\n\n“Zohran is getting drowned out on the airwaves. That’s why I’m supporting the official Zohran Mamdani support PAC — to run the ads Zohran can’t,” said the congresswoman — who has been openly supportive of the Palestinian terror group Hamas and called for the destruction of Israel.A Jewish donor who is a staunch backer of Israel and requested anonymity told The Post they were “appalled” at receiving a text message from Tlaib on behalf of Mamdani.\n\nBrooklyn state Assemblyman Kalman Yeger, a strong ally of Israel, also said he is not surprised that Tlaib is being used as a fundraising tool by the pro-Mamdani camp.\n\n“Unfortunately, in New York City, there are antisemites out there who would be receptive to her message, and Mamdani is the most antisemitic candidate New York has ever seen,” Yeger said.\n\nMamdani, a state assemblyman from western Queens, is running second behind Cuomo in recent Democratic primary polls.Last month, Tlaib participated in a Democratic Socialists of America virtual organizing call for Mamdani, where she urged “comrades” to back him for mayor.\n\nTlaib, a member of the US House of Representatives’ far-left “Squad” alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Bronx-Queens) and others, is known for her disdain of her own party’s support for Israel.As the only Palestinian American in Congress, she has been openly supportive of Hamas during her time in office and has even been censured by colleagues for defending it and for calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.\n\nDuring Netanyahu‘s address to Congress last spring, Tlaib was widely ripped for brandishing a sign accusing the Israeli leader of being a “war criminal” and “guilty of genocide.” \n\nShe also repeatedly berated then-President Joe Biden as an “enabler” over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war and even declined to endorse Kamala Harris as her party’s 2024 presidential pick. Branded by some Republicans as the “poster child” for Trump derangement syndrome, Tlaib most recently held up real-time signs during President Trump’s joint session of Congress last month declaring him a “liar.”","summary":"\"Zohran is getting drowned out on the airwaves,\" said the congresswoman — who has been openly supportive of the Palestinian terror group Hamas and called for the destruction of Israel.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/04/us-news/rashid-tlaib-fund-raises-for-nyc-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/103822238.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/cp7tcfzP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-04 19:29:18","author":"Carl Campanile","authors":["Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":317828386,"title":"Biden Didn't Show Signs Of Mental Health Decline, Says Ex-White House Press Secretary: 'Aging Happens Quickly'","text":"“I never saw that person - not a single time, and I was in the Oval Office every day - that was on that debate stage,” Psaki said Friday on the Mixed Signals podcast.\n\nBiden 's poor showing in the debate against Donald Trump prompted widespread calls, even from within his own party, to exit the 2024 race.\n\nPsaki emphasised that she left the administration in May 2022 and has seen Biden in person only once since then. She cautioned against drawing conclusions about his health post-tenure.\n\n“I think cover-up is such a loaded phrase,” Psaki spoke in the podcast when asked whether White House aides shielded the public from Biden's cognitive decline.“I don't know the facts of what was happening privately.”\n\nAcknowledging the effects of age, Psaki said,“I'm not a doctor, aging happens quite quickly.” She added,“Were things that people saw during that period of time that were similar to that or would've been in a category of that? I don't know, possibly. And all these books are gonna tell us.”\n\nPsaki argued that talk of a“cover-up” implies criminal wrongdoing, and that such accusations are dangerous when no legal violations have been proven.\n\n“A cover-up is often like a crime. People use that term when they refer to Watergate or the covering up of not sharing public information about a war,” she said.\n\nShe insisted that her former colleagues were well-intentioned:“I would like to think they would not be a part of an active 'let's hide from the public what we see happening privately.'”\n\nWhen asked if the media had failed to scrutinise Biden's mental fitness , Psaki admitted,“Maybe the media missed a lot, and so maybe in retrospect, there were major stories and moments missed.”\n\nShe also accused Republican operatives of shaping the public narrative prematurely.“There was an aggressive all-out pitching operation from the right-wing and from the Republicans about Joe Biden's age and how he was in decline... the majority of which wasn't true, in 2019-2022,” she said.\n\nPsaki suggested Biden's decision to run for reelection - and ultimately drop out in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris - had negatively impacted his legacy.\n\n“I think a lot of his legacy has been based around this question of him running for reelection, him not being aware or not being honest with himself, about him not being [able] to do a full term,” she said.","summary":"(MENAFN - Live Mint) Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she never witnessed signs of former President Joe Biden's mental decline during her tenure, distancing herself from concerns ...","url":"https://menafn.com/1109506135/Biden-Didnt-Show-Signs-Of-Mental-Health-Decline-Says-Ex-White-House-Press-Secretary-Aging-Happens-Quickly","image":"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-05/04/LM_ea580image_story.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 19:00:51","author":"Date,MENAFN","authors":["Date","MENAFN"],"language":"en","source_country":"jo","sentiment":-0.379},{"id":317828432,"title":"'Confident He Would Pass' - Biden's Staff Still Avoided His Cognitive Test In Feb 2024 Over Backlash Fears: New Book","text":"The book, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, is co-authored by a New York Times journalist and details behind-the-scenes discussions within the Biden camp.\n\n“Biden's aides were confident that he would pass a cognitive test,” the book says, according to the New York Times.“But they worried that the mere fact of his taking one would raise new questions about his mental abilities.”\n\nThe debate over the cognitive exam reportedly occurred in February 2024, while Biden was actively campaigning for a second term. Ultimately, the White House opted not to go forward with the test.\n\nThe decision would later come under renewed scrutiny after Biden's disastrous June 2024 debate against Donald Trump , which raised alarms even among loyal Democrats.\n\nBiden's performance in the first debate stunned the political world, triggering calls from within his party for him to reconsider his campaign.\n\n“I never saw that person - not a single time - that was on that debate stage,” former Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a recent interview, distancing herself from the fallout.

John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), who ran for president in 2020, doesn’t necessarily see Harris as a front-runner, even though polls show her leading the pack of potential candidates because of her high name ID, but he said he thinks she could add “valuable perspective to the political debate.”\n\n“I think time will tell,” he said when asked whether Harris would be a viable presidential candidate in the next election.\n\n“I think she will add value to” the national conversation, he said. “What’s going to happen over the next six to 18 months is going to be lots of Democrats having lots of different opinions about what our priorities should be. What are the values we have to put first?”\n\n“I think she will have a valuable perspective on that,” he said.\n\nHickenlooper said Harris’s decisive loss to Trump doesn’t mean she couldn’t put together a winning formula in the 2028 general election.\n\n“Every election is unique. We always try to draw analogies and inferences” based on past elections, he said. “I don’t think it disqualifies her that she lost.”\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers don’t want to slam the door shut on Harris running for the White House in three years, especially when they’re not sure if a stronger candidate will emerge.\n\nDemocratic senators were more vocal about the need to move on after Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election to Trump, even though Clinton won the popular vote that year by almost 2.9 million votes. Clinton won 227 electoral votes, while Harris won 226 votes.\n\nSenate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.), who endorsed the former first lady in the 2016 race, famously called on his party to “move” on from Clinton after her loss to Trump.\n\n“I think it’s time for our party to move to new leadership, a new spokesperson,” he said.\n\nIn 2019, former Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) discouraged Clinton from running again. \n\nAnd Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said it would be a “mistake” for Clinton to run again in 2020, when she would have been 73 years old on Election Day.\n\nHeinrich, however, is open to Harris running again, though he says she would likely face a lot of competition.\n\n“I’m a big fan of Kamala Harris, I enjoyed serving with her. I think given the time frame that we have, which is very different from what we were dealing with last time, that it’s going to be an open process,” he said. “Anybody who thinks they’ve got what it takes will step into that and someone will emerge” as the winner.\n\n“I would never underestimate her talent,” he said. “Having that open process has a lot of long-term benefits.”\n\nDemocrats who think Harris could be a viable general election candidate again in 2028 believe she was handicapped by having only a few weeks to campaign as the party’s nominee, since former President Biden didn’t drop out of the race until July 21.\n\nThe New Mexico senator said the compressed general election campaign schedule hurt Harris’s chances.\n\n“I think you need time to really get to know the candidates and feel” comfortable about them, he said. “If you’re going to run for president, you don’t get to hide a lot of cards. You really have to be comfortable in your own skin, and even the process of that in my view takes a year.”\n\n“She didn’t get the benefit of that,” he added.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers lauded Harris as a candidate during her brief 107-day campaign in 2024 but were left deeply disappointed by the results, which exceeded the worst expectations of many Democrats after she lost all seven battleground states including the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and the popular vote.\n\nNot only that, but some Democratic lawmakers thought that her poor performance created serious headwinds for Senate Democratic incumbents, who lost their reelections despite having tens of millions of dollars poured into their races.\n\nSenate Democrats lost four seats and their majority in last year’s election after former Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Tester went down in defeat. Former Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.) simply decided he didn’t want to run again in a state that Trump would go on to win by 42 percentage points.\n\nSteve Jarding, a Democratic strategist, said Harris is a “legitimate candidate.”\n\n“She obviously was vice president for four years. She got thrown into [a] 107-day election, which may not have been a fair read probably not fair” on her abilities, he said.\n\n“She’s got a tremendous donor base to work with. She’s got experience. I would be careful if I were the Democrats to throw out, ‘Well, she lost all the battleground states,’” he said. “Who has a better résumé, for instance?”\n\nHarris represented California in the Senate from 2017 to 2021 and before that served as California’s attorney general.\n\n“I understand the skepticism, she lost the battleground states, she lost to Donald Trump,” Jarding said. “They would be making a mistake if they didn’t take her seriously.”\n\nJarding said Democrats are a little concerned about the deal her husband’s law firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, struck with Trump in January to provide $100 million in pro bono legal services during his second term.\n\nThe former second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, who’s a partner at the firm, criticized the deal.\n\nHarris’s failure to win a single battleground state was especially disappointing to many Democratic lawmakers and donors after her campaign and its allies dramatically outspent Trump and his allies.\n\nHarris’s campaign raised more than $1 billion, and altogether her campaign and allied super PACs spent more than $2 billion on the race. She spent $1.5 billion over 15 weeks on everything from campaign ads and social media campaigns to voter canvassing efforts and celebrity-studded rallies.\n\nIn the end, she lost the popular vote by nearly 2.3 million votes.\n\nNevertheless, some Democrats thought the negative political climate for Democrats last year went far beyond Harris’s role as the party’s nominee.\n\nMany of them blame Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump on June 27 and then Biden’s refusal for weeks to drop out of the race, despite heavy pressure from many Democratic lawmakers and donors.\n\n“I think she’s a potential candidate. There were a good many reasons that she lost, some beyond her control. But she’s a strikingly attractive and effective candidate and public official,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\n\nHe said that Harris “would certainly have support.”\n\n“The question would be whether she’s the best candidate, and there will be a lot of debate about that question,” he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSenate Democrats are skeptical about their former colleague, former Vice President Kamala&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democrats Consider Possibility of Supporting Another Harris Campaign in 2028 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/democrats-consider-possibility-of-supporting-another-harris-campaign-in-2028/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-Democrats-cautiously-open-door-to-another-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 18:51:37","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.085},{"id":317785092,"title":"TikTok Gets Presidential Lifeline as Trump Considers Deadline Extension","text":"President Donald Trump has indicated he would extend the June 19 deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. assets if no deal is reached by that date.Newsweek reached out to the White House via email on Sunday for comment.Why It MattersIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a federal law that required ByteDance, TikTok's China-based parent company to sell its operations or face a nationwide ban. The ban later went into effect and the Chinese-owned app stopped working for Americans for about 12 hours.Trump signed an order that delayed the enforcement of the ban for 75 days until April 5, then later extended the deadline another 75 days to June 19.What To KnowIn a Sunday NBC News interview on Meet the Press with host Kristen Welker taped at Mar-a-Lago, Trump expressed willingness to see a deal completed, stating, \"I would... I'd like to see it done.\" Trump acknowledged having a \"sweet spot\" for the app that helped him win young voters in the 2024 election, adding, \"TikTok is - it's very interesting, but it will be protected.\"\"I won youth by 34 points. And there are those who say TikTok has something to do with it,\" Trump said at a press conference in Mar-a-Lago after his presidential election victory over Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in November.A divestiture deal has been in development that would create a new U.S.-based entity with majority American ownership, but this arrangement was suspended after China indicated disapproval following Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.Trump has previously appeared confident that a deal will come before the deadline and said during an interview on Air Force One in April that they have \"a lot of potential buyers\" and that there is \"tremendous interest in TikTok,\" according to Reuters.Potential buyers have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations, including:\n\nOracle with venture capitalist Marc Andreessen\nCryptocurrency foundation Hbar with OnlyFans co-founder Tim Stokely's startup Zoop\nProject Liberty (founded by former LA Dodgers owner Frank McCourt)\nA group involving internet celebrity MrBeast\nSearch engine Perplexity AI\nEarlier this year, there were rumors that Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was being tapped by Chinese authorities as a potential buyer of TikTok. However, TikTok shut down the reports, and in an email previously shared with Newsweek a spokesperson said: \"We cannot be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump said on Meet the Press that China was eager to reach an agreement, citing the impact of 145% tariffs on its economy: \"At some point, I'm going to lower [tariffs] because otherwise, you could never do business with them. And they want to do business very much.\"Trump, on Truth Social on January 19: \"SAVE TIKTOK!\"Vice President JD Vance, in an early March press release about the sale: \"There will almost certainly be a high-level agreement that I think satisfies our national security concerns, allows there to be a distinct American TikTok enterprise.\"TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in a video on the platform in January after the first ban was lifted: \"On behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"What Happens NextThe coming weeks will likely see intensified discussions among ByteDance, potential American investors, and government officials from both

Trump and his second administration.\n\nBut two disparate figures, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralised and fractured party.\n\nThe governor, a 60-year-old heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the congresswoman, the 35-year-old with working-class roots, both won their first elections in 2018.\n\nBoth have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more.\n\nEach has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists.\n\nBut as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different.\n\nAnd their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats.\n\nShould they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does?\n\nAnd beyond the message itself, what qualities should the best messenger have?\n\nWhat links them, said one prominent Democrat, is \"assertiveness\".\n\n\"People want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,\" said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics.\n\nOn that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez \"are both effective national figures – but in very different ways\".\n\nPritzker was born at the bridge of the baby boomers and Generation X into a sprawling family now entrenched in Democratic politics.\n\nLike Trump, he inherited great wealth, but he lambastes the president as a poser on working-class issues.\n\nHe chaired Illinois' Human Rights Commission before running for governor.\n\nIn office, he has signed an Illinois minimum-wage increase and is an ally of unions.\n\nHis family's hotels are unionised, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events.\n\nWhen Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement.\n\nHe made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state.\n\n\"Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity,\" Pritzker said in Chicago.\n\nSince Harris' defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate.\n\nOne of the nation's highest-profile Jewish politicians, he fired up liberals by comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich.\n\n\"If you think I'm overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: it took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,\" the governor said in February.\n\n\"All I'm saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.\"\n\nPritzker bemoaned \"do-nothing\" Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside \"decades of stale decorum,\" and urged voters into the streets.\n\n\"Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilisation, for disruption, but I am now,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats, he added, \"must castigate (Republicans) on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.\"\n\nIt was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence.\n\nPritzker wasted no time returning the volley, calling it \"terrible hypocrisy\" for Trump allies to complain given the Capitol siege on January 6, 2021, and Trump's pardons of the rioters.\n\nMeanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez is a millennial progressive with degrees in international relations and economics. She worked as a waiter and bartender before entering politics.\n\nWith support from the progressive Working Families Party, she ousted a top House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in a 2018 primary.\n\nLike Trump, she leverages millions of social media followers.\n\nAlso like Trump, she is an economic populist.\n\nBut she comes from the left wing of US politics and without the anti-immigration and cultural conservatism of Trump's right wing or the alliances with billionaire business and tech elites.\n\nShe has recently headlined the Fighting Oligarchy tour with Senator Bernie Sanders, a two-time presidential candidate.\n\nThe tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's next political move seems less certain than Pritzker's.\n\nShe is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency.\n\nBut she appears poised to inherit the mantle of the 83-year-old Sanders' movement.\n\nShe freely criticises Trump. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she's made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades.\n\n\"For years we have known that our political system has slowly but surely become dominated by big money and billionaires, and time after time we have seen how our government and laws are more responsive to corporations and lobbyists than everyday people and voters,\" she said.\n\nShe advocated for \"living wages… stable housing… guaranteed health care,\" and blasted \"the agenda of dark money to keep our wages low and to loot our public goods like Social Security and Medicare\".\n\nShe also played up her roots: \"from the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing\".","summary":"Democrats are looking for the right message and messengers to lead the opposition against President Donald Trump in his second term.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/tycoon-and-ex-bartender-emerge-as-anti-trump-leaders-c-18583712","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18583712/551feb02aab5ddfaaf36a60351ca19e1d5f721b4-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 18:44:30","author":"Staff Writers","authors":["Staff Writers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.045},{"id":317783696,"title":"‘No fan of mine’: Trump fires back at network host, reminds her UAW praised his auto tariffs","text":"President Donald Trump touted praise for his tariffs from the president of the United Auto Workers during a Sunday interview with NBC host Kristen Welker.\n\nTrump imposed a 25% tariff covering imported cars, SUVs, crossovers, minivans and light trucks, in addition to parts including engines and transmissions, citing “national security concerns” in March. The “Meet the Press” host questioned Trump about the effects his tariffs on China would have on small businesses, to which the president immediately fired back.\n\n“You pick a couple of little businesses. What about the car business?” Trump asked Welker. “They’re going to make a fortune because of the tariffs. Did you know the head of the union, who was no fan of mine, Fain, Shawn Fain I guess his name is right? He didn’t endorse me, the Teamsters did, a lot of people did, a lot of unions did, but he didn’t. He couldn’t stand me.”\n\n“Now he’s saying, ‘Wow, what Trump’s done for the automobile… I can’t believe it.’ I assume he’s probably going to say the next thing he can say which is, ‘I endorse this guy, he’s the greatest I’ve ever seen,’” Trump continued. “He said, ‘We’ve been waiting 40 years for somebody to do what Trump is doing.’ So why don’t you mention the big car industry instead of somebody that’s doing strollers?”\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain engaged in an 11-minute verbal battle with MSNBC hosts Alicia Menendez, Symone Sanders-Townsend and Michael Steele April 4 over tariffs imposed by Trump, arguing that they would bring manufacturing back to the United States. While the leadership of the UAW backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, with Fain labeling Trump a “scab” during the Democratic National Convention, many rank-and-file members of the union backed Trump, helping propel him to securing Michigan in 2024.\n\n“We are ecstatic to see an administration finally address the unfair trade laws in this country,” Fain said in video posted to social media March 27. “These laws have destroyed the American working class. They’ve destroyed communities in this country, in virtually every state, for decades.”\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent told Fox News host Sean Hannity Thursday that the Trump administration was negotiating trade deals with 17 major trading partners of the United States.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But why?","text":"For years, President Donald Trump blamed \"communists\" for his legal and political troubles. Now, the second Trump administration is deploying that same historically loaded label to cast his opponents — from judges to educators — as threats to American identity, culture and values.\n\nWhy? Trump himself explained the strategy last year when he described how he planned to defeat his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in the White House election.\n\n\"All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody who is going to destroy our country,\" he told reporters at his New Jersey golf club in August.\n\nTrump did just that — branding Harris \"comrade Kamala\" — and he won in November. With the assent of more than 77 million Americans who cast ballots — 49.9% of the vote — Trump is carrying that strategy into his second term.\n\nWhat he's talking about is not actually 'communism'\n\nIn 2025, communism wields big influence in countries such as China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba. But not the United States.\n\n\"The core of communism is the belief that governments can do better than markets in providing goods and services. There are very, very few people in the West who seriously believe that,\" said Raymond Robertson of the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government & Public Service. \"Unless they are arguing that the government should run U.S. Steel and Tesla, they are simply not communists.\"\n\nThe word \"communist,\" on the other hand, can carry great emotional power as a rhetorical tool, even now. It's all the more potent as a pejorative — though frequently inaccurate, even dangerous — amid the contemporary flash of social media and misinformation. After all, the fear and paranoia of the Russian Revolution, the \"Red Scare,\" World War II, McCarthyism and the Cold War are fading into the 20th century past.\n\nBut Trump, 78 and famous for labeling people he views as obstacles, remembers.\n\n\"We cannot allow a handful of communist radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws,\" Trump said Tuesday in Michigan while celebrating his first 100 days in office. The White House did not reply to a request for what Trump means when he calls someone a \"communist.\"\n\nThe timing of his use of \"communist\" is worth noting.\n\nTrump's Michigan speech came during a week of dicey economic and political news. Days earlier, The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs published a poll showing that more Americans disagree with Trump's priorities so far than agree with them, and that many Republicans are ambivalent about his choices of focus. After the speech, the government reported that the economy shrank during the first quarter of 2025 as Trump's tariffs disrupted business.\n\nOn Thursday, senior presidential aide Stephen Miller stepped to the White House podium and uttered the same c-word four times in about 35 minutes during a denunciation of past policies on transgender, diversity and immigration issues.\n\n\"These are a few of the areas in which President Trump has fought the cancerous, communist woke culture that was destroying this country,\" Miller told reporters.\n\nHis collection of words offered a selection of clickbait for social media users, as well as terms that could catch the attention of older Americans. Voters over age 45 narrowly voted for Trump over his Democratic rivals in 2020 and 2024.\n\nSmack in the middle of Miller's sentence: \"communist.\"\n\n\"It tends to be a term that is loaded with negative affect, particularly for older Americans who grew up during the Cold War,\" said Jacob Neiheisel, a political communications expert at the University at Buffalo. \"Appending emotionally laden terms to political adversaries is a way to minimize their legitimacy in the eyes of the public and paint them in a negative light.\"\n\nA 'Red Scare'-era figure influenced a young Trump\n\nThe threat that communists could influence or even obliterate the United States hovered over the country for decades and drove some of the country's ugliest chapters.\n\nThe years after World War I and the Russian Revolution in 1917, along with a wave of immigrants, led to what's known as the \"Red Scare\" of 1920, a period of intense paranoia about the potential for a communist-led revolution in America.\n\n\"McCarthyism\" after World War II meant the hunt for supposed communists. It's named for Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican who conducted televised hearings at the dawn of the Cold War that drove anti-communist fears to new heights with a series of threats, innuendos and untruths.\n\nCulturally, the merest suggestion that someone was \"soft\" on communism could end careers and ruin lives. \"Blacklists\" of suspected communists proliferated in Hollywood and beyond. McCarthy fell into disgrace and died in 1957.\n\nThe senator's chief counsel during the hearings, Roy Cohn, became Trump's mentor and fixer in the 1980s and 1990s, when Trump rose as a real estate mogul in New York. The Cold War was more than three decades old. The threat of nuclear war was pervasive.\n\nCommunism started to collapse in 1989 and the Soviet Union was dissolved two years later. It's now Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut communism — at least in one form — lives on in China, with which Trump is waging a trade war that could result in fewer and costlier products in the United States. By week's end, Trump was acknowledging the potential consequences of his government stepping in: Americans might soon not be able to buy what they want, or they might be forced to pay more. He insisted China would be hurt more by the tariffs.\n\nThe real modern debate, Robertson says, is not between capitalism and communism, but about how much the government needs to step in — and when. He suggests that Trump is not really debating communism vs. capitalism anyway.\n\n\"Calling people who advocate for slightly more government involvement 'communists' is typical misleading political rhetoric that, unfortunately, works really well with busy voters who do not have a lot of time to think about technical definitions and economic paradigms,\" he said in an email. \"It is also really helpful (to Trump) because it is inflammatory, making people angry, which can be addictive.\"","summary":"A 'Red Scare'-era figure influenced a young Trump","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-communists-harris-china-b2744733.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/06/11/09/flags-xi-trump-putin-indycomp.jpeg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 18:31:48","author":"Ap Correspondent","authors":["Ap Correspondent"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":317776328,"title":"Citadel’s Ken Griffin faces MAGA attack at Milken Institute shindig: ‘nationalists versus globalists’","text":"Allies of President Trump are angling for a showdown with tariff-bashing hedge fund mogul Ken Griffin at a glitzy Los Angeles shindig for financial elites this week — with Steve Bannon casting it as “nationalists versus globalists in Beverly Hills,” The Post has learned.\n\nCitadel boss Griffin traditionally hosts the VIP champagne-fueled welcome soirée at the Milken Institute Global Conference, an annual gathering for America’s top corporate titans dubbed the “Davos of the West,” and is one of the California forum’s main sponsors.\n\nBut this year, as he helps open the up-to $50,000-a-head boondoggle at the Beverly Hills Hilton, Griffin will face a rival reception hosted at the same hour at the Peninsula Beverly Hills next door — steathily organized by senior Trump advisor Ric Grennell.\n\nAn invite to Grennell’s uber-exclusive, behind-closed-door event obtained by The Post will also feature brief remarks from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that kicks off at 4 p.m. Pacific Time on Sunday.\n\n“It will be your only chance of talking to Bessent in private,” said one source, who said that a few dozen hand-picked heads of state and Wall Street titans would be in attendance.\n\nSources close to the organizers, Tactic Global, a DC-based consultancy, said the event — which has not been formally announced — had just 75 places.\n\nSources told The Post that the rival event was set up after Griffin repeatedly irked the administration with his relentless public criticism of the president’s trade and immigration policies.\n\n“It will be nationalists versus the globalists in Beverly Hills,” former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told The Post.\n\nThe Post has approached a Citadel spokesperson for comment.\n\nGriffin, worth an estimated $42 billion, has blasted Trump for allegedly “eroding” the American “brand” over his Liberation Day April 2 announcement at the White House over his plans to slap tariffs on imported goods in a bid to bring back jobs to the U.S.\n\n“We put that brand at risk,” Griffin said last month. “It could take a very long time to remove the tarnish from the brand.”\n\nBannon slammed Griffin as “an out-of-touch, clueless billionaire” who “helped to fuel populist nationalism” in the US.\n\n“Ken Griffin said his most important effort politically was to stop populism.

This event underscored the mounting frustration among Suffolk County residents, who feel neglected by their Republican representatives.\n\n“My friends, we are being governed by morons,” Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, addressed the audience. “Yet, the more challenging the struggle, the more triumphant the victory.”\n\n“I know I’m not your first choice — it would have been better to have your own representatives here,” Raskin added, referring to local GOP Reps.

The horse was bred and is raced by Godolphin, the global stable owned by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.On Saturday, many reacted to the results, including Palin, who wrote in an X, formerly Twitter, post \"Providential&#128591;'Sovereignty' defeats 'Journalism.'\" She included a video of the race as well as a screenshot of a religious understanding of sovereignty. It reads: \"In the Bible, sovereignty refers to God's ultimate authority, power, and control over all things, including creation, history, and the lives of humanity.\"Sovereignty refers to supreme power or authority, often without interference, and is often used to describe control over a defined territory. The term carries symbolic and political weight, especially as Trump has, at times, referred to himself as a \"king,\" aligning with that imagery.Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News co-host, called out the media in his post, writing on X shortly after the race: \"Sovereignty > Journalism. On the track. And in 2025 America.\"Hegseth has been across headlines as the center of controversy over two Signal app chats that shared information about a then-forthcoming U.S. attack on Yemen. Notably, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to one of the chats.As MAGA supporters took to X to celebrate what they saw as a symbolic victory over journalism, some warned the metaphor could be foreboding.Journalist and political analyst Jeff Greenfield wrote on X: \"Let me be the first of thousands to over-interpret the Kentucky Derby by noting that the victory of Sovereignty over Journalism is an obvious metaphor for the power of the Executive Branch (Trump) over the press. This does not bode well.\"CNN anchor Jim Sciutto offered a different take on Sovereignty's victory, writing on X that he placed a bet on the horse in honor of Ukraine whose sovereignty has been under attack by Russia several times, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing Russian full-scale invasion since February 2022.\"I am not a bettor but in honor of my mom I always make one bet on the Derby,\" he wrote. \"For the first time in my life I followed my grandfather's advice and bet an exacta box. On: Journalism (for my field) and Sovereignty (for Ukraine). It was a winner.\"What People Are SayingBrenden Dilley, a host of The Dilley Show and MAGA supporter, wrote on X Saturday: \"How many more signs from God do you need to realize what his desire is for the United States of America and her people? How about a horse named 'Sovereignty' winning the Kentucky Derby over a horse named 'Journalism?'\"Charlie Kirk, the conservative founder and president of Turning Point USA, wrote on X Saturday: \"Sovereignty just beat Journalism to win the Kentucky Derby.

Jamie Raskin packs out LI town hall with nearly 2K residents: ‘We are being governed by morons’","text":"Nearly 2,000 residents packed a weekend town hall on Long Island with Dem Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin — a rare in-person political forum in a deep-red county where GOPers have been avoiding such events.\n\nThe massive turnout was so high that an overflow center was needed for the main site, the Patchogue Theater — and highlighted the growing frustration of Suffolk County residents who say they’ve been left in the dark by their Republican reps.\n\n“My friends, we are being governed by morons,” Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, told the crowd. “But the more difficult the struggle, the more glorious the victory.\n\n“I know I’m not your first choice — it would have been better to have your own representatives here,” Raskin added, referring to local GOP Reps. Nick LaLota and Andrew Garbarino.\n\nRepublican pols have been dodging local public town halls in favor of tightly controlled teleconferences or private events after several heated meetings in recent months.\n\nRaskin, who sits on key House committees, told the attendees that if Republican lawmakers won’t host in-person events, he’ll gladly travel to their districts and speak further with their constituents himself.\n\nThe congressman spoke and took questions on a slew of issues affecting the region — from proposed cuts to Medicaid and Medicare to the SALT cap, tariffs, taxes and inflation.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the Republican stronghold, Raskin said that while he primarily identifies as a “progressive liberal,” he also considers himself a “conservative” in the sense that he wants to conserve the Constitution, the environment, Social Security, individual rights and religious freedom.\n\nHe acknowledged that Democrats haven’t done enough to earn the vote of the working class.\n\nTrump won Suffolk County with about 55% of the vote in 2024 — a 10-point lead over Kamala Harris, according to data from the Suffolk County Board of Elections.\n\nSome residents said they left the event feeling inspired and hopeful, while others simply felt angry that their own congressmen won’t hold similar events.\n\n“Where I live out east, Congressman LaLota doesn’t have town halls,” said Jim Casey, a senior citizen who attended the rally. “He held one phone town hall in March, and he only took eight questions.”\n\nCasey and others told The Post they believe lawmakers who back the current economic agenda may be dodging accountability as prices rise because of tariffs.\n\nGarbarino held a virtual town hall in early April that drew more than 10,000 people, according to his office, though it is not clear how many constituents had the chance to speak.\n\n“I wish our representatives had the balls to face us in person and say the things they had to say to our faces like this guy did — and he’s not even from here,” said a resident who asked not to be identified, referring to Raskin.\n\nRaskin’s Patchogue appearance follows a nationwide tour he and other Dem progressives — including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crocket and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — have launched in recent months, targeting Republican strongholds in a bid to win over working-class voters.\n\nStill, not everyone welcomed the visit. Protesters circled the venue in trucks draped with Trump flags, blasting the song, “Sweet Victory.”\n\n“The Patchogue Theater should have never allowed that communist to speak there,” said a resident who did not attend the event and asked not to be identified.\n\nBefore the forum, LaLota released a statement calling Raskin a “hyper-partisan” liberal who is “completely out of touch with Suffolk County.”\n\nRaskin fired back by saying that if drawing nearly 2,000 people in LaLota’s own district is considered “out of touch,” then Republicans may be in for a rude awakening come November.","summary":"Nearly 2,000 residents packed a weekend town hall on Long Island with Dem Maryland Rep.

'The potential emergence of a proto-Cold War between the [United States] and China.' \n\nSinger also suggested at the time that a cold war breaking out over rare earth minerals wouldn't be too far-fetched. \n\n'I better not walk outside and see a damn drone,' one person commented under Sharpe's post. \n\nIn the game, drones are launched against US cities. Recently, China announced it had bird drones - devices that realistically look like the animal. \n\nThe birds were unveiled by China in August last year during the founding anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army, the biomimetic drone looks like a Eurasian tree sparrow and is believed to be an ornithopter.\n\nThe similarities were also likened to the TV show The Simpsons that is known for supposedly making predictions of things that have then come true.\n\n'\"Simpsons predicted it\" was way more jolly than \"CoD predicted it,\"' another commenter wrote. \n\n'Imma replay the game, just in case,' a third joked.","summary":"Call of Duty: Black Ops II takes place in 2025 and some players believe the game's storyline is coming true.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14668169/call-duty-black-ops-ii-truth-players-weird-ways.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/01/15/97919037-0-image-a-8_1746110217990.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 17:35:12","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.222},{"id":317762534,"title":"Donald Trump sports bulging muscles and lightsaber in bizarre Star Wars day AI image","text":"The White House has shared a new bizarre AI-generated image of Donald Trump as a muscular Star Wars character , but people have noticed a key detail his team might have missed. Donald Trump appeared as a Star Wars character in an official post shared by the White House today to celebrate the intergalactic franchise's day, celebrated every year on May 4. In the image, Mr Trump could be seen dressed in robes while brandishing a lightsaber as two bald eagles - the national animal of the US - and American flags stood behind him. The post was also captioned: \"Happy May the 4th to all, including the radical left lunatics who are fighting so hard to bring Sith lords (Star Wars villains), murderers, drug lords, dangerous prisoners and well-known MS-13 gang members back into our galaxy. You're not the Rebellion - you're the Empire. May the 4th be with you.\" But social media users were keen to point out a key detail that the White House team appeared to have missed before they posted the image, namely that Mr Trump appears to be a Sith Lord himself. They identified this awkward fact by noting the lightsaber he held is red, the colour used by baddies Darth Vader and Darth Maul to name a few. One social media user said: \"How do you not have one nerd on staff to tell you what colour lightsaber is good and what colour is bad?\" Another added: \"umm, red is the colour of the Sith.\" While a third posted: \"So you have the president a Sith lightsaber. You just counter-signalled your entire post. Congratulations, you should resign.\" Another said: \"Says a lot that the AI knew to give Trump a red lightsaber.\" The post has already gone viral, attracting more than 1.2 million views since being posted earlier today. It also garnered an estimated 25,000 likes and 7,600 retweets. While Mr Trump is portrayed as a Star Wars character, he has previously been slammed by franchise legend Mark Hamill who played Luke Skywalker in the original and recent trilogies. During last year's presidential campaign, Mr Hamill urged voters \"don't go to the orange side\" as he made an appearance at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The 73-year-old added: \"In the movies, I fought against make-believe evil. But we’re at a time in history where we’re fighting against real evil. So I beg you, please don’t go to the orange side.\" Unfortunately for Mr Hamill, the Republican went on to convincingly win the November Presidential Election against Democrat Kamala Harris. His White House has since regularly posted memes featuring Mr Trump, including one of him while dressed as the Pope, just days after Pontiff Francis died.","summary":"The White House marked the Star Wars May the 4th celebrations by creating a bizarre muscular AI-generated image of Republican President Donald Trump as a Sith Lord","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-sports-bulging-muscles-35168928","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35169000.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_White-House-shares-bizarre-Donald-Trump-Star-Wars-AI-picture-to-celebrate-May-4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 17:13:53","author":"Anders Anglesey","authors":["Anders Anglesey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":317752932,"title":"Cardinal Dolan doesn’t like AI image of Trump as pope: ‘I hope he didn’t have anything to do with that’","text":"New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan on Sunday said the now-viral AI image of President Trump as pope was god-awful.\n\nTrump and the White House shared the image on their online accounts Friday — just after the 78-year-old president joked that the Vatican should contemplate making him the Holy Father when asked by reporters who he’d like to see succeed Francis.\n\n“I hope [Trump] didn’t have anything to do with that,” Dolan said of the AI image, speaking after a Mass in Rome, where the cardinal is preparing for this week’s start of the conclave of cardinals, who will select the next pontiff. \n\n“Well, you know, it wasn’t good,” Dolan said of the computer-generated image.\n\nPope Francis died last month, the day after Easter Sunday, at age 88. \n\nLast week, when asked by reporters about Francis’ potential successor, Trump quipped, “I’d like to be pope. That would be my No. 1 choice” — before clarifying that he doesn’t actually have a top choice.\n\nBut the 47th president seemingly implied that he would like to see Dolan become pope.\n\n“I must say, we have a cardinal that happens to be out of a place called New York who’s very good, so we’ll see what happens,” Trump said.\n\nTrump considers himself a non-denominational Christian, while first lady Melania Trump and Vice President JD Vance are Catholics.

Plus, polls are a joke | Friendly Fire","text":"Julie Roginsky, a Democrat, and Mike DuHaime, a Republican, are consultants who have worked on opposite teams for their entire careers yet have remained friends. Here, they discuss the week’s political events with Star-Ledger editor Enrique Lavín.\n\nNote: News of longtime Star-Ledger and NJ.com politics reporter Matt Arco’s death arrived as Friendly Fire was in production.\n\nJulie: I am incredibly shocked by the passing of Matt Arco, a fantastic reporter for this newspaper who was an even better person. To his husband and family and to the NJ Advance Media family, I am so very sorry. Matt was among the best of us and as his friend, I am gutted. \n\nMike: This is devastating news. As someone who played in the game Matt covered, he was all you could ask for in a reporter – fair, insightful, trustworthy and open-minded. Matt didn’t take criticism of a story personally and could push back with a smile. We are a better state for his contribution. I pray for his family and friends today.\n\nQ: April 29 marked President Trump‘s first 100 days in office. His administration touted Trump signed more legislation and executive orders than any other president in over half a century, including actions aimed at reducing regulations and promoting economic growth. How would you summarize his first 100 days?\n\nJulie: We are poorer, less safe, and more divided than we were 100 days ago. The executive branch has subsumed the legislative branch and ignored judicial decisions it does not like. We are sliding towards autocracy.\n\nMike: Purposeful chaos. Trump loves to have the media and his opponents screaming and yelling about controversies that are on his turf. Many of the controversies have been about his efforts to stop illegal immigration and to cut government spending. That’s good for him, but the chaos is starting to wear people down. His falling approval ratings show that. \n\nQ: The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are doubling down on deporting U.S. citizens who’ve been convicted of serious crimes. Similarly, he’s challenged other constitutional rights, such as birthright citizenship. Now he’s selling “Trump 2028” merchandise (yours for $50), while not saying flat out that he’s not running for an unconstitutional third term. What now?\n\nJulie: While we have all been fixated on the NFL draft, Trump is ignoring parts of the Constitution he does not like. It’s not an exaggeration to say that we are at the most perilous moment for our democracy since 1861. \n\nMike: Worse than the selling of campaign merchandise, where the proceeds go to the campaign, is the selling of digital coins and such that personally make him millions of dollars. No other president has been brazen enough to make money that way. He will continue to push Congress and the judiciary until they push back harder. \n\nQ: Speaking of the Constitution, the free press will more than likely be weakened even more in the near future. Paramount, owner of CBS News, is reportedly close to settling a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Trump, who claims CBS’ “60 Minutes” manipulated a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris, as the company seeks approval for a merger with Skydance. What do you make of this?\n\nJulie: If Trump can break “60 Minutes,” he can break other media organizations — all of whom have made mistakes but each of whom has produced incredible investigative journalism in the last half-century. It is a blow to democracy that they will soon be gone, even if the names remain intact and they soldier on for a while. Once cowed, they will never get their courage back. That’s how it works when you bend the knee. \n\nIndependent media, where content creators don’t answer to a huge corporate conglomerate with massive conflicts of interests, is the future. \n\nMike: The free press has a constitutional right to exist, but they don’t have a constitutional right to be above scrutiny or to make a profit. Questions about the truthfulness from the free press over the last 30 years are well warranted. The rise of conservative media has been because there has been a left-leaning bias in the mainstream press. Anyone who doesn’t admit that is fooling themselves.\n\nQ: The latest poll tracking the Jersey gubernatorial race has former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli ahead by miles (at 42%) among Republicans — he’s already started campaigning against the Democrat’s perceived front-runner, Congresswoman Mikie Sherill. But polling shows the race among Democrats is far from over. Is the GOP candidate locked in? What caught your eye about the Dem numbers? \n\n Julie: Come on. After all the public polling failures of the last gubernatorial election, are we still banking on polls to tell us which way this is going to go, especially in a tight, multi-candidate field? The GOP contest is not over as long as Trump’s endorsement is still up in the air. As for the Democratic primary, any one of these candidates can win by just several thousand votes or fewer, so that race is even less settled. \n\nMike: Jack certainly has a strong lead in the Republican primary. He’s running a strong campaign and he also benefits from the name ID built from the $25 million or so he spent in his previous two runs. The race could change now that Spadea is spending more serious money, and Bramnick continues to have his lane running a positive campaign. \n\nThe Democratic side, I agree Sherrill is the frontrunner, but I still think it is anyone’s game given one can win with a little over 20% of the vote.\n\nQ: The first set of May debates in the race to replace Gov. Phil Murphy starts next week with Republicans entering the ring on Wednesday, May 7 and Democrats on Monday, May 12. What storylines are you watching? \n\nJulie: I’ve run my share of debate prep for statewide candidates in New Jersey and loved doing it, so I am sorry to say that debates in this day and age don’t matter. These debates are like trees falling in the forest. The candidates will spend days simulating them, reading briefing books, gaming out strategy and practicing how to score a “moment” that most voters will never know about. \n\nWhat a waste of time. They should scrap the whole exercise and spend their time directly talking to voters instead. Go out and hold a rally. Host a town hall. Make some viral content that penetrates the bubble. That’s how you win an election in this era.\n\nMike: Republicans already had a debate and it was certainly spirited. The question is how hard will they go after the frontrunner? On the Democratic side, it is a very complex decision candidates must make because if a candidate is effective at attacking Sherrill, the attacking candidate is not necessarily going to benefit. \n\nOftentimes in a large field the candidate who does the attack is effectively hurting the frontrunner, but the voters reject the negative tones and look for one of the candidates uninvolved in the fracas.

During an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, the host asked Vance whether he believes Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could be the new face of the party.\n\n“President AOC, the stuff of nightmares, Bret, thank you. You’ve ruined my sleep for this evening,” Vance teased. “I don’t know.”\n\nBaier asked the vice president whether he thinks about the Democrat Party at all and who could be its new leader, following Trump’s defeat of former Vice President Kamala Harris and failed Democrat vice presidential nominee Tim Walz.\n\n“I think to the extent the Democrats have a leader, Donald J. Trump is the leader of the Democratic Party,” Vance said. “Because they’re just against everything that he does. Who could possibly disagree with rebuilding American manufacturing and ensuring these steelworkers have higher wages and better jobs?”\n\n“But any time Donald Trump does anything, they have this emotional response, they have to be against. Who could disagree with deporting millions of illegal aliens, many of whom are violent criminals? But they do, they have,” Vance added.\n\nIn March, a CNN/SSRS poll said the Democrat Party had dropped to a 29% approval rating— its lowest on record — marking a 20-point decline since January 2021. Among respondents, over 30% said they could not name a Democrat leader who “best reflects the core values” of the party. Of those who did, 10% named Ocasio-Cortez, 9% selected Harris, 8% chose Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and 6% wrote in House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\n“Whenever Donald J. Trump does something, they react negatively to it. They don’t have real leadership,” Vance said. “I think it’s why I’m not too concerned about 2028 because if I wake up in a fantasy world where the Democrats actually have constructive ideas about how to govern this country, that’ll actually be a good thing. But in the world that we actually live in, where they’re just anti-Trump about everything, the politics of 2028 will take care of themselves.”\n\nWith the 2026 midterms approaching and the 2028 general election on the horizon, speculation has swirled that Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are both eyeing their party’s presidential nomination.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

However, Gov. JB Pritzker from Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have notably increased their visibility by energizing a party that is both disheartened and divided through their compelling messages.\n\nGovernor Pritzker, at 60, is a wealthy successor to the Hyatt hotel legacy, while Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, aged 35, hails from a working-class background. Both leaders emerged victorious in their inaugural electoral campaigns in 2018. They have called for widespread resistance, criticizing their party for not being more combative. Their prominence has even provoked critical reactions from staunch Trump supporters.\n\nDespite sharing the role of spokesperson, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez exhibit contrasting styles. Their narratives, while sharing some common ground, diverge significantly, posing recurrent dilemmas for Democrats: Should their strategy against Trump hinge on highlighting dangers to democracy and national coherence as favored by Pritzker, or focus on depicting him as a wealthy opportunist worsening economic inequalities, as advocated by Ocasio-Cortez? Additionally, what characteristics define the ideal spokesperson for their cause?\n\nWhat links them, said one prominent Democrat, is “assertiveness.”\n\n“People want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,” said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez “are both effective national figures –- but in very different ways.”\n\nPritzker, an establishment power player\n\nPritzker was born at the bridge of the baby boomers and Generation X into a sprawling family now entrenched in Democratic politics. Like Trump, he inherited great wealth, but he lambastes the president as a poser on working-class issues.\n\nHe chaired Illinois’ Human Rights Commission before running for governor. In office, he has signed an Illinois minimum-wage increase and is an ally of unions. His family’s hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events. \n\nWhen Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state.\n\n“Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity,” Pritzker said in Chicago. \n\nSince Harris’ defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. One of the nation’s highest-profile Jewish politicians, he fired up liberals by comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich. \n\n“If you think I’m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,” the governor said his joint budget and State of the State address on Feb. 19. “All I’m saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.”\n\nAddressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned “do-nothing” Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside “decades of stale decorum” and urged voters into the streets.\n\n“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now,” he said. Democrats, he added, “must castigate (Republicans) on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.”\n\nIt was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. Pritzker wasted no time returning the volley, calling it “terrible hypocrisy” for Trump allies to complain given the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump’s pardons of the rioters. \n\nAOC, a progressive party crasher\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a millennial progressive who earned degrees in international relations and economics and worked as a waiter and bartender before entering politics. With support from the progressive Working Families Party, she ousted a top House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in a 2018 primary. \n\nLike Trump, she leverages millions of social media followers. Also like Trump, she is an economic populist. But she comes from the left wing of U.S. politics and without the anti-immigration and cultural conservatism of Trump’s right wing or the alliances with billionaire business and tech elites. \n\nShe has recently headlined “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops. \n\nOcasio-Cortez’s next political move seems less certain than Pritzker’s. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she appears poised to inherit the mantle of the 83-year-old Sanders’ movement.\n\nShe freely criticizes Trump. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she’s made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades. \n\n“For years we have known that our political system has slowly but surely become dominated by big money and billionaires and time after time we have seen how our government and laws are more responsive to corporations and lobbyists than everyday people and voters,” she said in Folsom, California. She advocated for “living wages … stable housing … guaranteed health care,” and blasted “the agenda of dark money to keep our wages low and to loot our public goods like Social Security and Medicare.”\n\nShe also played up her roots: “From the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing.”\n\nLittle consensus on the left about the better pitch\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Pritzker are allied against a common opponent, Trump, and not each other. Advisers to Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker did not respond to questions.\n\nAdam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argues Pritzker could be more attractive as a “traitor to his class” in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. An East Coast patrician, Roosevelt authored the New Deal’s federal expansion to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\n“How powerful would it be if a billionaire was the one helping to lead the charge against corrupt billionaires and corrupt billionaire corporations that are trying to crack the Constitution and loot the American people?” Green said, adding that “continued silence” on “billionaire issues” should disqualify Pritzker. “We have to be speaking to the shake-up-the-system vibe that people want to see.”\n\nMatt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, which typically backs centrist Democrats, countered that Pritzker could bring a “more stable” version of Trump’s argument that his wealth and success is an asset. Trump’s biggest liability, Bennett said, is “chaos” that negatively affects people’s lives.\n\n“People are very mad at Elon Musk, but not because he’s rich,” Bennett said of the Tesla CEO who is leading Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. “They’re mad at him because he’s vandalizing our government and doing it in a destructive way.”\n\nA relative of the governor, Rachel Pritzker, chairs Third Way’s board of trustees.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is often criticized by more moderate Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who has also positioned herself as a thought leader in the party. Slotkin recently suggested the word “oligarchy” didn’t resonate with working-class voters. It was an implicit rebuke of the Ocasio-Cortez-Sanders’ tour. \n\nShortly after Slotkin’s comments about oligarchy, Ocasio-Cortez posted on X: “Plenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness.” \n\nBennett said Democrats who emerge as party leaders, including the 2028 nominee, will be those who offer solutions for voters’ frustration “over their needs not being met.” It’s a notion that Green insisted is indistinguishable from criticizing the billionaire class, along with the tax and labor policies that drive wealth and income gaps in the U.S. \n\nWhatever direction Democrats choose, Bennett said, Ocasio-Cortez has secured her place as a national voice.\n\n“She’s very good at what she does. She’s formidable,” he said. “And anybody on the center-left who denies that is just kidding themselves.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nATLANTA – The billionaire heir and the former bartender.

The repeal of the pointless and inflationary subsidies should be a no-brainer layup for congressional Republicans. The opportunity to do so is coming up as part of the President’s much-anticipated Big Beautiful Bill. But now there’s drama.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022. Not a single Republican in the House or in the Senate voted for it. The bill was able to avoid filibuster in the Senate because the Senate Parliamentarian controversially determined that it qualified to be considered under the Senate’s reconciliation process. Even so, the IRA only passed Congress because then-Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate. (RELATED: STEVE MILLOY: What Exactly Have NIH Grants Got Us?) \n\nThe good news is that, because the IRA was enacted by reconciliation, it can also be repealed by reconciliation. That is exactly how Republican leadership plans to pass the Big Beautiful Bill, possibly as early as Memorial Day. The problem is that, while all Republicans seem to want to pass some sort of Big Beautiful Bill, not all want that bill to repeal the Green New Scam.\n\nA group of at least 21 Republican House members, none of whom voted for the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, signed a March 9 letter to Speaker Johnson warning against repealing the subsidies. “We have 20-plus members saying, ‘Don’t just think you can repeal these things and have our support,’” Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), who organized the letter, told Politico.\n\nWhat exactly is behind this resistance to a President to whom many of the letter signatories may very well owe their seats?\n\nWhile it’s often difficult, if not dangerous, to get in between politicians and their subsidies, the Biden administration made it especially so with the sheer amount of Green New Scam spending.\n\nAs of September 2024, Biden spent $147.4 billion in 41 states, including $63.7 billion in just seven 2024 battleground states. Eleven of the 21 signatories to the March 9 letter are from states that received at least $4.7 billion dollars. Eight signatories are from blue states and two are from ethanol subsidy-loving red states. Biden’s Green New Scam spending might be corrupt but it wasn’t stupid. These subsidies were obviously intended to purchase red state politicians so that it could be held over their heads and used against future repeal attempts.\n\nIn response to a recent X post by me about the letter, signatory Rep. Don Bacon (NE-02) wrote “Biofuels are important to Midwest. It is the reality.” He later added, “You might as well accept it… some of the tax incentives are going to remain. For one, folks already have invested billions based on the promise.”\n\nAnother piece of the resistance, according to two House members supporting the repeal with whom I talked, is coming from the oil and gas industry. The Inflation Reduction Act contains $8 billion in tax credits earmarked for carbon dioxide emissions capture and sequestration. This includes: (1) $85 per ton of emissions captured and sequestered from manufacturing and refining operations; and (2) $60 per ton of emissions captured during oil production.\n\nNone of this carbon capture and sequestration activity is meaningful to the climate. At best, it would amount to roughly 114 million tons of emissions captured and stored by 2031. Over that time period, global emissions will be on the order of 420 billion tons. That latter amount is about 3,700 times more emissions than the relatively trivial amount of emissions the oil industry would be paid $8 billion to capture.\n\nThe subsidy is outrageous waste, if not also fraud and abuse. First, the oil industry already has a tried-and-true business model that mints money without subsidies. Second, regardless of one’s views of climate science, the emissions capture and sequestration would be climatically insignificant. As trivial as the captured emissions would be to the climate, it’s not even clear that such a large amount of emissions could actually be physically captured and sequestered. Finally, President Trump is already undoing Biden’s regulations that hamstrung the oil and gas industry.\n\nYet the ungrateful oil industry is still demanding the subsidies. Its friends in Congress are willing to risk the Big Beautiful Bill, including maintaining the vital Trump 2017 tax cuts, for the sake of petty and pointless subsidies.\n\nCandidate Trump made his campaign promises. Americans voted for them and elected a Congress to enact them. No one voted for the subsidies. President Trump has issued the necessary Executive orders and directives. It is now time for congressional Republicans to do what they were elected to do: Repeal the Green New Scam.\n\nSteve Milloy is a biostatistician and lawyer, publishes JunkScience.com and is on X @JunkScience\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tim Walz Says Hello!","text":"Former vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz recently told an audience at Harvard’s Kennedy School that former Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as a running mate because of his uncanny ability to connect with the average Caucasian cisgender dude\n\n“I could code talk to white guys—watching football, fixing their truck,” he explained. “I was the permission structure to say, ‘Look, you can do this and vote for this.’”\n\nIt’s true, all the fellas are talking about “permission structures” these days.\n\nAlas, the White Guy Whisperer didn’t really help the Democratic Party ticket at all in 2024. Part of the problem, one imagines, is that the governor of Minnesota has an utterly deluded conception of himself as the embodiment of the working-class male. Though even if he were, few would have cared. Blatant pandering doesn’t go over well with any race or gender.\n\nFor one thing, guys who talk to guys never talk about how good they are at talking to them. Say what you will about President Donald Trump, he doesn’t “code” his language to appeal to the working class or anyone else. When he slams general managers for passing on Shedeur Sanders in the NFL draft, for example, you know the comment hasn’t been vetted by a bunch of pinhead pollsters or risk-averse handlers.\n\nYet, authenticity is about the last thing that came to mind watching Walz’s ham-fisted manly media stunts in 2024—not during his cringy Madden video game contest with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or his hunting outing where he struggled with a shotgun.\n\nNever mind, the notion of “white guys” being transfixed by a candidate simply because he also watches football is awfully insulting. Just because a couple of white guys talk about trucks doesn’t mean they agree on foreign policy.\n\nNow, we might have a propensity to read too much into things politicians say, but I think Walz’s white-guy code comment also speaks to one of the big problems hampering Democrats. They have an unnatural obsession with identitarianism.\n\nIt is tragically stupid and wholly un-American to approach people by race. On the most basic level, voters who define themselves, or let others define them, by immutable characteristics undermine their self-worth and free will.\n\nThere’s no such thing as “white guys” in anything but a physiological sense. Trump and I are both white guys born in Queens, though, admittedly, one of us has been marginally more successful. Still, a white Southern Baptist from Georgia probably gets Trump, a billionaire who’s lived a gold-plated existence, in ways I don’t. And a white Evangelical guy from rural South Carolina, a Catholic white guy from Arizona or an atheist white guy from Oregon all have different sets of cultural values, interests and quirks.\n\nA minuscule number of racists find their identity in being “white.” I’ve never once in my life wondered what other “white people” were thinking or doing or saying, nor has a normal person.\n\nYet, the Democratic Party is a coalition cobbled together by identity politics. It’s one of the reasons they are compelled to expend so much energy painting the opposition as a bigoted enemy.\n\nThe Left has gambled on the idea that ethnic demographics would transform the electorate and destroy the “white” Republican Party. No such luck. Democrats see the world in swaths of color and believe everyone has a similarly blinkered view of the world.\n\nFor years, Republicans pandered to Hispanics and black voters to try to expand their coalition, altering policy and lifting minority candidates for the sole purpose of connecting to voters through identity.\n\nIt never works because identity politics have always been overrated. Generational voting patterns and regionalism have far more powerful effects on who we support. And citizens in urban areas tend to vote for Democrats who align with their moral outlook. Urban areas have more minorities. The rural public votes for more traditional values. The political conflict isn’t about color but worldview. If racial divisions exist, it’s often because they are lumped together by the modern Left.\n\nIncidentally, one of the benefits of federalism and local control is that it allows these disparate people to live under a single federal government that upholds some basic ideals. Democrats have spent years trying to centralize the federal government and appropriate institutions to compel people to adopt their own increasingly narrow and unhinged liberal sensibilities.\n\nAnd one of the most corrosive aspects of that worldview is projecting your own racial views onto others.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

They’ll do their best to grind the agenda to a halt.”\n\nMidterm elections historically are painful for parties in power. And Democrats believe Trump’s sagging poll numbers and voter fears of an economic recession amid his trade war will be enough to win the narrowly divided House and give them a shot at the Senate majority, though the map is much tougher to flip that chamber.\n\nBut Trump is already showing intense personal interest in trying to buck the trend, Republican leaders say. In recent days, Trump has met privately with GOP leaders, including Johnson, to discuss candidate strategy and ways the White House can help in key races. Trump is signaling he will be fully engaged in the midterms, already planning more rounds of endorsements and offering to help in other ways, such as fundraisers and rallies, wherever he is needed, three GOP strategists said.\n\nAnd in the Senate, GOP leaders have been on an all-hands-on-deck push to woo perhaps their biggest recruit of the 2026 cycle: Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, along with Sen. Tim Scott, who leads the Senate GOP campaign arm, flew down to Atlanta over the Easter recess to discuss a potential run with Kemp and his wife, Marty. And the Georgia governor has sounded out senators for their advice, including Nebraska Sen. Pete Ricketts, a former governor himself, and Sen. Steve Daines, who used to run the Senate GOP campaign arm.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, Trump has spoken to Kemp about a potential Senate run — in February — when the nation’s governors were meeting in Washington, according to a source briefed on the conversation. While Trump made no commitments to Kemp, the fact that the president spoke with him has been viewed positively in GOP circles given that Trump lambasted the governor for years after Kemp refused to overturn the president’s 2020 election loss in Georgia.\n\n“It’s a very personal decision, but we’re going to give him every reason to run,” Thune told CNN, noting that Kemp was looking “over his options” and consulting with his family. “We’re all in.”\n\nIn multiple instances, Trump and his team have signaled they want to put up the best candidates — not simply the biggest MAGA acolytes — in a critical show of cooperation for a party that has been hobbled by ugly infighting over candidates in recent years, including between Trump and the party establishment in the 2022 midterms, according to multiple GOP strategists briefed on recent discussions.\n\n“They’re focusing on winning and finding the candidates that can win, period,” one GOP strategist said of the White House’s strategy.\n\nEven as Democrats believe Trump will be a huge liability for Republicans in the midterms, GOP leaders say they plan to fully embrace him — despite his polarizing politics — in a gamble to avoid their 2018 wipeout. One factor in their favor: Republicans are facing one of the narrowest House battlefields in recent memory, with roughly a dozen seats likely to determine the majority — with three Republicans holding seats in districts Kamala Harris won in 2024 compared with 13 Democrats in districts Trump carried.\n\nEven with some anxious about cratering poll numbers and ramifications of the trade war, many Republicans insist they can maintain control of Washington if they can successfully turn out Trump’s base.\n\n“President Trump’s gonna be crucial for us in keeping the House,” said Rep. Richard Hudson, the House GOP campaign chief, who met with Trump and his political team last week. “It’s gonna be critical for us to turn out that Trump coalition in the next election.”\n\nAsked whether swing-district Republicans should campaign with Trump next year, Hudson said: “Absolutely.”\n\nYet some swing-district Republicans are uncertain whether Trump will be helpful to their cause.\n\n“It’s always hard in a midterm year,” said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, one of the three Republicans in a district Harris carried.\n\nBut Bacon also revealed he’s weighing retirement, a decision he’ll make over the summer that will have big ramifications for a hotly contested seat pivotal for House control.\n\n“I have a chance maybe for a third life,” Bacon said. “So just praying on it.”\n\nGeorgia on their minds\n\nKemp, the term-limited governor, has been torn about a possible run for Senate. He has, nonetheless, been the subject of a concerted lobbying push from the many Senate Republicans who believe that Georgia — and specifically, Kemp — hold the key to their midterm map.\n\nIf Kemp were to run, top Republicans believe it would give them their best shot at taking down first-term Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff — and make it nearly impossible for Democrats to flip the Senate, which stands at a 53-47 GOP advantage.\n\nDaines, the former Senate GOP campaign chief who is close to Trump, recently spent 30 minutes on the phone with Kemp. Daines said the two spoke extensively about life in the Senate.\n\n“He showed great interest [in] what the Senate is about, what it’s like, what you do here as a senator, and I tried to give him as much of my own experience from the inside, so that he has as much information as possible to make a decision,” Daines said of the phone call with Kemp.\n\nRicketts, the former Nebraska governor-turned-senator, hosted Kemp and other GOP governors for dinner at his townhouse earlier this year, in addition to multiple personal calls on the subject of running for Senate, according to a person familiar with the outreach.\n\nIt was during that same governors’ trip to Washington that Trump spoke to Kemp, the first source said. That same night, the president also offered effusive praise for the governor in his public remarks, calling him “fantastic” and thanking him for helping him win Georgia in 2024. “We did a great job together, and I appreciate it. We won’t forget it,” Trump said at the time.\n\nThat Georgia seat is seen as one of the GOP’s top pickup opportunities, alongside the open seats in Michigan and New Hampshire. The GOP is also on defense in two potentially difficult races in both Maine and North Carolina, while facing a bitter intraparty primary in Texas that could cost party resources and give Democrats an opening.\n\nMeanwhile, other Republicans are considering a run. Rep. Buddy Carter, who has represented a Savannah-area district for the past decade, has said he would look at the seat if Kemp does not run.\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the hard-right firebrand and staunch Trump ally, did not rule out a run, when asked by CNN.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of options open to me. There’s the governor’s race, there’s the Senate race, and then there’s my district, which I love,” Greene said, referring to her northwest Georgia district. Asked about Kemp as a possible candidate, she said: “I’ve always been a strong supporter of our governor.”\n\nDemocrats not eager to talk Trump impeachment as MTG offers warning\n\nBut Greene also offered a word of warning to Republicans as they plot their midterm strategy, saying talk of impeachment won’t be good enough to win if they don’t pass Trump’s agenda in Congress and deliver on what their voters are demanding.\n\n“If the Republican campaign message in the midterms is to vote for House Republicans and vote for Republican candidates for Senate to stop the Democrats from impeaching Trump, the American people are not going to care because they’ve seen that show twice, and it didn’t matter,” Greene said. “It won’t work.”\n\nBack home in Georgia late last month, Ossoff caused a stir in Washington when he told a town hall audience that Trump has “already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment.” Within an hour of those comments Friday night, three separate GOP campaign groups had unleashed attacks on Ossoff.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has said little about whether he would push to impeach Trump a third time if his party can flip the House next year, despite being pressed about articles of impeachment recently filed by from one of his members, Rep. Shri Thanedar. The topic has not come up in private leadership or caucus meetings this year, multiple Democrats said, though Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive firebrand, told CNN last week that impeachment “should absolutely be on the table” if Democrats take the House.\n\nBut inside party leadership, there is no appetite to undertake that push, those Democrats said.\n\n“This is not an exercise that we’re willing to undertake,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, the No. 3 House Democrat, told reporters last week.\n\n“That’s just dumb,” Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said of the impeachment talk. “That’s not going anywhere.”\n\nAsked about his town hall comments, Ossoff said he stood by them but demurred when asked whether Democrats should pursue impeachment if the party retakes the House next year.\n\n“As I said last week, that kind of misconduct, I think, exceeds virtually any prior standard for that kind of inquiry in the House,” Ossoff told CNN, saying Trump is enriching himself through a cryptocurrency venture. “I can’t predict what a future House will do.”\n\nAsked whether he is concerned that Republicans will now weaponize his impeachment comments into his 2026 race, Ossoff replied: “I stand by those comments 100% and I think that the GOP should be concerned that the incumbent president appears to be selling access.”\n\nAs for a potential Kemp run, Ossoff seemed undeterred.\n\n“I am ready for any challenger,” the 38-year-old Democrat told CNN. “The pool is open. We’ll see who runs and I’m prepared.”\n\nCNN’s Casey Riddle, Ali Main and Ileya Robinson-Williams contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/gop-amps-trump-impeachment-talk-110051668.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DPXWk2QWr85t7Tz1DdxBEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/01e20679b7e7f45586f5d2c527a747f2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 11:00:51","author":"Manu Raju And Sarah Ferris, Cnn","authors":["Manu Raju And Sarah Ferris, Cnn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.244},{"id":317698062,"title":"“SNL” Pokes Fun at Donald Trump’s Executive Orders: 'Next Is a Pardon for Author J.K.

K. Rowling and outlawing ghosts \"It's been 100 years since I became president ... excuse me, days. Wow, feels longer,\" he joked\n\n Saturday Night Live returned — and so did the show's political parodies!\n\n The late-night comedy sketch series continued its milestone season 50 on May 3, with an episode that saw Quinta Brunson serve as host and Benson Boone as the musical guest.\n\n During the Cold Open, James Austin Johnson returned as President Donald Trump, to mock his series of executive orders and wish to become Pope amid his first 100 days in office.\n\n “Your favorite president and perhaps your next Pope!” Johnson, 35, as Trump, 78, said. “It's been 100 years since I became president ... excuse me, days. Wow, feels longer.”\n\n Johnson went on to discuss how he has sparked election wins, \"mostly in Canada,\" and talked about his \"147 executive orders — everything from banning paper straws to defunding PBS,\" while joined by Mikey Day as the president’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n Day, 45, then presented Johnson with more executive orders for him to sign to reinstate Columbus Day, reduce interracial couples in TV commercials and pardon J.K. Rowling.\n\n \"We love Jackie,” said Johnson as Trump. “You know, she created a whole wizarding world, a wonderful place for overweight millennials to stake their entire identity well past the point of being cute. ‘I'm a Hufflepuff.’ No bitch, you work at Staples!\"\n\n Marcello Hernandez then appeared as Secretary of State Marco Rubio — just in time to be mocked by Johnson, and the spoof later concluded with Johnson's Trump signing more executive orders, which included outlawing ghosts and making The New York Times connections game easier.\n\n Later in the episode, during SNL's Weekend Update, anchor Colin Jost discussed Trump's AI-generated image of himself as the pope, which he posted on Friday, May 2, nearly a week after attending the late Pope Francis' funeral. \n\n \"Who posts a photo of themselves dressed like a guy who died a week ago?\" asked Jost, 42. \"Trump was at the pope's funeral.

Jalen Hurts, as well as 11 other players, including DeVonta Smith, Darius Slay and A.J. Brown, opted to skip the visit.

McGuire begins each video by declaring it’s the \"most trusted nightly news show,\" before specifying that the disclaimer only applied to a specific niche audience, such as people \"that take their steak medium rare,\" \"put half-and-half in their coffee\" or grew up watching \"Full House.\" While McGuire doesn’t take himself particularly seriously, the \"Unpack\" newscasts sometimes attract more viewers than many CNN programs. He held a moment of silence for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., when she deleted pronouns from her bio, often finds humor in the actions of President Donald Trump, mocks just about anyone in the news and warns viewers to \"stay away from the crazies.\" BARSTOOL’S DAVE PORTNOY SAYS YOUNG PEOPLE DON’T TRUST TRADITIONAL MEDIA, BUT THEY TRUST HIM A recent video poking fun at pop star Katy Perry’s 11-minute flight to space on Blue Origin was viewed 2.1 million times, and McGuire’s thoughts on Chipotle making their bowls smaller in April amassed 5.6 million. \"I would not say I'm a journalist because I think it kind of diminishes actual journalists. I do the journalisming thing. Where I say, ‘Oh, this is great journalisming,' but… it's not even a word, like I made that up, I made it into a verb. It's not real… it's kind of a joke,\" McGuire told Fox News Digital. McGuire says it’s probably not a great sign for society that anyone would rely on him for news and his show is not \"100% journalism\" and was originally intended to simply entertain. However, he believes the modern media landscape that offers something for everyone is an improvement from the \"draconian\" era when Americans were forced to rely on ABC, NBC, CBS and print newspapers for information. \"People talk about Walter Cronkite back in the day… how do we know that was truthful? It probably was, not to throw Walter under the bus, [he’s] an all-time great. One of the best ever. But is it better to have all these news sources, or just to have three? I would argue, probably, all these news sources, all these options… the state of consuming news is in a decent spot,\" McGuire said. \"I should never be a one-stop shop,\" he added. DAVE PORTNOY RIPS INTO GAVIN NEWSOM AS 'TRASH' AFTER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES NEW PODCAST McGuire, who has piled up over 1.1 million followers on TikTok alone, started his Barstool career as a summer intern and eventually worked his way onto the social media team before landing a full-time role when he graduated from college in 2019. McGuire’s first attempt to pivot from a behind-the-scenes social media guy to front-facing content producer didn’t go so well. He was asked to be part of the \"Barstool College Football Show\" with company heavyweights, including Barstool founder Dave Portnoy himself. \"I did so poorly on the first show, Dave kicked me off… from there, I was kinda told, ‘Don’t do content,’\" McGuire said. \"I just kind of ignored that.\" McGuire continued his role on the social media team while putting out short-form video blogs that quickly resonated. In 2023, Portnoy famously bought Barstool back from PENN Entertainment for only $1 when the gambling company he previously sold the company for about $500 million wanted to move in a different direction and partner with Disney’s ESPN. MEDIA BAD BOY BARSTOOL SPORTS THRIVING IN POLITICALLY CORRECT CLIMATE: ‘WE'RE PRETTY RARE’ Portnoy’s windfall was also a win for McGuire, who had built up a passionate following since he was swiftly booted off the college football show. \"Dave approached me after he bought the company back and was like, ‘Hey, we see all these numbers you're putting up. Would you want to move from social just to doing content?'\" McGuire said. McGuire embraced the new role and set out to publish a new episode of \"Unpack with Jack Mac\" at least six times a week for an entire year before assessing its future. He often touched on current events in his short-form videos before they were even packaged as a quasi-newscast, and declared the scandal-plagued Tiffany Henyard, the mayor of Dolton, Ill., as the \"funniest, most corrupt politician\" in America back in 2023 – more than a year before the Democrat lost her bid for reelection. McGuire said he’s a \"child of the internet,\" and all his experience online gives him a good sense of what will amuse his audience. \"You kind of have a gut feeling. You see that Tiffany Henyard thing, and you think to yourself, ‘OK, I know this is funny. How do I make it digestible in a way that people will find it as funny as I do?’\" McGuire said. \"That's kind of the goal and struggle and challenge of content creating,\" he continued. \"You know you have to catch somebody's attention within three to five seconds on this app.\" 'SUPER MAYOR’ TIFFANY HENYARD SKIPS DOLTON MEETINGS AS CONTROVERSIAL TENURE NEARS QUIET END McGuire has become influential enough that former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign considered doing some sort of video with him at the height of election season. \"I honestly thought it was a joke,\" he said, noting that it \"ended up not working out\" but he planned to be respectful while mixing in some humor. \"There was jokes... in the office that it's like, ‘Oh, you could flip the election. What if she just dominates you and this is her huge moment, and they call it the ‘Jack Mac Effect’ in the textbooks? Obviously that wasn’t going to happen, but I did think about that a little bit,\" McGuire said. McGuire says he's not a journalist, but he isn’t sure if he falls into the \"influencer\" category, either. He feels people like the often-viral Alix Earle are the true social media influencers. Either way, he hopes that Portnoy, who he called a \"pretty damn good boss,\" has come around since kicking him off the college football show after one episode. McGuire said Portnoy has joked the viral newscasts are \"cringe,\" but said the Barstool boss continues to sign his paychecks and hasn’t told him to stop producing \"Unpack.\" \"Dave Portnoy, I don't think will ever really be a fan. Look, it's different. It's like, ‘Will he be a fan of Jack Mac?’ No, probably not… But I think he respects me. Or maybe, who knows? But I do think he does,\" McGuire said.

The “first 100 days has far exceeded that of any other presidency in this country ever,” said Pam Bondi. “Most” of the presidents whose portraits adorn the Oval Office – which include George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan – were mere “placeholders” who were not “men of action”, mused JD Vance.\n\nBefore the TV cameras on Wednesday, top cabinet officials took turns drenching Donald Trump with praise that some critics found evocative of politics in North Korea. Yet beyond the walls of the White House, the mood was shifting. New data showed the economy is shrinking. The national security adviser was about to be ousted. Opinion polls told of a president whose unpopularity is historic.\n\nAfter a hundred days in which Trump at times appeared invincible, political gravity is exerting itself. A majority of Americans regard him as both a failure and a would-be dictator. From the courts to the streets, from law offices to college campuses, revolt is swelling. Republicans are eyeing next year’s midterm elections with nervousness.\n\n“The honeymoon is over,” said John Zogby, an author and pollster. “He actually squandered his hundred days, perhaps you can argue, by doing too much, not succeeding with much of it and overplaying his hand. At the end of the 100 days his polling numbers reflect an unsuccessful quarter. Every poll that I know of, including mine, has him upside down.”\n\nTrump took office on 20 January with huge political capital. He had beaten his election rival Kamala Harris in every swing state and won the national popular vote for the first time, albeit at less than 50%. Having survived four legal cases, his sense of vindication was absolute. Tech billionaires and media moguls came to his Mar-a-Lago estate to kiss the ring.\n\nHe started fast and furious. As Trump signed a record number of executive orders – now more than 140 – Democrats looked like a boxer dazed by a flurry of punches at the opening bell. They struggled to find their feet and respond to a president who at breathtaking speed marginalised Congress, attacked judges and unleashed Elon Musk to eviscerate the federal government.\n\nMichael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “The reality is you do it fast, you do it furious, you do it at different times and levels and places and you wind up creating 100 rabbit holes at one time. People are stuck trying to figure out which is the most important rabbit hole to go down. That’s what you’ve seen play out.”\n\nYet 2 April, which Trump dubbed “liberation day” as he announced sweeping global tariffs, may also come to be seen as overreach day. His haphazard trade war rattled allies and wiped trillions of dollars off the stock market. Only fears of a bond market catastrophe spooked him into hitting the pause button. But he left in place tariffs on China as high as 145% and Beijing has refused to blink.\n\nThe chaos has shaken the faith of Trump voters who felt that he would at least deliver economic competence and guarantee the bottom line. Food prices are rising and tariffs are expected to disrupt supply chains soon, leading to empty shelves reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic. On Wednesday Trump admitted children might “have two dolls instead of 30 dolls” at Christmas and sought to blame his predecessor Joe Biden.\n\nMeanwhile Musk has sown further discord. Tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs. The US development agency USAID, a crucial tool of soft power, was closed. The social security welfare system has reportedly been hit by regional office closures, website crashes and some recipients being declared dead. Yet Doge looks set to fall well short of its $1tn target in savings and Musk is preparing to step away.\n\nTrump is even losing public backing on his signature issue of immigration. He sent troops to the border and expanded deportation targets, leading to a steep drop in illegal border crossings. But efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act for rapid deportations have faced legal challenges and concerns about due process.\n\nThe aggressive enforcement led to the mistaken deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland man with protected legal status, to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The supreme court ordered the administration to facilitate his return but Trump has refused.\n\nTrump promised to swiftly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza but both conflicts continue. His national security adviser, Mike Waltz, mistakenly added a journalist to a sensitive Signal chat discussing military operations. On Thursday it emerged that Waltz would leave his post and be nominated as US ambassador to the UN instead.\n\nTrump vowed to be a “dictator” on “day one” but, critics say, his pretensions to authoritarianism have been undercut by the ineptitude that derailed his first term and led to a crushing defeat in 2020. He has the lowest approval rating at the 100-day mark of any president in the past 80 years.\n\nAccording to a poll published by the Washington Post newspaper and ABC News, only 39% of Americans approve of how Trump is conducting his presidency. About 64% of respondents said he was “going too far” in his efforts to expand presidential powers.\n\nAnother survey by the Decision Desk HQ survey showed 44% approval and 56% disapproval. It also found that 64% of respondents said tariffs hurt consumers, and 91% were worried about inflation, with 62% “very concerned”. The Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) thinktank found that 52% agreed Trump was “a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy”.\n\nOpposition is manifesting itself in myriad ways and cutting Trump down to size. About 50 of his executive orders have been partially or fully blocked by courts, while about 40 have been left in effect, according to a count by the Associated Press.\n\nAnti-Trump demonstrations are growing in scale and frequency in cities and towns across the country. Democrats are holding raucous town halls in traditional Republican territory. After initially buckling under Trump’s “days of thunder”, law firms, non-profits and universities have found a spine and are feeding off one another’s resolve. Political commentators sense that the momentum is shifting.\n\nCharlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: “What Trump had going for him was he created this sense that he was an irresistible force, that resistance was futile, that everyone had to accommodate his whims and his agenda.\n\n“But now you’re seeing the supreme court pushing back on him, the markets expressing alarm and his poll numbers going south. The shock and awe which seemed irresistible for so long now seems to be encountering much more resistance.”\n\nTrump is not the first president to feel the pinch of political gravity. Biden started positively but saw his approval rating dip below 50% for the first time in August 2021, following the botched US military withdrawal from Afghanistan, according to an NBC News poll, He never recovered.\n\nA sustained backlash against Trump could become a threat to Republicans who, while more devoutly loyal than ever, have to worry about their seats in Congress in the midterm elections in November 2026. Historically the party that holds the White House tends to suffer losses in the midterms. Republicans currently hold a narrow 220-213 majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nPatrick Gaspard, a former official in the Barack Obama administration, said: “I would not judge this presidency to be a success. More likely than not we’ll begin to see Republicans whose names are on the ballot in 2026 slowly but clearly moving away from this agenda. It’s very clear that many Trump voters already have buyer’s remorse.”","summary":"The president started his second term fast and furious with a flurry of activity – much of it legally dubious – but analysts say the honeymoon is over\n\n“Not just courageous” but “actually fearless” said Doug Burgum.

It's not livable. Fifteen years ago, it was the best city in the country, one of the best cities in the world, and now you can't do anything.\"That was President Donald Trump speaking on the campaign trail in 2024, offering a grim portrait of a city he claimed had become a cautionary tale of liberal governance. The idea of a \"no man's land\" city landed easily on social media and cable news, tapping into years of headlines about crime, homelessness and the tech exodus.But on the ground in San Francisco, a very different picture is emerging—one of slow but measurable recovery, image repair and political recalibration.With new leadership and renewed energy in City Hall, signs of economic recovery downtown and notable public safety gains, the City by the Bay is attempting a reinvention rooted in pragmatism, old money, and a new centrist narrative that cuts against its reputation of being an experiment in progressive politics run wild. Daniel Lurie, San Francisco's recently elected mayor and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, has emerged as a steady hand.\"There's a renewed optimism in San Francisco,\" said Danny Sauter, a Democrat serving as District 3 Supervisor, whose district includes North Beach, Chinatown and parts of downtown.\"For the first time in probably six or seven years, more residents are saying they believe the city is on the right track,\" he told Newsweek in an interview.After years of skepticism and ridicule—often amplified by national figures like President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who once compared the city to a town from \"The Walking Dead\" — local officials are beginning to see a shift in tone.\"People love writing San Francisco's obituary, but every time the world declares us dead, we come roaring back stronger,\" California State Senator Scott Wiener, another Democrat, told Newsweek. \"We've worked to make San Francisco more welcoming for business, including through tax reforms and improvements to public safety and public spaces.\"Central to the city's turnaround narrative are its improving crime statistics. Homicides have plummeted to their lowest level in six decades, with just 56 recorded in 2024, according to data published by city officials in February. That figure represents a 34 percent decrease from 2023.Behind the decline in homicides was a focused effort by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) to reduce shootings, which have historically been the leading cause of killings in the city. According to year-end data provided by the SFPD to Newsweek, firearm-related homicides dropped by 31 percent, while non-fatal shootings fell by 19 percent over the course of last year.District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, who was appointed after voters recalled ultra-progressive D.A. Chesa Boudin, credited improved collaboration with law enforcement as a key factor.\"We built strong partnerships with SFPD and other agencies—relationships that were very strained before,\" Jenkins told Newsweek in an interview on Friday. As part of that effort, Jenkins said the D.A.'s office and police have also expanded surveillance across the city to strengthen investigations and support prosecutions.The momentum has continued into 2025. SFPD data shows that homicides between January 1 and April 14 dropped by another 56 percent compared to the same period in 2024.\"This progress reflects our commitment to public safety while continuing to build trust in our communities,\" Mayor Lurie said in a public statement announcing the data.'Changing the Conversation'Perhaps the most noticeable change for San Franciscans is the shift in tone and visibility. While former Mayor London Breed was known for her speeches, she often struggled to turn her leadership into tangible results—a factor that contributed to her reelection loss.Although a Democratic victory was never in question — 63 percent of the city's registered voters are Democrats — Mayor Lurie, who took office early this year, has adopted a more visible, hands-on approach. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Emily Hoeven called it \"Trump-like\" in its focus on optics and media control.Hoeven wrote in an April column there was no denying Lurie \"has changed the conversation around San Francisco, even if the substance is still catching up to the slogans.\"That energy follows years of political turmoil in the city once known as the \"Paris of the West.\" In 2022, voters recalled Boudin, the progressive D.A. known for his criminal justice reform policies, amid growing frustration over crime and a sense of lawlessness. Former Mayor Breed responded by boosting police funding and focusing on public order, but her administration struggled with rising public safety concerns, slow police response times and backlash to widespread \"defund the police\" rhetoric.\"Toward the end, she became increasingly conservative,\" one resident wrote of Breed in the San Francisco subreddit, often called the city's digital town hall (Reddit has been based in San Francisco for nearly 20 years).Breed's base eroded as the city's moderate coalition, backed by tech donors and a growing bloc of Asian American voters, pushed for tougher stances on crime. At the same time, progressives held sway on issues like housing, where some of the most restrictive zoning in the country kept resident development stalled even as homelessness and encampments spread.Into that vacuum stepped Lurie, a wealthy political newcomer with deep local roots and a deft media strategy. \"Lurie walks around the city, talks to people, visits troubled areas, listens to neighbors—he's very hands-on,\" said one longtime resident in a statement to Newsweek. \"He's no different politically, but he brings strong energy.\"That shoe-leather strategy has helped shift the narrative. \"Public perception had been gradually improving, but it really accelerated recently,\" Wiener, the state senator, said. \"We're seeing more visitors posting on social media about how great their time was in San Francisco. Many say they were misled about how bad it was.\"Signs of Life DowntownWhile downtown San Francisco remains under pressure—with high office vacancy rates and many shuttered storefronts —signs of life are returning. In April, the retailer Zara reopened a new flagship store in Union Square, and Nintendo announced plans for a high-profile retail launch. Major events like the InnoStars conference have drawn business travelers back, offering glimpses of pre-pandemic vitality.\"Businesses, small and large, are starting to take bets on San Francisco and make investments,\" said Sauter, the district supervisor. \"Residents are seeing improvements in cleaner streets and better city services.\"At the same time, the city is working to renew its identity as a national leader in tech and climate innovation. Recent investments in clean energy and regional AI hubs are attracting both capital and talent. City leaders are also advancing policies on housing, public transit and healthcare—seen as essential to long-term livability in a city where the median home price is about $1.3 million.Yet for all the momentum, the city is not out of the woods. No one in City Hall or elsewhere is claiming victory. \"We still have significant challenges,\" Sauter said. \"Homelessness, housing shortages, a downtown that's still partially empty.\"San Francisco's downtown continues to struggle with a commercial real estate crisis. As of the first quarter of 2025, the city's office vacancy rate stood at 34.7 percent—up from 33 percent a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The tech sector, once the backbone of the city's economy, has also contracted significantly, with more than 60 companies relocating their headquarters since 2020.Such visual markers of decline remain hard to avoid. While some on the left argue that the narrative around San Francisco's decay is nothing more than a media construct, it's no coincidence that it gained traction amid rising public frustration over the vexing and overlapping issues of crime, homelessness and housing costs.\"I think one of the biggest issues we face in San Francisco is the homelessness crisis,\" District Attorney Jenkins said. \"Many of those individuals are struggling with drug addiction—particularly to fentanyl right now.\"As a warning sign of what can go wrong under progressive leadership, San Francisco—California's most Democratic county—swung a full 7 points toward the Republican presidential candidate, even with hometown favorite Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.\"Neither California nor San Francisco can afford to fall into the trap of pursuing anti-Trump posturing at the expense of delivering measurable results for constituents,\" Hoeven wrote in a recent op-ed for the Chronicle.\"They now need to demonstrate that they can deliver the basics for their residents: a high-quality public education, safe and clean streets, abundant housing, and an efficient, well-run government.\"There are also concerns about how new enforcement strategies affect marginalized communities. GLIDE, a local social justice organization, told Newsweek on Friday that while fewer reported crimes improve safety, higher arrest rates and expanded surveillance—now including drones, license plate readers and increased filming of \"troubled locations\"—can disproportionately impact people of color, the homeless and those with substance use or mental health issues.\"It is critical that any use of surveillance tech comes with strong transparency, community input and strict protections to prevent misuse or over-policing of vulnerable communities. Trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve is vital, and any technology must support—not undermine—that trust,\" a GLIDE spokesperson said.In many ways, the city's struggle to rebound mirrors that of other American cities grappling with the triple shock of COVID-19, economic realignment and political polarization. But what sets San Francisco apart is the symbolic weight it carries — a place home to some of the wealthiest companies and entrepreneurs in the world, set against a backdrop of breathtaking natural beauty. The city is now fighting on two fronts—against an external narrative of decline and an internal reckoning with its political identity.For the first time in years, however, the trajectory appears to be shifting upward.\"San Francisco is incredibly resilient,\" said Wiener. \"People still have frustrations, but many say they feel safer. They notice fewer car break-ins, fewer encampments—there's a growing sense that things are improving.\"","summary":"Written off as hopelessly broken, the City by the Bay is recalibrating—fighting back against crime, restoring order, and reclaiming its lost identity as one of America's great cities.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/san-francisco-crime-new-mayor-comeback-2067442","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2637873/san-franciscos-great-american-comeback.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 10:00:02","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.373},{"id":317695552,"title":"Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries rips Trump budget cuts at desert town hall","text":"One day after President Trump proposed a budget that would deeply slash the federal government, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Saturday vowed that his party is unified in their opposition to cuts to Medicaid, Social Security, veterans’ services and other safety-net programs for vulnerable Americans. “We are committed to doing everything we can at this moment to stop the Republicans from trying to jam this reckless, extreme budget down the throats of the American people,” he told a few hundred people gathered in a high-school performing arts center for a congressional town hall. “It will hurt children and families and seniors and women and older Americans and Americans with disabilities. Hospitals will close, nursing homes could shut down, and in fact, people could die.” Jeffries said the budget comes from an out-of-control Trump administration, and described the proposal as un-American and unconscionable. “We’re going to do everything we can to stop this budget in its tracks, bury it in the ground and make sure it never rises again,” he said. Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, criticized Jefferies' appearance at the town hall, calling him \"delusional, destructive, and drenched in hypocrisy.\" The event occured in the congressional district of one of Trump's late rallies in the 2024 presidential campaign. The event was the first stop on a nationwide tour of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, as well as a town hall hosted by Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Indio). Ruiz represents all of Imperial County and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, including Cathedral City, Indio, Coachella, El Centro, Calexico, San Jacinto, Hemet and Needles. In recent elections, the district has been viewed as safely Democratic. But earlier this year, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report deemed it “likely Democratic” because of Trump’s performance in the region in the 2024 election. In 2024 the president won 10 counties in California that voted for Biden in the previous election, including three in Southern California, and lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris in Ruiz’s district by a scant two points. Ruiz far outperformed his fellow Democrat, winning the district by 13 points. But depending on who the GOP congressional candidate is in next year’s midterm elections, and whether the party puts resources behind him or her, the race could be more competitive in 2026. First elected to Congress in 2012, Ruiz said he was especially concerned about potential cuts to Medicaid, which provides healthcare coverage for low-income Americans and is known as Medi-Cal in California, because of his experience as a physician. \"I have anxiety because many of the patients I took care of were on Medi-Cal, and I know that without Medi-Cal they won't get their treatment, and they'll come in, even in more dire circumstances, into the emergency department,\" he said. He argued that the budget cuts Trump is proposing are so large that there is no way to enact them without cutting Medicaid. Ruiz said he was told by the Inland Empire Health Program that three hospitals in his district will probably have to close if there are significant Medicaid cuts. \"So if you don't have Medicaid, where are you going to go? If there's an emergency, where are you going to go to get your chronic care?\" Ruiz said. \"So this affects all of us.\" Ruiz's comments were in response to a question from an audience member about healthcare. Other inquiries concerned deportations, due process, Social Security and cuts to federal departments including the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Education. The town hall also featured Rep. Nanette Barragan (D-San Pedro), a co-chair of the Steering and Policy Committee, and Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), the chair of the House's Democratic Women’s Caucus. The latter delivered an impassioned plea about the impact of federal cuts to the women who rely on federal healthcare coverage during their pregnancies and to their children. \"When those babies are born, we want them to be born strong and healthy,\" Leger Fernández said. \"And then those children will go to school, and we want to make sure that they are not hungry, right? Because kids cannot learn where their stomachs are growling. ... But right now, Medicaid, the nutrition programs, education, they are all proposed to be cut ... so that they can give trillions of dollars of tax cuts to the wealthiest who backed them.\" Jeffries said such efforts are part of a broader assault on the nation and democracy, and are why Democrats are holding town halls not only in their party's districts but also those represented by Republicans. \"Congress is a separate and co-equal branch of government,\" he said. \"We don't work for this president. We don't work for any president. We don't work for Donald Trump. We don't work with Elon Musk. We don't work for far-right extremists. We work for you, the American people.”","summary":"Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Saturday vowed that his party is unified in their opposition to cuts to Medicaid, Social Security, veterans' services and other safety net programs for vulnerable Americans.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-05-04/democratic-leader-hakeem-jeffries-rep-raul-ruiz","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a24e91d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1608x844+0+160/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Ff5%2Fabc98fd74f5c9f46eb862828bcfc%2Fme-raul-ruiz-hakeem-j","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 10:00:00","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":317656312,"title":"Election countdown - should Swinney be optimistic?","text":"Politics at home is vulnerable to the impact of global issues, whether that's import tariffs from the US President Donald Trump or the effects of conflicts in the Middle East, Ukraine or elsewhere.\n\nSome of these issues may change the context in which domestic debates take place.

But who? | Jim Fossel","text":"Ever since the November election, various people have been making excuses for why Kamala Harris lost. They range from her lack of time to wage a general election campaign to her closeness to an unpopular former incumbent to the division within the Democratic Party as a whole. These are all clearly laid out and knocked aside at the end of the excellent book “Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes.\n\nThey settle on an alternate explanation: She never forcefully laid out her vision for the country or why she was running.\n\nThat’s almost it, but it’s not quite the core truth of the matter: Harris was, simply, a bad candidate. She ran a bad presidential campaign in 2020, and she ran a bad campaign in 2024. Yes, that wasn’t made any easier by the unique circumstances, but she still had every opportunity to win and just couldn’t do it.\n\nThat’s something to keep in mind as we take a look at how the 2026 elections might play out. Recent numbers revealed by the Pine Tree State Poll, a States of Opinion Project poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire, reflect that. Regardless of whether one considers this poll to be high quality, Sen. Susan Collins would undoubtedly rather have better numbers in it. They show that she may be politically vulnerable, but they don’t show that she’s toast.\n\nAt the moment, she doesn’t have any high-profile challengers from within her own party. If the two declared candidates manage to make the ballot, it’s hard to imagine their campaigns being anything but quixotic. So, once we get beyond the June primaries, her numbers with Republicans will come up if she’s officially the nominee.\n\nWhile Republicans aren’t thrilled with Collins, it’s important to consider why: They’d probably mostly rather have someone more closely aligned with President Trump. There’s nobody like that in Maine who could win a general election, which is why she’s unlikely to face a real primary.\n\nThat person just simply doesn’t exist.\n\nThe question is not whether Collins is vulnerable, but whether Democrats have anyone available who could defeat her in a general election. At the moment, that’s an open question. Gov. Janet Mills is probably Democrats’ best choice, but she’s not exactly universally beloved. Her two gubernatorial campaigns initially looked like they might be competitive, but she ended up defeating both Shawn Moody and former Gov. Paul LePage handily. There are two interpretations of those results, and one is that they make her an appealing U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nThat’s an understandable argument. She’s the only potential candidate who’s run statewide before and won twice. She did that by seeming to be centrist, especially compared to the rest of her party, and by being from rural western Maine, rather than from Portland. She’s a skilled politician, as she’s proven time and time again, to the chagrin of Republicans in the Legislature. So, a promising candidate, right?\n\nWell, maybe not quite so much. Did she do well in those gubernatorial races because she was good, or because her opponents were terrible? Renominating LePage in 2022 was a mistake; the public wasn’t interested in returning him to office.\n\nWhen Moody ran in 2018, he wasn’t very politically experienced. He’d only ever run for office once before, as an independent in the 2010 gubernatorial race. While a personable, well-known businessman, he wasn’t politically savvy enough to separate himself from LePage in 2018 and make his own case — just like Kamala Harris couldn’t vis-a-vis Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nSo, while Mills is a strong candidate on paper, she hasn’t faced truly tough opponents in her statewide runs. Collins has faced a series of credible opponents, in both primaries and general elections, from Joe Brennan to Sara Gideon, on whom the Democrats wasted millions.\n\nCollins would be the toughest opponent Mills has ever faced, and ousting an incumbent is always difficult. She’ll have to run a disciplined campaign while raising more money than she ever has before.\n\nWhile Collins may look vulnerable now, turning bad poll numbers into real votes isn’t nearly as easy as it might appear. Voters have to be convinced not only that an incumbent is bad, but that the challenger is better. Mills may be the Democrats’ best option, but that doesn’t mean she can actually win. It matters who both candidates are, not just whether someone has bad poll numbers.\n\nLike former President Joe Biden said, quoting his father, judge me by the alternative, not the almighty.\n\nJim Fossel, a conservative activist from Gardiner, worked for Sen.

If he won, they would move abroad. The couple said they had been willing to give Trump a go during his first term, but they'd watched in alarm as he returned to office and ended a range of policies aimed at promoting racial equity and rights for LGBTQ+ people. We love this country, but we don't love what it has become, Davis, a 69-year-old educational consultant, said from their home in a New York City suburb. When your identity is being attacked, there is a personal sense of... anger (and) frustration. Now, they're working with an immigration lawyer to assess options in Europe. The couple is most interested in Portugal and Spain, attracted by the southern European lifestyle, and are looking at a digital nomad or retirement visa. Bartlett, who is 52, is retired. It saddens me to move, said Davis, who'll be sorry to leave her local community behind. But it's also a situation, politically and socially, that is unacceptable. Government visa and citizenship data, as well as Reuters' interviews with eight relocation firms, indicate an increased number of Americans are considering moving to Europe in the wake of Trump's election - though the figures remain quite small for a nation of 340 million people. U.S. applications for Irish passports were at their highest level in a decade in the first two months of this year. Average monthly application in January and February of nearly 4,300 were up around 60% from last year, according to data from Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs. In France, government data showed that long-stay visa requests from Americans stood at 2,383 in the first three months of 2025, compared to a total of 1,980 over the same period last year. From January to March, French authorities have granted 2,178 long-stay visas versus 1,787 the year before. And applications for UK passports in the last three months of 2024 - the latest period for which data is available - were a record of any quarter in the past two decades, with 1,708 applications submitted. Relocation companies and websites helping people emigrate say that, at any given time in recent years, a significant number of Americans have shown an interest in moving abroad, citing issues including political divisions and gun violence. Italian immigration advisor Marco Permunian, founder of Italian Citizenship Assistance, said the election of Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 led to an increase in interest too, mainly from Republican voters. But most of the relocation firms that Reuters spoke to said there has been a larger spike in interest since Trump returned to the White House, with many clients expressing concern over the direction of policy and social issues. OVERWHELMING DEMAND Some Hollywood stars left the U.S. after Trump's re-election in November, including talk show hosts Ellen de DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell, sparking media attention. Thea Duncan, founder of Milan-based relocation business 'Doing Italy', said she been receiving enquiries nearly every day since the election from ordinary Americans seeking information. People are uncertain about what's happening and what's going to happen, Duncan said. In Britain, a company of immigration lawyers called Immigration Advice Service said it had seen a more than 25% increase in enquiries from the U.S. Its director, Ono Okeregha, said several clients had expressed worries over political changes under the Trump administration, particularly over rights for same-sex couples as several states consider weakening protections for their marriages. Wendy Newman, a 57-year-old photographer, moved to London with her husband in 2022 in part because of the increasing political polarisation back home. She said she felt her rights were more secure in Britain, where she wants to stay permanently. She hopes her daughter, who still lives in the U.S. but is applying for university in Britain, can move too. We just feel like there's just too much at risk for her to stay there, said Newman, fearful of curbs on women's reproductive rights in the U.S. and what she described as Trump's misogynistic tendencies . Trump has denied repeatedly allegations of misogyny and sexual misconduct, describing accusations in 2017 as fake news . Blaxit, a company that helps Black Americans move abroad, saw traffic to its site jump over 50% following the election, its founder Chrishan Wright said. It has also seen a 20% increase in its paid membership community, Blaxit Global Passport, which costs $16.99 per month, she said. Wright, originally from New York, moved to Portugal two years ago and said Trump returning to the White House reassured her that she had made the right decision. According to an exit poll by Edison Research, Trump won just 13% of Black voters in November, 1 percentage point higher than 2020, while Kamala Harris garnered 86%. 'RELATIVE SAFETY' Also feeling disillusioned, a young transgender couple living in Colorado, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted, said they are hoping to secure a student visa to start a new life in Italy. Trump has said the United States would recognise only two sexes, male and female. He has also sought to restrict gender transition care for people under 19 and to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military. But they are under no illusion Europe will be perfect, as right-wing populist parties make political gains across the continent, including in Italy - where the conservative government portrays itself as a guardian of traditional values. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni vowed, when she came to power in 2022, to combat what she calls the LGBT lobby and to defend the natural family . In Germany, far-right Alternative for Germany came second in February's federal election. In neighbouring France, Marine Le Pen, leader of far-right National Rally party, had been a front-runner in opinion polls for the 2027 presidential election but was banned last month from running for office for five years. Wright, from Blaxit, said the political situation in some European countries was troublesome but many Americans remained interested in coming to the continent regardless. Knowing exactly how many people will follow through on their interest is difficult, said Julien Faliu, founder and CEO of online expatriate community Expat.com. Faliu said Expat.com saw an increase of around 26% in requests from Americans over the last two years. I've been talking to U.S. citizens who say: 'If Trump is re-elected, we will be moving'. He got re-elected, so now what are you doing? Faliu said. When there's an election, it's always like that. HURDLES EVERYWHERE There are many hurdles for would-be ex-pats. Relocate.me, a relocation platform, identified some of the disincentives: difficulties in securing jobs abroad, restrictions on remote work, lower salaries in Europe, and the U.S. tax system - which taxes its citizens on worldwide income. For those who proceed, however, there are several visa options. Digital nomads visa for remote workers in countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy are popular. Retirement visas, work permits and student visas are also in high demand, according to relocation firms. But some Europeans - already struggling to cope with mass tourism and a housing crisis - don't relish the prospect of more foreign arrivals. National authorities are restricting some controversial schemes that offered access to visas for the wealthy. The option of buying real estate to secure a golden visa is no longer a possibility in Portugal, and the Spanish scheme ended in April after the system was criticised for stoking an affordable housing crisis. Rebeca Caballero, from Spanish real estate developer Gilmar, said they had received an influx of interest from American clients in the six months before the scheme ended. I secured investments from three clients who bought homes for the golden visa without even coming to see them, Caballero said.","summary":"Following Trump's re-election, a notable number of Americans are exploring relocation to Europe, driven by concerns over policy shifts and social issues.

\n\nBecause members of the White House press corps all think and act in unison, as if they are members of a guild, they’ve already lost the argument.\n\nConsider that none of them saw any sign of Joe Biden’s cognitive decline — until it jeopardized his chances of beating Trump.\n\nInstantly, they all joined the call for Biden to step aside and anoint Kamala Harris as the Dem nominee.\n\nIndependence daze\n\nStill, the vague claim of “independence” is the only argument they have and it’s not a coincidence that both the Times and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting used the word to defend their perks and declare themselves holier than thou.\n\nIn a recent article that covered nearly two full pages in the print edition, the Times sneered at White House attempts to broaden access to the president in the Oval Office and briefing room by making space for newcomers, including bloggers and podcasters.\n\nTo the Gray Lady, letting in upstarts who don’t subscribe to leftist pieties is an affront to all that is good and decent.\n\n“Longtime White House reporters say the result has been an erosion of their independence,” the Times sneered, without defining what independence it was referring to.\n\nIt went on to claim that adding newer media outlets “has undercut the briefing as a space to relay accurate information to the American public and hold the president to account.”\n\nIt offers no evidence of those claims, except to show that the newer outlets sometimes get to ask questions of the press secretary that are different from the ones the Times thinks should be asked.\n\nHeaven forbid!\n\nThat’s the left in a nutshell: Diversity is a good idea as long as everybody thinks alike!\n\nNPR reacted with the same don’t-you know-who-we-are arrogance.\n\nIt said Trump’s executive order defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which in turn funds PBS and NPR, is “an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR . . . and locally owned and operated the First Amendment rights of station listeners and donors who support independent news and information.”\n\nSo let’s get this straight: By saving taxpayers $500 million a year by pulling the funding, Trump is violating the First Amendment rights of both recipients and listeners.\n\nIs there a lawyer in the house?\n\nFree speech gatekeepers\n\nThe sense of entitlement perfectly captures the arrogance of the leftist outlets. \n\nThey not only want a monopoly, they also demand that taxpayers fund it.\n\nWhat they really fear is that breaking their stranglehold will lead to the public hearing different perspectives and that will be the end of their cookie jar.\n\nThink about the implications: These are the supposed guardians of the First Amendment, yet they try to squelch the free flow of information because it threatens their sinecures and control of what the public knows about its government.\n\nBad as it is, the position would be more defensible if the legacy media didn’t distort everything by putting their leftist spin on all news and commentary. \n\nTheir lack of fairness and balance is the ultimate reason why they should lose their dominance.\n\nUnfortunately for them, the second Trump White House sees the pattern and is determined to throw open the doors.\n\nMoreover, the administration is wise to the grifters’ false claims of being independent and is now insisting they actually live up to the word.\n\nIn his Friday executive order ending funding for PBS and NPR, Trump cited why the outlets should be forced to do without government money.\n\n“Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence,” the president wrote.","summary":"When there is a Republican president, the leftist-dominated White House press corps likes to gang up and try to put him on defense.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/03/opinion/michael-goodwin-the-left-wing-media-creates-false-allegations-with-trump-back-in-the-oval-office/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/u-s-president-donald-trump-103579181-e1746319677271.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 01:11:20","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.066},{"id":317564924,"title":"Photos and Video Show Bernie Sanders Crowd Size in Swing State Trump Won","text":"A roaring crowd of thousands filled Stabler Arena in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Saturday to hear progressive Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders blast President Donald Trump and what he called the billionaire class gripping the nation's politics. Organizers estimate the crowd numbered between 5,000 and 6,000.Newsweek reached out to Sanders' spokesperson via email on Saturday for comment.Why It MattersPennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, was critical to Trump's 2024 presidential victory and has reemerged as a decisive swing state heading into the 2026 midterms.Trump's surge in support in smaller cities like Allentown and Scranton helped secure the state over Kamala Harris in November, flipping several counties that leaned more Democratic in prior elections.Sanders' rally in Bethlehem, located in Lehigh County, which swung over 5 percent more Republican compared to 2020 — highlights progressive efforts to reclaim lost ground among working-class voters in the Rust Belt. His populist economic message appears aimed at those same disillusioned constituents who have drifted away from the Democratic Party in recent years.What To KnowLehigh University's sports arena hosted the 83-year-old independent senator as he made his third Pennsylvania stop in just three days on his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour.Speaking just miles from Gettysburg, Sanders invoked Abraham Lincoln's vision of government \"of the people, by the people, for the people,\" contrasting it with what he called a modern system run by billionaires.Sanders name-checked Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, saying all three tech tycoons stood behind Trump at his 2025 inauguration and represent the consolidation of wealth and power undermining democracy.\"Right now, we have a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class, for the billionaire class, and we are not going to accept that,\" Sanders said, drawing thunderous applause from the crowd.As head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has led the charge on cuts to federal spending, and as the owner of X, formerly Twitter, has made himself a top advocate for the administration's policies through his prolific social media activity.Sanders criticized both Trump and Democratic leadership, saying the latter's failure over the past half-century to stand up for working Americans helped pave the way for Trump's rise. He condemned cuts to Medicaid, threats to Social Security, and growing corporate influence in Washington.What People Are SayingSenator Bernie Sanders took to X, formerly Twitter on Saturday: \"More than 5,000 people came out in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to stand up for the needs of working families against the billionaire class, against powerful special interests, against enormous corporate greed, and against Trump's authoritarianism.\"He added: \"That's what this movement is about.\"Anna Bahr, director of communications for Sanders, told Newsweek in an email on Friday: \"The arrogance, selfishness, greed, and exploitation of the current oligarchic regime – as personified by Elon Musk, but also by many other billionaires like Zuckerberg, Bezos, etc – have generated a period of populist revolt that unites working people across the political spectrum.\"Billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk on Sanders' recent Denver, Colorado rally in a March 23 X post: \"The Dems just move around the same group of paid 'protesters.'\" In a separate post on April 11, Musk wrote: \"Bernie is just fully communist.\"Sanders told rallygoers at Saturday's \"Fighting Oligarchy\" event in Bethlehem: \"The Democratic Party is going to finally have to say, 'We're going to stand with those people. We are prepared to take on the greed of corporate America.'\"What Happens NextSanders' \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour is expected to continue drawing national attention as Democrats assess how to rebuild a fractured coalition in time for the 2026 midterms.","summary":"Bernie Sanders draws thousands in Trump-won Pennsylvania, blasting billionaire influence and rallying working-class support.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/video-photos-show-bernie-sanders-crowd-size-swing-state-trump-won-2067775","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2638293/bernie-sanders.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 01:04:59","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.127},{"id":317583334,"title":"'Sopranos,' 'Bad Boys' Star Joe Pantoliano Considering Move to Portugal Over Trump: 'Want to Run for the Hills'","text":"Actor Joe Pantoliano, who played Ralph Cifaretto on The Sopranos, revealed that he is considering leaving the United States for Portugal in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s election win.\n\nIn an interview with Page Six, Pantoliano expressed that he was “uncomfortable with the nature” of what was happening in the U.S., and added that he wants to “run for the hills.”\n\n“I’m so uncomfortable with the nature of what’s happening in our country, and I just want to run for the hills,” Pantoliano told the outlet.\n\nIn a video on Instagram, Pantoliano revealed that he and his wife, Nancy, had been in Portugal, adding that during their visit they “looked into getting visas” so that they could live in Portugal “part of the time” or for “most of the time.”\n\n“Nancy and I were in Portugal for a couple of weeks — the first part of it with our friends, Tony and Lisa,” Pantoliano explained. “And, then we continued on our journey — we had a wonderful time.
