Check against the original before quoting.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Do you regret your Trump vote? Just asking questions. We're a little over 100 days into the second Trump administration. Though it kind of feels like more as the president came in hot with an arsenal of executive orders reshaping the immigration system, the federal bureaucracy and the global economy. You might recall that Trump made an explicit appeal to libertarians to vote for him showing up at the Libertarian Party Convention tomake his pitch. Many libertarians feeling queasy about a Kamala Harris presidency and underwhelmed by the state of the Libertarian Party decided to give Trump 2.0 a try. We've got three of them here today, including my co-host Liz Wolf and another of my Reason colleagues J.D. Tuccille. Dave Smith, host of Part of the Problem podcast, also joins us. I think it's fair to describe them all as reluctant Trump voters who had some serious reservations about various aspects of his agenda and maybe his character, but felt that the other options were worse. And so this seems like a good time to just reflect on how things are going so far from a libertarian perspective. Good to see all of you.\n\nLiz Wolfe: I see you too much.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Yeah, yeah, you can just keep it to yourself. You each voted for Trump for slightly different reasons. So let's start there. First, Dave, we had you on before the election to talk about this a little bit, which we will link to that episode. And you told us at the time that \"I might be casting the most unenthusiastic vote in the history of voting.\" But your reasoning was that it was purely a vote against Kamala Harris. Let's roll the tape to see exactly why you thought she deserved to lose at the time. \n\nDave Smith:(CLIP) I've never seen anything like the Kamala Harris campaign. There's not even anything else you could compare it to where on every level it doesn't exist. Like there's nothing. She didn't win a primary. She ran for president four years ago and didn't make it to Iowa. She's walked away from every single position that she was running on four years ago without explaining why. \"That was five years ago. Ha ha ha ha\". That's it. But oh, by the way, she's the sitting vice president. Is she running on the current administration? No. And why not? Because I'm not Joe Biden. Hey, like, it's just nothing there. And to watch her, you know, what really did it for me was this rehabilitate the Cheney's that I just was like, what are we what are we doing here? And to me, for you know for everything the Democrats have done over the last really eight years. Um, starting with framing the sitting president for, uh, treason for these claims that he was a Russian spy, which were totally all, they produce nothing. Then they were the, um, the party of lockdowns and, uh mandates, which, okay, the Republicans were bad on too, but no question. They kind of branded themselves that then they were all in on this disastrous war in Ukraine, which has done nothing except get hundreds of thousands of people killed. And then they're gonna essentially coup the president of the United States of America who they had spent four years pretending was not in severe mental decline and and now to run somebody who's just nothing who's going around campaigning with Liz Cheney is just enough for me that you deserve to lose forever. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Okay, so about 100 or so days in, and kind of imagine, I guess, the counterfactual Kamala Harris presidency. How are you feeling about things, Dave? \n\n Dave Smith: I'm, uh, I enjoy talking to you guys much more from home than a hotel room. That's my reflection on that. Man, I hate being in hotels all the time. Uh, yeah, I mean, you know, running the counterfactual Kamala Harris, I think is a little bit difficult, um, because I don't know, you know what, it's hard to say exactly what her presidency would have been. Like my, uh my default assumption is that it would have I don't think it would have just been a continuation of the Biden administration. I think it wouldn't have been a ramp up. And I think we also talked about on that show that one of my major motivations for supporting Trump was that I thought it would really be a death blow to the corporate media and it would be kind of like the coronation. Like this had kind of already happened, but it made it official that the alternative internet world is the mainstream and that the corporate media is dead. And, and I, I got into arguments with this, but like with some people who I think are very smart, who I respect very much. Um, I remember arguing with Robby Soave.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Believe it or not, that's his real name, folks. \n\nDave Smith: Robby was basically saying, which he had a fair argument for, he was like, well, look, like the first time Donald Trump won, it actually drove the ratings up for the corporate media. And my thought was that it's not going to work this time. And I thought so much of that was driven by the Russiagate stuff. And post Russiogate being exposed, and post the entire COVID narrative falling apart, I just think they had no more bullets left in the chamber. Like there was nothing they could say. That's going to actually get people to want to tune in and listen. So for now, if I'm running the counterfactual, if Kamala Harris had won. In many ways, I think that would have signaled that no, actually, the corporate media still does matter more. And that even though Donald Trump, even though Joe Rogan and Theo Von and all these guys had Trump on, that didn't move the needle as much. And so almost completely aside from the politics of it, just like on a cultural level, I think this is a lot of why so much of the woke insanity has totally receded. It's just kind of like, oh, they lost this epic battle therefore we recognize the side that's won. Almost every Democrat, I shouldn't say almost, there's a sliver of them who still want to cling to it, but almost every Democrat now recognizes that's like, oh we can't push this radical cultural agenda anymore, it's gonna cost us elections. And so for that you know, and for the reasons I laid out there, I do, I, I still feel that way. Um, I think that, you know, the Donald Trump first hundred days have been, you know like a clown show in a lot of ways, there's been some really terrible policies, um, and there's been some good ones too. But at this point, I'm not feeling like, Oh, I regret my vote. I'd, I'd still at this point, you would say, Oh thank God we dodged the bullet of Kamala Harris. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Any reactions to that, JD or Liz, this idea that Trump was, it had to be done because there had to be a repudiation of the kind of gatekeepers that ushered us through COVID. And that is a major upside of Trump 2.0. \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Yeah, I mean, there's an element of David's thinking of what I did. I think I described at the time my first ambiguous exploration and reason for voting for Trump, but then I openly wrote for National Post that I was voting for him, but I said I was engaged in damage control and. \n\nZach Weissmueller: I've got your reasoning right here, you said Trump, scumbag though he is, could be less bad than the empty vessel for the control freaks around her that is Kamala Harris. \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Yeah and uh… That was my attitude then. Now is the Trump 2.0 presidency perhaps a little shittier than even I anticipated yes it is uh… I can't say I regret it i knew it was a gamble at the time. I thought the choices we face were actually awful uh… I liked Chase Oliver as a candidate for the Libertarian Party was uh… Shambolic is still shambolic and rebuilding so I uh… By cut through the dice and said you know what at least if we disrupt what what is a and by administration Kamala Harris administration that is heavily integrated with the permanent government the civil service with the political class with the elite, if we disrupt that a little bit maybe we can at least get a different variety a less organized variety of all hold us for a little while and and break up what has been a bad experience with the Biden/Harris uh you know presidency uh nothing either of them were in control i don't think i think the aids around works just as much the decision-making power. So, do I regret it? I don't really regret it. I'm also not happy about my vote. It just was what it was in an effort to exercise damage, to engage in damage control in a bad situation. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Can I ask you about one other aspect of your reasoning for voting for him? You said you were kind of standing in solidarity with your wife who felt that the left's anti-Semitism was just getting out of control. How do you feel on that front? Because there's definitely been a pivot towards combating anti-semitism, but from a libertarian perspective, it's kind of manifested in these. Crackdowns on speech on campus and even, you know, pulling visas and green cards from people for engaging in protest activities, what are your reflections on that particular point? \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Yeah, I mean, I was and am concerned about the antisemitic turn of the Democratic Party. I'm not pleased with how the Trump administration enacts even its good ideas, but the way I look at it is that we were given a choice between a nativist, economically illiterate authoritarian political party, the Republicans, and an antisemitic, economically, you know, illiterate totalitarian political party which is the Democrats. And I'm deeply concerned about antisemitism. They're really, my wife is an observant Jew. I mean, you know, that's a matter of concern for me. And there are two places in the world now that are probably safe for Jews to live. And that's the United States and Israel. You know, Jews are kind of running out of places where they can live and openly, you know, observe their faith and be visibly Jewish. Uh… Even Canada uh… Is going through a major turmoil and an open and accidentally some business tax on jewish schools and synagogues so uh… That is a major concern now is the Trump administration going about this the right way. Well I'm not gonna lose too much sleep about pulling money away from Harvard University, Columbia University depriving any of the uh… Universities of government money uh… Do I think that people ought to be busted just for writing an op-ed? No, I absolutely don't think that's the case, even if it's horrendous out there. Expressing hateful ideas. But a lot of this stuff crosses that line, like what we saw at Columbia University yesterday in the library, when two security guards were driven away in ambulances after there was a quasi-riot in the library on a pro-Hamas protest. So yeah, this is definitely part of my reasoning, is that I'm troubled by the anti-Semitic turn of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Which is I think still dominant now, even though the Democratic Party is going through what Republicans won through say five or eight years ago, which is kind of a re-examination of what it stands for and it's something of a breakup that may result in a coalescing new form. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Liz let me invite you both to react to anything that they said and also read you your own words back to you Remember you asked for this It's I think you \n\nLiz Wolfe: I think doing this panel just to correct the record 100% was not my idea. It was my idea while stoned. I was literally like smoking a joint on my patio and I was like, wait a second. I'm so annoyed by people on Twitter always asking me if I regret my Trump vote. What if we just got a whole bunch of Trump voters together and explored that question. So I messaged it to Zach and naturally Zach was like okay sure whatever. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Yeah, this is your chance to clear the air of weed smoke and also all the smoke on Twitter. This is, I mean, so what you said at the time was that the democracy subverting activities of January 6th disturbed me as did tariffs, but I'm more optimistic about the economic conditions that will arise as a result of a Trump administration. And I was pleased with his Supreme Court fix during his first term. Price controls, court packing, and massive amounts of government spending, which I expect to accompany a Harris presidency, will simply not work for me. So what do you, how, what's your reflection, how do you feel about things now? \n\nLiz Wolfe: I mean, I don't really regret my vote because I don't really spend a lot of time thinking about who I voted for. I think libertarians have historically been completely correct in basically saying your vote doesn't matter to the degree that you think. You are probably best served sitting at home. It's just really not going to turn the outcome of an election. And the fact that people spend so much time sort of shaming people over this type of thing is really, it's just such a waste of breath and energy. That said… I always saw Trump, and I think I could have articulated this better at the time, I always saw Trump as a very high upside, very high downside candidate. And I think the thing that's been really frustrating for me is that so far we've seen pretty much all downside. In the early days, I was feeling really optimistic about what DOGE could do. And I recall reading the news about the CFPB being dismantled and like sending that link to a few of my friends and just feeling like, wow, I've been so vindicated. This is awesome. And DOGE seems like the only sort of hope of actually meaningfully reducing the size of government, at least in my lifetime that we've seen, like, this is incredible. And it's just absolutely wild how that really has not come to fruition. I think as it was initially conceived of by Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, I think it could have been successful in that form when Vivek was sort of kicked off of the project and it became an Elon Musk initiative entirely. Um, it somehow just became, you know, profoundly unsuccessful. And I think a lot of their sloppiness and accounting has really kind of discredited some of the limited government cause, which makes me concerned from like a 4D chess political perspective, like does this sabotage government slashing efforts for like a decade to come, I hope not, but it's possible and then in a bunch of other areas too, it's just been. Absolutely horrible, you know, trying to make sense of what his tariff policy actually is and why. And what he wants those final amounts to be. I mean, the announcing of reciprocal tariffs has been such a problem. I'm concerned about that as well as the sort of constant 90 day pauses. And then immigration policy, you look at the degree to which he's just really aggressive with deportations. And look, there's some amount of like, deportation was never going to be, soft and cuddly and fuzzy, right? Like it was never gonna be sealing the border again and rolling back some of the Biden era chaos. Was never going to be something that looked good. But the way that the Trump administration has done it has been just shockingly, appallingly bad. And I really do think that there's like such an erosion of due process, which leaves me feeling like, how do we possibly get people to care about this again? The number of fellow Americans who I've seen justifying that type of behavior by the Trump administration is really, really frustrating to me, especially because using that alien enemies act to attempt to deport these people. Keeps getting swatted down by various judges. We saw the Fourth Circuit especially issue a really scathing rebuke. And I'm just a little bit like, you know, like even Trump appointed judges don't agree that the Alien Enemies Act can be used in this way. And I think that's a really big problem. I think the mechanism by which we do this really does matter. \n\n Dave Smith: On that topic, yeah, go ahead, please do. No, there was something, what Liz said up top there, I feel like I just wanted to like stress because there is something that I've, it's very interesting the way a lot of libertarians do react to voting at all. And it's almost as if in some weird way. They buy into the same principle that statists do. And like, I remember there was this one, one time, many years ago, I was on a Fox news show. I was on Kennedy, uh, and Julie Roginsky, who's like a Democratic strategist. She, at one point, like I forget what it was, but it was like, I criticized Hillary Clinton, and then she was like oh, so you must love Donald Trump, you know, the typical thing libertarians are used to getting, and I was like no, I actually don't like him either. And she was, like, wait, so who did you vote for? And I was, I didn't vote. And she goes, this is all on air, and she goes well, if you don't vote, then you can't complain. And I'm like, really? Because I'm about to. So like that's, it's like, that's like an, it is an empirical claim, and I'm about to demonstrate that that's not true. And every libertarian recognizes immediately like how ridiculous that is but then they almost apply the inverse when they find out like you're voting for one of the major party candidates like oh well now you're responsible for all of the bad and it's like all of this is so ridiculous it's like look from libertarian first principles you can deduce that like we're under duress. We are forced into we're forced into a false binary where that shouldn't exist. But one of these two people is gonna be president and it's completely reasonable for libertarians to say I find one of them to be slightly preferable to the other one. So I'm gonna throw a vote their way and see what ends up coming of all of that. So that was kind of just my I just I found it very interesting watching like how people how libertarians implicitly like conceptualize what voting is as if this means it's like a full endorsement of everything that this person has ever done or said or whatever they will do in the future rather than what it really is which is essentially a strategic guess you're kind of going like \n\nLiz Wolfe: This is the thing that's like wrinkled me so much in the aftermath of my scandalous Trump vote, which has been the number of people who respond to me constantly on Twitter or YouTube or whatever and say, you voted for this whenever I'm criticizing a Trump policy. And it's like, yes, I voted for this candidate extremely reluctantly, but I didn't endorse every single thing that you would end up doing. And wouldn't you, in fact, rather have people who will vote for a candidate and still retain their independence and their ability to you know, critically assess each specific policy that this president puts forth and then is able to call balls and strikes and say, this policy is good, this policy's not aligned with my values. Like, it's confusing to me, and especially for a journalist to do that, like it's confusing to me what they want. Do they want me to vote for Trump and then become like a MAGA-tard Trump sycophant and just, you know be super, super excited about every single thing his administration does? Like, would they feel better served by me doing that? I wouldn't feel good. By me doing that. I feel much better about saying, look, I made an educated guess. So far, I don't really like how the guess is working out. It's not really aligned with my values and beliefs. As a libertarian, I consistently feel like there's no good option available to me. And you know what? The only thing I can do as a journalist for the next four years is try to be honest about what is good, what is bad, and what I know and what I don t know about what Trump's doing. \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Yeah, I'm gonna get down on that. Yeah, go ahead. I was just gonna say, I mean, I am just amazed. I've known people for decades who will come at me with, and it's clear that they kind of live at the intersection of tribalism and retardation, because it's a matter of being, they insist that you be all in. You're either entirely on Team Red or entirely on Team Blue, and they can't, and they're angry with me. They're furious because I write some columns that say, yeah, I think DOGE is a good idea. I'm going to scare the Department of Education. And then I write a piece saying, no, Trump's way over the top with executive actions and his trade policy is insane. So yeah, tribalism, the insistence that political identity is all, is a be all and end all. And actually, this is a good way to riff and say this. I've recently seen two studies, one from 2017 from Stanford, another from Political Psychology published recently. Both said that now political identity overshadows race and ethnicity as a matter of personal identification. And a source of interpersonal animus in this country. So yeah, people live in this kind of intersection of, and I'll say it again, of retardation and tribalism. And they insist that you go all in on this identity instead of saying, you know, the vote worked out or the vote didn't work out, and I think I'll just be critical of the policy, the action, the politician rather than the candidate. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Yeah. Let me, uh, triple down on that and say that it's, I think that the less, the more people can avoid letting a vote warp their brain, um, the better off we will all be. Um, I've increasingly come to view it as a harm reduction type of thing where it's like whoever wins, this is not going to be good for America, but is there a choice that is going to be less harmful for America? And if the answer to that is no, then. You can not vote, that was my decision, but this year, last time I made a different decision. We kind of bring this on ourselves at Reason by publishing our votes publicly and just for the record, so people get an understanding. We had 12 Chase Oliver voters, six non-voters, including myself, three Kamala Harris voters, and two write-ins and two Trump voters, to both who are on this show with us. Right now I want to keep going into some of the specific issues one that Liz raised was deportations and I'm really curious to get Dave's thoughts on this because I think Dave, you're the most kind of friendly to immigration restrictions of the libertarians on this podcast. However, there are some rule of law issues. The Supreme Court did order the government to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia from this El Salvadoran prison. So far that seems not to be happening at all. What are your feelings about this? Do you have any sort of rule of law type concerns around this particular issue? \n\n Dave Smith: Um, yes. And I think, yeah. And you know, uh, um, I think it's already sold out, but I think they stream it, but of course Reason magazine, uh or Reason I always call you guys Reason magazine even though the magazine is the least of it these days, but it's just, that's what's in my brain for eternity. \n\nLiz Wolfe: At least you don't call us ReaCNN. \n\n Dave Smith: That's, I've never, I'd never been known for that. I may have called you \"Treason Magazine\" once, but I was particularly mad at you. I think Brian Doherty had written an anti-Ron Paul piece and he got me pissed off or something like that. But, I love you guys. I've always been on record. You two are, this is my favorite show, that Reason does. But, you know, there's like, okay, so I'm doing a debate at the Soho Forum, which is a Reason, you know, event on immigration. I'm sorry about that. In a couple weeks so check that out there is put it out online so yes i am an immigration restrictionist and in fact i even think that i i'd personally believe and i think this is consistent with libertarian principles we've done shows on this before that i think people who uh… I don't think it's a natural right comma uninvited to it uh… Piece of property that you don't own even if it is absurdly claimed by the U.S. government. But regardless of any of that even if you're going to support mass deportations like let's say just like for the sake of argument come at it from the side where you want to see mass deportation and you've kind of won the day in many respects the public opinion of the American people has been pushed far to the right on immigration from the Joe Biden administration. Mass deportations have at least in several polls had super majorities of the American people supporting them. And so what does Donald Trump do at this moment? You know, you've got the American people on your side, you got the president, this is his signature issue. And so again, he does it in a way that would almost you'd think be designed to undermine public support for mass deportations. I mean, it's one thing to say, you came here illegally, you don't have a right to be here, we're gonna ask you to leave. It's another thing to send people to like a torture camp In El Salvador. In a couple instances people who are not from that country it's like this is madness and I would say I think um me and JD may may see things a little bit differently on this but as the I believe the only jewish person on this uh on this show you know I gotta say and somebody who also doesn't like to see like a rise in hatred of Jewish people you know. Wading into the Israel-Palestine conflict, which is one of the most controversial ongoing events in the world, and is a very divisive and polarizing issue. To weigh into that and then deporting legal residents for the crime of having the wrong opinion is just about the worst thing you could do if you don't want to see a rise in Jew hatred. And I would also, obviously in terms of the policy, I support defunding all of the universities. College is essentially one giant government program that should be abolished just like basically every other government program. But again, to defund them based on the accusations of antisemitism is the worst thing in the world you could do if you want to see a decrease in hatred of Jewish people. Particularly after for at least fifteen years all of these universities have been hotbeds for the most vicious anti white bigotry imaginable I mean it's just like it's it's been totally institutionalized and taught into the entire curriculum that it's just okay to be viciously horrible toward straight white men and there's entire entire departments dedicated to it and so then to defund it i mean just plays right into the stereotype of like oh yes see the one group you're not allowed to accuse. It does nothing but give red meat to the Jew haters whose arguments are pretty stupid and like we don't need to give them any more red meat. So I think all of that has been terrible. I think that Donald Trump essentially had about as big of a like you know I don't like the term mandate. I know politicians always like to use it. I think it's kind of an anti libertarian idea that you ever have a mandate but Donald Trump coming back in and this time winning all the swing states and the popular vote and the corporate media being defeated. He had a real shot in the arm to get some amazing things done in the beginning of his presidency. I think he did a few good things, but at this point, a hundred days in, it is kind of like, I think he's blown that already now. And unfortunately, we're just back to kind of where we were. His approval ratings are, he had his highest approval ratings at the beginning and they're already right back down to where they were because just all of this stuff is so It's obviously clown show stuff. I mean, and the deportations and the tariff stuff, I think are right at the top of the list of that. \n\nZach Weissmueller: Stuff there. JD, I'm curious to hear your reaction to this notion that paradoxically Trump may have laid the ground for increasing antisemitism, but also just the general sense that, you know, it was articulated by Ezra Klein in this video essay he did where he said the emergency is here, like the threat to rule of law has escalated so bad that we're facing, like it's It's finally here. We're facing that constitutional crisis. Do you buy that it's like things are that bad? Like it is an emergency. \n\nJ.D. Tuccille: Well, I mean, two part question, two-part answer. He is definitely, in the way he's gone about, responding to some of the students, the other people here on student visas who expressed hateful ideas, but only expressed hateful ideas, and didn't engage in violence or criminal actions. The way he has gone about that has given them the excuse to act as martyrs. And so it creates a sense of martyrdom when he's visibly suppressing, punishing people for their speech. Rather than for their conduct. Others are being punished for conduct. So is that a problem? Yeah, it is. Because if you give people who are hateful, who are potentially dangerous in some ways, if you give them an excuse to wrap themselves in the flag of martyrdom, you can reinvigorate the movement and definitely give them a certain energy, you can have a lift under their wings. Beyond that, the rule of law, the due process, yeah, there seems to be, even when… Trump is on to something that is important and valid. He seems dedicated to doing it in the cruelest and most self-aggrandizing way he possibly can. And I think that is largely because the man has a walking personality disorder. He's heavy on narcissism. And everything, there has to be an expression of his will. It can't be, well, let's implement these policies and wanna go through the system that might be established by law and by the Constitution. No, it's got to be the CEO handing the orders down and getting it done right now, even if it's in violation of established rights, of protections for rights, and of legal process for getting things done, if you actually find somebody against whom action might legitimately be taken. And so at the end of the day, yes, he does create martyrs. He's a threat to due process. And yeah, he has no regard, so far as I can tell, for abiding by the Constitution, for abiding court orders, and for abiding by the dictates of a system that is a political system and not a corporate structure that he personally owns. \n\nZach Weissmueller: What about you, Liz? Do you have any thoughts on the rule of law question?\n\nLiz Wolfe: Oh, yes. I think, you know, when people talk about Trump's deportation policy, they so frequently bring up the case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, which makes sense. You know, he was basically tarred as a member of MS-13 by multiple members of the Trump administration. He was deported to El Salvador originally. He came to the U.S. illegally in, I believe, 2012. It took him like seven years to actually sort of attempt to seek legal status. And he had, you know, one arrest on his record and the cops basically said he looks gang affiliated. But, you know, then he was able to successfully convince a judge that he had credible fear of persecution from gangs because of his family's successful pupusa business in his own country. And so he was to get a sort of withholding of removal that basically shielded him from being deported back to El Salvador. He married a US citizen He was not, you know, a legal permanent U.S. resident, but he had a child who was an American citizen and a wife. And he was sent to CECOT, to El Salvador's, you know terrible maximum security prison without really getting sufficient trial, without getting the ability to sort of contest the charges against him that he was MS-13 affiliated. And to be able to make the case for why he ought to be to stay, or at least not to be deported back to that place that he had withholding removal from. Most people know of that case, right? Everyone's heard of that. They don't necessarily know the case of Ricardo Prado Vazquez, the Venezuelan migrant who was I think doing like a door dash job or something near the Canada-U.S. Border, took a wrong turn, went over the bridge, attempted to reenter the United States, was detained, was then sent to ICE custody. And then his family hasn't heard from him since then. He was confirmed to be deported from the United States. And the US government appears to have lost track of him. They don't know what happened to him or where he went. There's also, by the way, no indication that he's gang affiliated and his child hasn't heard from him for I think over a month now. You know, you look at the flights of Venezuelans who were deported, not to Venezuela because the Venezuelan government won't accept them, but to El Salvador. And you have these flights of, you know, 238 Venezuelans or like the New York Times did a long investigative feature, basically saying. Are these people the worst of the worst, as the Trump administration claims? Well, if you actually cross-check their records and look through a whole bunch of crime databases in Colombia, in Peru, in El Salvador, in Venezuela, in places where these people might have lived or passed through, you don't actually turn up a lot of evidence that indicates that all 238 of these people are brutal rapists and murderers. There is some number, I think it was roughly two dozen, that do have wrap sheets like that. And then some other fraction have more minor offenses, like much more minor, like stealing something, like petty theft. And then a whole bunch of those people actually don't have a criminal record. Actually, there's no information that links them to Tren de Aragua or any other sort of violent gang. At least to me, the fact that the Trump administration feels so comfortable saying, these people are all rapists and murderers. They're all MS-13, they're all Tren De Aragwa, and they feel comfortable deporting these people. Cutting off contact with their family, cutting off with lawyers, and in some cases, sending them to a maximum security prison where it's totally unclear what their fate will be. I mean, I don't feel good about this. And many people basically say, what did you expect? Did you expect a court date? Did you accept a habeas trial for every single person deported? With the scale of the migrant crisis under Biden, that was always impossible. And I think my response is, well, we're America. And we have certain constitutional guarantees. And it is important to me that our executive follows the orders of different court rulings, including the Supreme Court's ruling, which has said that Trump needs to facilitate the return to the United States of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. We consistently see Trump appointed judges basically slapping down the logic, the justifications that he's using. And look, I'm not saying that it should be a situation where every single migrant who has a sob story or who married a US citizen or who is a father gets total and complete amnesty forever. That's not what I'm saying. But what I am saying is that we do have the procedural mechanisms to ensure that people get their day in court and they at least get to contest the allegations against them, or maybe bare minimum, we could just not have members of the Trump administration lying about how violent and how heinous and how gang-affiliated these people actually are. Some of them very much are, and the most violent people absolutely do need to leave our country and be locked up for a long time. But it's important to me to be careful about this. I think anybody who actually cares about justice, who cares about crime, who cares about public safety, owes it to themselves and to other people to be honest and to be very careful with how they sort of sift through evidence. And I just think it's frankly very offensive that the Trump administration hasn't done that. And I worry about what type of precedent that sets. When we ignore due process and when we ignore lower court rulings, what exactly do we become?\n\nZach Weissmueller: Well, yeah, that's what I want to ask about, just to elaborate on one thing Liz was saying, and this will be open to anybody, maybe you'll have thoughts on it, JD, is I think that when it comes to thinking about the rights of immigrants, whether it's citizens or permanent residents or just people who are here on a visa, it seems like the kind of thing that is hard to get. Americans, a lot of Americans care about it. I think libertarians are particularly attuned to individual rights, whether it's the rights of an immigrant or, you know, stretching back to 9-11. You know, we were the people saying, like, maybe don't send these quote-unquote suspected terrorists to Guantanamo, or they are going to be hauled away with no rights. And that was not a popular position at the time. I wonder if… Like, do you think that there's any way that is there any way to get people to care about this and think about it in terms and like, should they care about it? Should they think about going beyond affecting this, you know, unpopular group of people known as illegal immigrants?\n\nLiz Wolfe: Well, my question to them is like, what exactly happens once Trump starts ignoring Supreme Court rulings? Like what actually happens, like truly, I don't think we want to know. I don' t think we wanna find out. And it's just wild to me that so few people have this sense of, you don't have to and you in fact shouldn't have allegiance to the Imperial executive, to any one branch of government, but you should have a respect for the way that checks and balances get to sort of curb the power. Of the executive when it's overreaching in the way that it has. And I am very concerned about what happens when you repeatedly undermine the judiciary. Like, where do we go from there if the Supreme Court can just be completely ignored by an executive that's very power hungry? Sorry, Jared.\n\nJ.D. Tuccille: No, no problem at all. I was going to say, I mean, one of the things, one way to get people perhaps a little more open to the idea, because I know people are not necessarily sympathetic to the courts. When we say due process, they imagine a long, drawn out process and, you know, but fundamental due process. The basis of it is proving an allegation. And a lot of people jump to the ideas, okay, the government's rounding up illegal immigrants who don't have a right to be here. Well, how about asking the government to demonstrate they've got the right people? Because that's the fundamental element of due process, that you actually have the person you claim that you have, that this person actually is an illegal immigrant and not a citizen that you've misidentified or maybe somebody who an ICE agent happens to have his eye on the guy's wife. I mean, we don't know. That's the fundamentals of due processes, proving you have the right person. It's the very first step. And if we can at least get to that point, I think we could work from there. It doesn't necessarily have to be a year-long trial for each and every single person who's accused of being an illegal immigrant. It might just be, how about making the government prove that this person is the person you say it is? You got the right name, and it's actually an illegal emigrant and not a citizen you misidentified.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Well, this is the really frustrating thing about the degree to which so much of the sort of collective media imagination has been occupied by Kilmar Abrego-Garcia's case. It's like we're all interested in reading the tea leaves to try to ascertain whether or not he is an MS-13 member and like his finger tattoos. What exactly does the marijuana leaf mean? What does President Trump think about that? And it's like, well, in a sense, this was a huge waste of time because when Trump came into office, he had to use Dave's hated phrase, a mandate to crack down on open board, open borders, I put in quotes, but like Biden era rampant immigration, he had mass popular approval for that. And it's a waste of our time to be focused on whether or not the marijuana leaf signifies MS-13, whether or not the skull tattoo signifies that, because the thing that should really matter is, is this person in the country legally? Is there a withholding of removal or not that prevents them from deportation? Are they legally eligible for deportation?\" And there's lots of people who absolutely fall under that criteria. So we really don't need to adjudicate whether or not they're Trendy or Agua or MS-13. And I think that our sort of, you know, popular health would actually be very well served by coming up with a system of doing that. And I think the Trump administration is being a lot more careful about making sure they're not tarring and feathering people who don't really deserve that. Like it should be. Enough just to say this person is in the country illegally, you know, we have a mandate to crack down on that type of thing, therefore we are deporting them and we're deporting in sort of like the most reasonable, low cost way possible where they're legitimately released into their home country and that's that. But they're not doing that, right? They're making a show of it and they're being, you know, as cruel as can be. And it strikes me as just like, it's like all this like a pageant, it's the show, it's this entertainment for them.\n\nZach Weissmueller: Let me ask about one of the other huge Trump policies of these first hundred days, which Dave brought up earlier, the topic of tariffs. And not only tariffs, but these unilaterally imposed tariffs, which is what has really riled up people like Rand Paul, who's taken a stand against that. We had him on the show to talk about why. We'll link to that. Essentially he thinks it's a wild abuse of executive power, regardless of how you feel about the tariffs themselves. And I think that a lot of libertarians, including me, were very concerned about the Kamala Harris economic agenda. I mean, one of the things I raised as to why I could not vote for her was that one of first and only concrete policy proposals she made was to set price controls on grocery stores. And so, you know, I could never vote for somebody that is economically illiterate, like that's a road to ruin. I would feel horrible about supporting that in any way, in any form whatsoever. But I do think that the markets have been in turmoil because of the kind of unpredictability of this. They're now recovering because Trump has, you know, made this deal with the U.K. and maybe there's more deals to come. Um, but. To me, it's been kind of unilateral, like the president can actually change the entire global economy this way. That's been kind of disturbing. And I think you could make a case that the kind of economic nationalism we're seeing might even be worse than what we would have seen under the Harris administration. Let's start with Dave. What do you think about the tariffs really being the central. And defining features of these first 100 days or so of the Trump administration.\n\n Dave Smith: I mean, just the economic illiteracy of it all is just infuriating. And it's like, you know, being as charitable as I can be here, because there is like, I think, a little bit of nuance to this, where, like, the current dynamic with many countries, is that there are countries that the U.S. subsidizes. Like both subsidize their military. We put them under our nuclear umbrella. We give them article five NATO guarantees of like, you know, helping defend them. And then those countries turn around and put tariffs on our products. And that is an outrage. I mean, that is truly appalling. Like that makes me white hot mad. Like someone should be shot over this. Okay, maybe not that, but it's like, it really is like an outrage Now, obviously, the correct answer, I think, from a libertarian perspective is that, well, then we shouldn't be subsidizing these countries and we should not be guaranteeing their protection, particularly like wealthy countries that are in less debt than we are. But okay, look, you could make an argument that, okay, in order to stop doing that, we would have to get this corrupt Congress, you know what I mean, to act and that's impossible to do. And so… Perhaps in theory, you could say that Trump could threaten tariffs against somebody. And if that resulted in them saying, okay, we'll lower our tariffs on you. If you don't come through with this, there could be a way in which you would threaten tariffs that resulted in lower tariffs for everyone. That would be a positive result. Not the problem is that that's not at all what donald trump's doing and that's not but that's also not the way he himself talks about it i mean he talks about tariffs and as if they are a good in and of themselves and that they make people rich and they may and and this is just totally backward you know i saw there was a a great uh… There's so but uh… If you guys are from a bob murphy is a senior fellow at the mises institute you are a really brilliant economist and he's really really great at the like. At things like this. But I remember, so he was reviewing, there was like a tariff versus free trade debate. And the guy who was arguing on behalf of tariffs, he brought up this Lincoln quote, which I'd never heard before. But the Lincoln quote, evidently is Abraham Ringgit said something like, he goes, you know, when we trade with the world, we get the goods, and they get the money. And when we train with ourselves, we keep the goods and the money. And like, it's one of those quotes that's got like a little bit of a ring to it. And you could see where that would maybe like convince someone to go, Oh yeah, you know, we get the goods out of the body and Bob Murphy's response to it, he just goes, uh, he goes, yeah, the first thing Abraham Lincoln did when the civil war broke out was put a blockade around the South. It's like, oh, I guess he was just trying to make sure they kept the goods and the money, right? Like he was trying to help the South. I'm sure that's why Israel has a blockade around Gaza right now. I'm sure why Churchill put a blockage around Nazi Germany, just because we wanted to help him so much. Bill Clinton just wanted to help Saddam Hussein in the 90s, right, because if you think about this, it's like talking about the minimum wage with leftists. What's the limiting principle here? If tariffs are good and they make us rich, well then why are we messing around with these 30-40% tariffs. Let's put 1,000% tariffs on that. Let's just cut off trade with the rest of the world. In fact, let's cut off the trade between the states. I mean, it's good, right? It's gonna, in fact, let's go off trade between you and your neighbor and everyone just has to produce everything on their own. That way, you keep all of the goods and all of the money and we'll all just be trillionaires, I guess. It's like, it's such economic illiteracy and it's infuriating. And then, and you know, the other thing to it, which I find truly remarkable, is such a huge part of the reason why Donald Trump is president again, right up there at the top, it might be the number one reason, is the price inflation during Joe Biden's presidency. And you know, truth be told, Donald Trump himself was very responsible for a lot of that price inflation, maybe not all of it, but it was on Donald Trump's watch that we locked down the country and printed $6 trillion, and that had a little something to do with prices going up in the following years. And, but for Donald Trump to be able to say, like, oh, you know, you have 30 dolls, maybe your kid will have two, as if, like the obvious follow up questions to that aren't like, okay, and what about the kid who's only got two dolls? Oh, they just get none, I guess. But the idea that first of all there's things that are a lot more important than dolls for your kids that the prices of which are going up. But the idea that anyone would, after the last few years, downplay the damage that rising prices does is just, it's disgusting. I mean, and this is a point of the picture where like, social conservatives really need to learn economics. Like social conservatives really need to learn their libertarian lesson because the truth is that it's not just like oh rising prices over here but that's just economic stuff over here like then we have these social issues over here they're all interrelated i mean rising prices destroys families it's the number one reason for divorce is financial stress this is this is what breaks up families this is What leads to little kids growing up without their dad around this is leads to men swallowing pistols this like it is It is a devastating force for working class and poor people when your prices go up. And there's something so elitist about it. Like, you know, like, look, I'm doing pretty well these days. If groceries go up by 30 percent, like I do, I'm annoyed, but it's not like the end of the world for me. But this is something like when you're a family, if you have the median household income in the United States is, I think, like high 70s, like 79 grand a year or something like that.\n\nSpeaker 5 Or something like that.\n\n Dave Smith: Right around $80,000 a year. Like if you're making the median household income and you have three or four kids and groceries go up by 20% or 30%, it is devastating. It ruins people's lives. And yeah, so it's bad economics and I can't believe that after the last few years, MAGA supporters can talk about rising prices as if it's not a big deal when it is maybe immigration was number one, it depends on which poll you look at, but it was either number one or number two, the reason why Donald Trump is president again.\n\nZach Weissmueller: And, you know, there was this hope, I think, that libertarians were going to exert some influence on MAGA. We had people like Vivek Ramaswamy in there, who was calling for this Libertarian Nationalist Alliance, and he was just kind of kicked to the curb. And now, history kind of repeats itself in this way, too. We were talking, when we talked with Vivek on this show, we talked a little bit about. How during the Pat Buchannon run, there was this alliance as well. And then basically Pat Buchannon ended up by the end, he was talking about trade wars, like every single time on the campaign trail. And there was a good retrospective written about this, about why it all fell apart that we can link to. But I'm curious to get Liz's thoughts on the tariffs, because you—you mentioned specifically in your reason to vote for Trump that the economic agenda, like me, you had major concerns. And I'm specifically interested to hear you talk a little bit about what Dave raised at the beginning there, this idea that maybe tariffs as a pure negotiating tool to eliminate. Trade barriers, to force other countries to drop their tariffs, maybe that is defensible.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Yeah, my sort of Trump theory of mind is that he's, I think, a little smarter than many people give him credit for. And so I am always interested in entertaining the possibility that this is in fact a grand negotiating tactic to attempt to impose really tough trade barriers that can induce other countries to come to the negotiating table and then decide to lower their trade barriers. If that is his goal, he's doing it in kind of an insane way, because for example, it was just announced this morning that the US and the UK have reached a trade deal. Okay, well, it's not like the U.K. was slapping massive tariffs on the United States. And so getting those tariffs removed, if that is in fact what will result, is not some huge win. I'm sorry, that's just pretty negligible. That's pretty minor. And so what he appears to be doing is not getting to an entirely zero tariff, complete free trade future. But something entirely different. And so I always want to like entertain, I don't want TDS to destroy my brain and I want there to always be this ability to say, hmm, is there this like 4D chess move that he is attempting to play and he's looking, you know, seven moves ahead and I'm not understanding that. Like, right, like I'm always interested in that. I'm gonna go full Scott Adams with it, but I think that it is good for people to think in those terms with Donald Trump. That said, it's so clear, you know, what Dave was saying is 100% correct. Trump appears to have this complete and total affinity for tariffs. He seems to be deeply worried about trade deficits just innately by nature of what they are without seeming to understand what they are. And when you look at the approach of his administration, it's very concerning to me, the number of Trump sink offenses, Trump boosters who seem to be. So down with excusing how much havoc this will wreak on the normal American family. And you look at, okay, well, people aren't having enough kids and his administration seems somewhat sympathetic to ideas about how to raise the birth rate. Well, it's not just that there's a bunch of only-tiled American kids out there with 30 dolls, which is intense materialism run amok. It's also big families that are the ones with 30 dollars. When you have eight kids, you have a lot of kid stuff, right? And so the thing that's so frustrating to me is like, he's willing to be so dismissive without understanding that people make lots of very rational choices, given the size of their families and the things that they value. And to act like it's just totally fine for him to basically force them into poverty or into worse living standards than what they've been accustomed to is something that just makes me, it makes me so angry. I was looking at Bari Weiss's tweet. She was excerpting Joe Nocera's work from the Free Press, I don't really know that writer, but she pulled a quote from it, which was, no one anymore on the left or the right denies that globalization has fractured the US, both economically and socially. It has hollowed out once prosperous regions, blah, blah blah, furniture making, car making areas. Okay, I deny that, right? I completely deny that and there's a ton of people who support free trade who can say yes. Globalization and outsourcing and, you know, the decline of manufacturing in the United States has certainly hurt some populations. And there is sort of cultural pain, cultural suffering that happens in those regions. But let's not act like the immense gains from globalization, the immense gain from outsourcing in free trade. Like we can't get into this mindset where we take these things for granted. Because if we do that, we will be in a situation where future generations are poor. Then what we've experienced in our lifetimes. And at least when I think about it, what type of life will my kid have? I don't want poverty for him. I want, you know, the abundance that we've grown accustomed to continue.\n\n Dave Smith: Yeah, there's also this weird conflation that goes on that I feel like Bari Weiss is guilty of there, where it's like, what exactly are you talking about when you say globalization? Like, are you're talking about global governance? Are you talking about the World Economic Forum? Are you talking about the IMF and the World Bank? Are you talking about America being an empire? Are you telling about America fighting seven disastrous wars over the last 25 years? Or are you talking about the fact that we trade with the world? And to just put it all on, Like as if that last one is the culprit in all of this. Like look, the truth is that the deindustrialization of America and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs It's like old, like basic, like Frederick Bastiak stuff. Unless you want to argue that we should block out the sun so that the candle makers can do more business, like unless you're arguing that we should like, like it hurts us if people are making stuff for a more affordable price. The reality is that. And this has been kind of the story of the united states of america rate is that like the size and scope of government just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and you go through woodrow wilson instituting the income tax in the central bank uh… FDR instituting a new deal to linden johnston in instituting that the great society to whatever keep going forward to the George W Bush expansions to the Barack Obama expansions the Donald Trump expansions we've now gotten to a point where we're, I think it's $1.3 trillion in interest on the national debt. Like if we balanced our budget, we still run trillion plus deficits every single year. And we can't tax the people enough and we can borrow enough. So we print the money. Essentially the American worker has to carry the American empire on his back. And then as these new industries aren't coming in to replace the old industries, and now when you don't have a system where like a young guy could get out of high school and get a job where he can support a family we're supposed to sit here and blame the Chinese for producing stuff for us and not look at Washington DC and how much they've robbed from the American people and so like when you talk about globalization yeah I'm an anti-globalist in a lot of senses but not in the sense that we shouldn't trade with the rest of the world It's just the most ridiculous\n\nLiz Wolfe: Oh, go ahead, Jerry.\n\nJ.D. Tuccille: I was just going to say, globalism has just become a bogeyman, for it represents whatever imagined wrongs are in people's heads about engaging with the world or about elites or about whatever it is that's bugging them and how they think the world has gone wrong. But the economic policy, the bad economic policy that has been the response of this has made that much worse, where it's the result not of, say, legislators arguing at coming to bad conclusions, but to the whims of one president. And this is what we're seeing now, I think, is the latest culmination. And unfortunately, it's not the end state, but the latest combination of turning the presidency into an elective monarchy, which we saw, I mean, four years ago, we were talking about Biden having set a new record for the issuance of executive orders, executive actions. Now Trump is invoking these tariffs, to impose these tariffs a 1977 emergency law. It was a bad idea then. People warned it would be misused by presidents. And it can be invoked simply by using the word emergency in an executive order. That's exactly what Trump did. So this is whim driven and it's so bad because it's one person's idea of what a tariff should look like when he wants to engage the entire world, bend the entire word to his will. And what we're seeing in this is kind of like the latest culmination of all the warnings about turning the presidency into a monarchy. And it's gotten as bad as it's been with Trump. And yet wondering how much worse it can get from here, but I'll bet it can actually get worse.\n\nLiz Wolfe: Yeah, and whether it's mourning the sort of decline of manufacturing in the Rust Belt or the decline of agriculture in the Midwest, the thing that's really frustrating to me about the Trump view of the world, and I guess some of the views proffered over by the free press, is that there's just this sense That the US economy is or ought to be static, not this dynamic ever-changing force. And it's like, as we gain the ability to industrialize further and to outsource more things, it is important and necessary and just a normal natural part of growth for industries to shift and for some industries to become defunct. And that's not, you know, like I go to Noleda, Manhattan today, and guess what? It's not all, you know, shirt-waist factors, right? Like, they're not- producing, it's not textile factories, they're not producing garments, right? The garment district no longer does that. That's not something that I lose a bunch of sleep over. And I understand part of the reason we're able to feel good about that is because so much time has passed, whereas with hollowed out, you know, areas with the decline of the Rust Belt, less time has passed. And we're seeing legitimately awful situations where there's lots of deaths of despair and people who are struggling to figure out how to transform their economy and help But it's really frustrating to me that people, I guess like Bari Weiss or folks at the Free Press seem to believe that it's the central planners that ought to sort of like deliver salvation to these people versus the fact that economies naturally go through these transitions. That doesn't mean that it is not very, very hard for the people who incur the cost, but the only thing to do is to continue to embrace a dynamic sense of what is to come. Central planners just can't save you from some of these hardships. I think it's important for libertarians and free marketers to not dismiss these hardships, right? If men are drinking themselves to death and killing themselves because they no longer have dignified work, that's something that as a fellow American, I'm very disturbed by. I'm very worried about that. I just really don't take that lightly. But at the same time, that can't be a reason to reject globalization and to force all Americans everywhere to cut their ability to buy things from other parts of the world. Like that's a crazy logical leap.\n\n Dave Smith: It's a very, a really, really important point, particularly for libertarians to really understand that it's like, it's not, it, it it's like in the same sense as like when Bernie Sanders is pointing out the insanely high healthcare costs and then advocating for universal healthcare. It's like don't, don't downplay the fact that there is a real problem with what he's talking about, just the fact that he's advocating for the worst solution, you know, doesn't mean that there isn't. And I'll tell you, I mean, I know people who like, I know this one like younger couple or like on my wife's side of our family. And they probably, they both work incredibly hard. Um, they're probably make a hundred grand a year between the two of them. I think he makes around 70 and she makes around 30 grand a year or something like that. And, you know, I was talking to him recently and it's like, dude, he's like, how am I ever going to buy a house? The houses around here in the good neighborhoods are going for 900 grand. How does anyone who makes 100 grand a year buy a $900,000 house? I mean, it's just like, and the thing about it is, is that again, what people are missing is they're going, okay, look, there was a time, and this is true, like in my grandfather's day, you literally could go wait online and then get a job at a factory and you could support a family off of that. My grandfather owned his own house, he worked at a factory his whole life. He owned his house, his wife didn't work, they had two cars, they sent two kids to college. Now, you can't do that anymore, but the thing is that it's all about the money. I mean, it's like even sometimes you'll see, Zach, I think me and you might've talked about this once, but you'll like even those leftists will have the charts of like when the working class stopped being able to afford all this stuff. And it always starts in the early 70s. Yeah, it was always in 1971. And then they're always like, well, what happened? What happened? It's like, yeah, we went off the gold standard and like there's other government policies too, specifically that have kept the pricing of housing and the pricing of college and the price of healthcare, like, you know, ridiculously high. But the real essence of the problem is that we've destroyed the currency. And that, and so it's just, it's a shame that, which is very typical, I thin","summary":"Three libertarians—Dave Smith, J.D.

Jean Carroll weaponization lawsuit against President Trump.”\n\nAnother person close to the president said Joby’s “ties to Reid Hoffman, someone who funded political prosecutions of Donald Trump” were “concerning.”\n\nAnd a Senate Republican aide also claimed that some lawmakers on Capitol Hill were “skeptical of taking meetings” with Joby, “especially given Hoffman’s attacks on Trump and [Elon] Musk.”\n\n“The anonymous claims are ill-informed and inaccurate,” a Joby spokesperson told The Post Friday. “Joby is a proudly American company and global leader, employing over 2000 engineers and other experts, across 40 different US states, and our pioneering aircraft are designed, built and assembled in America.\n\n“From being the first company to deliver an air taxi to the Department of Defense to being the first air taxi to fly a demonstration flight in New York City, the progress we’ve made and the support we’ve received reflects the work of our incredible engineers, not the politics of any individuals.\n\n“We have been actively engaged with the Administration, including the White House, DOT and legislators on certification—as is appropriate for any company pursuing a first-of-its-kind FAA approval. We’ve received strong, bipartisan support across the board. We’ve also been consistent advocates for many of the priorities that DOT and FAA are championing, including air traffic control modernization and ensuring that eVTOL technology is commercialized here in the US.”\n\nJoby went public nearly four years ago as part of a SPAC deal with Hoffman’s blank-check company Reinvent Technology Partners, which was also headed up by Zynga founder Mark Pincus.\n\n“The Jetsons now become real,” Hoffman crowed to Bloomberg Technology in an August 2021 interview.\n\n“It’s Uber meets Tesla in the air — and that can transform space, people’s commutes, stop gridlock and have that not have the climate impact.”\n\nThe Reinvent deal helped seed Joby with more than $1 billion as it began pursuing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications, CNBC reported.\n\nHoffman had served on Joby’s board from the 2020 merger until 2024, but stepped down last year.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder remains a large stakeholder in the company with more than 30 million shares, per its latest quarterly SEC filings last month.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, Hoffman donated more than $7 million to a pro-Harris super PAC after having bankrolled legal funding for Carroll’s sex abuse civil suit against Trump through his nonprofit American Future Republic.\n\nHe was replaced on the board last year by Michael Thompson, a Miami Beach-based investor who also helped establish Reinvent Technology Partners.\n\nThompson donated $200,000 to Musk’s America PAC to help re-elect Trump in June 2024, Federal Election Commission filings show, and has been bullish about Joby’s opportunities in Trump’s second term.\n\n“If our thesis on a company like Joby is accurate, you’re going to have the first new transportation modality in 50-plus years — and it’s going to happen in this term,” Thompson predicted on the “Citizen Podcast” last month.\n\nThompson recounted how the “moment for many Americans that air travel became tangible” was when President William Howard Taft watched a member of the Wright Brothers flight school take off from the South Lawn in 1911.\n\n“We’re hoping to replicate that this year and fly the Joby off of the White House lawn,” he said.\n\nOther leading eVTOL makers include Beta Technologies and Archer Aviation.\n\nThe White House, FAA and Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","summary":"Joby Aviation has scored federal approvals and contracts and hopes to begin taking passengers by early 2026.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/09/us-news/electric-air-taxi-firm-joby-aviation-eyes-white-house-landing-but-has-deep-ties-to-anti-trump-billionaire-reid-hoffman/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/104175486.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VSjwv2TQ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-09 21:27:15","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":319709554,"title":"Abigail Spanberger Says She Can Take on Trump Without Bashing Him","text":"That’s an eternity in Democratic politics these days. The president lives to draw attention to himself, and his cuts to the federal workforce and federal spending are doing significant damage to the state of Virginia, where Spanberger is the Democratic gubernatorial nominee.\nYet one reason she is the early front-runner in the race is that Spanberger is so far refusing to allow rage about Trump to dominate the discussion. So when I ask where fighting back against the president ranks among her campaign priorities, Spanberger first talks about the new administration’s negative impact on everything from Virginia research universities to suburban Washington convenience stores to tattoo shops in coastal Hampton Roads. “I am focused on standing up for Virginians, and that means standing up to the Trump administration when their actions are hurting Virginia, Virginia’s economy, our workforce, our people, because that is the job of the governor of Virginia,” she tells me. “My favorite thing is when the pollsters come back and they’re like, ‘Wow, people are really talking about the economy.’ I’m like, No shit. Thank you for validating what I’m hearing on the ground.”\nSpanberger’s campaign—in a purplish state that has an incumbent Republican governor but went for Kamala Harris last November—is an intriguing test case for a Democratic Party that’s being roiled by arguments over how to rebound. The strongest energy has been on the populist left, with Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drawing huge crowds for their “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies. I tell Spanberger I am not asking her to proclaim a solution for the party as a whole. “Everyone else does!” she says, both brightly and sarcastically. “We should just take a second and listen to people,” she continues. “We’re a broad-tent party, and I think we should celebrate that rather than trying to figure out, Okay, who was the most recently successful Democrat? Now everybody do the same thing.”\nSpanberger, 45, is tough, funny, and passionately pragmatic, a profile forged by her eclectic background. The daughter of a cop and a nurse, she was born near the Jersey Shore (her mother and aunt went to high school with Bruce Springsteen). As a teenager, she moved to suburban Richmond with her family, eventually graduating from the University of Virginia. Spanberger, a mother of three daughters, later became a CIA case officer, specializing in terrorism and nuclear proliferation.\nShe owes her political career, in a sense, to Trump. In 2018, Spanberger was a member of a group of Democratic women who ran for Congress for the first time in reaction to Trump’s original White House win. She served three terms in the House of Representatives, compiling a bipartisan legislative record, twice declining to vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker, and occasionally criticizing President Joe Biden.\nIn November 2023, Spanberger announced she would leave Congress at the end of her term to run for governor in 2025. Mark Rozell, the dean of the school of policy and government at George Mason University, initially expected Spanberger to face a progressive primary challenger looking to “vanquish the opposition.” But no one emerged. “In statewide elections, Virginia can lurch from one party to the other, so it’s not really clear that running a more firebrand progressive would yield a good result for the Democrats in this state,” Rozell says. Stephanie Taylor, cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (and a native Virginian), cautions against extrapolating from Spanberger’s middle-of-the-road approach to the national Democratic debate. “She is working to include progressives and progressive values into her coalition,” Taylor says. “But I would be careful about reading too much into the race.”\nThe Republican nominee is the state’s current lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears. She is already trying to lash Spanberger to Biden, pointing to the Democrat’s congressional votes on pandemic-era federal spending bills as being responsible for boosted inflation. Spanberger parries that Earle-Sears and her Virginia Republican colleagues were happy to take credit for spending all that infrastructure money. But then Spanberger does something more interesting than throwing partisan punches: She comes close to admitting that mistakes were made. “The choices we made in an exigent circumstance are choices that, at that moment in time, I stand by,” she says. “Now, hindsight being 20/20, we should all be learning from what we did or didn’t do. And in the event, God forbid, we are ever in that sort of crisis mode again, we will make better choices.”\nSpanberger is also making a choice when it comes to Trump and her campaign—hardly ignoring the president, but focusing on the wreckage rather than on resistance rhetoric. “While standing up to Trump, or the discussion of what Trump is doing, isn’t necessarily the thing that I lead with, it is the foundation on which there’s urgency to all of these types of things,” she says. Spanberger believes her part on the Democratic road to recovery is delivering on everyday needs, from broadband access to housing prices to teacher training, while defending core civil rights, including legal access to abortion. “Even talking about teacher residency programs—there’s a strong measure of success in those programs, and now the federal government has cut dollars.”\nThat framework makes sense given the job she’s seeking. One risk, though, is that Spanberger’s centrist approach might not meet the polarized moment and motivate enough Democratic voters in November. Spanberger scoffs at my suggestion. “Come to my events. They’re quite crowded and energized,” she says. “If you’re working 80 hours a week to pay the rent and put food on the table and, oh my God, hopefully your kid doesn’t get sick—they don’t want to be excited. They want somebody to fix it. They want to know that somebody cares and is decisively focused on the issues that matter to people. That is actually compelling. Whether it’s exciting, I don’t know. I’ll let people determine their own emotions.”","summary":"The no-nonsense Democrat, who is running for Virginia governor, tells VF that her party should “just take a second and listen to people” before committing to a strategy for reclaiming the White House.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/abigail-spanberger-says-she-can-take-on-trump-without-bashing-him","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/681e2a7ed58ffe00e31139ee/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/VF0525_Abigail-Spanberger_Tout.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 21:23:11","author":"Chris Smith","authors":["Chris Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.293},{"id":319733204,"title":"Biden Breaks Silence On Why Trump Defeated Kamala Harris, And It Had Nothing To Do With Economics","text":"Six months have passed since Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in the November election for president, and many Americans are still mourning. The devastating blow divided the country even more, and now, former President Joe Biden is finally addressing his theories about why the Democratic party failed. \n\nSince leaving the White House, Biden has kept a relatively low profile. That is until recently, with him sitting down for several major interviews and making public appearances over the last few weeks. During an interview on “The View” Thursday (May 8), Biden spoke about last year’s campaign season, even making a surprising admission.\n\nAccording to the former president, Harris’ defeat didn’t come as a shock. “Not because I didn’t think the vice president was qualified to be president,” he clarified. Biden went on to defend Harris saying she was more than qualified to run the country. But there was two simple yet deeply complex things he believes stopped her from pulling out the final victory.\n\nIt’s no secret that Harris is Black woman. But despite making history as the first woman district attorney in San Francisco and the first woman to serve as vice president, Biden said it was her gender and race that many folks couldn’t see past. Plus, it didn’t help that the Republican party basically used her identity against her, just like they did during former President Barack Obama’s campaigns. \n\n“I was surprised because they [MAGA] went the sexist route, the whole route. ‘This is a woman,’ she’s this, she’s that, really, I’ve never seen a successful and consistent [of a] campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country — and a woman of mixed race,” Biden told “The View” hosts. Let’s all remember the right’s continuous attacks on Harris, previously calling her a “jezebel” and suggesting she slept her way to the top of the political ladder.\n\nThe same thing happened in 2016 with the battle between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Trump. Even “The View” host Sara Haines mentioned the 2016 voting frenzy saying Harris’ loss “was like 2016 all over again.” In the cases of Obama, Clinton, and Harris, each candidate presented a “radical” progressive change in the political system. But while Obama, a Black man, was able to win two terms, the ladies didn’t have the same success. \n\nOf course, if you were paying any attention to last year’s election, Biden’s recent remarks aren’t surprising. It was very clear from the beginning of Harris’ 100-day campaign that voters were hesitant to elect the first female president. But you know who called it? Black women. \n\nOn X, @judysquirrels tweeted back in November that Harris is “not radical, she just happens to be a Black woman.” Another Black woman, @tify330, wrote “People hate when Biden is honest, everything he said is true: Sexism, Racism, COVID, Pessimism, Negative view of Gov’t all played a role.”\n\nIt remains unclear if this country will ever be ready for a Black women to lead, or even a woman in general. But despite this, Biden continues to praise his former second in command. “We had a very successful effort to change the direction of the country and we did,” he said. “She was every single part of that.”","summary":"Six months have passed since Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in the November election for president, and many Americans are still mourning.

What’s Next?","text":"A little over 100 days ago, President Donald Trump was sworn into office for his second term. In his inaugural speech, he promised to set this country back on track and undo the damage caused by Joe Biden and the Democrat Party. His plan? Secure our southern border, stop inflation, restore law and order, put America First on the world stage, and work every day for the American people.\n\nNot an easy task. But after what this country went through with Biden and Kamala Harris at the helm, President Trump knew there was no time to waste. And he’s kept his promises in record time.\n\nOn Day One, President Trump got to work. The president immediately signed executive orders to declare an emergency at the southern border, bring prices down, unleash American energy, combat fentanyl pouring into our country, restore free speech, and make America’s interests a priority again.\n\nThis is a president who is truly putting the American people first. His first trip as president was to my home state of North Carolina to tour disaster areas in the wake of Hurricane Helene. His administration has been working to help the Tar Heel State recover ever since he was sworn into office. In fact, the Trump administration recently approved a $1.4 billion grant to aid in recovery efforts in North Carolina.\n\nThese successes are just the beginning. Over the past 100 days, President Trump has worked tirelessly to Make America Great Again. But we must remember, this is not just his agenda; this is America’s agenda.\n\nIn November, he carried all seven swing states, won the popular vote, and helped Republicans carry the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. Do not listen to the fake news when they tell you this agenda is unpopular. President Trump is delivering exactly what he said he would and what the American people voted for. This is the definition of “Promises Made, Promises Kept.”\n\nSo, what’s next?\n\nLooking forward to the next 100 days of this administration and the next four years, we must keep this momentum going. We need to ensure he has the support he needs in Congress throughout his entire term and not just the first two years. If we want to build a foundation for the future of this country and ensure President Trump’s successes last for future generations, we need to elect Republicans up and down the ballot in 2026. We also need to protect the integrity of our elections.\n\nPresident Trump, the Republican National Committee, and House Republicans have already started this work. \n\nJust a few weeks ago, the president signed an executive order to make sure only American citizens can vote. And the Republican National Committee was involved in more than 170 election integrity lawsuits last cycle—we are not taking our foot off the gas anytime soon.\n\nThe future of the United States depends on the policies we set now. If the Democrats gain control of Congress, they will stop the amazing successes of President Trump’s first 100 days dead in their tracks. This is not what the American people want.\n\nIf you want the United States to continue building on President Trump’s historic successes, then we need to elect Republicans in the House and Senate, so he has the support he needs throughout his entire four years.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

And sometimes this is a problem.\n\nThough when I say “sometimes”, what I mean is “always”.\n\nThis week, for instance, he announced that America won world war two. I’m sure this caused his fans over there to hold their hats to their hearts as they smashed up the nearest Volkswagen showroom in a frenzy of teary-eyed patriotism.\n\nBut it’s not entirely accurate.\n\nThe simple truth of the matter is that we held Hitler at arms’ length until the Russians were able to defeat his armies.\n\nBut there was no time to explain this to the Donald because he was busy thinking out loud again, saying that he was going to buy Canada and that America’s Declaration of Independence was all about love.\n\nAnd then he mused about how the troubling conflict between India and Pakistan has been going on for centuries. Which is odd because Pakistan was only created in 1947.\n\nTrump’s shaky grasp of reality is a worry. But then I do wonder what the world would have looked like if his rival, Kamala Harris had won.\n\nWorse, probably. Especially for people with testicles or a womb.\n\nIt’s incredible really that when the time came for the world’s most powerful country to replace Joe Biden, who was mostly dead, it offered voters a choice between a woman who wrote speeches using tiles picked randomly from a Scrabble bag, and a maniac with nylon hair.\n\nAnd waiting in the wings is JD Vance, a God botherer who thinks women who’ve been raped should be forced to have the resultant baby.\n\nAnd there’s no end in sight to this madness. Because of the way candidates are chosen (using money) only lunatics will ever end up in the White House.\n\nSo I wonder if maybe it’s time to change the role of the president.\n\nAt the moment, he or she wields enormous power, whereas our head of state, the King, does not.\n\nHe’s just a figurehead who’s wheeled out occasionally to open car parks and stand on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, in a snazzy uniform, waving.\n\nThat’s what they need in America. A president who opens stuff and waves.\n\nAND NOTHING ELSE.\n\nAnd do you know what? I don’t think Donald Trump would be totally averse to the idea. He wouldn’t have to bow out after four years. He could stay in office till he dies.\n\nAnd he could call himself King Donald the First and make people bow when they meet him. I think he’d like that a lot.\n\nTHANKS BUT NO YANKS\n\nSo let me see if I’ve got this exciting new US trade deal right.\n\nFrom now on, we will be allowed to buy terrible left-hand-drive cars that are far too big for our roads.\n\nAnd at night, we will be able to eat chicken that tastes vaguely of a swimming pool. Or beef that’s so full of chemicals, we will wake up in the morning with two heads.\n\nOn the upside, we are told we will now be able to export all the steel we make to America.\n\nHmmm. As I recall, we only have one steel plant left in this country and all it made last year was a knife and fork.\n\nObviously, I haven’t had time yet to read the small print in this deal but when I do, I think it’ll be even worse. Because we were being represented in negotiations by a man who can’t talk properly, and wears someone else’s spectacles. And he was up against a ruthless businessman who’s mad.\n\nThat said, however, it’s possible that Starmer’s new trade deal with India is better for Britain.\n\nMainly because he was negotiating with a man whose mind was on other things.\n\nLike dropping bombs on Pakistan.\n\nIF ever you’re in need of a laugh, go online and have a look on your local council’s website at the objections being raised by elderly people about all the planning applications.\n\nA belter caught my eye this week. A tennis club in Norfolk has applied for permission to keep the courts open until 10pm and locals, predictably, are furious.\n\nA chap called Keith is worried about the noise saying: “You’ve got balls bouncing off fences.”\n\nYes, Keith.

So that’s what the kids are talking about these days. I thought it was gay rights and -Palestine and who said what on TikTok.\n\nBut no. They’re in the gym and the juice bar and in the staff room at work, and all they’re talking about is how the world would be a better place if only there was an alternative to ketchup.\n\nAnd now there is. It’s from Heinz, surprisingly, who’ve launched a new line called Fish & Chips Sauce.\n\nExcept it’s not new. It’s just tartare sauce with a new label. And the fact is that it’s not quite as good as Thousand Island. Which I put on everything.\n\nIncluding biscuits.\n\nVOIGHT NEEDN’T BOTHER HOLDING ON FOR A NIRO\n\nJON VOIGHT is an Oscar-winning actor and father to Angelina Jolie.\n\nHe is also such an ardent MAGA fan, that he’s managed to convince Donald Trump that all films should be made in America.\n\nI have no idea how that might work. Paddington becomes Grand Central Station? James Bond changes his name to Jimbo? Jason Bourne never goes further than Tennessee?\n\nOne thing I do know, however, is that we will never see Voight and Trumpo-hating Robert De Niro working together again.\n\nThat scene in Heat?

Such proposals have been steadfastly opposed by Trump and his Republican allies in Congress.\n\nThe last time Trump passed major tax legislation was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress promised that the bill would boost household income for the middle class and spark economic growth. It did neither.\n\nThe package included tax cuts that were “highly skewed” in favor of the super-rich, the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted in a 2024 report on the law. The group also noted that the law “benefited high-income households far more than households with low and moderate incomes,” creating a “windfall” for the wealthy while eroding the revenue base the government relies on.\n\nCongressional Republicans are currently in the process of pushing more tax legislation that would double down on the failures of Trump’s old law. The bill, called “One Big Beautiful Bill” because that’s what Trump demanded his priorities be labeled, cuts spending on programs like Medicaid in exchange for tax breaks that benefit rich people.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office reported on Friday that over 5.5 million people will lose health care coverage if Republican plans to roll back Medicaid expansion become law under the so-called beautiful bill that is being considered.\n\nDespite this information and Trump’s track record on taxes, The New York Times chose once again to amplify Republican spin—while hiding the truth from its readers.","summary":"In a report published Friday, The New York Times regurgitated President Donald Trump’s claim that he is backing away from supporting increased taxes on the wealthy.\n\n\n\nHeadlined “Trump Softens on Raising Taxes on the Rich, Saying G.O.P.

Walz encourages legislators, and anglers, to get the lead out","text":"CROSSLAKE, Minn. – It is a Minnesota tradition like no other that the final days of the legislative session and the opening of fishing season coincide by a matter of days each May. That means in the midst of negotiations to wrap things up at the state Capitol, the governor – for 77 straight years now – heads off to a lake or river to celebrate angling on the state’s abundant waterways.\n\nTalking about fishing and the goings on in St. Paul on Friday, in an exclusive interview with the Pioneer Press, Gov. Tim Walz said it’s time to get the lead out. And he was referring to both anglers and legislators.\n\nHe wants the legislative session to finish on time, and with an eye toward protecting the official state bird, he wants anglers to cut down on their use of lead fishing tackle.\n\nWith the May 19 deadline for adjournment of the legislative session now less than two weeks away, Walz said he will call a special legislative session, with a pre-set agenda agreed upon, if necessary, but it’s not something he wants to do.\n\n“If you don’t set a time to mow the yard, it doesn’t get mowed. If they don’t do some of these things, then I think you just have to set the time and recognize you can’t let the perfect get in the way of the good,” he said, urging lawmakers to compromise and get to the finish line on time. “And I think the longer you wait, it becomes harder, I think then it becomes, you just keep procrastinating. And so we’re getting late. There’s no doubt about that, but there’s still an opportunity to get this done.”\n\nHe pitched once again for his wish for a lower sales tax rate, accompanied by an expansion of the sale tax to include financial planning and wealth management services, but said he will be unlikely to veto a tax bill that gets to his desk, even if it does not include his reform idea.\n\n“I don’t threaten when I go in there, I leave things open,” Walz said. “And I just made the case on this for Minnesota. We’re talking about lowering the sales tax for 80% of Minnesotans as we see it. But right now, the sales tax excludes things like wealth management banking, things like that.”\n\nHe offered examples of what he sees as inconsistencies in Minnesota law, like the sales tax charged if you have someone trim your trees, but not if you have someone manage your money, or the sales tax charged on funeral arrangements, but not on the preparation of a last will.\n\n“So I said, you just expand that base, lower the rate. A lot of folks don’t use those upper end services, and just candidly, the folks who use them have a little more wealth,” he said. “I think the thing is, I’m bringing this up because people’s spending habits have changed. People are using more services and less goods. But we’ll see, and I think it’s just about having consistency in our tax system.”\n\nWhitefish Chain fishing\n\nAs is traditional for this event, which has been held everywhere from Lake of the Woods in the north to the Mississippi River near Winona in the south, Walz planned to head out with a guide on one of the dozens of lakes in the Whitefish Chain in the wee hours of Saturday morning. In Crosslake, members of the local Republican party were organizing a protest and boat parade for Saturday morning, which is not uncommon for a governor whose popularity in Greater Minnesota has varied widely since Walz was first elected in 2018.\n\nOne change the governor was advocating for this year is getting lead lures and sinkers out of Minnesotans’ tackle boxes, as ingesting the metal is harmful to aquatic birds, most notably the common loon. Legislation calling for a ban on lead fishing gear in Minnesota has failed at the state Legislature in the past. Walz said he would sign a ban if it got to his desk, but he also feels that encouraging changes rather than mandating them is the right approach.\n\n“Here in Minnesota, we still make it your option. We’re trying to educate people on this … Loons are our state symbol now. They’re on our state seal. Very important to who we are. Lead’s very, very dangerous to them,” Walz said, noting that he hunted pheasants with bismuth-based ammunition last year and liked the feel of it.\n\n“The waterfowl hunters have worked on this for years. I think there’s a move away from lead tackle. We’ve got Lindy and some corporations that are moving to that. I think it’s important to bring people along on their own terms. I don’t think an industry this big and the folks who’ve been doing this, that you dictate to them,” he said. “I know there is a school of thought that says we just pass a law and ban it. I think that having compliance with bringing people along, and more and more people are doing it. So I fish lead free, shoot lead free. I think (we) try to encourage people to go there, but we don’t mandate it.”\n\nLooking back on campaign\n\nMeeting with members of the media on radio row during the 77th annual Minnesota Governor’s Fishing Opener at Manhattan Beach Lodge in Crow Wing County, Walz admitted the relatively slow pace of events like these is a welcome change following the whirlwind that 2024 became for him last summer.\n\nWhen Walz accepted an offer to run for second in command at the White House alongside then-Vice President Kamala Harris, his life became a non-stop world of travel and thrust his family into the national spotlight. After the Harris/Walz ticket lost in November, he said getting his body back into shape has been a goal and while Walz remains thankful for the experience, he also values his time back in this land of 10,000 lakes.\n\n“I ate a lot, so I’m now trying to lose some weight. I was doing the ice cream at midnight type of thing,” Walz said, with a grin, looking back fondly on the campaign. “But it was quite a thing. Look, it was an honor to do it. I got to see this country more than I ever would have, but I also say this: When you travel and you see a lot, home looks pretty good. So coming back to Minnesota’s a blessing.”","summary":"\"We're talking about lowering the sales tax for 80% of Minnesotans as we see it,\" said Gov.

I've become a crank in my old age, but there are certain things that still make me watch with the wide-eyed awe of youth, and a papal conclave is one of them. The smoke, the bells ringing in unison across Rome. The people streaming into St. Peter's. The new pope being introduced to the entire world at the same time, using his first words to call for peace. I also just love that some version of the following phone call probably took place multiple times around the US yesterday:\"Hey! Remember Bobby from sophomore calculus? Did you hear about his new job? Yeah, he's the pope now.\"The whole spectacle yesterday at the Vatican was really special, and particularly well-timed for a certain Catholic former president whose first TV interview since the election was, thankfully for him, immediately followed by the white smoke and thus buried by the news that would follow. I speak of course of Joe Biden, who went on The View yesterday, looking and sounding worse than ever, where he delivered one of the most shameful, delusion, insulting and all-around sad public displays from an ex-president I can remember.Some of you get mad when I am hard on Joe, but I really have no—zero—compunction about it given his behavior throughout 2024 and now continuing into 2025. He is personally responsible for Trump's return. And yet, I do feel sorry for him at the same time, and direct my real disgust at the people around him, like Jill Biden. This man should be sitting on his favorite rocking chair on his porch in Rehoboth, regaling his grandkids with stories from his 50 years in politics and working on his memoirs. Why is he being wheeled out on a media tour?If you didn't catch The View appearance, Biden managed to do the following: take responsibility for Trump's win, while also saying he \"wasn't surprised\" that Kamala Harris lost, while also claiming he would have won, while also blaming her loss on—wait for it—sexism.Where to even begin with that. Harris lost because she was both a bad candidate and handed a total shit sandwich by Biden, who waited too long to drop out and then had the gall to demand she remain loyal to him while his own approval was -20 by the time he left office. Not even a politician as talented as Bill Clinton could have threaded that needle, while also fending off attacks from Trump. And Kamala Harris ain't exactly Slick Willie.Also, can the Dems please dispense with blaming everything on sexism or racism? Michelle Obama would have crushed Trump in a head-to-head matchup. It also absolves them for ignoring the proximate causes of Trump's return, which is their dereliction of duty on the core issues of inflation, immigration and crime. And it begs the question, if Kamala could never have won because of sexism, why the hell did Biden endorse her to succeed him?!Matt Yglesias, the center-left pundit, is calling for Dems to \"throw Biden under the bus\" after what he said on The View, and I agree. His post-election gracelessness, and the behavior of the people around him—specifically Jill—is grotesque. Harris should hold a presser today where she answers every question about just how much her boss had deteriorated, when, and who specifically was covering for him. We deserve at least that. And please, Democrats, I am begging you: stop defaulting to the sexism thing. It's so insulting to the American people and it comes across as you just shifting the blame for your own failures.On that lovely note, have a great weekend.

Seconds later, she collapsed out of her chair and fell onto the studio floor.\n\nThe show’s host, Jonathan Hunt, remained in his seat, noting, “We’re just going to get some help her for Camryn.” He then attempted to give the broadcast over to another presenter, which didn’t pan out, forcing the show to cut to commercial break.\n\nWhen the show returned, he assured viewers that Kinsey was already doing better. “We want to give you a quick update. Camryn is up and moving,” he said. “We have paramedics checking her. We will keep you updated. We wish her all the best.”\n\nIt’s unclear what prompted this scary medical incident. However, many fans seemed most disturbed by the fact that Hunt continued talking to the cameras after Kinsey fell to the ground. \n\n“He didn’t even THINK about helping,” commented one viewer on a video of the incident. Another said, “Wow [he] just sits there and doesn’t help her. What a man.” A third wrote: “The way they filmed that feels like ‘The Office’.”\n\nAlthough most commenters felt that Hunt should have helped her, one user did defend him. “You all know there is a studio full of people? Someone would be helping her ... his job is to carry on.”\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Kinsey took to X, formerly Twitter, to reassure fans that she was doing better. \n\n“Wow, sorry for the scare last night. I want to start by thanking the incredible Fox News team and the EMTs who responded with such speed and care. It was an unexpected and frightening moment, but thanks to their professionalism and kindness, I’m doing well,” she said.\n\nShe continued to thank everyone who had reached out to her. “I’m taking it slow, staying hydrated, letting my body rest,” she wrote, noting “I’ll be back on your TV soon.” She then teased: “Hopefully long enough to finally finish my point about Kamala!”\n\nKinsey, 24, previously worked as an External Relations Director at the White House during Trump’s first term and has worked as a reporter and White House correspondent for One America News Network. Most recently, she’s been working as a political commentator. Kinsey is also the founder of Titan Media Strategies, a Florida-based company.\n\nMeanwhile, Hunt has been a correspondent for Fox News Channel in Los Angeles since 2002.","summary":"Political commentator Camryn Kinsey collapsed on air during a “Fox News @ Night” appearance.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/tv/2025/05/fox-news-correspondent-draws-criticism-for-on-air-conduct-after-guest-fainted.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/5SE7KRQ3IJGLZGNZWKMFEGNUD4.jpg?auth=6d8f8812bc4f3fd61f26d0b888ba79a4802c07e84e4dd8fca7838a16f7f2f0b2&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 17:31:31","author":"Kelly Corbett","authors":["Kelly Corbett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":319649824,"title":"Casey Means: the controversial 'wellness influencer' nominated for surgeon general","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nIn The Spotlight\n\nCasey Means: the controversial 'wellness influencer' nominated for surgeon general\n\nMeans has drawn controversy for her closeness to RFK Jr. \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nDr. Casey Means is seen during a Capitol Hill hearing in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, 2025\n\n(Image credit: AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\nJustin Klawans, The Week US \n\nPresident Donald Trump's new nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, is unlike most prior figures who have held the position. A \"wellness influencer\" who has notable links to the Trump-adjacent Make America Healthy Again movement, Means was nominated by the president to replace his first choice for surgeon general, former Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat — but Means now faces scrutiny of her own.\n\nWhile Means does have a medical degree, she has never worked in government. Her closeness to another divisive health figure, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is also causing alarm in the health care industry.\nMeans' background\nMeans, 37, is a well-known health influencer in the conservative internet space. She attended and graduated from Stanford Medical School and later pursued a surgical residency at Oregon Health & Science University \"but dropped out before completing the program,\" said NPR. Means left the residency because she was \"frustrated by what she saw as her field's inability to treat patients' underlying, chronic causes of ill health,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Means had an Oregon medical license granted in 2014 but it was rendered inactive in 2024, according to the state's medical board; this means she is \"no longer authorized to practice medicine or prescribe medication, although there is no indication of disciplinary action or revocation,\" said Newsweek.\n\nSurgeon general nomination\nTrump nominated Means for surgeon general because she \"has impeccable 'MAHA' credentials,\" the president wrote in a social media post, referencing the \"health-conscious\" movement heralded by RFK Jr. She will work with RFK Jr. to \"reverse the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and ensure Great Health,\" Trump said.\nBut many have called into question Means' controversial stances on public health matters. She has notably \"echoed some of Mr. Kennedy's skepticism of vaccines, calling on the new administration to study their 'cumulative effects' and to weaken liability protections offered to vaccine makers as a way of encouraging them to develop new shots,\" said The New York Times. Health experts are \"adamantly opposed to trimming the list of recommended immunizations, warning that such changes would trigger outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases.\"\nMeans has also described a \"dizzying web of influences to blame for the nation's health problems, including corrupt food conglomerates that have hooked Americans on unhealthy diets,\" said The Associated Press. Both Means and her brother, Calley Means, have become influential in the right-wing health sphere and have made \"appearances with some of Trump's biggest supporters, winning praise from conservative pundit Tucker Carlson and podcaster Joe Rogan.\"\nThe siblings \"often rail against the influence of the pharmaceutical and food industries in their many appearances,\" said NPR. But Means also goes further with assertions about processed food, \"linking changes in diet and lifestyle to a raft of conditions including infertility, Alzheimer's, depression and erectile dysfunction,\" said the AP. For Means, the top issues plaguing American health are \"obesity, diabetes and infertility,\" and she has also \"endorsed raw milk, like Kennedy,\" said The Hill.\nIt is up to the U.S. Senate to decide Means' fate, as the surgeon general position must undergo a confirmation hearing. But many — even far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer — have expressed skepticism over the pick. Means \"PRAYS TO INANIMATE OBJECTS, COMMUNICATES WITH SPIRIT MEDIUMS, USES SHROOMS AS 'PLANT MEDICINE' AND TALKS TO TREES!\" Loomer claimed on X, calling Means a \"crack pot.\"\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nJustin Klawans, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\n Justin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.

Navarro recounted that Biden denied the \"daylight\" comment during a live interview on \"The View\" earlier in the day and said she believed him, adding that she doesn't think he lies often. Jennings asked her of Biden, \"You think he’s ever told a lie?\" Navarro replied, \"I don’t think he tells many lies,\" prompting Jennings to bend over laughing. JEN PSAKI RECALLS REACTION TO BIDEN'S DEBATE, ‘HEARTBREAKING’ SUMMER BEFORE 2024 EXIT: ‘I WAS LIKE, IS HE OK?’ The clash came several hours after Navarro and her \"View\" co-hosts spoke to Joe and Jill Biden on the set of the ABC talk show Thursday morning, asking him about claims made in a new book that he requested that Harris leave \"no daylight\" between them. \"Well, look, first of all, I did not advise her to say that, number one. Like I said, I was vice president. I understand the role, number one,\" he said. \"Number two, I think it was, I think she was talking about, she wouldn’t have changed the successes we had, not opposed to, we wouldn’t change anything at all. She has to be her own person, and she was.\" Biden’s response conflicted with reporting in \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" the book written by reporters Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen in the aftermath of the 2024 election. Biden’s alleged request to his then-vice president was seen as one of the contributing reasons for her loss. Critics have claimed Harris didn’t do enough to separate herself from her ex-boss’s unpopular presidency. Jennings confronted Navarro over the answer she received from Biden on her other show, suggesting she’d rather believe Biden’s statements over Parnes and Allen’s reporting. \"It’s been reported. He told [Harris] point-blank – he told her point-blank, ‘No daylight, kid. No daylight,’\" the conservative said, as Navarro tried to speak over him. BIDEN TELLS ‘THE VIEW’ HE WASN'T SURPRISED HARRIS LOST, BLAMES SEXISM, RACISM \"The View\" co-host shot back that Jennings, a media critic, was buying the journalists’ claims without much skepticism. \"Oh, because reporting can never be wrong?\" she asked. \"Are you attacking the journalism around it?,\" he replied. \"You think reporting can never be wrong? You come in and you come on here and you attack reporting every night! We actually asked him the question directly,\" Navarro responded, referencing her interview with Biden. Jennings rejected Biden’s response, saying, \"There’s critical reporting about this guy, and he told her point-blank, ‘No daylight.'\" After Jennings laughed at her denial that Biden wasn't being honest, Navarro hit back, \"No. You know why you don’t get to laugh like that? Because you support a guy who lies every freaking day and lies continuously. You support a guy who cannot acknowledge that he lost the 2020 election, and that lies about it.\" By this point in the discussion, the two were almost yelling at each other, prompting CNN anchor Abby Phillip to end the segment. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Following the interview, Jennings continued defending his point on X, sharing the image of Allen’s headline mentioning Biden’s alleged \"daylight\" claim. In the post, the CNN commentator invited the authors of the Biden book to refute Navarro and Biden’s statements, writing, \"Care to weigh in, @amieparnes and @jonallendc? You’ve been called liars here on the ‘no daylight kid’ moment - but my bet is you’ve got it right and Joe Biden can’t remember what he had for breakfast yesterday. This will not age well.\" Allen replied to Jennings on Friday morning, declaring \"We stand by our reporting, which @TheView noted was deeply sourced.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a follow-up post, Allen even argued that Biden had not even denied the \"daylight\" claim specifically. He wrote, \"Also, Biden was asked a two-part question. 1) Harris saying ‘there’s not a thing that comes to mind’ on The View. 2) that he encouraged her to have ‘no daylight’ from him. He answered the first — ‘I did not advise her to say that’ — and ignored the second.

The state has become a bastion of conservative leadership over the past decade, but Democrats are hoping to make it competitive in the midterms, particularly if Trump's falling approval rating drags down Republicans next year.What to KnowA new poll from the James Madison Institute, which surveyed 1,200 registered Florida voters from May 5 to May 7, showed potential candidate Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat who has not formally said she is running, trailing Republicans by a single-digit margin.The poll shows the race could end up being closer than last year's presidential contest.Representative Byron Donalds, who is running and was endorsed by Trump, led Levine Cava by four points in a hypothetical matchup (38 percent to 34 percent), with State Senator Jason Pizzo, who last month left the Democratic Party, winning five percent support. Twenty-three percent were still undecided.Florida first lady Casey DeSantis, who hasn't said she plans to run, led Levine Cava by four points as well (39 percent to 35 percent). In that scenario, Pizzo won support from eight percent of respondents, while 18 percent were still undecided.Newsweek reached out to Donalds' campaign, Governor Ron DeSantis' office and the Florida Democratic Party for comment via email on Friday.In the Republican primary, 29 percent said they would be inclined to vote for Casey DeSantis, while 28 percent leaned toward Donalds. Ten percent said they'd vote for former Representative Matt Gaetz, seven percent said they'd vote for former Lieutenant governor Janette Nunez and five percent leaned toward Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, though none of them have confirmed they are running.After learning about Trump's endorsement, Republicans were more likely to back Donalds over DeSantis (44 percent to 25 percent), according to the poll.On the Democratic side, Levine Cava held a lead with 32 percent. Former Representative Gwen Graham followed with 13 percent, while former Representative David Jolly received 10 percent support and former State Senator Lauren Book received 7 percent.The margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 2.77 percentage points.Another recent survey found that a plurality of Floridians is not happy with the Trump administration. The Civiqs poll shows Trump's net approval rating in Florida was -1 point on May 7, with 48 percent approving of the job he is doing and 49 percent disapproving.What People Are SayingDonalds on CBN News, according to Florida Politics: \"I have the support of President Donald Trump. I have the support of [Florida's GOP] Senator Rick Scott. I have the support of most of the Republican congressional delegation. And we're picking up steam every single day. I've been crisscrossing the state nonstop for the last six weeks, except when I'm here doing my job here in Washington.\"Casey DeSantis on whether she'll run for governor, in remarks reported by the Florida Phoenix: \"We'll see.\"What Happens NextThe gubernatorial field remains unclear, with potentially major candidates on both sides yet to declare.

Tim Walz, earned an Emmy nomination last week for Outstanding Edited Interview. Trump slammed the “totally discredited” Emmys on Truth Social in response.\n\nA group of Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made a direct plea to Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, to not settle the lawsuit, saying it would be a “grave mistake.”\n\n“Rewarding Trump with tens of millions of dollars for filing this bogus lawsuit will not cause him to back down on his war against the media and a free press,” Sanders and the Democrats wrote to Redstone on Tuesday. “It will only embolden him to shakedown, extort and silence CBS and other media outlets that have the courage to report about issues that Trump may not like.”\n\nTheir message may fall on deaf ears as it was previously reported that Redstone was in favor of settling the lawsuit in hopes of paving the way for Paramount’s planned merger with Skydance Media and preventing potential retribution by Trump’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which has the authority to halt the multibillion-dollar transaction. \n\nRedstone not only wanted to reportedly “keep tabs” on upcoming “60 Minutes” segments involving Trump, she reportedly urged CBS execs to delay any sensitive reporting on Trump until after the merger deal closed with Skydance. That led to the abrupt resignation of “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, who cited his inability to maintain editorial independence. \n\nOn the contrary, “60 Minutes” aired a highly critical report last Sunday about Trump’s executive order targeting Democratic law firms who’ve attacked him, the show’s staff essentially thumbing their noses at the corporate honcho. \n\n“Get out of our way and let us keep working how we have been for decades,” one CBS News staffer previously told Fox News Digital.\n\nJournalists on “60 Minutes” as well as “CBS Evening News” directly linked Paramount’s effort to settle Trump’s lawsuit to the company’s merger plans while giving an on-air salute to Owens. \n\nBut it’s no longer just stars from CBS’ news division speaking out. “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert called out his corporate bosses Tuesday night in an exchange with his guest, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. \n\n“There are reports that the owner of this company called the president – or called the chairman of this company – and said, ‘Yeah, you’ve got to get the news to lay off any bad Trump stories.’ And the word is that that was not passed on to the news division, I’m happy to say,” the CBS star told Maddow.\n\nLiberal critics in the media have lamented the precedent it would set if Paramount settled the lawsuit, which many legal experts have suggested was frivolous, including Georgetown Law Professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley, who said he was “unconvinced” by the lawsuit after previously expressing certainty any lawsuit filed over the Harris interview would fail in court. \n\nHowever, Trump has had a string of settlement victories in recent months with ABC News, X and Meta from other legal battles waged by the now-president.\n\nThe CBS lawsuit stems from the editing of an exchange Harris had with “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t “listening” to the Biden administration.\n\nHarris was widely mocked for the “word salad” answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on “Face the Nation.” However, when the same question aired during the primetime special, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris’ “word salad” answer to shield the then-vice president from further backlash leading up to Election Day. \n\nEarlier this year, FCC Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript of the interview as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC’s “news distortion” policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript when the controversy first began. \n\nThe released raw transcript and footage showed that both sets of Harris’ comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the “Face the Nation” preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special.","summary":"Paramount Global is facing mounting pressure from CBS stars and Dem lawmakers as it considers settling a high-stakes lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/09/us-news/paramount-facing-mounting-pressure-over-trump-lawsuit/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/united-states-president-donald-j-104157990.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TVuy84Aw-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-09 16:11:46","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":319673288,"title":"Democrats seethe over Biden’s media blitz: ‘Elections are about the future’","text":"Former President Joe Biden’s recent media appearances have angered Democratic Party strategists seeking to move on and redefine their movement in the wake of last year’s devastating election defeat to Donald Trump, according to a report. \n\nBiden, 81, stepped aside last summer to allow his Vice President, Kamala Harris, to run in his place amid widespread concerns about his supposed cognitive decline. However, she lost to Trump and granted the Republican a belated second term in the White House.\n\nCoinciding with the victor’s first 100 days in office, the 46th president returned to the spotlight by granting interviews to the BBC and ABC’s The View.\n\n“What the hell’s going on here? What president ever talks like that?” an energized Biden said of Trump and his threats to annex Greenland and Canada in conversation with Nick Robinson of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. \n\n“That’s not who we are. We’re about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.”\n\nHe also took his successor to task for engaging in “modern-day appeasement” in his handling of Russian President Vladimir Putin: “I just don’t understand how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, to decide he’s going to take significant portions of land that aren’t his, that that’s going to satisfy him.”\n\nMeanwhile, on The View, Biden, accompanied by his wife, former First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, continued his attack, saying Trump “has done, quite frankly, a very poor job in the interest of the United States of America.” He went on to accuse him of “blowing up” NATO. \n\nAsked why Trump was “fixated” on him, Biden won a warm round of laughter and applause from the studio audience when he answered sharply: “I beat him… I’m used to dealing with bullies.”\n\nThe veteran’s May media blitz may well boost his personal brand with the public at a time when a number of books are hitting the shelves dissecting last year’s disaster. However, according to The Hill, it has not been so well received by his old party’s strategists, who would prefer to move on rather than relitigate past hurt.\n\n“Elections are about the future. Every time Joe Biden emerges, we fight an old war,” Democratic strategist and former Biden administration staffer Anthony Coley complained.\n\n“Every interview he does provides a contrast to Trump that’s just not helpful for the Democratic brand, which needs trusted messengers and fighters who can reach independents and moderates and inspire the base. Joe Biden ain’t that.\n\n“Honestly, what good does that do now? Many Democrats – from elected leaders to the party faithful – are just ready to turn the page. I just don’t think he understands how wide and deep this sentiment is.”\n\nSteve Schale, an ally who once ran a pro-Biden super PAC, added: “There is a way for President Biden to build his post-presidency, but this isn’t it. \n\n“I really wish he’d embrace the thing that’s been his calling card for 50 years: his humanity.”\n\nSchale suggested Biden would be well advised to follow the example of the late Jimmy Carter: “By the end of his life, we were reminded of the decent and humble nature of the man thanks to his acts, not his words. I really wish Biden would follow a similar path.\n\n“Get out and work in the community. Do things that highlight the things his administration did to help people. Let the images of his human interactions and the stories they tell rebuild the brand. That’s way more powerful than playing pundit.”\n\nMore receptive to Biden’s re-emergence was party strategist Antjuan Seawright, who said: “I thought that was good for Joe Biden to just be honest and open about where things were, and where they are, and where he thinks they very well could be based on his own life experiences.\n\n“If you know Joe Biden like I know Joe Biden and have spent time with him post the presidency like I’ve spent time with him, then you will know that Joe Biden is doing what is still in the best interests of the country.\n\n“Joe Biden can still be helpful to the country, to the Congress, the Constitution, and the community.”\n\nThe former president is not the only ghost of 2024 still haunting Democrats, however.\n\nHarris recently delivered her first major speech since November, accusing the president of marching the country into recession thanks to his tariff war. She then appeared at New York’s prestigious Met Gala.\n\nHer running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, has meanwhile given a swathe of interviews to everyone from The Washington Post to fellow governor turned podcaster Gavin Newsom, offering characteristically candid insights into what he believes went wrong.\n\nNone of this has helped the party rally around a new figurehead. Governors Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, JB Pritzker, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are just some of its members tipped as future presidential candidates and leaders, but have yet to grasp the torch.","summary":"Former president provides unwanted reminder of past hurt to party strategists otherwise desperate to move on","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-democrats-media-interviews-bbc-the-view-b2748106.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/08/16/04/Jill-and-Joe-Biden-on-The-View.png?trim=0,455,0,275&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wXd8IJwR-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-09 16:03:53","author":"Joe Sommerlad","authors":["Joe Sommerlad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":319622938,"title":"Former Trump official faints live on Fox News in horror moment as medics rush in","text":"Fox News was thrown into chaos when a former Trump official collapsed live on-air.\n\n Camryn Kinsey worked for President Trump from August 2020 to 2021, during his first term in office. She was an external relations director at the White House for Trump, who was re-elected as President at the end of last year after beating Kamala Harris.\n\nKinsey appeared on Fox News on Thursday (May 8) to discuss recent comments made by former President Joe Biden, who suggested his successor Kamala Harris lost the 2024 election due to sexism. However, the live segment was cut short as she passed out in the studio and fell off of her chair.\n\nThe right-wing commentator had begun stumbling over her words before her eyes rolled back and she fainted. She said: \"So this is about incompetence, it's not about ideology or uh, it's not about uh,\" before she collapsed sideways.\n\nFox anchor Jonathan Hunt was left stunned as his guest dropped to the floor, replying: \"Oh! Oh my goodness,\" He nearly got out of his seat to help but decided to keep the broadcast running while a crew member rushed to her aid.\n\nHe turned back to the camera to address viewers while the dramatic scene unfolded next to him. \"So we're just gonna get some help for Camryn,\" he said. \"Let me come back to Lydia while we get some help for Camryn here,\"\n\nHunt decided to cut for a commercial break, signing off: \"Um, so... uh, Lydia, the...

You just see them thrown in—rough. I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice.’”\n\nThe official line was that he was just joking, but even some police officials were uncomfortable with making light of police brutality. In the ensuing years, Trump’s rhetoric has only gotten worse. His recent use of the word unleashing wasn’t by accident. Unleash means “to let happen or begin something powerful that, once begun, cannot be controlled.”\n\nThe purpose of the Constitution is to put the leash on the government and its agents. In the Declaration of Independence, colonists complained that the British king “sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.” Police officers are the front line between the government and the people—and few others have such power to deprive us of our liberties and lives.\n\nMany conservatives applauded the order, arguing that he’s merely empowering police to do their jobs. But police and prosecutors have plenty of tools. Similarly, this administration has mocked the constitutional process of due process, whereby the accused get their day in court. That protects the innocent more than the guilty by simply requiring the government to prove its case.\n\nAs someone who has covered police-abuse cases, I can guarantee that officers make mistakes, can be overly aggressive and on occasion are corrupt. After the 1980s-era War on Drugs, police often have used tactics more appropriate to an occupying military force rather than to civilian police officers. If you think police should be unrestrained, get back to me after a SWAT team gets the wrong address and invades your house instead.\n\nThis is not about letting police do their jobs. Let’s say a President Kamala Harris or Gavin Newsom—or whichever potential Democratic politician keeps you awake at night—issued an executive order calling for the feds to “unleash high-impact” IRS, ATF or EPA officers. Would you say, “That’s great, they’re just cracking down on tax cheats, illegal guns and environmental scofflaws”?\n\nOf course not. You’d instead fear they are going to tread on the rights of honest taxpayers, legitimate gun owners and law-abiding business owners. You’d believe the purpose of the executive order would be political. In 2023, for instance, a Republican-controlled House subcommittee called on the IRS to end “unannounced field visits” because they believed the agency was targeting conservative groups, abusing its power and harassing ordinary citizens.\n\nI expect this argument to fall on deaf ears given the inconsistent positions taken by members of each political tribe. As an aside, I saw a pickup truck with a “don’t tread on me” flag bumper sticker and one of those blue-striped flags symbolizing support for police. Who, exactly, does the driver think will tread on his rights? We’re all supportive of police who honestly and legally use their authority to battle crime, but only the most naïve person would believe that unleashing them from legal constraints will only hobble gang-bangers and felons.\n\nIn many ways, police already have been unleashed from reasonable limits. Consider the issue of civil asset forfeiture, whereby police officers, FBI agents and other law-enforcement officials take the homes, cars and cash of people who have never been accused of a crime. That also started with the War on Drugs. Federal officials argued that the best way to stifle criminal gangs was to take their assets.\n\nThat’s a fair point, provided it’s bound by normal, legal standards—i.e., forcing the government to prove an underlying crime before engaging in a taking. Unfortunately, police take what they want based on their own claims—and then force the owners to prove their innocence to reclaim their life’s savings. This is what unleashing looks like in the real world.\n\nSure, most police officers are honorable, which makes it all the more appalling to incentivize bad ones. “Bad cops are the product of bad policy,” wrote Radley Balko, author of “Rise of the Warrior Cop.” “And policy is ultimately made by politicians. A bad system loaded with bad incentives will unfailingly produce bad cops.” These Trump actions provide all the wrong incentives—and law-abiding citizens have much more to fear from them than criminals.\n\nSteven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

She has better fashion sense than most politicians (see again: Met Gala), a great smile, and can deliver a decent speech. But she embodies the stereotype of the out-of-touch political elite that Democrats should be rejecting. She’s in the news right now precisely because she attended fancy parties in New York and San Francisco. Her proximity to the Silicon Valley rich kept her from even embracing a Biden-level of populism and helped her lose the 2024 election. Her brother-in-law, Tony West, a lawyer with deep corporate connections, had considerable influence on her campaign, which emphasized “freedom” rather than voters’ material well-being, wealth redistribution, and curbing oligarchic power. \n\nThis inattention to the working class was even a departure from Bidenism. One reason Harris lost was that she failed to embrace what was sometimes popular about her own administration: investing in American jobs (CHIPS Act, among others), capitalist-friendly pro-climate policy (Inflation Reduction Act and aggressive agency-level regulation of pollutants); making people’s lives better and more economically stable (child tax credits and countless pandemic-era measures). Harris didn’t talk much about any of that during the campaign.","summary":"Kamala Harris has emerged from her den, apparently refreshed. Last week, she delivered a winsome keynote at a benefit gala in San Francisco, then made a surprise appearance at the Met Gala, the party of the year for New York City high society, and this week headlined a closed-door benefit for the Democratic National Committee.

During the interview, Biden appeared to throw his vice president, Kamala Harris, under the bus when discussing her loss in the 2024 presidential election. Biden didn’t hold back as he discussed the election results and his thoughts on his own involvement, raising eyebrows about his relationship with his one-time running mate. Here’s a closer look at what he said, how it impacts the Democratic Party, and whether this was a moment years in the making. Why Did Joe Biden Say He Wasn’t Surprised by Kamala Harris’ Defeat? During the The View interview, Biden revealed that he wasn’t surprised by Harris’ loss to Donald Trump in 2024. He explained that a major factor in the outcome was the lower voter turnout compared to the previous election. Biden pointed to a notable 3 million decrease in voters, which he argued impacted the results. His words were aimed at explaining why Harris couldn’t secure the victory, though he did suggest that if he had remained at the top of the ticket, the outcome could have been different. Biden also mentioned that he had outperformed Trump in 2020 by winning 7 million more votes. He insisted that he would have done the same in 2024, despite the growing concerns about his age and cognitive abilities. As the 82-year-old former president acknowledged, these questions about his mental sharpness were raised as early as 2023, particularly after a series of stumbling moments and missteps. Was Joe Biden’s 2024 Debate Performance Really That Bad? Biden didn’t mince words when discussing his performance in the 2024 presidential debate, which many saw as a disastrous night for him. He admitted that it was a “terrible night” but attributed it to feeling sick. Although he acknowledged that illness wasn’t a valid excuse, Biden remained resolute that his decades of service and political experience made him the best choice to defeat Trump. Jill Biden, his wife, also chimed in during the conversation. She recalled how, after the debate, Joe was disheartened and admitted he “screwed up.” Jill then reminded him of the bigger picture, urging him to stay positive and keep moving forward for the sake of the people depending on him. Her support was clear as she said they wouldn’t let one bad debate define his political career. Did Joe Biden Step Aside to Prevent a Divided Democratic Party? One of the key takeaways from Biden’s interview was his reasoning for stepping out of the race. According to the former president, his decision to drop out wasn’t due to fear of losing to Trump but was instead motivated by a desire to keep the Democratic Party unified. Biden emphasized that he did not want a fractured party going into the election. His decision, he claimed, was “better for the country” and came from a place of selflessness. This decision raised some questions about his personal ambitions versus the greater good of the party. But Biden made it clear that, for him, the Democratic Party’s unity was a top priority. Did Joe Biden Really Influence Kamala Harris’ Campaign? Biden also responded to rumors about his influence on Harris' campaign, particularly regarding policy decisions. One controversial moment in Harris’ campaign was when she appeared on The View and was unable to identify anything she would have done differently during Biden’s presidency. Biden was quick to deny that he had advised her to make this statement, asserting that Harris should be free to make her own decisions and stand on her own. Despite the criticism of Harris’ campaign, Biden defended her, calling her “qualified to be president.” He also highlighted the fact that her defeat was partly due to the Trump campaign’s focus on her race and gender, a pointed remark that added another layer to the conversation. What About Biden’s Thoughts on Donald Trump’s First 100 Days? When asked about his thoughts on Trump’s first 100 days in office after winning the 2024 election, Biden didn’t hold back. He labeled Trump’s early tenure as the “worst” in U.S. history, claiming that the entire global democratic system had taken a blow due to Trump’s policies. He also spoke about the lasting negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the election, citing how it influenced attitudes and optimism across the country and around the world. Biden’s words suggest that he believes the aftermath of the pandemic played a significant role in the results, a sentiment that many political analysts have echoed in their post-election breakdowns. His comments emphasized how global challenges and crises can profoundly affect election outcomes, an angle that Trump’s administration and campaigns have often minimized. What Does This Mean for Kamala Harris’ Future? Biden’s sharp remarks raise serious questions about Kamala Harris’ future in American politics. While he has called her “qualified” for the presidency, his comments seem to suggest a level of disappointment in her performance. With Trump’s looming return and the Democratic Party’s possible struggles in the next election cycle, it remains to be seen whether Harris will continue to hold a prominent role in the party’s leadership or if Biden’s comments will lead to a shift in the political landscape. As the 2024 election cycle continues to unfold, both Biden’s and Harris’ political futures remain uncertain. However, one thing is clear: Biden’s public criticism of Harris has opened a new chapter in American political discourse, and it could have far-reaching consequences for the Democratic Party’s strategy moving forward. In conclusion, Joe Biden’s appearance on The View has given political observers much to think about. His comments about Kamala Harris’ loss, his own debate performance, and his analysis of Trump’s impact on the election all shed light on the complicated dynamics at play. The political scene is ever-evolving, and Biden’s words will certainly influence the ongoing conversation surrounding the 2024 election. Whether these remarks help or hurt the future of the Democratic Party remains to be seen.FAQs:Q1: What did Joe Biden say about Kamala Harris losing the 2024 election? A1: Biden said he wasn’t surprised and felt he would’ve won if he stayed. Q2: Why did Joe Biden drop out of the 2024 race? A2: He stepped down to keep the Democratic Party united, not because he feared losing.","summary":"Joe Biden election loss comments on The View have stirred controversy after he said he wasn’t surprised Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in 2024.

The Florida-based lawyer and former computer programmer has said he once developed a software that could change votes. He opposes the use of voting machines and highlights his connection to proponents of election conspiracy theories, including Mike Lindell and Steve Bannon.\n\nSoon he is slated to start overseeing elections in Shasta county, California, a conservative region of 180,000 people in the state’s far north where Republicans vastly outnumber Democrats.\n\nAfter holding public interviews, the governing body in Shasta voted late last month to appoint the out-of-state candidate – who has never before overseen an elections office – to serve as the county clerk and registrar of voters.\n\n“I think now is the time to do things differently and lead in a different way,” said Kevin Crye, the chair of Shasta’s board of supervisors, and one of three supervisors who supported Curtis for the role. He said that Curtis could “right” what he believes is wrong with elections.\n\nThe move was not unexpected in a county that has emerged as a center of the US election denialism movement, which maintains that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election. But the decision to appoint Curtis over more experienced candidates, such as Joanna Francescut, the assistant elections clerk and registrar of voters who has worked in the office for more than 16 years, shows the deep foothold election fears and conspiracy theories have in the county.\n\nShasta county has faced years of political turmoil with the rise of a far-right faction in county government, and decisions around elections and voting have been particularly contentious.\n\nThe region’s elections office reported increased harassment and aggressive behavior toward workers in past years. Cathy Darling Allen, the longtime elections clerk who retired last year, reported being frequently maligned by ultra-conservative elected officials and residents convinced of widespread voter fraud.\n\nIn 2023, the county’s board of supervisors cut ties with Dominion Voting Systems, the voting machine company at the center of baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud, and ordered the creation of a system using a hand-count in an effort to “restore trust”.\n\nPatrick Jones, a far-right supervisor who promoted the plan, argued that year that “Elections have been manipulated at the county level for decades” and that Shasta’s efforts could put a stop to the supposed interference. Amid national outcry, state lawmakers intervened, passing a bill preventing counties from using costly and error-prone manual tallies in most elections.\n\nBut the residents who believe conspiracy theories about voter fraud and stolen elections and the supervisors who have expressed skepticism in the process, have not given up on their efforts to transform voting in the region. While Shasta is a small county with political aims at odds with those of the Democratic state, what happens here has provided a framework for election deniers on how to advance their agenda across the US and reverberated nationally.\n\nWhen the county was considering ousting Crye, one of its most conservative officials, national figures including Rand Paul and Trump ally Kari Lake urged residents to vote no on the recall.\n\nLast year when Allen announced her retirement after 20 years due to medical issues, the Shasta county board of supervisors held public interviews to replace her. Curtis and Francescut both applied then. Francescut, who oversaw the office of the county clerk and registrar of voters for months after Allen went on leave, had the endorsement of elections officials and prominent area Republicans.\n\nThe board opted then to appoint Tom Toller, a former prosecutor who had never worked in elections. He vowed to change the office culture, improve public confidence, and suggested he would be willing to pushback against the California secretary of state’s office. In the end Toller was a vocal supporter of the office, and said he never saw evidence of fraud. He rejected suggestions from a local voting commission to take action that he said wouldn’t comply with state law.\n\nToller announced plans to resign in March due to medical reasons and endorsed Francescut for the job.\n\nWhen the board of supervisors again held public interviews in April, both Francescut and Curtis applied for the job. Residents who have frequently spoken publicly about their concerns about vote tampering and stolen elections, expressed support for Curtis. But others urged the board to hire Francescut.\n\n“Appointing her would not only be the logical choice but also a step toward ending the chaos and division that has plagued our elections for the past three years,” one speaker said.\n\n“Without a doubt appointing a self-proclaimed election expert with no ties to our community, no elections experience and a history of promoting unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud would be a grave disservice to the voters of our county.”\n\nFrancescut highlighted her 16 years of experience in elections and history of working with the board of supervisors.\n\n“I have a great technical knowledge,” she told the board. “The work of election administration requires a diverse skill set, including the ability to tabulate ballots as well as marketing and educating voters.”\n\nCurtis has been known in election integrity circles since claiming that he developed a software to hack voting machines in 2000 at the request of the Florida state lawmaker Tom Feeney. He was reportedly interviewed by the FBI and spoke to Congress about his claims. Feeney, who Curtis ran against for a congressional seat, as well as his employer, denied those allegations.\n\nCurtis, who previously ran for Congress as a Democrat, told the board of supervisors he felt compelled to “fix” elections because of the software he claimed to develop. “I broke it so I better fix it,” he said.\n\nHe said had a plan to secure elections in Shasta county by installing cameras and filming every step of the process so its integrity can be verified.\n\nHe also mentioned his appearances on the shows of Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn and Mike Lindell and said he had worked in elections law for years, citing consulting work with governments in Germany and the Netherlands about hand-counting (although he declined to provide contact information for people who could verify such work or other clients to the local outlet A News Cafe.) That same outlet reported that he appeared to have lied on his application for the role. Curtis also said he had worked on the Kamala Harris ballot audit when she ran for attorney general in California.\n\nCurtis told the board he preferred hand-counting but would follow state law, and that running elections was a “pretty straightforward process”.\n\n“We can secure our elections without having to have that hand count so everyone can still see everything,” he said.\n\nSupervisor Matt Plummer opposed Curtis’s appointment, arguing his ideas had a “track record” of failure and pointing to widespread community support for Francescut. “The voters of Shasta county want Joanna in this role,” he said.\n\nSupervisor Chris Kelstrom, however, said his appointment could “change voting not only in Shasta county but possibly the whole state and possibly the whole nation”.\n\nThe board voted 3-2 in favor of hiring Curtis to serve out the remainder of the term. The appointment will be finalized after the completion of a background check.\n\nIn response to a query from the Guardian, Curtis emphasized that he had worked with people of different political beliefs.\n\n“I do not judge people by their political beliefs and feel that we must be willing to treat everyone with respect. Failing to do so just keeps us at each other throats and we accomplish nothing,” he said in an email.\n\nThe news of his appointment was met with dismay by Francescut’s supporters, including Morgan Akin, who has volunteered as a poll worker in the county alongside his wife for several years. He said he wasn’t sure if he would continue to volunteer. “She has 16 years of service there and they hired a guy who has no experience in elections.”\n\nSoon after the decision, Francescut announced her intention to run for the office in 2026.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/florida-based-election-skeptic-came-140029498.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/bd76207e715acbd530f59e106fa25d96","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 14:00:29","author":"Dani Anguiano In Redding","authors":["Dani Anguiano In Redding"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":319636328,"title":"What Pope Leo XIV has said about LGBTQ+ people, immigration and abortion","text":"Robert Francis Prevost, the first American pope, will now lead more than a billion Catholics around the world — including 53 million American Catholics.\n\nBy Mariel Padilla for The 19th\n\nAfter a little more than 24 hours of anticipation, the telltale white smoke rose from the Sistine Chapel on Thursday — signaling that the Roman Catholic Church’s 133 eligible cardinals had come to a two-thirds majority vote on who the next pope should be. The bells of St. Peter’s Basilica chimed, the crowd in St. Peter’s Square waved flags from different continents and chants could be heard: “Viva il Papa!” Long live the pope.\n\nAbout an hour later, 69-year-old Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost emerged on the central balcony of the basilica in Vatican City as the new leader of the world’s largest Christian denomination — wearing the white papal cassock for the first time and choking back tears. Throngs of priests, nuns and Vatican employees could be seen on the surrounding rooftops, trying to catch a glimpse of their new spiritual father.\n\nRelated | Trump loses another election\n\nHis chosen papal name: Leo XIV. He will now lead more than a billion Catholics around the world — including 53 million American Catholics. “Peace be with you all,” he said in Italian and Spanish from the balcony in his first public remarks. It is tradition for the new pope to offer a blessing from the balcony to the city and the world before a few additional remarks that often indicate how he plans to lead. He talked about building bridges and remaining “close to those who suffered” and emphasized peace and unity.\n\nThe names popes choose for their tenure also reflects the direction and vision they want for their papacy. Prevost’s chosen name aligns him with a lineage of Pope Leos known for strong leadership in adversity, including Leo XIII, who served in the late 1800s and emphasized the dignity and rights of the poor and working class. He is the first American to hold the papacy, as well as the first Peruvian citizen, having been naturalized after working in the country for decades. Born and raised in the Chicago area, he was ordained as a priest after studying in Rome and is fluent in Spanish and Italian.\n\nThe Catholic Church was at a crossroads, with many wondering whether new leadership would be more progressive like Francis or more conservative, like the majority of the American Catholic bishops. It appears he is pastorally aligned with Pope Francis, who named him a cardinal in 2023. Notably, Francis also asked him to preside over one the most revolutionary reforms, in which he added three women to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations are greenlit and sent to the pope.\n\nSome advocates were against his candidacy for the papacy because he has been accused of mishandling sex abuse cases in Peru and Chicago. His dioceses have maintained that the accusations were handled according to Church policy at the time.\n\nLeo’s papacy also comes at a time of tension between the Vatican and the Trump administration. A few months before he died, Pope Francis issued a letter to the church’s American bishops condemning the president’s approach to immigration and took direct aim at Vice President JD Vance’s attempts to use his Catholic faith to justify the administration’s deportation policies. Pope Leo XIV, then a cardinal, publicly agreed with Pope Francis and posted on social media that “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.”\n\nRelated | Holy disrespect: Trump's arrogance has Catholics steaming\n\nHere’s what Pope Leo XIV has said over the years on a number of issues:\n\nLGBTQ+ people\n\nWhile Pope Francis made substantial strides in pushing the church toward including LGBTQ+ people, Pope Leo XIV is seen as less progressive on queer issues. The New York Times noted in a recent story that as a bishop in Peru, he opposed a plan to include gender teaching in school, noting that, “The promotion of gender ideology is confusing, because it seeks to create genders that don’t exist.”\n\nIn speaking to bishops in 2012, he criticized Western news media for cultivating “sympathy” at odds with gospel including “homosexual lifestyle” and “alternative families comprised of same-sex partners and their adopted children.”\n\nIt’s unclear if his views have changed since. He has not fully endorsed nor opposed a document that would bless same-sex unions in the church. That said, he had supported Pope Francis’ general aim to make the church more inclusive.\n\nImmigration\n\nLeo seems to be aligned with Francis on immigrant and migrant rights, particularly because of his time in Peru, though he has not made many public statements on the issue. Francis pushed back on multiple anti-immigrant actions from Trump in the last year of his life, subtly calling out Vice President JD Vance’s beliefs on the issue in a February letter. Meanwhile, Leo’s X account has reposted several statements that were critical of Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele’s deportation plans.\n\nAbortion and reproductive care\n\nThe new pope has not made clear his views on reproductive health concerns such as access to abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization (IVF) or surrogacy. Historically, the Catholic Church has opposed those forms of health care.\n\nDuring his tenure, Pope Francis typically avoided highlighting reproductive health, though he was particularly critical of surrogacy and voiced concerns about IVF. He had also characterized the 2024 election as one that required Americans to choose between “the lesser of two evils,” citing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ support of abortion rights and President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration policies.\n\nClimate change\n\nLeo follows Francis, who was known for his progressive beliefs on combating climate change and living sustainably. The new pope has signaled alignment with Francis’ environmental priorities. In the past, Leo stressed that the world should move “from words to action,” and that humans should have a reciprocal relationship with the environment. He supported the Vatican’s shift to solar panels and electric vehicle usage.\n\nIn the days after Pope Francis died, social media platforms were flooded with conclave content as people began posting videos, memes and pope predictions as if talking about a celebrity gala or reality television show. The conclave — a historically secretive and solemn election attended only by older men in red cloaks — had a wider following this time around, particularly among the young, non-religious and perpetually online.","summary":"Robert Francis Prevost, the first American pope, will now lead more than a billion Catholics around the world — including 53 million American Catholics.\n\n\n\nBy Mariel Padilla for The 19th\n\n\n\n\nAfter a little more than 24 hours of anticipation, the telltale white smoke rose from the Sistine Chapel on Thursday — signaling that the Roman Catholic Church’s 133 eligible cardinals had come to a two-thirds majority vote on who the next pope should be.

Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., a potential 2028 presidential candidate, launched a new fact-check website on Wednesday targeting \"right-wing misinformation,\" as a new poll found more than half of California registered voters believe he is more focused on becoming president than delivering for Californians. Newsom's campaign apparatus described the new fact-check website as a \"rapid-response website to set the record straight about the Golden State\" and President Donald Trump. A new survey conducted by UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times found that 54% of California registered voters believe Newsom is more focused on his personal presidential ambitions than solving the ongoing problems at home in the Golden State. \"By a more than a two-to-one margin (54% to 26%), most voters believe that as Newsom serves out his final two years as governor, he is devoting more of his attention to things that might benefit himself as a possible candidate for president than to governing the state and helping to solve its problems,\" according to the results of the poll completed April 21-28 among 6,201 registered voters in California. TRUMP DARES NEWSOM TO RUN IN 2028, SLAMS RECORD ON LA WILDFIRES Newsom's campaign, in a press release announcing the new fact-checking endeavor, touted California as the fourth-largest economy in the world, and said the blue state's population is growing, crime rates are at historic lows and California is leading the nation in clean energy and tech innovation. WHITMER DITCHES DEM PLAYBOOK ON TRUMP'S TARIFFS AMID 2028 SPECULATION \"This site is for everyone sick of the BS about California. We’re done letting the MAGA trolls define the Golden State. We’re going on the offense and fighting back — with facts,\" Newsom said. Newsom's latest endeavor targets misinformation from the devastating Los Angeles fires this year and other state issues, including crime, climate, the economy, immigration, energy and housing. California is often ridiculed by Republicans as a representation of the demise of Democratic states. Such was the case last month when a California lawmaker proposed a bill to allow state college and university students to sleep in their cars amid the blue state's housing crisis. The California politician has long been rumored to harbor presidential ambitions. He was one of several names floated as a potential Democratic nominee replacement for President Joe Biden before Biden suspended his re-election campaign last summer and ultimately chose former Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. Newsom also campaigned for Biden and Harris in key battleground states, acting as a surrogate for both candidates when their names were on the top of the ticket. Newsom launched a podcast this year embracing political dialogue across party lines, following Democrats losing the White House and the Senate and failing to regain the House of Representatives in 2024. Newsom has invited Trump allies and conservative guests, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, onto his podcast in an attempt to show he is open to \"criticism and debate without demeaning or dehumanizing one another.\" The strategy follows criticism after the 2024 election that Democrats didn't prioritize new media appearances and unscripted conversations enough. But Newsom's willingness to soak up the national spotlight as Democrats look for someone to lead the party into the next generation may have backfired among his California constituents. Newsom is one of several Democratic governors trying to balance diplomacy with rejecting Trump's agenda during the president's second term. Newsom has spoken out against Trump's tariff policies and executive orders while reaching across the aisle to secure disaster relief following the Los Angeles fires earlier this year. The poll found a majority of California voters believe the state would be negatively impacted by Trump's overhaul of the federal government, as 64% believe Trump's tariffs would negatively impact California business and agriculture and over 50% believe Trump's policies would have a negative impact on education. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, Californians are split on Newsom's job performance, with 46% both approving and disapproving of his job as governor and 45% reporting they are not confident in \"his ability to be effective in looking out for California’s interests when dealing with the Trump administration.\" \"The Governor is focused on one thing: his job — driving L.A.’s recovery, confronting the housing crisis, and taking Donald Trump to court over his disastrous tariffs that are raising costs for families and blowing a hole in California’s budget,\" Newsom's office told Fox News in response to the new polling.","summary":"California Gov.

The Skydance boss – and son of Trump pal Larry Ellison of Oracle fame – and his partners at Redbird Capital are no fans of DEI, I am told. They are likely to dump the racial- and gender-based hiring policies without much of a fuss, my sources say.\n\nThe bad news for the rest of the media industry: The super woke companies will have to decide to give up on their lefty political biases if they want to survive with Team Trump in charge.\n\nA Skydance spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter as did press reps for Comcast and Disney. An FCC rep didn’t return a call for comment.\n\nCarr, for the unacquainted, is a longtime telecom attorney (he was an FCC commissioner before Trump appointed him chair) and conservative activist. He also believes he’s on firm ground demanding that all companies seeking his “public interest” merger approval start by nixing DEI. The acronym is better known as racial- and gender-based quotas and it is pervasive in hiring and promoting for on-air talent, and in the broader workforce, for most media companies.\n\nWhile Skydance might be willing to ditch DEI, it will be a bitter pill for the broadcast industry, one of the most woke businesses on the planet. Media and theme park giant Disney, as I point out in my book, “Go Woke Go Broke; The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America,” mandated DEI in everything from characters in its cartoons to the hiring of interns.\n\nDEI goes beyond media, of course. It’s why a trans woman was featured in a Bud Light commercial, sipping a beer and giggling about March Madness. DEI is why retailer Target featured a month of gay pride displays that were so graphic that its Middle America customer base rebelled.\n\nDEI is why Harvard skewed its admissions against high-achieving Asian students, and white males found it difficult to get hired and promoted at large companies, particularly after the 2020 killing of George Floyd. The incident ushered in calls for “racial justice” and soon quotas in employment by many leftist politicians and their supporters in corporate America.\n\nBut times are changing, or to be more precise they have changed. The courts have ruled that racial preferences are unconstitutional, whether it’s in college admissions or hiring. Donald Trump was elected on a platform of getting rid of DEI when the federal government has a say over issues.\n\nCorporate mergers — which need approval from Trump-run regulatory agencies including the FCC – falls well within those issues, my sources say. Carr, I am told, believes it’s within the “public interest” to throttle deals by using the FCC power to withhold local broadcast licenses (as opposed to cable which doesn’t have the same FCC rules) if new companies don’t agree to ditch DEI.\n\nIn just a few months, Carr has opened DEI-related cases against Disney and Comcast-owned NBC. Expect more if media mergers pick up as they should given Trump’s lighter regulatory agenda.\n\nCarr’s investigation into the Paramount-Skydance deal has been delaying the merger for months. He’s looking if the merger comports with anti-trust and public interest rules, including the Trump administration’s contention that DEI is illegal and definitely not in the public interest.\n\nHe is also investigating CBS for allegedly deceptively editing a controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris during the campaign, whether the news magazine edited out her famous word salad answers to make her sound more coherent, as many critics contend. \n\nThat investigation has teeth given the FCC’s authority over public airwaves like local broadcasting (as opposed to cable), which again must comport with FCC public interest guidelines that stipulate fairness in news broadcasting.\n\nLike Skydance, Shari Redstone, the current principal owner of Paramount, is eager to ensure that Carr’s demands are met to get the deal completed and cash in on her payday of around $2 billion, On the Money has learned. She’s also looking to settle a separate $20 billion lawsuit brought by Trump against CBS News over the alleged unfair editing of the Harris interview.\n\nCBS has stated that the lawsuit is meritless despite Redstone’s reported current plan to settle for as much as $20 million or maybe more, any day now.","summary":"Getting rid of so-called DEI will be a prerequisite for any media deal that needs FCC approval, sources tell On The Money.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/09/media/paramount-skydance-must-scrap-dei-to-pass-fccs-public-interest-litmus-test-sources/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Brendan-Carr-DEI-Skydance-Paramount-ANIMATION.gif?w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 13:13:30","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":319591622,"title":"'They’re all bad': George Conway explains GOP’s 'political calculus' with 'crazy' Trump DOJ picks","text":"Although attorney George Conway is a veteran of the conservative legal movement, he aggressively supported Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and another Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, four years later.

The appearance marked the couple’s first joint interview since departing the White House.\n\n“I do, because, look, I was in charge and he won. So, you know, I take responsibility,” Biden said when asked whether he felt accountable for Trump’s comeback victory.\n\nA break from tradition, a return to the arena\n\nUnapologetically engaging in the current political discourse, Biden, like his predecessor Trump, broke with long-standing norms for ex-presidents by offering pointed critiques of the administration that succeeded him. He dismissed Trump’s early days back in office as chaotic and ineffective.\n\n“He’s had the worst 100 days any president’s ever had,” Biden declared, offering one of his strongest public rebukes yet of the man who defeated him.\n\nDespite stepping away from elected office following a turbulent final year that included a widely criticized debate performance, Biden signaled that he still considers himself an active voice in America’s political future. He used the platform to defend his legacy, reject doubts about his cognitive health, and weigh in on broader global political trends.\n\nAddressing personal and party setbacks\n\nThe former president also responded to revelations from an upcoming book that questioned his mental acuity during his time in office. While acknowledging that the path to his departure was rocky, Biden stood firm in his belief that he had made sound, principled decisions as president.\n\n“I didn’t leave the way I wanted to. But that doesn’t change what we accomplished,” he said, adding that the pandemic’s long shadow distorted political outcomes both at home and abroad.\n\n“Liberal democracies all across America, all across the world, lost last time out,” Biden said. “I think we underestimate the phenomenal negative impact that Covid had… on people, on attitudes, on optimism.”\n\nWhen asked about Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss in the 2024 election, Biden didn’t mince words. “I was disappointed but not surprised,” he said, blaming her defeat in part on systemic bias.\n\n“They went the sexist route,” Biden continued. “I’ve never seen quite as successful and consistent a campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country—and a woman of mixed race.”\n\nA legacy under scrutiny, a voice undeterred\n\nAs speculation continues about Biden’s future role in Democratic politics, his interview offered a rare glimpse into how he views the end of his presidency—and how he hopes history will view it. Unafraid to challenge his successor or defend his record, Biden made clear that his time in the spotlight may be over, but his presence in the national conversation is not.\n\n“I take responsibility,” he reiterated. “But I won’t let that take away from what we did for this country.”","summary":"WASHINGTON, D.C. — In his first live television interview since leaving office, former President Joe Biden acknowledged personal responsibility for Donald Trump’s return to the White House following the 2024 election while fiercely defending his own presidential record and sharply criticising his successor’s early performance in office.","url":"https://www.breezyscroll.com/world/the-us/biden-breaks-silence-takes-responsibility-for-trumps-return-in-first-post-presidency-interview/","image":"https://www.breezyscroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-88.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 11:33:43","author":"Shriya Kataria","authors":["Shriya Kataria"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.078},{"id":319716876,"title":"News anchor slammed for reaction after guest suffers urgent medical emergency live on air","text":"A US news anchor has been slammed for his reaction on live TV after a guest suffered an urgent medical emergency in front of the cameras.\n\nBlunders and mishaps are part of live TV, typically leading to a prompt reaction from the broadcaster to head to a commercial break or get the cameras off the unfortunate individual.\n\nOn Thursday (May 8), former Trump administration official Camryn Kinsey appeared on Fox News to discuss Joe Biden's interview on 'The View', where he blamed sexism for Kamala Harris' defeat to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nKinsey, a political commentator and keen Trump supporter, said: \"This is what they have to do, they have to rewrite history because they had a failed campaign, they had a failed presidency.\n\n\"They put her as the border car.

Joe Biden joined Ana and the women of The View today and gave his explanation for what went wrong in November.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSARA HAINES: So, why do you think the vice president lost and were you surprised?\n\nUNKNOWN: Oh.\n\nJOE BIDEN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I wasn't surprised, not because I didn't think the vice president was qualified person to be president. She is. She's qualified to be President of The United States of America. But I was surprised -- I -- I wasn't surprised because they went the route of the sexist route on the whole route. I mean, this is a woman. She's this. She's that. I mean, it really -- I -- I've never seen quite a -- a successful and a consistent campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't leave the country and a woman of mixed race.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPHILLIP: I've seen some criticism of that, saying that it's not the full picture.\n\nBAKARI SELLERS: I mean, I -- I think there is a lot to do with that. I mean, I think anybody who says that that has absolutely nothing to do with it is- is just not being intellectually honest. Was that the whole reason? To your point, is that the full picture? Of course not. That's not the full picture. I think that there were economic headwinds against a Democrat being President of the United States. I think that there were immigration headwinds against a Democrat being President of the United States. And I also think that there were people who felt as if- and if this is the most amazing stat that came out of the most recent election: Are you better off four years ago?\n\nPHILLIP: Right.\n\nSELLERS: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? And the overwhelming majority of people answered that question “no”.\n\nPHILLIP: Yeah.\n\nSELLERS: Kamala Harris was more than qualified to be President of the United States, and I'm not sure that any Democrat, and I say this again, would have beaten Donald Trump in that race.\n\nPHILLIP: Why -- but why can't Joe Biden understand that? That it's -- that it was immigration, the economy. Why -- I mean, I thought that was -- hold on. I thought that was the most strike -- one of the most striking things was his unwillingness to even acknowledge that maybe some of the issues had to do with it, too.\n\nANA NAVARRO: No. If you watched the entire interview, he did acknowledge it, and he took responsibility. He said, look, I was in charge. So, yeah, the buck stops with me. I was, you know, it is my responsibility. I think part of what -- what happened between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and -- and this entire election is that there's a lot of affection and loyalty between the two.\n\nThere was a lot of gossip for four years that they didn't like each other, that he was undercutting her, that she was unhappy. I think she couldn't distance him -- herself from him out of loyalty. And I think today what you heard from him was a lot of deference and affection towards his vice president, a role that he played.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Hold on. But let me -- let me ask you a question though. He said he wasn't surprised that she lost, but that he would have won the race. That's like saying, well, you know, I was a boat anchor on my vice president, so she drowned in this election, but the anchor itself would have floated? That's a crazy- that is crazy talk for him to say that.\n\nNAVARRO: No, Scott, he -- he did not say that. He did not say --\n\nFERGUSON: He did.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJENNINGS: He literally said, I wasn't surprised --\n\nFERGUSON: He said I would have won.\n\nJENNINGS: I would have won. The idea that he believes to this day --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nUNKNOWN: I don't -- I don't --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPHILLIP: He not only said that, he has said it repeatedly that he believes he would have won.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nFERGUSON: Let's go back to what he said about racism. Can we just take a moment and talk about a white guy saying that racism's why it shouldn't win, and also the same white guy, Joe Biden, says I would have won. Like, you were one and the same person here. Like, if you're going to blame racism, it's absurd. My point is, I didn't say she lost because racism is absurd. She lost because the country was in a disastrous place, and they blamed him and his politics. She had to defend.\n\nNAVARRO: Can I tell you something?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNAVARRO: Can I tell you something? You, as white guy have the privilege of saying that racism and you as a white male -- okay. I am telling you right now, okay. And I am -- okay. Okay, Ben.\n\nFERGUSON: I'm saying it's an incredibly ridiculous statement as a white guy --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNAVARRO: As a woman of color, I am telling you that it is incredibly ridiculous for you, with the privilege that being a white male gives you in this country, to say that there wasn't some element of racism.\n\nFERGUSON: I think it was the policies. I think if you guys stick --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nUNKNOWN: One second, Ben.\n\nFERGUSON: Hold on. If you stick with this plan, which is every time we lose an election, racism has to be involved.\n\nSELLERS: That's not what I just said. I literally gave you a full picture.\n\nPHILLIP: Yeah, I mean, he didn't say that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nFERGUSON: That's what Joe Biden said.\n\nSELLERS: Full picture. And what I'm also saying is that yes, I believe Joe Biden saying he'd win the election is delusional, right? So I said that because I also said there is a certain point. But let me also explain with the equal level of delusion. You do understand that black folk, particularly black women, have to run twice as fast as you do to achieve the same goal. And if you do not understand\n\nFERGUSON: I disagree with that. \n\nSELLERS: You can.\n\nFERGUSON: I disagree with that.\n\nSELLERS: You can, and I'm just telling you that that is the experience whether or not you're in politics or the business world or education.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nFERGUSON: So, let me ask you this.\n\nPHILLIP: Hold on, hold on, Ben.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nFERGUSON: -- Joe Biden from candidacy. If what you're saying is true, then he would have won overwhelmingly.\n\nPHILLIP: Bakari --\n\nSELLERS: That's not what I just said.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPHILLIP: Let me -- let me just actually ask you something because --\n\nSELLERS: That's not what I just --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nUNKNOWN: You're not making any sense.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nFERGUSON: You -- you just said that it's twice as hard for African- Americans to win.\n\nPHILLIP: Just a second. Given what you just said, if you believe that it would have been twice as hard for Kamala Harris to win, isn't it even more important for Joe Biden to have given her ability to --\n\nSELLERS: I don't- I don't think that's a question. But that -- that's not a -- that's not a question. And Ana brought up a good point because --\n\nNAVARRO: No.\n\nSELLERS: Out of all -- all the people -- I'd say this is a good question. I said out of all the people that are sitting around this table, I was actually a part of those discussions. And the person who did not want to distance himself because of loyalty, although she might not have had the loyalty given back from some of the women, particularly who were around Joe Biden, was Kamala Harris. (CROSSTALK)\n\nPHILLIP: Yeah, but -- but did Joe Biden say --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSELLERS: She did have it from Joe Biden. Correct. That's actually a fact.\n\nPHILLIP: But did Joe Biden ever say to her, you need to do --\n\nJENNINGS: Yes, that's right.\n\nPHILLLIP: Exactly what you need to do to win this election.\n\nSELLERS: No.\n\nJENNINGS: You're totally right.\n\nPHILLIP: You need to --\n\nSELLERS: No.\n\nPHILLIP: -- pursue a policy that is --\n\nSELLERS: No. And by the way --\n\nPHILLIP: -- what you need. So that's -- that's the answer, right?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSELLERS: I cannot I cannot let this go. I cannot let this go on this show in front of millions of Americans who will watch this whether or not it's on Snapchat, TikTok or Twitter. The point still remains when we're talking about the issue of race and gender in this country that everyone is not on equal playing fields. That the fact that, yes, we have a black woman, whether or not she is in academia, whether or not she's in business or in politics.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSELLERS: The field is not equal. She's actually the best candidate for governor of the- of the state of Georgia or whatever else she wants to do.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nFERGUSON: If she's so good and it's only an issue of what you're saying?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSELLERS: California. What did I say?\n\nPHILLIP: Georgia.\n\nSELLERS: Okay. Sorry.\n\nPHILLIP: All right, Scott. Hold on, Ben. Scott, go ahead.\n\nJENNINGS: Can I ask you one other sort of forward looking issue? Watching him on The View today and watching some of the interviews he did over --\n\nNAVARRO: Thank you for your viewership.\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah, I saw it. It's rare for me, but I did -- I did watch it.\n\nSELLERS: (UNINT)\n\nJENNINGS: I will just say, watching him over the last few days reminded me that a whole bunch of people were telling us with a straight face that this man was capable of serving another four years as president. And that these appearances, coupled with what I understand is going to be the equivalent of a nuclear bomb dropped on the Democratic Party when Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book come out next week, I don't know that the Democrats have fully internalized what's about to happen to them between what he looks like today and what they're about to report. Get ready. Get ready.\n\nPHILLIP: I am not -- I am not sure that Joe Biden, fully realizes even his own deficits in this moment, Ana. I think seriously, he seems to not, to -- I mean, you -- he was asked about it directly and he doesn't seem to get it at all, which is part of the problem.\n\nNAVARRO: Well, look, Abby. I don't know many elected officials, in any party who willingly walk away from their elected office, right? I think it's hard for everybody. Look, I -- I think this was very hard for Joe Biden and I think he took responsibility for that. He did not say what you just said, Scott, that he said --\n\nJENNINGS: What? What?\n\nNAVARRO: You just said that he told --\n\nJENNINGS: What did he not say?\n\nNAVARRO: He -- you said that he told Kamala Harris that she could not have any distance from him.\n\nJENNINGS: False. It's been reported. He told her point blank- he told her point blank, “no daylight.”\n\nNAVARRO: It doesn't matter what he was-\n\nJENNINGS: He told her point blank, “no daylight, kid.” “No daylight.”\n\nNAVARRO: Okay, because reporting can never be wrong?\n\nJENNINGS: Are you attacking the journalism around it? \n\nNAVARRO: You think reporting can never be wrong? \n\nJENNINGS: Are you attacking the journalism around it? If you want to be anti-journalism, I’ll be pro-journalism.\n\nNAVARRO: You come in and you come out here and you attack reporting every night.\n\nJENNINGS: I do not.\n\nNAVARRO: We actually asked him the question directly.\n\nJENNINGS: I'm -- I'm -- there's critical reporting about this guy.\n\nNAVARRO: Okay.\n\nJENNINGS: And he told her point blank --\n\nNAVARRO: Well, we asked him --\n\nJENNINGS: -- “no daylight.”\n\nNAVARRO: -- we asked him directly today. Did you tell her that?\n\nPHILLIP: All right, last --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJENNINGS: You think he's never told a lie?\n\nNAVARRO: I don't think he tells many lies.\n\nFERGUSON: He told a lie about his cognitive decline. I can tell you that much.\n\nNAVARRO: I don't think he tells many lies. I don't think he's --\n\nJENNINGS: LOL\n\nFERGUSON: Come on!\n\nNAVARRO: Wait. Wait. No. You know why you don't get to laugh like that? Because you support a guy who lies every freaking day and lies continuously.\n\nJENNINGS: Because it’s tragic what you just said. Because it’s tragic. It's tragic what you just said. “I don’t think he tells many lies?”\n\nNAVARRO: You support a guy who cannot -- who cannot acknowledge that he lost the 2020 election and that lies about it.\n\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNAVARRO: I have no idea what's in Jake Tapper’s- have you read it? \n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPHILLIP: We got to go guys.

Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?'\"\n\nThe Independent also reported Prevost resharing a tweet which reads: \"There is nothing remotely Christian, American, or morally defensible about a policy that takes children away from their parents and warehouses them in cages. This is being carried out in our name and the shame is on us all.\"\n\nThe newly elected pope has also hit out at Trump's vice president JD Vance, resharing an op-ed from the National Catholic Reporter titled: \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\"\n\nLoomer - a vocal Trump supporter whose conspiracy theories include that 9/11 was an inside job - didn't hold back.\n\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, she slammed Prevost as an 'anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist' - 'like Pope Francis'.\n\n\"Catholics don’t have anything good to look forward to, she added. \"Just another Marxist puppet in the Vatican.\"\n\nIn another post, she simply wrote: \"WOKE MARXIST POPE.\"\n\nLoomer made headlines last September after reports swirled that she was behind Trump's decision to fire members of the National Security Council she deemed disloyal—though Trump has denied her involvement.\n\nShe's previously claimed that Kamala Harris is not black, and that the son of billionaire George Soros was 'sending cryptic messages calling for Trump's assassination', the BBC also reported.\n\nHer strong views - particularly against Muslims - have led her to be banned from social media platforms and even rideshare services like Uber and Lyft.","summary":"![CDATA[The president may be celebrating, but not all his allies are... ]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/world-news/pope-leo-anti-maga-woke-laura-loomer-comments-905765-20250509","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt028dc0e5ef67c87c/681dc4c1e18f677bfadacde7/pope-laura-loomer-woke-marxist-comments.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 10:58:12","author":"Ellie Kemp","authors":["Ellie Kemp"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.011},{"id":319525672,"title":"Fox News Guest Suffers Scary Collapse Live on Air: ‘Oh My Goodness!’","text":"A Fox News pundit collapsed live on air while attacking former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nFormer Trump administration staffer Camryn Kinsey was on Fox News @ Night Thursday talking about Biden’s appearance on The View earlier in the day. \n\nWhilst criticizing the 82-year-old former president, as well as the Democratic Party’s muddled messaging, the 24-year-old’s speech slowed and she fell off her chair in an apparent faint. \n\nKinsey had been asked by host Jonathan Hunt why she thought Kamala Harris lost the election last year. She gave token MAGA answers and launched into an explanation about “ideology.” \n\n“They had a failed presidency and campaign. She never went to the border. So this is about incompetency, it’s not about ideology...” she said before her speech slurred, her face froze, and she fell sideways off her chair, landing with a thud on the studio floor. \n\n“Oh! Oh my goodness,” Hunt said as production staffers rushed to Kinsey’s aid. \n\nHe tried to keep the show on the road, turning to the camera and saying: “So we’re just gonna get some help for Camryn...um.. let me come back to Lydia while we get some help for Camryn here.”\n\nA producer in his ear then appears to inform him they will go to a commercial break instead of speaking with the other contributor. \n\n“Um, so.. uh, Lydia.. the...ah president...

We have paramedics checking her. We will keep you updated. We wish her all the best,” he said. \n\nHunt took some heat online for not tending to the political commentator after her fall. “A normal person would have immediately gotten up and tried to help. Who is that Fox News anchor?” one person asked on X. \n\n“How on earth would you continue to broadcast when someone right beside you passes out?” another asked. “Where’s humanity these days? OMG.” \n\nOthers pointed out that the production team helped the guest and lauded Hunt for continuing to broadcast. “People were already helping her. What else do you think he could do. They had it handled.

His opponents in the race — first President Biden and then Vice President Kamala Harris — aggressively tried to tie him to the Heritage Foundation's unpopular conservative playbook, which was unveiled in 2023. Trump vociferously denied it was his plan, and the White House still does. Now, several months into Trump's second term, what is clear is that he is working with incredible speed to implement an array of policies that align with those espoused by Project 2025's conservative authors and contributors, some of whom Trump has appointed to prominent administration posts. A tracking project claims Trump has already implemented more than 40% of Project 2025’s recommendations. Here are five areas where the alignment is evident: In a Project 2025 chapter on the powers of the executive, Russell Vought — who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget during Trump’s first term — envisioned Trump moving quickly to “break the bureaucracy to the presidential will” by firing huge numbers of career federal employees, installing loyalists in positions of power and taking control of the federal purse strings from Congress. Vought argued career federal employees with liberal leanings had taken too much power, and the next conservative president should seize that power back. When Trump was elected, he appointed Vought to again head OMB, and Vought, along with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, swiftly got to work attacking the federal bureaucracy. The OMB froze trillions of dollars in federal funding allocated by Congress. Vought prompted mass government layoffs by ordering federal agencies to “focus on the maximum elimination of functions that are not statutorily mandated.” The courts are now hearing multiple challenges to firings, funding cuts and other Trump administration efforts to downsize the federal government. Trump appointed multiple immigration hard-liners with ties to Project 2025 to prominent roles in his administration, including Stephen Miller as his deputy chief of staff for policy and Tom Homan as his “border czar.” They have pushed various policies also espoused by the playbook. Project 2025 said prioritizing “border security and immigration enforcement, including detention and deportation,” was crucial, called for many more detention beds to be created, and said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement should rescind policies that barred agents from staging immigration enforcement raids in “sensitive places” such as schools, hospitals and churches. The Trump administration has ordered the biggest mass deportation program in U.S. history, called for billions to be invested in massive new immigration detention facilities, and promptly did away with ICE policies barring raids in sensitive places. It has also claimed sweeping executive powers to target immigrants in the country illegally, as Project 2025 recommended. Project 2025 proposed that all federal regulations that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity be rescinded, that transgender service members be ousted from the military and that gender-affirming care be strictly limited. It also called for bans on federal funding for gender-affirming care and for “gender ideology” to be removed from all school curricula, suggested transgender athletes were endangering girls’ sports, and called for the total erasure of transgender identities in federal regulations, policies and materials. Trump has begun implementing all of those policies. His administration announced plans to remove transgender service members, ordered the removal of LGBTQ+ references in agency materials, threatened local schools that allow transgender athletes to compete, threatened hospitals that provide gender-affirming care, and began clawing back federal funding from LGBTQ+ healthcare providers. In his chapter on trade, economist Peter Navarro argued the U.S. must expand domestic manufacturing and called on the next president to take a particularly hard line on trade with China. Promptly after being elected, Trump appointed Navarro as his senior counselor for trade and manufacturing. Within months, he announced sweeping new “reciprocal tariffs” against nations around the globe and even stiffer tariffs on China, suggesting those moves would return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. The episode sent shock waves through the global economy and has produced rare examples of pushback against Trump's agenda from Republicans in Congress. Project 2025 called for dismantling the Department of Education. The Trump administration has ordered massive layoffs there, which Education Secretary Linda McMahon called the “first step” toward eliminating the agency. It has also sought to rescind hundreds of millions of dollars in education funding and ordered schools nationwide to end “diversity, equity and inclusion,” or DEI, initiatives and support for transgender students. Project 2025 also called for ending federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, accusing both the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio — and even “Sesame Street” — of harboring anti-conservative bias and having little educational value. Trump signed an executive order to cut the funding.","summary":"In his first several months in office, President Trump has worked with incredible speed to implement policies that align with Project 2025.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-05-09/5-ways-trump-administration-implementing-project-2025","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d05f767/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7996x4198+0+567/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F93%2F4cb13ebb465b96e94e4af3fe0700%2Felection-2024-conser","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 10:00:00","author":"Kevin Rector","authors":["Kevin Rector"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.075},{"id":319496186,"title":"Tom Cruise Greets Adoring Fans on the Red Carpet in South Korea, Plus George Clooney, David Beckham, Kate Middleton and More","text":"Famous Face \n\n Tom Cruise waves as fans hold up pictures of the actor at a Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning red carpet in Seoul, South Korea, on May 8.\n\n Play Ball \n\n A smiling George Clooney tees up to throw a ball while playing a game in New York City's Central Park on May 8.\n\n Cuppa Coffee \n\n David Beckham nurses a cup of Nespresso at the brand's flagship boutique launch in London on May 8.\n\n Royal Round of Applause \n\n Prince William and Kate Middleton hold the British flag as they clap during a concert celebrating the 80th anniversary of VE Day in London on May 8.\n\n Lacy Look \n\n Lizzo beams in an edgy black outfit while out on a stroll in New York City on May 8.\n\n Triple the Talent \n\n Darren Criss, Nicole Scherzinger and Jonathan Groff hang out at the Tony Awards' Meet the Nominees event in New York City on May 8.\n\n Glad to Be Here \n\n Also at the Tony Awards' Meet the Nominees event in N.Y.C., Glengarry Glen Ross' Bob Odenkirk keeps it casual on May 8.\n\n Think Pink \n\n Paris Hilton reps her new skin care brand PARÍVIE while out in New York City on May 8 dressed in pink all over.\n\n When in Rome... \n\n Lily Collins snaps a selfie while filming Emily in Paris season 4 in Rome on May 8.\n\n As Stylish As Possible \n\n A$AP Rocky and A$AP Nast party at a private event held hosted by Dover Street Market at Soho House in New York City on May 8.\n\n Couple Activities \n\n Cruz Beckham and Jackie Apostel go on an art gallery date to see the \"Bob Dylan: Point Blank\" exhibition in London on May 8.\n\n Toast to This \n\n Scheana Shay, in a red-scaled mini-dress, raised her Absolut Cosmo martini in honor of her 40th birthday at her Los Angeles party on May 7.\n\n Shondaland Forever \n\n Conrad Ricamora, James Pickens Jr., Betsy Beers, Shonda Rhimes, Bellamy Young and Scott Foley celebrate 20 years of Rhimes' television success in New York City at The Paley Museum on May 7.\n\n Three in a Row \n\n Charlie Vickers, Daniel Weyman and Charles Edwards arrive at a FYC event for The Rings of Power in Los Angeles on May 7. \n\n Ladies Who Lunch \n\n Kate Lauprete, Scarlett Johansson, Kathleen Barnea Spink and Katherine Birch bring their best garden party attire for the Frederick Law Olmsted Awards Luncheon in New York City on May 7.\n\n Fun and Games \n\n Natasha Lyonne and Cynthia Erivo smile from ear-to-ear as they hug at Peacock x Vanity Fair Game Night in New York City on May 7.\n\n A Rare Beauty \n\n A stylish Selena Gomez is in character as Mabel on the set of Only Murders in the Building season 5 in New York City on May 7.\n\n Royal Spotted \n\n Prince William wears medals while Kate Middleton wears polka dots after a VE Day service in London on May 8.\n\n Puppy Love \n\n Miranda Lambert cuddles with an adorable dog at rehearsals for the 2025 ACM Awards in Frisco, Texas, on May 7.\n\n Man on a 'Mission' \n\n Tom Cruise attends the South Korea press conference for Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning on May 8.\n\n Star on the Steps \n\n Téa Leoni takes a seat on the set of Only Murders in the Building season 5 in New York City on May 7.\n\n Got Us Like O-M-G \n\n Usher brings out Eve for the final London show of his Past Present Future tour on May 7.\n\n Shining Stones \n\n Megan Moroney sparkles in a gem-studded mini-dress at the Play Something Country gala in Frisco, Texas, on May 7.\n\n Golden Girl \n\n Lainey Wilson tips her hat at the ACM's Play Something Country gala in Frisco, Texas, on May 7.\n\n Good to Go \n\n Kelsea Ballerini gives a thumbs up at the ACM Country Kick-Off in Frisco, Texas, on May 7.\n\n Meet Your Heroes \n\n Hollywood Squares host Drew Barrymore smiles with Matlock's Leah Lewis at CBSFest 2025 in Los Angeles on May 7.\n\n He Knows How to Ball \n\n Max Greenfield reps the New York Knicks on his jacket at CBSFest 2025 in Los Angeles on May 7.\n\n Sofa, So Good \n\n Also at CBSFest 2025, Padma Lakshmi takes a seat in Los Angeles on May 7.\n\n I'm Flying!

administration official Camryn Kinsey fainted on live television when she railed against former President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on Thursday night.\n\nKinsey’s frightening caught-on-camera moment happened during her appearance on “Fox News @ Night” as she talked with Jonathan Hunt who was filling in for Trace Gallagher.\n\nThe 24-year-old political commentator was sounding off on Biden’s divisive interview on “The View,” where he blamed “sexist” Americans for Harris’ 2024 election loss to President Trump.\n\n“This is what they have to do, they have to rewrite history because they had a failed campaign, they had a failed presidency. They put her as the border czar. She never went to the border. So this is about incompetency. It’s not about uh ideology,” Kinsey said as she became incoherent.\n\nKinsey, who served as the External Relations Director inside the Presidential Personnel Office during Trump’s first term, struggled with her words before she went silent.\n\nShe took a quick breath before her eyes shut and she fell out of her chair.\n\nThe television camera quickly cut to Hunt as a crewmember rushed to Kinsey’s side.\n\nThe stunned anchor attempted to transition to the next segment before cutting himself off and sending the show to a prolonged commercial break.\n\n“We’re just going to get some help here for Camryn,” Hunt said. \n\nHunt revealed Kinsey was doing better after receiving medical attention.\n\n“Camryn is up and moving, we have paramedics checking her out now. We will keep you updated and of course we wish Camryn all the best,” Hunt said after the show returned from break.\n\nKinsey, a former Division I cheerleader, served as the White House correspondent for One America News Network for six months after her stint in the Trump administration.\n\nShe has most recently founded the media marketing consulting firm, Titan Media Strategies, according to her LinkedIn.\n\nHours before the frightening on-air scene, Kinsely celebrated the election of Pope Leo XIV.\n\n“New Pope!” she wrote on X.\n\nEarlier in the broadcast, Kinsey blasted Biden’s decision to go on the ABC program months after leaving office and refusing to take responsibility for the Democrats’ loss.\n\nBiden revealed Thursday that he “wasn’t surprised” President Trump trounced Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n“I wasn’t surprised, not because I didn’t think the vice president wasn’t the most qualified person to be president. She is,” Biden said.\n\nBiden blamed Trump’s consistent attacks on Harris for her failed presidential campaign, calling it “sexist.” \n\n“I wasn’t surprised because they went the route of a, the sexist route, whole route, this is a woman, she’s this, she’s that,” Biden claimed.","summary":"The 24-year-old was sounding off on Biden's divisive interview on \"The View,\" where he blamed Kamala Harris' 2024 election loss to President Trump on \"sexist\" Americans earlier.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/09/media/ex-trump-admin-official-camryn-kinsey-faints-during-live-fox-television-interview-in-scary-moment/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/104139012.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F9UFiFqn-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-09 09:56:20","author":"Nicholas McEntyre","authors":["Nicholas McEntyre"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.457}]}
