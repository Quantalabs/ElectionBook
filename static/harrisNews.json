In the U.S. House of Representatives, California now has 17% Republicans (9/52) and Texas has 34% Democrats (13/38), twice the proportion.\n\nIf Texas’ redistricting changes five seats as expected, Texas’ Democratic proportion will drop from 34% to 21% (8/38), which is still higher than California’s 17%. Proposition 50 is not needed for fairness.\n\nIf California’s Proposition 50 also reverses five seats, California’s proportion of House Republicans would drop from 17% to 8% (4/52), which is unacceptably low. Note no on Proposition 50.\n\nDavid Berti\n\nLetters’ Prop. 50\narguments lack nuance\n\nRe: “Prop. 50 would worsen under-representation” and “Plainly speaking, Prop. 50 is unfair” (Page A6, Oct. 14).\n\nBoth writers have some valid points; however, some nuance might have strengthened the power of their arguments. Gov. Newsom says he regrets having to endorse Proposition 50, whereas Arnold Schwarzenegger says two wrongs do not make a right.\n\nCombining these thoughts, and looking for a good direction, I posit the following: Imagine being a passenger riding on a bus loaded with people. It is illegal and dangerous for a rider to grab the steering wheel under most circumstances.\n\nImagine now that the bus starts to veer into oncoming traffic, or is headed over a cliff. The driver may have fallen asleep or is trying to commit suicide. It would be unconscionable for a passenger not to grab the wheel and try to save many lives.\n\nThis may well be a good comparison to the background and details of Proposition 50. Please think carefully … then vote accordingly.\n\nRichard Bartlett\n\nPorter’s debacle shows\na lack of leadership\n\nRe: “Porter’s meltdown opens door for Padilla” (Page A7, Oct. 15).\n\nAs many people did, I witnessed the clip of Katie Porter’s interview with Sacramento journalist Julie Watts and was appalled by her inability to handle a reporter’s questions. If she can’t even cope with a reporter, how is she possibly going to be able to manage the State of California?\n\nShe has lost my support and my vote. I’ll now be supporting Xavier Becerra or, perhaps, Alex Padilla should he choose to run.\n\nPeggy Moyers\n\nTime for Oakland to\nrequire healthy options\n\nI am part of the Oakland HOPS (Healthy Option at Point of Sale), a youth-led initiative working to set a minimum nutrition standard for products sold at checkout.\n\nAs an Oakland resident and student-athlete, I see how much our society pushes unhealthy food onto us. It is difficult to find healthy options in corner stores near school. Passing Healthy Checkout would be putting Oaklanders’ health first.\n\nWe’ve spent the past five years collecting data, hosting focus groups, meeting with residents, businesses and city leaders. This isn’t just about food, it’s about long-term health. It’s about real choice, not the illusion of choice surrounded by sugar and salt.\n\nOakland has the chance to become the second city in the nation to pass this kind of policy. We believe that change is possible. We’re ready. The community is ready. Is our City Council ready?\n\nAshley Trousdell\n\nFederal employees need\nwork, not pink slips\n\nRe: “Judge halts firing of federal workers” (Page A1, Oct. 16).\n\nU.S. District Judge Susan Illston’s ruling to temporarily halt the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the government shutdown was a wise action and a great victory for working families, including many here in the Bay Area.\n\nFederal employees across local agencies have endured weeks of uncertainty, anxiety and deepening financial hardship as bills go unpaid and savings are depleted. Receiving layoff notices and being locked out of their work accounts with no one around to help them is both disrespectful and unfair. The administration appears focused on using federal workers as leverage against Congress rather than resolving the shutdown responsibly.\n\nOur dedicated civil servants deserve dignity and respect, not to be treated as pawns in political strategies. The courts must continue standing against reckless administrative stunts that cause unnecessary harm to innocent people.\n\nAlexandros Silva\n\nU.S. leaders choose\nposturing over solutions\n\nThe current government shutdown is one more example of how those whom we have placed in power over us care more about that power than the security, safety and prosperity of their citizens.\n\nThe current video requested to be played at TSA counters by the United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, blames the Democrats for the government shutdown. Apparently, it is more important to posture and confront (to gain political points) than to work toward a resolution of this intentionally manufactured crisis.\n\nWe live in a democracy that is supposed to be about learning to live with each other and finding a middle ground that is, at least, tolerated by most. Instead, the current political climate, from the top of the government down, promotes power-grabbing over all else. Those we have trusted to lead need to work together for the common good.\n\nRandall Klein","summary":"Also: Lacking nuance &#124; Porter's debacle &#124; Healthy options &#124; Federal workers &#124; Leaders posturing.

Among registered voters, she’s up by 4 points (48-44%), down from a 7-point lead (48-41%). Either way, the race has tightened, and Sherrill’s edge is inside the poll’s margin of sampling error. This analysis uses registered voter results. FOX NEWS POLL: DEMOCRAT SHERRILL LEADS NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR'S RACE Key groups that give Sherrill her advantage include Black voters, those under age 35, women ages 45 and younger, those with a college degree and Hispanic voters. Ciattarelli’s best groups include MAGA supporters, men without a college degree, White men, Catholics and those ages 55-64. About nine in 10 of each candidate’s supporters say they are certain to back them, but more of Ciattarelli’s supporters (69%) say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this year than Sherrill’s (64%). On both sides, one in 10 supporters say they could change their mind before voting. Recent campaign attacks have taken a toll on the candidates’ favorability and honesty ratings. Sherrill’s honesty and trustworthy marks remain positive overall — but have declined since late September. More voters now view her as more honest than not, by a 5-point margin (52–47%), down from a 16-point advantage just three weeks ago (56–40%). FOX NEWS POLL: UNHAPPY WITH NYC'S DIRECTION, VOTERS FAVOR MAMDANI FOR MAYOR BY A WIDE MARGIN A similar shift occurred in her personal ratings. Sherrill was viewed more favorably than unfavorably by 10 points last month (51-41%) — and, now, views are net positive by only 2 points (50-48%). Views of Ciattarelli have also shifted negatively, though not as much as Sherrill’s. On honesty, his marks have gone from being in positive territory by 4 points in September to underwater by 2 points today. His favorable ratings are net negative by 3 points now vs. by 2 points last month. \"The allegations about Sherrill’s record at the Naval Academy damaged her, but the manner in which those records were obtained have left Ciattarelli open to criticism as well,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps conduct the Fox News Poll with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson. \"On the whole, it seems Ciattarelli has benefited slightly, if only because he was behind and needed to change the dynamics of the race.\" On some traits, perceptions of the candidates are closely aligned. For instance, 54% think Sherrill, a U.S. congresswoman, is a \"strong leader\" and an equal number, 54%, feel the same about Ciatterelli, a former state assemblyman. Half believe the phrase \"can bring needed change\" applies to each. On other characteristics, there are modest differences — such as empathy: 55% think \"cares about people like me\" describes Sherrill, compared to 49% for Ciattarelli. Voters identify taxes (34%) and the cost of living (19%) as the top two problems facing the Garden State, and a larger number trusts Sherrill to handle both of those — by 3 points on taxes and by 6 points on the cost of living. She is also favored on energy costs (+3) and healthcare (+14), while more trust Ciattarelli to handle crime (+7). Some 92% of Republicans support Ciattarelli, and 89% of Democrats back Sherrill, while the small subgroup of independents splits. Sherrill benefits from more NJ voters identifying as Democrats than Republicans. The candidates are competing to fill term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s seat. He beat Ciattarelli by about 3 points in the last election and leaves the governor’s mansion with mixed marks: 47% of New Jersey voters have a positive view of him vs. 49% negative. In addition, while more than half, 55%, are currently unhappy with how things are going in the state, that’s an improvement from 62% who were dissatisfied in the months preceding Murphy’s first term. In both 2020 and 2016, President Donald Trump received 41% of the vote in New Jersey. He performed better in 2024, garnering 46%, yet still losing to former Vice President Kamala Harris (52%). Today, 45% of New Jersey voters have a favorable opinion of Trump, while 54% view him unfavorably. That’s up from eight years ago. During his first term, it was 36% favorable vs. 62% unfavorable. NJ: CLICK HERE FOR CROSSTABS AND TOPLINE Conducted October 10-14, 2025 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,002 New Jersey registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (153) and cellphones (592) or completed the survey online by following a link received via text message (257). There was a subsample of 869 likely voters. Results based on both the registered voter and likely voter sample have a margin of sampling error of ± 3 percentage points. Sampling error for results among subgroups is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Sources for developing weight targets include the most recent American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Likely voters are identified based on past vote history and self-reported likelihood of voting. Results among subgroups are only shown when the sample size is at least N=100.

Cameron has led the other candidates by double digits in recent polling.\n\nAn October internal poll commissioned by the Cameron campaign showed Cameron in the lead with 39% of likely Kentucky GOP voters, Barr at 22%, and Morris at 8%. A separate October poll commissioned by the Barr campaign also showed Cameron in the lead at 42%, Barr at 25%, and Morris at 10%.\n\nCameron’s campaign told the Washington Examiner that his name recognition in Kentucky has boosted his popularity. The campaign’s internal poll showed him with a 56% favorability rating, double digits higher than that of Barr and Morris.\n\n“Money is important, and we feel confident we will have plenty of resources to win in May from both our campaign and outside conservative groups supporting us,” the Cameron campaign said in a statement. “But if money was everything then Kamala Harris should be President and Amy McGrath should be an incumbent U.S. Senator. Voters matter most- and voters LOVE Daniel Cameron.”\n\nThe Barr campaign has used the polling to argue the GOP primary is a “two-man race” between Barr and Cameron, deeming Morris too many steps behind in the polls. However, both the Barr and Morris campaigns are saying money talks.\n\n“Andy Barr is dominating this race,” Barr campaign spokesman Alex Bellizzi said. “He’s built an unmatched campaign operation with more than four times the cash on hand of his opponents — including 10 times more than his only real competitor, Daniel Cameron.”\n\nBarr led the GOP primary contestants with over $6.6 million in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. Morris had over $1 million, and Cameron had $629,748.\n\nMorris gave seven separate loans to his own campaign, totaling just over $3 million since July, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\n“We’re not concerned with fake internal polls — Nate is going to spend whatever it takes to win this race,” Morris campaign spokesman Conor McGuinness said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “We’re just getting started.”\n\n“It tells you everything you need to know that Andy Barr and Daniel Cameron have spent all their time, energy, and resources attacking Nate Morris from the minute he got into this race,” McGuinness said.\n\nThe attack ads in the race have been heated against the candidates as PACs throw their weight into the race to replace retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and the three vie for a possible endorsement from President Donald Trump.\n\nThere is a fourth Republican candidate in the primary race, Michael Faris, though he was in a deficit with negative $15,902 cash on hand at the close of the third quarter.\n\nMASSIE BRINGS IN RECORD-BREAKING FUNDRAISING HAUL AFTER BUCKING TRUMP\n\nOf the five blue candidates registered with the FEC for the Democratic primary, only one has filed her third quarter report as of Thursday, according to the FEC website. State Rep. Pamela Stevenson reported raising $41,621 and having $23,863 in cash on hand.\n\nThe primary elections in Kentucky are set for May 19, 2026, and the general election will be held on Nov. 3, 2026.","summary":"Former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron is consistently leading in GOP primary polling for the state’s 2026 Senate election despite raising far less than his other Republican opponents.

The candidate reportedly made posts insulting law enforcement in response to reports of police activity and claimed rural white Americans were racist while tying it to President Donald Trump.\n\nPlatner distanced himself from the posts in a Tuesday interview with CNN, saying they emerged from a period when he was angry and disillusioned. “That was very much me f**king around the internet,” Platner told CNN. “I don’t want people to see me for who I was in my worst Internet comment – or even frankly who I was in my best Internet comment … I don’t think any of that is indicative of who I am today, really.”\n\n My name is Graham Platner and I’m running for US Senate to defeat Susan Collins and topple the oligarchy that’s destroying our country.

Cops are bastards.” Platner replied, “All of them, in fact.”\n\nPlatner often commented on police violence, allegedly calling it “a problem that extends deep into the profession as a whole” and dismissing claims of accidental shootings in cases like the killing of Daunte Wright. “F**k these cops,” he wrote.\n\nPlatner addressed the anti-cop posts. “I can honestly say that this is me just being an a**hole on the Internet,” he said. “I have an immense amount of friends who are police officers. They’re not all bastards because they’re literally buddies of mine.” (RELATED: Maine Mamdani: So-Called ‘Grassroots’ Oyster Farmer Has Deep Connections To Far-Left)\n\nIn a 2020 post that has since been deleted, Platner reportedly replied to a thread called “White people aren’t as racist or stupid as Trump thinks” by saying, “Living in white rural America, I’m afraid to tell you they actually are.”\n\nThe candidate told CNN he didn’t recall that particular discussion, though he suggested it was a reflection of a debate he had online at that time.\n\nWhen someone posted the question “‘When you are older, you’ll be more conservative.’ — How many on this subreddit are older,” Platner wrote, “I got older and became a communist,” according to a screenshot. The comment was made on the far-left subreddit r/Antiwork in 2021, CNN reported.\n\nPlatner, a Maine oyster farmer who entered the race in August, has been presented as a “grassroots” challenger to Republican Senator Susan Collins, aiming to connect with the state’s Trump supporters through a campaign focused on improving conditions for Maine’s working-class residents. The candidate said he deleted the posts because he desired to rid himself of any association with a darker period of his life.\n\n Chuck Schumer should be focused on fighting Donald Trump and protecting healthcare for millions of Americans, not meddling in a Maine primary.

Though he didn’t use his name on Reddit, he shared details about his age, job, Maine residence and military service.\n\nIn the interview with CNN he went to assure voters stating that “I’m not a communist. I’m not a socialist. I own a small business. I’m a Marine Corps veteran.”\n\nPlatner previously served as a former State Department employee and spent time as a student at George Washington University. Platner has kept a relatively low profile online, though his past posts show him frequently retweeting Independent Vermont Sen.

Leaders in other Democratic-leaning states, such as Maryland, New York and Illinois, have said they’re considering their own mid-decade redistricting plans.\n\nLast month, Republican-led Missouri adopted revised districts aimed at helping the GOP win another seat. North Carolina Republican legislative leaders also have announced plans to vote next week on redrawing the state’s House district map.\n\nRedistricting remains under consideration in several other states, including Indiana and Kansas, where Republican lawmakers are gathering petition signatures from colleagues in an effort to call a special session for congressional redistricting.\n\nThe effort could backfire\n\nSome Republicans remain hesitant, partially because of concerns that mid-decade redistricting could backfire. To make Democratic-leaning districts more favorable to Republicans, map drawers would have to shift some Democratic areas into districts currently held by Republicans, making them more vulnerable. \n\nIn South Carolina, Republican leaders worry that redrawing its seven U.S. House districts could be dangerous in a state where the GOP hovers at roughly 55% in competitive elections. Republicans hold all seven seats but lost one for a term in 2018.\n\nKansas had already attempted to make the state’s four districts an all-GOP congressional delegation when it redrew the lines in 2022 to weaken the Democratic stronghold on the Kansas City-area. But Democratic incumbent Rep. Sharice Davids still won easily in 2022 and 2024.\n\nTrump’s push to redraw the maps comes as his administration’s policies face skepticism among many voters, according to polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nMoon Duchin, a computer and data science professor at the University of Chicago and redistricting expert, said creating reliably partisan congressional maps in a large state like Texas is easier because the state has 38 districts, offering plenty of options to tinker.\n\nIt’s tougher in states like Nebraska or Kansas, she said.\n\n“You have fewer lines; you’re not going to be able to put them as far out of reach without creating opportunities elsewhere,” Duchin said. “And so, yes, you have to do it really carefully because it can backfire.”\n\nEven in Texas, Republicans saw the effects of dummymandering after they aggressively redrew political lines in the 2010s that helped pad the GOP’s House majority. That lasted until 2018, when a backlash against Trump in his first term led Democrats to flip two seats that Republicans had thought safe.\n\n“That’s the thing about gerrymandering — people are still going to vote, and you have to make guesses about future voting behavior,” Duchin said.\n\nNebraska has other challenges\n\nAfter initial reluctance, Republicans in states including Texas and Missouri came around to support redistricting. \n\nThat could happen in Nebraska, too, but some key Republican lawmakers remain opposed.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Merv Riepe said he’s not inclined to support such a measure, leaving Republicans with too few votes to overcome a filibuster.\n\nThat’s in line with Republicans’ failure last year to pass a bill that would have made Nebraska the 49th state to award its Electoral College votes on a winner-take-all basis. \n\nCurrently, only Nebraska and Maine allow presidential electoral votes to be split by congressional district. Nebraska’s 2nd District’s vote has gone to Democrats three times in the last two decades — to Barack Obama in 2008, Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nAssociated Press writers David A.

I directed Trump in Celebrity. He was a pleasure to work with and a very good actor. He was very polite, hit his mark, did everything correctly and had a real flair for show business. \n\n\"I could direct him now. If he would let me direct him now that he's president, I think I could do wonders.\"\n\nA source close to Allen said: \"Woody thought he was making an offhand remark about filmmaking, but it landed like a bomb in the industry. \n\n\"Hollywood's liberal crowd didn’t find it amusing – they see Trump as toxic, and for Woody to praise him publicly was seen as crossing a line.\"The insider added: \"He's already had a hard time getting backing for his projects, and this just made things worse. People who once championed him are distancing themselves fast.\"\n\nAllen's last movie, Coup de Chance, a French-language romantic thriller released in 2023, was financed and filmed entirely in Europe after U.S. studios reportedly refused to collaborate with him. \n\nInsiders say the director had been hoping to make a small-scale American production next year but now faces even steeper odds of securing funding.\n\n\"He's been effectively blacklisted for years, but this may have sealed it,\" said a source at a major streaming service.\n\n\"His comments about Trump sent the message that he's out of step with Hollywood’s values.

Very, you know, as I say, I would like to direct him now as president and let me make the decisions. But that's not gonna happen.\"\n\nDespite those clarifications, his remarks have been widely criticized by left-leaning fans and fellow filmmakers who accused him of \"romanticizing\" a divisive political figure. \n\nOne movie producer said: \"He's always had a provocative streak, but this hit differently. For a lot of people in Hollywood, praising Trump – even professionally – is just unacceptable.\n\n\"Woody's never cared much for public approval, but the reaction's been brutal.\"Allen's Backlash Over The YearsThe backlash comes amid years of controversy surrounding Allen's personal life and ongoing debates about his legacy. \n\nHe has long denied sexual abuse allegations made by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, maintaining that there is \"no merit\" to the claims.\n\nAllen has previously said he is \"on the fence\" about making another movie, admitting: \"I don't want to have to go out to raise money.

While giving thanks for her time at the network, Milne did not offer a reason for her exit. Sources added that Weiss was not part of the editorial meeting.\n\nVariety was the first to report on Milne’s departure. A CBS News spokesperson confirmed to The Independent that Milne was leaving the network and made the announcement during the morning meeting.\n\nMilne, whose father worked as an editor in CBS News’ London Bureau for three decades, also sent out a staff-wide email Thursday that revealed she was leaving. Throughout the letter, she urged her colleagues to “keep asking those tough questions,” while adding that it was a “privilege” to work for the same news organization that her father called home.\n\n“Some of you know that my dad worked for CBS News for decades. He was an editor, and like all editors he toiled away in small dark rooms fixing mistakes and making our work better,” she wrote.\n\n“He gave me a curiosity about the world and a belief in the importance of what you all do. When he was home, I learned a lot at the kitchen table,” Milne continued. “He never got to know that I came back to work at CBS. I think he would have been proud (and maybe a bit surprised!).”\n\nCalling it a “privilege to work alongside all of you and hopefully sometimes help make your work a little better,” she stated that he was filled with “awe and pride” with the amount of attention and care the newsroom had taken in its reporting.\n\n“We live in complicated times. For our company, for our industry and for our country. And it’s times like this that what we do matters most,” Milne declared. “I believe our role as journalists is to hold the powerful to account. We are here to question and challenge our political leaders on behalf of our audiences, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative.”\n\nIn conclusion, Milne encouraged CBS News journalists to “keep asking those tough questions, challenge those in authority and keep informing the audience.” At the same time, she said she had confidence they will “continue to do it in the fair, balanced and unbiased way that this organization always has and is the bedrock of good journalism.”\n\nPrior to joining CBS News in 2019, Milne was the head of live TV at Bloomberg and a senior editor at ProPublica. She also spent a significant portion of her career at the BBC. Upon arriving at CBS, she became the managing editor of CBS This Morning before taking on additional responsibilities with the network the following year. \n\nThe Tiffany Network has been rocked by turmoil over the past year, particularly after Donald Trump sued CBS News last October over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. \n\nThat defamation lawsuit, which Trump claimed amounted to “election interference,” ended up sparking the resignations of several newsroom leaders as the former Paramount leadership negotiated a settlement with the president despite CBS News’ lawyers calling the complaint “without merit.” \n\nWeeks before Paramount closed on its merger with Skydance, which needed the Trump administration’s approval, the company announced it had paid Trump $16 million to settle the lawsuit. That settlement, as well as other concessions Ellison made to the Federal Communications Commission and the administration prior to Skydance’s merger with Paramount, is currently being investigated by Democratic lawmakers for potential anti-bribery violations.\n\nEllison, who said upon the merger’s closure that he didn’t want to “politicize” the newsroom, has faced scrutiny over his decision impacting CBS News in recent weeks, prompting some news staffers to fume that he “lied” to them.\n\nAdditionally, the arrival of Weiss – who labels herself as a “radical centrist” and “Zionist fanatic” – as the top editor, along with Paramount purchasing her anti-woke and “heterodox” digital outlet The Free Press for $150 million, has yet to be fully embraced by the newsroom.\n\nEven before last week’s announcement that she’d been brought on as editor-in-chief, the prospect of her taking over the newsroom prompted employees to start “literally freaking out” amid the wholesale changes Ellison had been implementing, which many perceived as pushing CBS News towards the right in an attempt to appease Trump.\n\nWhile her first week on the job has been marked by staffers literally rolling their eyes at her Sorkinesque call to journalistic arms and confusion over her Elon Musk-style memo to the newsroom, much of the anxiety among staff centers on the anticipation of crippling layoffs.\n\nFollowing the $8 billion merger’s closure, Ellison has made it clear that he is seeking to slash $2 billion of costs from Paramount Skydance, which would include the loss of thousands of jobs across the company. CBS News is therefore expecting a 10 percent reduction in its staff over the coming weeks.","summary":"During an editorial call Thursday morning, Claudia Milne announced she was leaving as the head of standards at CBS News.

Katy Neubauer told Fox News host Harris Faulkner her 8-year-old daughter was handed the offensive bracelet by a volunteer at the booth run by the Winnebago County Democratic Party. (RELATED: ‘Beyond Disqualifying’: Glenn Youngkin Says Democrat AG Candidate’s Texts Are ‘Where The Violent Left Is’)\n\n“We were down at the farmer’s market having a conversation, my sister-in-law next to their booth and they had free children’s books out and bubbles blowing in the wind and the kids were having a great time and we didn’t think much of it and continued our conversation,” Neubauer said. “And out of the corner of my eye I see the man leaning over and giving one of our children a bracelet and I kinda waited for it.”\n\n“I thought oh, this will be fun, you know, whatever. But the child runs over, hands it to us and we both look down and my sister-in-law says I don’t really know what it says and I said it says, ‘Is he dead yet?’ and we both kind of look at each other in shock and I walk back over to the table and hand it back to him and I had said we don’t wear hate speech here,” Neubauer continued. “And I had to walk away because I was seething.”\n\nA Rutgers survey showing 56% of “left-of-center” respondents saying that assassinating Trump would be at least partially justifiable was released in April. Neubauer said that after a while, she returned to confront the people at the booth.\n\n“I went and continued and bought a few more items and then I decided to confront them a second time. So, at that point I started going through the bracelets and found others that contained not-so-nice language, including 8647, which I’m sure you’ve heard that one before,” Neubauer said, with Faulkner responding, “Yeah.”\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey posted, then deleted, a photo of seashells on a beach that had the “8647” meme, which has connotations of wishing for Trump to be killed.\n\n“I said are any of these appropriate for children? He said no, I suppose they’re not. And I said okay, then why are you handing them to my 8-year-old child?” Neubauer continued. “I read off a couple others to them and he picked up the basket and said here, I will remove them then. I said okay, that would be a good start. So that’s how that came about.” (RELATED: ‘That’s Assassination Prep Language!’: Journalist Shuts Down Dem Rep On CNN Over Rhetoric)\n\nThe manager of the Oshkosh Farmers Market, Michelle Schmid-Schultz, told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that the Winnebago County Democratic Party’s booth at the market had been banned for the rest of the 2025 season, and that its fate in future years would be decided at a November meeting. Faulkner asked Neubauer what brought about the market’s decision to kick the Democrats out.\n\n“I called the farmers market manager as I was walking home,” Neubauer said. “We live very close to downtown, our kids actually have a farmer’s market booth every other week and we’re down there a lot and we know the manager and she was very kind and she said you aren’t the first person to call and complain about their booth today.

The project by AEP Transmission, a subsidiary of Ohio-based American Electric Power, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.\n\nAEP primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.\n\nThursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.\n\nThe move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said. \n\nThe cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.\n\nThe loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.\n\nThe project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans \"will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. \n\n“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity \"will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.” \n\nThe upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.\n\nMore than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.\n\nThe projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.\n\nThe loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,\" he added.\n\nWright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.

It shows an editorial shift in how CBS will operate,” the person said, speculating that “this is Bari’s first scalp.”\n\n“We live in complicated times. For our company, for our industry and for our country. And it’s times like this that what we do matters most,” Milne said Thursday in a farewell note to colleagues, which was first reported by Variety. “I believe our role as journalists is to hold the powerful to account.”\n\nMilne, who oversaw her unit since 2021, played a pivotal role in a host of eyebrow-raising decisions. Those ranged from coverage of the transgender Nashville, Tenn., shooter and spiking an Elon Musk interview to the network’s recent reporting on the Israel-Hamas conflict, among other issues.\n\nCBS declined to comment.\n\nAs previously reported by The Post, in 2023, Milne and then-news division president Ingrid Ciprian-Matthews banned staffers from using the word “transgender” when reporting on the Nashville shooter.\n\nThe decision sparked outrage at the network because police working the case had identified the killer, Audrey Hale, as a transgender woman. Sources said Ciprian-Matthews and Milne spent 15 minutes telling staffers not to report Hale’s identity because it may not be relevant to the shooter’s motive.\n\n“This is absurd because the police identified Hale as transgender,” a CBS insider said at the time “If the cops didn’t address it, maybe you could avoid it, but withholding information is not journalism.” \n\nMilne was also one of the executives who blocked former CBS News correspondent Catherine Herridge from interviewing Musk in 2023, The Post has learned. Herridge declined to comment.\n\nHerridge said on X that she’d had the rare opportunity to interview Musk after his high-profile purchase of the social media platform. He was in the news in late 2022 for his release of the “Twitter Files” to a handful of tech and media journalists.\n\nBut the interview opportunity landed with a thud, Herridge recounted on X, because Musk wanted to do it live. CBS execs said they would rather pass on the session than hold it live because they were worried about what Musk was going to say, according to the former investigative reporter.\n\n“I’m thinking, ‘Isn’t that the point of journalism?’ You don’t know what the person’s going to say,” an exasperated Herridge said.\n\nAnother surprising moment in which Milne played a part was last year’s criticism of “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil after he grilled author Ta-Nehisi Coates over his one-sided polemic against Israel, which the writer compared to an “apartheid” state.\n\nThen-news division President Wendy McMahon and her number two Adrienne Roark said Dokoupil’s interview did not meet the “editorial standards” of the network during a staff meeting last year, citing a lack of neutrality and objectivity.\n\nShari Redstone, then the owner of CBS, ripped top brass and said Dokoupil “did a great job.” Redstone has also been vocal about the slanted coverage at “60 Minutes” over its reporting on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nMilne’s exit comes as new owner David Ellison, whose Skydance merged with CBS-parent Paramount in August, is looking to assuage the Federal Communications Commission’s concerns about liberal bias after the network settled a lawsuit with President Trump over “60 Minutes'” Kamala Harris sitdown.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ellison hired Weiss, acquired her right-of-center news site, The Free Press, and installed former Trump adviser Keneth Weinstein as an ombudsman.\n\nWhile those moves undermined the authority of the standards unit, Milne had already been losing her grip over the network.\n\nIn 2025, Susan Zirinsky, a veteran CBS exec, was tapped to lead the standards department on an interim basis amid concerns of bias. Al Ortiz, a former CBS News standards exec, was later brought on to oversee “60 Minutes” stories.","summary":"\"She was part of the woke mob at CBS News.

Republicans hold a narrow 219-213 majority, meaning a net loss of just six seats would cost them control of the chamber. If the Democrats gain the House, they will be able to control the passage of key legislation and act as a roadblock to the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at a news conference at Belvedere Middle School, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025, in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nProposition 50 would authorize California to adopt a new congressional map created under Assembly Bill 604 (AB 604), replacing the current boundaries drawn by the state’s independent Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2021. If approved by voters, the new map would be used for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections, after which the commission would resume its role and draw fresh districts in 2031 following the 2030 Census.\n\nUnder the existing map, Republicans dominate much of inland California while Democrats control the coast and major cities. The proposed map, however, shifts several inland and southern districts toward Democrats, consolidating Republican voters into fewer, larger districts.\n\nAccording to the new boundaries, Districts 3 and 5 — previously a lean Republican and a solidly Republican seat — would be combined into a single strongly Republican district. Meanwhile, several formerly red districts in the Central Valley, Inland Empire, and Orange County would become more competitive or tilt Democratic. Northern California also sees a major change, with large Republican-leaning areas redrawn to include more Democratic territory, further reshaping the state’s political balance.\n\nThe plan — passed by the State Assembly (57–20) and State Senate (30–8) along party lines in August — is designed to give Democrats a stronger advantage in several key congressional races. According to political analysts Kyle Kondik and J. Miles Coleman, the new boundaries could help Democrats gain up to five additional seats, targeting Republican Representatives Doug LaMalfa (CA-1), Kevin Kiley (CA-3), and Ken Calvert (CA-41), with two others — David Valadao (CA-22) and Darrell Issa (CA-48) — seen as toss-ups.\n\nMaps showing California’s 2024 presidential election results by existing congressional districts (L) and California’s 2024 presidential election results by proposed congressional districts (California State Assembly, Statewide Database (SWDB), and Madera County via Ballotpedia)\n\nDemocrats are optimistic that voters will approve the measure, given California’s strong left-leaning record — it backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 20 points last November. \n\nAccording to September polling by Emerson College, 51 percent of people said they would support the ballot measure while 34 percent said they were against it. An additional 15 percent were undecided.\n\nNewsom has defended Proposition 50 as a direct response to recent redistricting moves by Republican-led states. “They’re not screwing around. We cannot afford to screw around either,” Newsom said. “We have got to fight fire with fire.”\n\nProposition 50 also includes symbolic language urging Congress to support independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions nationwide, framing the proposal as part of a broader call for “fair and independent” map-drawing across the country.\n\nNewsom’s proposal follows a new redistricting law passed in Texas on August 22, which, according to The Texas Tribune, could give Republicans up to five additional U.S. House seats. The Texas plan was advanced after the Justice Department said four districts were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. GOP lawmakers, including Representative Todd Hunter and Senator Phil King, said the goal was to “improve Republican political performance,” while President Donald Trump endorsed the plan, saying Texas was “entitled to five more seats.”\n\nNewsom argued that California’s ballot measure “will nullify what happens in Texas,” predicting it could allow Democrats to gain five seats — but, he noted, “with the consent of the people,” since voters must approve the measure.\n\nSimilar efforts have emerged in Missouri, where the state legislature passed a new map dividing Kansas City among three congressional districts.

Joni Ernst, a Republican who is stepping down after serving two terms. They include state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek and military veteran Nathan Sage.\n\nOn the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson is running for the nomination against former state Sen. Jim Carlin, among others. Republicans are favored to retain the seat in a state where Republican President Donald Trump won 56% of the vote and defeated Democrat Kamala Harris by 13.2 percentage points in the November 2024 election.\n\nErnst’s surprise announcement last month that she would not seek reelection in 2026 created an unexpected opening. But the move hasn’t made national Democratic campaign leadership any more aggressive, nor made Republicans anxious, about the seat.\n\nDemocrats must gain a net of four seats to seize the Senate majority, a tall task for the party, considering most of the states holding Senate elections next year were carried by Trump in 2024. Democrats have been more focused on recruiting candidates in pickup opportunities such as Maine, where Trump lost last year, and North Carolina, where Trump won narrowly.\n\nRoberts’ arrest by ICE came at a terrible time for Norris, a former chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama who launched her campaign in August emphasizing her service on the Des Moines school board and past as a classroom teacher.\n\nShe was thrust into the spotlight as the public tried to understand how the board could have hired Roberts in 2023, when authorities said the native of Guyana was living and working illegally in the U.S. Days after the arrest, Norris faced criticism for posting a video ahead of a quarterly Sept. 30 fundraising deadline seeking donations.\n\nAP political reporter Thomas Beaumont contributed from Des Moines, Iowa.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/iowa-democrat-jackie-norris-ends-172648256.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P.W2u_6peVwrqDoloz9qcA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/f87900dd0cf93345b34ede5dcd2f7bb3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 17:26:48","author":"Ryan J.

Biden is returning from a day trip to North Carolina.\n\nWhen White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre joined an impromptu Zoom meeting on July 21, 2024, she was shocked to find out that President Joe Biden was withdrawing from his reelection bid. A lifelong member of the Democratic Party, Jean-Pierre had disapproved of how party leaders were treating Biden following his debate performance against President Donald Trump, but she thought that he could withstand the critics. However, when he announced his decision to pull out of the 2024 election, Jean-Pierre—the first Black person and openly queer woman to hold her position—realized that the party that had shaped her worldview and career had shifted. In her new book, Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines, Jean-Pierre dissects the party politics surrounding the campaign and how she decided to step away from the Democratic Party to become an independent. In this exclusive excerpt, Jean-Pierre shares the moment she learned that Biden would not run and the immediate aftermath. \n\nOn that Sunday morning, July 21, I woke up wondering how we’d navigate an unpredictable week because the president, who was at his vacation residence in Rehoboth, Delaware, had COVID. I purposely didn’t turn on any of the Sunday political shows because with all the chatter about whether the president should stay or go, cable and the other networks had become too hard to watch. I checked in with Ben LaBolt, the White House communications director, and some members of my team. Then, at about 1 p.m., I happened to glance at my work phone. There was an invite to an unexpected meeting happening in 45 minutes. The invitation had been sent to the senior advisers, myself, LaBolt, Tom Perez, and Stephen Benjamin, all of whom were usually part of our daily chief of staff meeting at 8:15 a.m. The impromptu gathering left me with mixed feelings. It had to be one of two things—one of the scenarios unimaginable. \n\nAt 1:45, I hopped on Zoom, and again I could see all the folks there were the usual participants in the morning call. But then, gazing at the list of names, I saw that the leadership from the campaign was there as well. There was Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, former White House deputy chief of staff and now chair of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, who I figured would be leading the meeting with Jeff Zients, the White House chief of staff. And there was another name on the screen. President Joe Biden. My mind went into overdrive. \n\nMy heart began to pound. \n\nThe meeting started right on time. And boom, the moment Biden popped on, he delivered the news. \n\n“Hey everyone, it’s Joe,” he said. I don’t remember his exact words, but he told us he’d made the decision not to run for reelection. The party had done so much damage to his campaign, there was no coming back from it. He would finish his term, exit the presidential race, and endorse Harris. A statement would be going out shortly, telling the world his decision. \n\nU.S. President Joe Biden watches as Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks at Prince George’s Community College in Largo, Maryland on August 15, 2024.\n\nI didn’t really hear the rest. I vaguely recall him thanking us all and saying he’d called O’Malley Dillon and the vice president right before joining us. I was numb. My camera was off because on a Sunday afternoon I hadn’t been prepared to appear on a surprise call. But now I noticed the faces of all those gathered to hear this devastating news. Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, and Quentin Fulks, Biden’s principal deputy campaign manager. And I saw many people who, like me, worked for the administration. They looked sad, in shock. While we continued to sit there, the letter announcing Biden’s exit was issued. And of course, in the midst of my daze, my phone began buzzing incessantly. Everybody was texting, asking if it was true. \n\nI never thought Biden would step down. The way the Democratic leadership was coming after him, I believed he would fight back harder. He was the descendant of Irish immigrants and someone who held firm to his convictions. He’d never let them win, I thought. He’d never step down even though the attacks on him were ugly and cruel. He would double down. “I know I have COVID,” he’d say, “but know that though I’m going to be out of the game for a little bit, I’m in this. I’m not going anywhere.” He’d thank the team and encourage us to continue doing what we’re doing. \n\nOn the call, Biden seemed to be totally at peace with his decision, but I was stunned, my feelings a blur. I was angry and sad. I was enraged and heartbroken that this man ...","summary":"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on shocking moment she learned Biden was pulling out of race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/karine-jean-pierre-joe-bidens-press-secretary-on-the-day-he-quit-race-10889764","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PER02_Karine-Jean-Pierre-Book-Excerpt-and-QA_01_2151186261.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 15:30:00","author":"Karine Jean-Pierre","authors":["Karine Jean-Pierre"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":369850012,"title":"Kamala Harris hints at possible 2028 run, says some call her 'most qualified candidate ever'","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris hinted at a possible presidential run in 2028 and claimed that some people said she was \"the most qualified candidate ever to run for president\" during an on-stage interview with journalist Kara Swisher. When asked by Swisher last week whether she would be running for president in 2028, Harris shrugged and responded, \"Maybe. Maybe not,\" which prompted cheers from the crowd. Harris has already bypassed a run for California governor in 2026. The former vice president was then asked what policies she would focus on either implementing, or rolling back, if she were to be elected president. KAMALA HARRIS PLAYS UP COZY RELATIONSHIP WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS WEDGE WITH BIDEN WIDENS \"It's much too early to have that conversation, Kara,\" Harris responded. \"I literally yesterday would not have known that this Department of Justice would have indicted the New York Attorney General, right?\" After taking a quick jab at President Donald Trump's Department of Justice, Harris told Swisher that she believed that the Democratic Party's current responsibility is to deal with the immediate needs of the American people. She added that, during her time with the Biden administration, she could have approached that goal differently. \"I actually, in reflection, one of the things I would have done differently — and I talk about a few things but one of them on this topic — I really do think we should have done the families piece of ‘Build Back Better’ before we did the infrastructure and the CHIPS Act,\" she said. KAMALA HARRIS ADMITS THERE ARE THINGS SHE WOULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY IN 2024, FAILS TO ELABORATE Earlier in the interview, Harris spoke about her experience running against Trump in 2024, which is covered extensively in her new memoir, \"107 Days.\" Harris said she \"couldn't do enough\" in the relatively short time she had on the campaign trail. The former vice president stressed that she wanted voters to not only know her background of who she is as a person, but also her professional qualifications. Harris reeled off her former titles, including serving as a U.S. Senator from California, the state's attorney general, and the district attorney of San Francisco.

Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be imprisoned,” Faris said. “His corrupt henchman — er, ‘immigration czar’ — Tom Homan has distributed threats of arrest on cable news like he’s tossing paper towels to hurricane victims, against everyone from New York Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to California Governor Gavin Newsom.”\n\nMeanwhile, Faris said Trump and his “Cabinet goons can count on the reliably servile U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to do whatever the administration asks.”\n\nFaris said Trump is also using ICE to disproportionately target blue states and Democratic-run cities, with CNN reporting that Trump’s troops deliberately marching up and down Latino-majority streets is “killing business” and shutting down whole sections of Chicago.\n\n“Citizens in blue states feel like they are living under a constant state of military siege, rhetorical harassment and punitive partisan budgetary cuts because that is in fact what is happening. And it is not sustainable for another three years,” said Faris. “The compact between the states is not magical or self-executing or ordained by divine providence to ensure that it can’t be undone by ruthless MAGA tyrants. It has fallen violently apart once before.”\n\nFaris said blue state officials are already mulling a tax strike.\n\n“In 2024, California and New York alone combined to send nearly $1.2 trillion in income and other taxes to the federal government, making up close to a quarter of all revenue. The reliance of many small, rural Republican-leaning states on federal funding is well known,” Faris said. “… By themselves, the states that voted for Kamala Harris — leaving aside the consensus battleground states — represent half of all federal tax revenue.”\n\nThe gamble, said Faris, is that Trump’s own diminished IRS would not be able to summon the resources or personnel to verify and punish citizens participating in a strike, even though Faris said Trump appears more than willing to muster some form of federal force to discourage a protest from taking “root on its own.”\n\nAnother option, said Faris, could be a national general strike with infuriated federal workers walking off their jobs and bringing society “to a screeching halt.”\n\n“If workers in just the Social Security Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs went out at once (they would need to resign, take time out under the Family and Medical Leave Act, or find some other workaround to avoid prohibitions on striking), and if they were joined by, say, public school teachers, the country would be snarled in an almost unimaginably chaotic crisis within 24 hours.”\n\nRead the Nation report at this link.","summary":"Roosevelt University political science professor David Faris warned The Nation that blue states may have to resort to a ‘tax strike’ to stop being the MAGA regime’s ‘second tier’ Americans.\n\n“Since his election, Trump has … treated blue states not as equals … but rather like defeated vassals who must pay tribute to their new emperor in the form of policy capitulations and abrogations of their constitutional rights,” said Faris, adding that Trump’s explicit mandate to make blue states suffer “is the gravest threat to the constitutional union since the Civil War.”\n\n“Last week, Trump escalated this campaign of autocratic intimidation by screaming on his fourth-tier microblogging website that Illinois Governor J.B.

While the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, fought to present a new economic vision focused on costs, for many voters it was too late.”\n\nWith just over a year until the midterm elections, the Guardian reports Trump’s economy isn’t looking much brighter. More than half of Americans said they believed the economy was in a recession, which rates five ticks higher than what Harris was facing in the lead up to the November election.

Martínez Ocasio – is a superstar, one of the top-streaming artists in the world. And because he is Puerto Rican, he’s a U.S. citizen, too.\n\nTo be sure, Bad Bunny checks many boxes that irk conservatives. He endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024. There’s his gender-bending wardrobe. He has slammed the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies. He has declined to tour on the U.S. mainland, fearing that some of his fans could be targeted and deported by ICE. And his explicit lyrics – most of which are in Spanish – would make even the most ardent free speech warrior cringe. \n\nAnd yet, as experts on issues of national identity and U.S. immigration policies, we think Lahren’s and Johnson’s insults get at the heart of why the rapper has created such a firestorm on the right. The spectacle of a Spanish-speaking rapper performing during the most-watched sporting event on American TV is a direct rebuke of the Trump administration’s efforts to paper over the country’s diversity. \n\nThe Puerto Rican colony\n\nBad Bunny was born in 1994 in Puerto Rico, an unincorporated U.S. territory that the country acquired after the 1898 Spanish-American War. \n\nIt is home to 3.2 million U.S. citizens by birth. If it were a state, it would be the 30th largest by population, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. \n\nBut Puerto Rico is not a state; it is a colony from a bygone era of U.S. overseas imperial expansion. Puerto Ricans do not have voting representatives in Congress, and they do not get to help elect the president of the United States. They are also divided over the island’s future. Large pluralities seek either U.S. statehood or an enhanced form of the current commonwealth status, while a smaller minority vie for independence. \n\nBut one thing is clear to all Puerto Ricans: They’re from a nonsovereign land, with a clearly defined Latin American culture – one of the oldest in the Americas. Puerto Rico may belong to the U.S. – and many Puerto Ricans embrace that special relationship – but the island itself does not sound or feel like the U.S.\n\nThe over 5.8 million Puerto Ricans that reside in the 50 states further complicate that picture. While legally they are U.S. citizens, mainstream Americans often don’t see Puerto Ricans that way. In fact, a 2017 poll found that only 54% of Americans knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens. \n\nThe alien-citizen paradox\n\nPuerto Ricans exist in what we describe as the “alien-citizen paradox”: They are U.S. citizens, but only those residing in the mainland enjoy all the rights of citizenship. \n\nA recent congressional report stated that U.S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans “is not equal, permanent, irrevocable citizenship protected by the 14th Amendment … and Congress retains the right to determine the disposition of the territory.” Any U.S. citizen that moves to Puerto Rico no longer possesses the full rights of U.S. citizens of the mainland. \n\nBad Bunny’s selection for the Super Bowl halftime show illustrates this paradox. In addition to criticisms from public figures, there were widespread calls among MAGA influencers to deport the rapper \n\nThis is but one way Puerto Ricans, as well as other Latino citizens, are reminded of their status as “others.” \n\nICE apprehensions of people merely appearing to be an immigrant – a tactic that was recently given the blessing of the Supreme Court – is an example of their alienlike status. \n\nAnd the bulk of the ICE raids have occurred in predominantly Latino communities in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. This has forced many Latino communities to cancel Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations.\n\nBad Bunny’s global reach\n\nThe xenophobic fervor against Bad Bunny has led political leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson to call for a more suitable figure for the Super Bowl, such as country music artist Lee Greenwood. Referring to Bad Bunny, Johnson said “it sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.”\n\nBut the facts counter that claim. The Puerto Rican artist sits atop the global music charts. He has over 80 million monthly Spotify listeners. And he has sold nearly five times more albums than Greenwood.\n\nThat global appeal has impressed the NFL, which hopes to host as many as eight international games next season. Additionally, Latinos represent the league’s fastest-growing fan base, and Mexico is its largest international market, with a reported 39.5 million fans.\n\nThe Bad Bunny Super Bowl saga may actually become an important political moment. Conservatives, in their efforts to highlight Bad Bunny’s “otherness” – despite the United States being the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world – may have unwittingly educated America on the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Ricans. \n\nIn the meantime, Puerto Ricans and the rest of the U.S. Latino community continue to wonder when they’ll be accepted as social equals.\n\nEdiberto Román, Professor of Law, Florida International University and Ernesto Sagás, Professor of Ethnic Studies, Colorado State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Martínez Ocasio – is a superstar, one of the top-streaming artists in the world. And because he is Puerto Rican, he’s a U.S. citizen, too.\n\nTo be sure, Bad Bunny checks many boxes that irk conservatives. He endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024. There’s his gender-bending wardrobe. He has slammed the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies. He has declined to tour on the U.S. mainland, fearing that some of his fans could be targeted and deported by ICE. And his explicit lyrics – most of which are in Spanish – would make even the most ardent free speech warrior cringe. \n\nAnd yet, as experts on issues of national identity and U.S. immigration policies, we think Lahren’s and Johnson’s insults get at the heart of why the rapper has created such a firestorm on the right. The spectacle of a Spanish-speaking rapper performing during the most-watched sporting event on American TV is a direct rebuke of the Trump administration’s efforts to paper over the country’s diversity. \n\nThe Puerto Rican colony\n\nBad Bunny was born in 1994 in Puerto Rico, an unincorporated U.S. territory that the country acquired after the 1898 Spanish-American War. \n\nIt is home to 3.2 million U.S. citizens by birth. If it were a state, it would be the 30th largest by population, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. \n\nBut Puerto Rico is not a state; it is a colony from a bygone era of U.S. overseas imperial expansion. Puerto Ricans do not have voting representatives in Congress, and they do not get to help elect the president of the United States. They are also divided over the island’s future. Large pluralities seek either U.S. statehood or an enhanced form of the current commonwealth status, while a smaller minority vie for independence.\n\nBut one thing is clear to all Puerto Ricans: They’re from a nonsovereign land, with a clearly defined Latin American culture – one of the oldest in the Americas. Puerto Rico may belong to the U.S. – and many Puerto Ricans embrace that special relationship – but the island itself does not sound or feel like the U.S. \n\nThe over 5.8 million Puerto Ricans that reside in the 50 states further complicate that picture. While legally they are U.S. citizens, mainstream Americans often don’t see Puerto Ricans that way. In fact, a 2017 poll found that only 54% of Americans knew that Puerto Ricans were U.S. citizens. \n\nThe alien-citizen paradox\n\nPuerto Ricans exist in what we describe as the “alien-citizen paradox”: They are U.S. citizens, but only those residing in the mainland enjoy all the rights of citizenship. \n\nA recent congressional report stated that U.S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans “is not equal, permanent, irrevocable citizenship protected by the 14th Amendment … and Congress retains the right to determine the disposition of the territory.” Any U.S. citizen that moves to Puerto Rico no longer possesses the full rights of U.S. citizens of the mainland. \n\nBad Bunny’s selection for the Super Bowl halftime show illustrates this paradox. In addition to criticisms from public figures, there were widespread calls among MAGA influencers to deport the rapper \n\nThis is but one way Puerto Ricans, as well as other Latino citizens, are reminded of their status as “others.” \n\nICE apprehensions of people merely appearing to be an immigrant – a tactic that was recently given the blessing of the Supreme Court – is an example of their alienlike status. \n\nAnd the bulk of the ICE raids have occurred in predominantly Latino communities in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. This has forced many Latino communities to cancel Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations.\n\nBad Bunny’s global reach\n\nThe xenophobic fervor against Bad Bunny has led political leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson to call for a more suitable figure for the Super Bowl, such as country music artist Lee Greenwood. Referring to Bad Bunny, Johnson said “it sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.”\n\nBut the facts counter that claim. The Puerto Rican artist sits atop the global music charts. He has over 80 million monthly Spotify listeners. And he has sold nearly five times more albums than Greenwood.\n\nThat global appeal has impressed the NFL, which hopes to host as many as eight international games next season. Additionally, Latinos represent the league’s fastest-growing fan base, and Mexico is its largest international market, with a reported 39.5 million fans.\n\nThe Bad Bunny Super Bowl saga may actually become an important political moment. Conservatives, in their efforts to highlight Bad Bunny’s “otherness” – despite the United States being the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world – may have unwittingly educated America on the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Ricans. \n\nIn the meantime, Puerto Ricans and the rest of the U.S. Latino community continue to wonder when they’ll be accepted as social equals.","summary":"Puerto Ricans like Bad Bunny complicate the administration’s campaign to portray America as an English-speaking, homogenous nation.","url":"https://theconversation.com/the-real-reason-conservatives-are-furious-about-bad-bunnys-forthcoming-super-bowl-performance-267078","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695775/original/file-20251012-56-i1expi.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=545%2C725%2C2167%2C1083&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 12:41:43","author":"Colorado State University,Ediberto Román,Florida International University; Ernesto Sagás,Professor of Ethnic Studies,Professor of Law","authors":["Colorado State University","Ediberto Román","Florida International University; Ernesto Sagás","Professor of Ethnic Studies","Professor of Law"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":369802662,"title":"Kamala Harris drops an f-bomb to describe RFK Jr’s actions as HHS secretary during latest book tour stop","text":"Kamala Harris took a moment from promoting her memoir about her doomed presidential bid at an event in Washington, D.C., Wednesday night to blast Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s record as Health Secretary as “f***ed up.”\n\nIn an onstage discussion with podcaster Kara Swisher at the Warner Theatre, Harris contrasted her own mother’s work as a scientist working to “uplift the human condition” with the Trump administration’s efforts to “deny science”, as she put it.\n\nIn particular, she railed against RFK Jr and the current stance of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under his leadership.\n\n\"When I see what these people are doing right now to end the war on cancer, to deny science and fire scientists … it's personal for me,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris’ book, “107 Days,” was released in September. The title refers to the length of the hyperspeed campaign that the former vice president launched against Trump after Joe Biden dropped out of the race. \n\n“And I can’t laugh at it because, like so many of you, who have known people who suffer because of unknown diseases, or cancers for which there are no cures, or there is the beginning of [a cure], but more work that needs to be done…\n\n“What they are doing to push misinformation and lies at the highest level of government – it’s criminal. And people will die because of what they’re doing. I can’t laugh about that, I’m sorry.”\n\n“It’s f***ed up,” she added, to rapturous applause. \n\nAt one point later in the conversation, Harris told the audience, \"Well, some people have actually said I was the most qualified candidate ever to run for president.”\n\nSwisher jokingly responded: \"I like the ‘some people say,’ very nice, but go ahead.\" \n\n\"I’m just speaking fact,\" Harris replied. \n\nHarris’s book tour has generated a considerable quantity of headlines, including revelations that the grief she felt at losing the election was comparable to the pain of losing her mother.\n\nAlso, that while on the campaign trail, Biden called her before she appeared on a critical televised debate with Trump, asking her if she’d been badmouthing him to Democrat donors.\n\nShe was heckled at another appearance in Chicago, at which the former vice president clapped back at a heckler who’d shouted a comment about her “legacy”. Nonvoters, she responded, had earned a “legacy” of Donald Trump’s return to the presidency by refusing to support her campaign.\n\nDuring the book tour, she has labelled Trump a “tyrant”, and likened him to a “communist dictator,” while calling big industry bosses who have supported him “feckless”.\n\nWhile mounting her White House run, Harris also described Trump as a “fascist” who had become \"increasingly unhinged and unstable\".","summary":"Harris accuses Trump administration of ‘ending war on cancer’ and denying science","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-book-tour-rfk-b2846492.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/16/9/48/Screenshot-2025-10-16-at-10-51-33.png?crop=1084.5,723,x53.8,y0&trim=0,54,0,53&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4DiyL2XS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-16 12:26:46","author":"Harry Cockburn","authors":["Harry Cockburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.067},{"id":369833598,"title":"This Federal Office Was Meant to Ensure America’s Energy Future. Trump Aims to Kill It.","text":"This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nThe Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was supposed to be a launchpad for ambitious projects to help America lead the way on cleaner power and manufacturing. Now it’s been reduced to a shell of itself.\n\nAs the Trump administration slashes spending and fires workers across the federal government, the US Department of Energy has emerged as one of the hardest-hit agencies—and perhaps no other of its divisions has been singled out as deliberately as OCED.\n\nIt’s a dramatic reversal for the four-year-old office. During the Biden administration, Congress endowed it with nearly $27 billion to try to scale up cutting-edge technologies that could curb planet-warming pollution from industrial facilities and power plants. Trump officials have in recent months hollowed out the office, canceling billions in previously issued awards for everything from low-carbon chemical manufacturing to rural energy resiliency, while also dismissing over three-quarters of its employees.\n\nThe situation is best summarized by the budget the White House has requested for OCED for the next fiscal year: $0.\n\nExperts and insiders warn that the tumult within OCED and the DOE more broadly is eroding the private sector’s trust in the federal government and its ability to drive energy innovation.\n\n“The administration has really created a chilling effect on the willingness of future early-stage technology developers to work with the Department of Energy,” said Advait Arun, a senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, a nonprofit think tank.\n\nUltimately, that will stifle investment not only in the clean energy sectors the Trump administration dislikes but in those it has championed as well, such as advanced nuclear and geothermal. Former OCED staffers and contractors, who were granted anonymity to speak freely, told Canary Media that the disruption is a major setback for America’s efforts to launch the world’s next generation of energy technologies and industries.\n\n“We are eliminating ourselves as a leader in the clean energy space, especially for the industrial complex,” one person said. ​“What I’m seeing is China is about to slip right into that position. Just logically and economically, I don’t understand the steps that are being taken.”\n\nCongress created OCED in December 2021 to help deploy first-of-a-kind projects at commercial scale. The idea was for the government to absorb some of the risks and provide early capital to usher companies across the valley of death that lurks between promising research pilots and real-world operations that can move the needle on decarbonization.\n\nThe 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law provided OCED with about $21 billion over five years to scale up emerging technologies like small modular reactors and long-duration energy storage, and to advance ambitious ​“hubs” for producing hydrogen fuel and capturing carbon dioxide from the sky and smokestacks. In 2022, Congress gave OCED an additional $5.8 billion through the Inflation Reduction Act to help decarbonize US manufacturing of materials like steel, cement, and chemicals.\n\n“A lot of this stuff is a chicken-and-egg situation, where the private sector doesn’t want to come in [and invest] yet because it’s not proven,” said Zahava Urecki, a senior policy analyst with the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Energy Program.\n\n“But we need the technology to go through this [demonstration] process in order to make sure it becomes proven, so that eventually we can have this in society,” she added. ​“And that’s where the federal government plays a key role.”\n\nOver the course of three years, the office selected 116 projects in 42 states to receive over $25 billion in federal funding. For most awards, participating companies were required to cover at least 50 percent of total costs themselves—meaning the office expected its portfolio to spur nearly $65 billion in private investment, in addition to creating potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nAmong the biggest winners were seven regional hydrogen hubs and two major direct air capture initiatives that would remove CO2 directly from the sky. The choices were not always broadly celebrated, and critics raised concerns that the hydrogen and carbon-capture initiatives in particular would do more harm than good for the climate by propping up unproven, energy-intensive projects involving fossil-fuel companies.\n\nBut other OCED picks garnered more public applause — and supported industries that President Donald Trump had flagged as priorities. In 2024, the office selected Cleveland-Cliffs for an award of up to $500 million to begin lower-carbon steel production in Middletown, Ohio, the hometown of Vice President JD Vance. Another manufacturer, Century Aluminum, got up to $500 million to help it build the nation’s first new aluminum smelter in decades, which would be powered by carbon-free electricity.\n\nFormer OCED staffers said they attempted to brief the incoming Trump administration on the office’s portfolio and to explain how they could support the president’s stated goals of boosting ​“American energy dominance” and ​“advancing innovation.” \n\nHowever, from the time Trump took office on January 20, ​“It became pretty clear that it didn’t really matter,” a former employee said.\n\nIt was quickly evident that Trump would, in fact, be adopting the right-wing policy platform Project 2025 after trying to distance himself from it on the campaign trail. The blueprint—which outlines ways to erase federal spending—called for eliminating ​“all DOE energy demonstration projects, including those in OCED,” in order to avoid ​“distorting the market and undermining energy reliability.”\n\nFor one staffer, ​“it all started crumbling” on Day 1, when the White House issued an executive order to halt federal work on ​“diversity, equity, and inclusion”—a measure that affected OCED’s grant recipients. Under former President Joe Biden, the office required participants to create community benefit plans to ensure the billions in taxpayer dollars went to projects that included neighbors in the planning process and supported local economies. Under Trump, the strategy became a liability.\n\nA blitz of federal funding freezes and layoffs—and court reversals and injunctions—then ensued, creating chaos across federal agencies and for all the outside companies that hold or held government contracts. In late January, the White House extended federal workers a ​“deferred resignation offer” that would allow people to resign from their jobs and go on leave with pay through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.\n\nFew OCED staffers initially took the offer. But after several months of chaos, about 77 percent of workers at OCED signed the deal when the White House extended it again in April. Insiders say that figure is likely even higher now. Across the DOE, some 3,200 employees within the agency’s roughly 17,000-person workforce opted to leave.\n\n“That’s when folks at OCED actually started to realize it was going to be personnel changes that would first impact the projects, and not the program cuts,” according to a former employee.\n\nOn May 15, about a month after the staff exodus, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the DOE would begin scrutinizing federal grants to ​“identify waste of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe agency started requesting additional information for 179 awards totaling over $15 billion, with a focus on large-scale commercial projects. Wright claimed that these awards were ​“rushed out the door, particularly in the final days of the Biden administration,” and required further review to ensure that individual projects were ​“financially sound and economically viable.”\n\nLess than 3 percent of the more than $25 billion in OCED’s awards portfolio had actually been paid to projects as of March 31, in part because larger grants were meant to be doled out in tranches over a long development timeline, according to EFI Foundation, a nonpartisan organization led by Ernest Moniz, who served as energy secretary during the Obama administration.\n\nProject developers interviewed by EFI claimed that, contrary to Wright’s statement, OCED’s ​“due diligence was more rigorous than what private-sector investors would conduct” and that, rather than undergo the office’s laborious process, ​“faster decisions would have better aligned with developer timelines,” the foundation said in a June report.\n\nWright didn’t wait long to begin nixing projects. In late May, he announced the termination of 24 awards issued by OCED totaling over $3.7 billion, including funding for carbon capture and sequestration and projects within the office’s Industrial Demonstrations Program that aimed to reduce emissions from iron, cement, glass, and chemicals production.\n\n“These clean energy projects were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and represent the will of Congress,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, said in a recent statement to Canary Media. Heinrich and other congressional Democrats sent a letter to Wright on September 9 accusing the DOE of undertaking a ​“haphazard, disorganized, and politically driven” cancellation process.\n\nMore funding cuts arrived earlier this month, when the DOE said it was slashing 321 grants for projects almost entirely in states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. A spreadsheet of the cuts lists 11 newly affected OCED projects totaling nearly $2.5 billion, including for two major hydrogen projects planned in the Pacific Northwest and California. The October list also repeats five OCED-backed initiatives that first appeared in the May announcement.\n\nProject developers have said they’re appealing the award terminations and are in continued talks with the DOE. Still, it’s unclear how much capacity the office has anymore to helm those discussions.\n\nWright said in an October 3 interview that more cancellations would follow, and early last week rumors swirled about a second spreadsheet that appeared to outline deeper cuts for carbon-removal projects, hydrogen hubs, and other OCED projects. The nature of the list remains unclear, but if it proves to be a signal of cuts to come, it would cancel another $6.1 billion in awards from OCED.\n\nThe project areas that have yet to be cut—or to appear on any potential hit lists—include advanced nuclear energy and critical minerals. Additionally, the energy agency said it has started tapping OCED’s authority to make some new grants for Trump’s favorite energy source: coal-fired power plants. Should the office shutter, these awards would likely be managed by other divisions within the DOE.\n\nAlex Kizer, a senior policy advisor at EFI, noted that gutting OCED won’t end America’s efforts to decarbonize heavy industries.\n\nIn the case of cement and steel, demand for low-carbon materials is growing within US and global markets as tech giants look to build less carbon-intensive data centers, and as state governments and European and Chinese regulators work to rein in industrial pollution. Still, losing grants—and the DOE’s seal of approval—will undoubtedly make it harder and more expensive for companies to raise private capital for commercial-scale projects. Stifling the DOE’s role as a gatherer and publisher of real-world lessons could further slow progress, Kizer said.\n\n“The potential for breakthrough across different energy sectors is so significant,” he said of OCED’s work, noting that ​“a relatively small investment from taxpayers could have an enormous benefit to taxpayers over time,” in terms of delivering cleaner, more reliable energy. ​“Who says no to that?”","summary":"This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the&#160;Climate Desk&#160;collaboration.

Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), the Democratic nominee, with a 4.6-point lead over Ciattarelli. Just last month, she held a lead of 8.5 points. Strategists note that his endorsement and mobilization put the governor’s mansion firmly in play.\n\n“They wouldn’t be loading in at the last minute here if they didn’t think that they could pull it off,” New Jersey strategist and political consultant Henry de Koninck told the Washington Examiner. “Whether or not this additional push by Trump, as far as [whether] public support and fundraising will help put Ciattarelli over the edge, that’s another question.”\n\nA Ciattarelli win would be a major victory for the Trump administration. Although Trump didn’t win the Garden State in 2024, he ran former Vice President Kamala Harris close, the closest a Republican came to winning it since 1992. The New Jersey gubernatorial race is one of two happening in 2025 that will serve as a temperature check on the president’s agenda.\n\nThat agenda temperature check, however, could be Ciattarelli’s downfall. Trump and Republicans have made significant inroads in New Jersey since the president’s 2016 run, but Trump ultimately lost the state to Harris by 5 points in the 2024 election. \n\nSherrill has spent much of her campaign tying Ciattarelli to Trump to grow her standings in the polls. De Koninck said the more Sherrill can make the gubernatorial race a referendum on Trump, the better her chances of winning.\n\nTrump is making that easy for Sherrill; his endorsement of Ciattarelli and the Republican nominee’s decision to give the president a grade “A” during last week’s debate sets up easy blocks for Sherrill to knock over. \n\n“Trump endorsed Jack Ciattarelli calling him ‘100% MAGA’ and Jack returned the favor by giving his cost-raising presidency an ‘A’ rating,” a Sherrill campaign spokesperson said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “While Jack will always go to bat for Trump, Mikie will stand up for New Jersey.”\n\nDe Koninck noted that, given the president’s level of support, there’s not much Ciattarelli can do to distance himself from Trump at this point. \n\n“Ciattarelli is kind of leaning into it here, down the line, not that he has a choice,” de Koninck said. “The president is going to do what he’s going to do, but if it’s a referendum on Trump, and Trump is not himself personally on the ballot, that is a recipe for success for Democrats.” \n\nCiattarelli has mostly aligned himself with Trump, but he deflected during the debate on whether he was part of the Make America Great Again movement by saying he was part of the “New Jersey movement,” with the knowledge that to win, he’ll need to draw out voters in Trump-friendly areas throughout the state.\n\nThe New Jersey race will test whether Trump and his allies can rally enough support to bring GOP voters out in an off-year election cycle. Historically, Democrats have done a better job of getting their voting base to the polls in a non-presidential election year than Republicans. \n\n“Since Trump has come onto the national scene,” de Koninck said, “Democrats have done well when Trump is in office but not personally on the ballot himself.… That’s a trend that’s 10 years old right now.” \n\nSo, New Jersey Republicans will have to rely on the money from Trump allies and phone calls from the president himself to motivate voters to support a ballot that does not have Trump’s name on the top of the ticket.\n\nAnother bellwether race is that of Virginia, where former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears are engaged in a competitive gubernatorial race. \n\nBut while Trump endorsed Ciattarelli in New Jersey, he has not done the same for Earle-Sears, raising speculation that the president may see the writing on the wall: She is a much weaker candidate, and he’ll have more luck of a victory in the Garden State.\n\n“Trump is more hesitant to endorse her, I think, because she is a black woman and she is projected to lose,” Kaivan Shroff, a 2024 delegate for Harris, told the Washington Examiner. “So I don’t think he’s willing to take the swing for her than he might for some other figures. And I just think there’s a long pattern of Trump not being a fan of black women. And a good example is the indictment of [New York Attorney General Letitia James].”\n\nThe president notably did not address or endorse Earle-Sears even as he spoke at the Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia earlier this month. Earle-Sears has consistently trailed Spanberger in polls and fundraising.\n\nTrump has weighed in on the Virginia race — just not for Earle-Sears. He endorsed state Attorney General Jason Miyares (R-VA), who is seeking reelection against embattled Democrat Jay Jones. Jones sparked bipartisan ire after it was revealed that he sent violent text messages suggesting former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert should receive “two bullets to the head.”\n\n“What he’s hoping is, by endorsing Miyares, you can focus on this Jay Jones [scandal], and maybe it may change dynamics at the top of the ticket,” said a Republican official who requested anonymity to speak freely. “We don’t know, but we do know that if this story doesn’t get coverage, nothing is going to change in Virginia, and Democrats are probably going to capture all three statewide offices.”\n\nA second Republican operative, also granted anonymity to speak freely, spoke on the factors influencing Trump’s non-endorsement in the Virginia gubernatorial race. They said New Jersey is trending “much faster” toward the GOP than Virginia, which Republicans consider a blue state, “even though we did better there last year than we expected.”\n\nThe operative added that the recent federal layoffs and firings, as well as the government shutdown, are likely to have more of a negative effect on the GOP’s performance in Virginia. Though the shutdown seeped into New Jersey with the pause in funding for the Hudson Tunnel project, the consequences of a shutdown will be harder to overcome in a state like Virginia that borders Washington, D.C., versus a northern state like New Jersey.\n\nMost importantly, the operative said, a candidate’s strength matters when it comes to Trump’s endorsements. \n\n“I would say that going into this race, there was a perception that Mikie Sherrill was not a good candidate and that Spanberger was a slightly better candidate,” the operative said. “And I think that that has largely borne out. I think clearly, Spanberger has not found a way to handle the Jay Jones messaging.”\n\nThe operative was alluding to the sole debate between the two Virginia candidates in which Earle-Sears hammered Spanberger over not calling on Jones to exit the attorney general race.\n\n“I’m wondering why my opponent won’t say beyond its abhorrent and disgusting … that he must leave the race because Jay Jones advocated the murder, Abigail, the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children, who were 2 and 5 years old,” Earle-Sears said during the Virginia debate last week.\n\nSpanberger never responded to Earle-Sears’ taunts and dodged when moderators pressed her about whether Jones should drop out.\n\nCIATTARELLI PLANS TO FILE DEFAMATION LAWSUIT AGAINST SHERRILL IN NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL RACE\n\n“We are all running our individual races. I believe my opponent has said that about her lieutenant governor nominee,” Spanberger said. “And it is up to every person to make their own decision. I am running my race to serve Virginia, and that is what I intend to do.”\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Trump and Ciattarelli’s campaign for comment.","summary":"President Donald Trump and his allies are preparing to boost Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the final days of his campaign to become the next governor of New Jersey, a sign the race could get even more competitive with less than three weeks until the election.

But the big-money donors like the Durst Organization, Bruce Ratner, Netflix and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman will continue to back Cuomo, and he will pick up some would-be Adams voters. (Cuomo also seems Donald Trump’s favorite, and the developers know he will support their desire to build more immense residential and office buildings in the city.)\n\nMeanwhile, Mamdani has done well with first-time and young voters, drawing thousands of them to the polls in the June primary. The young people mobilized around the issues they care about most: housing, education, mental health and economic justice. There is a wide split between lifelong New Yorkers and new transplants in support of Mamdani, with longtime and older residents exhibiting less support.\n\nMamdani also increased turnout among South Asian primary voters compared to the 2021 primary. There are about 500,000 South Asians living in New York City, and they typically make up a smaller share of the electorate compared to other ethnic groups, partly because many are not citizens. The group is growing rapidly, though, including a surging Bangladeshi population, and many of those who are citizens are registering for the first time. In addition, Mamdani is working to make inroads with working-class and lower-middle-class Black voters by emphasizing his commitment to homeownership and lowering costs for people trying to stay in neighborhoods that are rapidly gentrifying.\n\nMamdani has begun to win endorsements from Democratic Party holdouts like former Vice President Kamala Harris and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. However, Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer has not yet endorsed him, and neither has New York’s junior U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is still on the fence, too.\n\nAt the same time, Mamdani has gained a steady flow of small donors. Democratic leadership, however, has done little to support him. Some of them are frightened that his criticism of Israel and what they see as socialist or radical proposals — getting rid of gifted education programs for kindergarten students and freezing the rents of rent-stabilized apartments — will hurt the party. Mamdani has taken back some of his past criticisms of the New York Police Department as racist and threatening public safety budgets — reflexive former positions that would only hurt him politically and would lose many minority votes. Meanwhile, members of the Democratic National Committee have confronted party Chairman Ken Martin for being overly cautious and not fully backing him.\n\nMamdani has proposed to raise new revenue to fund his agenda by upping taxes on wealthy residents and corporate taxes on businesses. Of course, that proposal has already been countered by opponents asserting that the wealthy will leave for lower-tax states and cities, diminishing our tax base.\n\nIt could be a risk to raise taxes on the wealthy, but their tax rate should be increased, though a compromise on the percentage of tax increase will probably be necessary. I also hope tax breaks given to developers will be reduced.\n\nThe right-leaning tabloid New York Post has attacked Mamdani for claiming to appeal to a broad section of New Yorkers while “his inner circle of radicals is strikingly white and privileged.” Another put-down from the always demagogic Trump attacks Mamdani as a “communist.” Clearly, Mamdani was a democratic socialist, not a communist, who has recently been moving toward becoming a pragmatic social democrat. Obviously, one cannot expect nuance from a president whose preference is for hyperbolic slogans and invective-laced dismissals of anybody he dislikes.\n\nYes, there is a danger that if Mamdani wins, Trump will take it out on the state and city economically and even find a justification to send the National Guard. From my perspective, it’s worth taking a chance on somebody idealistic and somewhat inspired to run the city rather than a ruthless, tired pol like Andrew Cuomo, whose day is long past.\n\nBeyond my own feelings, I also wanted to see how people on the ground felt about Mamdani. I asked a friend and ex-student of mine who was canvassing for Mamdani in Brooklyn, about what he observed.\n\nHe wrote: ”I’ve done my canvassing in Flatbush and what’s now called Prospect Lefferts Gardens. In the former, the buildings I canvassed were mainly inhabited by Haitians. They knew little about the issues but reacted positively when I finished my spiel. In Prospect Lefferts Gardens, which is a mix of Blacks and young whites, the whites were 100 percent for Zohran, most of them supporting him for his position on rents and the fact that he loves and cares about the city. The Black population was more often pro-Mamdani, especially sympathetic to his positions on rents and child care. Absolutely no one ever mentioned the war in Gaza or Mamdani’s position on Israel. And the public seemed impressed that people were knocking on their doors. It’s interesting that most of the canvassers were white, young and almost none were native New Yorkers.”\n\nI support Mamdani, though I’m not sanguine about what he’ll be able to achieve as mayor with the authoritarian, vindictive Trump in power.\n\nA city like New York with so many competing interests and problems is hard to negotiate at the best of times, so being genuinely committed to social change is rarely sufficient. But I am all for taking a stab with a fresh face and perspective — much better than the alternatives.","summary":"A city like New York with so many competing interests and problems is hard to negotiate at the best of times, so being genuinely committed to social change is rarely sufficient.

Jay Jones’ escalating scandal — over messages envisioning the murder of a Republican lawmaker and his young \"fascist\" children — is expected to dominate Thursday’s attorney general debate at the University of Richmond. The tentacles of the scandal have already reached far beyond the home of the Spiders, as President Donald Trump and Republican leaders across the country have latched onto the messaging from Jones, D-Norfolk, and the muted response from fellow Democrats. The most recent Fox News-approved poll, conducted by Christopher Newport University on Oct. 3 before the scandal broke, showed Jones leading Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares by six points, with other Democrats on the statewide ticket enjoying similar margins. But anecdotal evidence points to a tightening race, as Miyares has largely put the three-seat Republican ticket on his shoulders while Jones’ campaign falters. JOE SCARBOROUGH TELLS DEM CANDIDATE JAY JONES TO LEAVE RACE OVER VIOLENT COMMENTS AGAINST GOP LAWMAKER Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears hammered Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger on the issue at their own debate last week in Norfolk, repeatedly asking whether Jones should withdraw from the race. Spanberger declined to call for his resignation, saying voters should decide, but several voters in the Shenandoah Valley told Fox News Digital they were disappointed she didn’t take a stronger stand. Jones’ fellow Democrats have either been silent or vaguely supportive of the embattled former Biden administration Justice Department staffer continuing his bid, even as polling and public sentiment suggest his troubles could bring down the rest of the Democratic ticket. Top Democrats back Jones despite backlash Current Virginia House Speaker Don Scott Jr., D-Portsmouth, was defiant when he addressed the media following the gubernatorial debate, comparing and contrasting the situation with Trump’s own words about Wyoming Republican Liz Cheney facing gun barrels in one of the war zones her neoconservative stances advocated for. Senate President L. Louise Lucas, D-Norfolk, and caucus campaign chief Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, later issued a joint statement backing Jones and warning that keeping Miyares in office would be worse. Meanwhile, Earle-Sears has a similar grip on the Republican base as Youngkin did, but continues to trail Spanberger in recent polling. Miyares, however, has now either closed the gap or slightly surpassed Jones – which pundits have said may help blunt Democratic turnout for the entire ticket. LIBERAL MEDIA DOWNPLAYS SCANDAL OF DEM VIRGINIA AG HOPEFUL JAY JONES' TEXTS FANTASIZING MURDER OF GOP LAWMAKER Republican lieutenant gubernatorial candidate John Reid recently posted on social media that he has reportedly pulled to within a point or two of challenger Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, although the rubric of the surveys he was referring to were not immediately verifiable. Together, these signs suggest a tightening statewide contest in an increasingly blue-leaning commonwealth. Virginia's political upset shifting again In 2021, Republican Glenn Youngkin rode an upset victory on parental-rights outrage over transgender athletes in school sports. Earle-Sears has since championed that same issue while also hammering Democrats for their silence or ambivalence over Jones remaining in the race. Youngkin’s upset over Terry McAuliffe was an outlier versus other recent Virginia races – notably Republican military veteran Hung Cao’s 20-point defeat to Sen. Tim Kaine in the intervening 2024 election. Kamala Harris also defeated Trump that year. A decade ago, Republicans still had somewhat of a presence in heavily-populated northern Virginia. Then-Prince William County chairman Corey Stewart, seen as a staunch conservative, unsuccessfully sought statewide office but remained in the suburban county’s leadership for many years. While currently opposed to Trump’s brand of Republicanism, then-Rep. Barbara Comstock, was a popular officeholder in the now-progressive Loudoun County area. Del. Geary Higgins, R-Lovettsville, remains the only Republican delegate in the once-red county west of Washington. Though he, too, faces a tough road against Warrenton innkeeper John McAuliff in November’s contest. YOUNGKIN SAYS DEMOCRAT AG CANDIDATE JAY JONES MUST 'STEP AWAY IN DISGRACE’ OVER TEXTS ABOUT FORMER GOP LEADER During his campaign, Youngkin made repeated trips to southwest Virginia to run up margins in Republican strongholds and boost turnout — a strategy that, combined with support from concerned parents across northern Virginia’s Democratic-leaning suburbs, helped secure his victory. Jones’ texts revealed In messages first reported earlier this month, Jones texted Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Hopewell, in 2022, imagining a scenario where he would choose to \"fire two bullets\" into then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert’s head, describing Gilbert as worse than dictators Pol Pot or Adolf Hitler. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Jones also referred to Gilbert’s young children as \"fascists\" in the exchange. The revelations have prompted bipartisan condemnation, though Democratic leaders have so far resisted calls — including from Youngkin — for Jones to bow out of the race.","summary":"Former Virginia delegate Jay Jones faces scrutiny over violent messages about a Republican lawmaker as he prepares for Thursday&apos;s debate against Jason Miyares.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jay-jones-two-bullets-scandal-over-violent-texts-expected-dominate-virginia-ag-debate","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/jay-jones-and-jason-miyares.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 08:00:31","author":"Charles Creitz","authors":["Charles Creitz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.503},{"id":369709998,"title":"Jennifer Lopez takes a swipe at Ben Affleck eight months after their divorce","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nHome and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Oct 16th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew taxes on the rich will be 'part of the story' of Budget, says Reeves as she blames Brexit, Farage and the Tories... anyone but herself\n\nBattle for Liam Payne's £24M fortune?

Harris joined podcaster Kara Swisher at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., to discuss her new book, \"107 Days,\" which details her whirlwind experience in the 2024 election. Swisher thanked Harris for attending, but quipped that by the time they were done, numerous crazy things would have occurred in the news cycle. Harris responded by juxtaposing her mother’s work as a scientist to \"uplift the human condition\" with how she characterized the current state of the HHS under Trump and RFK Jr. \"When I see what these people are doing right now to end the war on cancer, to deny science and fire scientists, Kara, it's personal for me,\" Harris said.

Seth Moulton (D-Mass) announced Wednesday that he will challenge Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass) for his Massachusetts Senate seat, arguing that the 79-year-old lawmaker, who has served in Congress since 1976, is “too old.”\n\n“Is he too old?” Moulton said in an interview with the Boston Globe. “Look, every political consultant will tell me not to say this, but the honest truth is, yes.” \n\n“Senator Markey is a very nice guy,” the congressman continued, “but he’s been in Congress for 50 years, and he’ll be 86 years old at the end of his next term as our junior senator.” \n\nMoulton, a 46-year old Iraq War veteran and six-term congressman, acknowledged that he and Markey see eye-to-eye on “the vast majority of issues,” but said, “it’s time for a new generation of leadership for Democrats and for America.”\n\nIn his campaign launch video, Moulton cited the lessons learned from the 2024 presidential election, which saw Kamala Harris get trounced by President Trump after she replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket, amid mounting concerns about his age and mental acuity. \n\n“We’re in a crisis, and with everything we learned last election, I just don’t believe Sen. Markey should be running for another six-year-term at 80-years-old,” Moulton said in the clip. “Even more, I don’t think someone who has been in Congress for half-a-century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future.” \n\nMoulton called on Biden to drop out of the race last July in a Boston Globe op-ed, revealing that the then-president “didn’t seem to recognize me” in a small group setting at a D-Day anniversary event in Normandy earlier in the year. \n\nThe congressman also called out Democratic leadership, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). \n\n“Real people across Massachusetts are being hurt by Democratic leaders refusing to do everything they can to win,” he argued. “We’ve got to look in the mirror and be honest: it’s time for change.”\n\nMoulton told the Boston Globe that if elected he would “vote no on Senator Schumer for majority leader, because I believe our party needs new energy.”\n\nThe congressman said he’d champion “big, forward-looking, progressive solutions” if elected to the Senate. \n\nHe specifically cited “universal healthcare,” “high-speed rail,” “affordable housing,” “banning assault weapons” and “fighting climate change” as issues he’d take on. \n\nMarkey’s campaign did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"“Senator Markey is a very nice guy,” Moulton said, “but he’s been in Congress for 50 years, and he’ll be 86 years old at the end of his next term as our junior senator.” ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/15/us-news/democratic-rep-seth-moulton-launches-primary-challenge-for-ed-markeys-massachusetts-senate-seat-argues-longtime-lawmaker-is-too-old-to-serve-another-term/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/113535138.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Zbt1wxAP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-15 23:55:36","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.169},{"id":369667716,"title":"If Kamala Harris won instead of Donald Trump, how do you think the last 9 months would have unfolded differently for the United States?","text":"You've been blocked by network security.\n\nTo continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer tokenIf you think you've been blocked by mistake, file a ticket below and we'll look into it.Log in File a ticket","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1o7r0p9/if_kamala_harris_won_instead_of_donald_trump_how/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 23:42:38","author":"u/sizequeenx0","authors":["u/sizequeenx0"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-1},{"id":369621446,"title":"MAUREEN CALLAHAN: Trump's depraved critics have committed their foulest act yet...","text":"How's this for a plot twist: An authoritarian, fascist dictator whose very existence is a threat to American democracy has not only brought peace to the Middle East but has saved the lone democracy in the region.\n\nNot that his enemies can even admit it.\n\nWe now have irrefutable evidence that Trump Derangement Syndrome is more intractable than long COVID. A historic week, a monumental achievement that saw the 20 remaining living hostages safely returned — thought never to happen just weeks ago — cannot be celebrated by the left.\n\nThey refuse. They simply cannot admit that President Trump achieved greatness here.\n\nIt's sick, truly.\n\nTake the staff at the otherwise dying, irrelevant Time magazine, deliberately choosing a terrible photo of Trump, taken from a universally unflattering angle, to memorialize his masterstroke.\n\n'Yes, it was on purpose,' a staffer told Daily Mail. 'We laughed about it.'\n\nAgain: legacy media wonders why it's dying. The Democrats wonder why they keep failing to win hearts and minds.\n\nWither Joaquin Phoenix, Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo – just a few of the 5,000 actors and filmmakers who signed an open letter pledging to boycott the Israeli movie industry?\n\nIt should be a matter of simple decency, of basic humanity, to cheer the release of hostages who spent 737 days being beaten, starved, raped and tortured in Gaza.\n\nEspecially on the left, whose woke progressives decried the 'genocide' taking place in Gaza. You would think they'd celebrate the American president who has finally brought peace to the region and ended said genocide.\n\nYou'd think that they'd speak up now as Hamas murder squads openly execute Palestinians – their own people – in the streets of Gaza, as the last remnants of the terror army grasp for control.\n\nNo, no and no.\n\nThe New York Times, in its physical Tuesday edition, had not one op-ed about the most consequential end to war in our lifetime.\n\nTheir headline, above the fold: 'Hostages and Prisoners Freed with Gaza's Path Unclear.'\n\nGaza's path unclear. Pay attention to this framing: It's not the end of war, the release of innocent hostages, and a moment the entire world exhaled. No: Gaza's path is unclear, so let's all perseverate on the only justifiable outcome when one side executes a terror attack, in scale and scope, that was Israel's 9/11.\n\nThe Times 'news analysis' inside the paper, by David E Sanger and Adam Ragson: 'The Lost Chances to Reach a Cease-Fire and a Hostage Deal.'\n\nIf that isn't the very definition of yesterday's news.\n\nAnother headline, same edition: 'Cheering Crowds Greet Freed Palestinians, Though Joy is Muted For Some.'\n\nMuted joy? Paging Kamala Harris!\n\nHarris, by the way, is out on her book tour and clearly testing the waters for a 2028 run. But she wouldn't even call Trump by his name in her statement about the peace deal.\n\nI'll spare you the unnecessary verbiage and get right to the relevant part of her statement on X: 'I commend the leaders and partners who made this agreement possible, including the president and his team.'\n\nImagine if Joe Biden had been the one to broker this. Of course that did not happen — in fact, it's extremely unlikely that Hamas would have ever gone through with the 10/7 attacks if Trump, rather than Biden, had been in office.\n\nAnd does anyone think for second that the feckless, weak, incomprehensible Kamala Harris, had she won 2024, would have gotten this done?\n\nYet here we have both former President Biden and his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, taking credit for this deal — which only goes to show how incredible they know it is.\n\nThey want what some of the Orange Hitler's got.\n\nChiming in from another galaxy, Biden wrote that 'the road to this deal was not easy. My administration worked relentlessly to bring hostages home, to get relief to Palestinian civilians, and end the war.'\n\nIf only he had done that when he had the chance.\n\nBlinken issued a similarly churlish, detached-from-reality statement on X, all but patting President Trump on the head for having 'adopted and built on the plan the Biden administration developed after months of discussion with Arab partners, Israel and the Palestinian authority.'\n\nIt's almost enough to make you forget that Biden was doddering around the White House, sleeping his days away, forgetting that dead colleagues were dead, and was so cognitively addled that his inner circle kept him from his own high-level military and war strategists.\n\nAnd where is Obama, the self-appointed arbiter of the moral universe?\n\nThe name Trump has yet to pass his lip — or his X feed.\n\nAs for the bulk of mainstream media — well, it doesn't surprise.\n\nNBC News took Andrea Mitchell out of the mothballs, where she thanked — on air! — Biden and Blinken for getting this done.\n\nShe went further in a reply to Blinken on X.\n\n'Thank you for spending two years working towards this moment,' she wrote.\n\nOver at CNN, a network in terminal decline, Christine Amanpour apologized — under duress from execs is my guess — for telling host Kaitlan Collins that the hostages, some of whom were forced to dig their own graves after being starved to skin and bones, 'were probably being treated better than the average Gazan, because they are the pawns and the chips that Hamas had.'\n\nThis is depraved. This is nothing less than institutional rot at the core of left-leaning media, which has learned nothing, nothing, from the rout of 2024.\n\nAt the very least, Amanpour should be suspended for that. At least two survivors of Oct 7 — survivors who escaped that day, not hostages — have committed suicide, unable to cope with their PTSD.\n\nRoei Shalev, who was shot that day and survived, killed himself on October 10th — just three days after the second anniversary of the attacks.\n\nHe was only 30 years old. He left a suicide note on social media.\n\n'Please don't be angry with me, please,' he wrote. 'No one will ever understand me, and that's OK because you can't understand. I just want this suffering to end. I'm alive, but inside everything is dead.'\n\nPresident Trump did what Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Antony Blinken could not. And it seemed he understood — far better than the ostensible party of caring and compassion — the very human costs of this war, and the costs to come.\n\nOnly one person here deserves credit. And as long as the Dems and their media enablers deny him, they can kiss any hope of 2028 goodbye.","summary":"How's this for a plot twist: An authoritarian, fascist dictator whose very existence is a threat to American democracy has brought peace to the Middle East.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15195757/Trump-critics-gaza-peace-MAUREEN-CALLAHAN.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/15/20/103020027-0-image-m-14_1760554975361.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/13/7415006332347433772/1024x576_MP4_7415006332347433772.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-15 23:30:20","author":"Editor,Maureen Callahan","authors":["Editor","Maureen Callahan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":369625222,"title":"'The View' Co-Host Sunny Hostin Gets in Shouting Match With Cheryl Hines Over Her Husband RFK Jr.'s Qualifications on Live Show — 'May I Finish?'","text":"Tempers flared on The View when ultra-liberal Sunny Hostin began attacking guest Cheryl Hines over her husband, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Her complaint points to a board-adopted rule that sets a minimum six-month timeline for contract bargaining, of which her original filing fell eight days short.\n\n“Teamsters union brass, increasingly unable to hold onto their rank and file, are choosing to silence worker voices by not allowing them the chance to have their wishes expressed via secret ballot elections,” said Foundation President Mark Mix. “This attempt to use any means to keep workers trapped in a union they oppose and never even voted for demonstrates why the NLRB should move to eliminate the various board-created hurdles that workers face when attempting to exercise their statutory right to hold decertification elections.”\n\nNLRB is the abbreviation for the National Labor Relations Board, which is responsible for overseeing local groups to ensure the enforcement of federal labor laws. Miller says the Pittsburgh regional director dismissed her first request, citing the timeline issue, which is not spelled out in statutes.\n\nIn July, a Coca-Cola driver in Houston, Pa., filed a federal lawsuit against Teamsters Local 585 violated his constitutional right to opt out of membership and avoid paying dues that can support political activities. However, the union contract stipulated that joining was mandatory.\n\nThe lawsuit points to what critics say is a slush fund for Democratic candidates bankrolled by automatic payroll deductions of union dues, many of whom rank-and-file members don’t support.\n\nThe Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative policy group based in Harrisburg, said government unions spent $33 million in 2023 and 2024 supporting political action committees and other causes, of which just 5.2% backed candidates from other parties.\n\nFoundation research shows that membership dues bankrolled more than half of the $227 million unions have spent on political endeavors since 2007. According to the report, the organizations spent the money on voting drives, lobbying, mailers, and PAC contributions to sidestep claims that the money doesn’t directly support political candidates.\n\nIn August, the Freedom Foundation filed an ethics complaint against the Pennsylvania State Education Association – which represents 177,000 current and retired educators – that says the union concealed a $1.5 million campaign contribution to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro by routing it through unauthorized political funds and the Democratic Governors Association, violating state and federal campaign finance law.\n\nIn a statement to The Center Square, the association spokesman Chris Lilienthal denied the allegations. Investigations remain ongoing.\n\n“PSEA, through its Fund for Student Success, made a lawful contribution to DGA, into an account that was permitted to accept union contributions,” he said. “None of those funds were used to make direct contributions to the Shapiro campaign.”\n\nAndrew Holman, a foundation policy analyst and author of the report, said that in a swing state like Pennsylvania, it’s “impossible” for 9 in 10 members to agree completely with their union bosses’ political priorities.\n\n“Government unions don’t even try to hide their blatant partisanship,” Holman said. “Unfortunately, it is union members who suffer when they learn how union bosses are spending their dues.”\n\nIn the 2024 election, for example, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse a presidential candidate – bucking a two-decade streak of Democratic support – because of its members’ differing views.\n\nA straw poll conducted that same year showed 60% of the union’s rank-and-file members supported Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. During the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien reiterated the sea change.\n\n“The American people aren’t stupid,” he said. “They know the system is broken. We all know how Washington is run. Working people have no chance of winning this fight.”\n\nThe Teamsters represent 1.3 million workers – from newspaper reporters to zookeepers to police officers and everything in between – across the country. It was Republican congressional support guaranteeing sick leave for unionized rail workers, however, that inspired O’Brien to endorse Trump – even if he was called “traitor.”\n\n“I want to be clear: at the end of the day, the Teamsters are not interested if you have a D, R, or I next to your name,” he said. “We want to know one thing: what are you doing to help American workers?”\n\nHERE ARE THE GROUPS TRUMP HAS DESIGNATED AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS\n\nRegional chapters of the union stood behind Kamala Harris and other Democratic candidates. Holman’s research found that the same held true in Pennsylvania, where unions spent $2.1 million on state and local races that helped maintain the party’s one-seat majority in the state House of Representatives.\n\n“With a long-standing record of transparency issues within these unions, many members remain in the dark about what their dues are actually funding,” Holman said.","summary":"(The Center Square) – An emergency responder wants to disband Teamsters representation at her station in southwestern Pennsylvania.
