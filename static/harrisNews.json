Katie Porter’s (D-CA) blowup on a reporter asking her how she intends to lure Trump voters into supporting her shows the “arrogance” and the “entitled attitude” of California Democrats.\n\nWhile talking to Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday, Hilton spoke about Porter, who is hoping to replace California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). Hilton announced in April that he was running to be the next governor of California.\n\nWhen asked his thoughts about an interview between Porter and reporter Julie Watts with CBS News California Investigates, in which Porter became irritated and threatened to end the interview after being asked how she intended to get Trump voters to vote for her, Hilton explained that her attitude in the interview “was really ripping the mask off not just her” but off of the Democrat Party in the state.\n\n“I guess it’s good news in one sense. But, actually, the thing that I really feel is that yes, it’s about her and her terrible inept performance, and what it reveals about her. But, the deeper point is what it reveals about the Democratic Party, because the attitude that we saw on display in that was really ripping the mask off not just her, but the whole California Democrat machine. That arrogance, the entitled attitude, the, like, ‘How dare you ask me questions?’ This is what they are all like in California,” Hilton said.\n\n“We’ve had fifteen years of one-party rule. They never get challenge, there’s never any accountability for their failures, they’ve got the worst results of any state in the country, we have the highest costs for gas, electricity, housing, rent, water, you name it, insurance. The highest unemployment rate, the highest poverty rate, the worst business climate.”\n\nHilton added that while everything in California is a “total disaster,” Democrats such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and Porter “keep trucking on” with the mindset that they can continue to stay in office forever,” which Hilton noted was “arrogant.”\n\n“That’s the arrogance that you get when you’ve been in power too long, and I think people are sick of it. And, I think this was a real moment where people can see who these people are. That’s why I’m really confident, actually, that we’re going to win. I know people look at this race and think, ‘How’s a Republican going to win?’ I think we’re going to win because people are sick of these elitist Democrats in California and their terrible results, and we want change.”\n\nHilton pointed out that while the mid-term elections generally have a “lower turnout,” you can change the turnout in places such as California with a “positive campaign about the changes” that can be made, and by firing people up.","summary":"California Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton pointed out that former Rep.

Here’s Why.","text":"Virginians with even a modicum of decency were rightly repulsed by vile 2022 text messages from Jay Jones, the Democrat nominee for state attorney general, made public last week, in which he wished for two bullets to the head of then-Virginia House of Delegates Speaker Todd Gilbert—and for the killing of Gilbert’s two young children.\n\nIn purely “CYA” mode, Jones’ Democrat ticket mates running for governor and lieutenant governor were quick to join in the deserved condemnation of Jones’ despicable remarks.\n\nBut now, more than a week later, they still have not taken the next step and called on Jones to quit the race.\n\nAppalling as that is, it comes as no surprise to those of us who remember the equally shocking case of Susanna Gibson, a Democrat who ran for the House of Delegates just two years ago. More on that in a moment.\n\nAt a candidate’s debate Thursday night, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee for governor, repeatedly pressed her opponent, Democrat former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, to call on Jones to quit. Even a debate moderator repeatedly asked Spanberger about it, but the Democrat ducked, dodged, and weaved. Spanberger refused to answer whether she thought Jones should leave the race with what should have been the obvious one-word answer: “Yes.”\n\n“We’re all running our individual races,” Spanberger stammered, when asked point-blank for a “yes or no” answer. “It’s up to every voter to make their own individual decision.”\n\nNo profile in courage, Spanberger’s unwillingness to declare Jones unfit for office makes clear her condemnations of him were as performative as they were perfunctory.\n\nThe same can be said of Jones’ abject apologies for the damning texts.\n\nSpanberger and the Democrat lieutenant governor nominee, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, apparently can’t bring themselves to pull the trigger—metaphorically—and call the despicable text messages of the man who aspires to become the state’s top law enforcement officer what they are—namely, disqualifying for the job.\n\nAt Thursday night’s debate, Spanberger again denounced Jones’ violent rhetoric as “absolutely abhorrent,” but offered up only Kamala Harris-like word salads when asked repeatedly whether she thought Jones should quit the race.\n\nThe failure—not just of Spanberger and Hashmi, but also of other high-ranking Virginia Democrats, among them U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine—to call for Jones to step aside calls to mind a onetime favorite adage of the Left, albeit one used in other contexts: “Silence = Assent.”\n\nThat brings us back to Gibson, who refused to end a 2023 bid for the state legislature after it was revealed in September of that year that she had posted videos of sex acts with her husband on a pay-for-play pornographic website.\n\nThen as now, top Virginia Democrats circled the wagons and refused to demand Gibson get out of the race.\n\nState Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, the Virginia Senate majority chairwoman, criticized the release of the videos as “an invasion of privacy” and insisted that Gibson’s purported qualifications for office were all that really mattered. (Despite the sex scandal, and perhaps because of the wagon-circling, Gibson came shockingly close to winning, garnering 48.8% of vote.)Fast-forwarding two years, Locke and state Senate President Pro Tem Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, issued a joint statement in which they called Jones’ texts “deeply disturbing”—but apparently not “disturbing” enough to give up the chance for Democrats to win back the state Attorney General’s Office from Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.\n\nLocke and Lucas insisted—laughably and evidence to the contrary notwithstanding—that Jones “has demonstrated the character and compassion the Office of Attorney General deserves.”\n\n“There is no place for political violence or violent rhetoric in our public discourse,” Locke and Lucas tut-tutted and tsk-tsk’d, adding, “Jay must take accountability for his actions. But we will not allow this moment to distract from the urgent fight we are in for Virginia’s future.”\n\nLikewise, after condemning Jones’ texts, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, urged voters to keep their attention on the broader stakes of the election, the Virginia Mercury reported.\n\n“We can’t get distracted, because they want us to get distracted by the text message here or something else. Stay focused,” he said.\n\nFor its part, the Democratic Attorneys General Association has given no indication it would ask for the $3.1 million it has donated to Jones’ campaign back.\n\nIn other words, for Democrats, it’s party and political power uber alles.\n\nHow do these Democrats propose that Jones ‘take accountability for his actions’ if not by quitting the race in disgrace?\n\nIf not wishing death on a political opponent (or a sex scandal), what would it take to get Democrats to throw one of their candidates under the campaign bus?\n\nNo one doubts that if this had been Miyares, Virginia Republicans would have rightly demanded that he not only end his bid for reelection, but also that he immediately vacate his office.\n\nYou could ask then-U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., who in 2012 rejected calls from fellow Republicans to quit his bid for Senate after causing a political firestorm with insensitive remarks about rape and abortion.\n\nLike Gibson, Akin insisted on remaining in the race, but unlike Gibson, he lost in a landslide. There might be a lesson there waiting for Jones on Nov. 4.","summary":"Virginians with even a modicum of decency were rightly repulsed by vile 2022 text messages from Jay Jones, the Democrat nominee for state attorney general,...

The state Democratic Party and both of Virginia’s Democratic U.S. Senators pushed for it. Nationally prominent Democrats such as 2016 presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi concurred. The party’s gubernatorial nominee in this year’s election, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, joined the parade, saying the “bigotry displayed in this photograph is appalling”.\n\nSPANBERGER SILENT ON JAY JONES ENDORSEMENT UNDER HEAT FROM EARLE-SEARS IN FIERY VIRGINIA DEBATE\n\nRacist sentiments are always beyond the pale, and it’s easy to understand why Democrats roundly demanded the governor’s head. But racism is not the worst sin one can be guilty of. Murder for any reason is more evil than that, and that is exactly what Jones called for in the explosive texts.\n\nThe August 2022 exchange with former Republican state Delegate Carrie Coyner is horrific. He said that the then-GOP Speaker of the House, Todd Gilbert, should get “two bullets to the head” for his non-progressive views. He doubled down when Coyner expressed disgust, calling her to defend his views. He even said that Gilbert’s wife and he were “breeding little fascists” and wished that the wife could see her child die in her arms so that Gilbert would reconsider his views.\n\nHe then followed up on that desire in further texts, telling Coyner that “only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy”.\n\nOne might think that these violent views would spur immediate outrage among his Democratic colleagues and ticket mates. After all, if a 35-year-old racist photo makes one unworthy of high office, three-year-old expressions that one’s political opponents and their children should be murdered for their views should be immediately disqualifying.\n\nAlas, that has not happened.\n\nSpanberger has expressed her “disgust” for his statements, but has not withdrawn her support for him. The state Democratic Party chairman, Lamont Bagby, says the texts are not something “anyone should end their political bid over.” Sen. Tim Kaine, who said that Northam’s 35-year-old photo had “broken the trust Virginians must have in their leaders” as he called for Northam’s resignation, says that Jones’ texts are “indefensible” but “out of character” and remains supportive of Jones’ campaign. \n\nThe verdict is in and it’s unanimous. For Virginia Democrats, racists are out, and would-be murderers are in.\n\nThat should shock everyone. The fact that it apparently does not is also telling. Such is the degree of political polarization among Democrats that the enemy of my enemy — President Donald Trump and the Republican Party — that even direct expressions of support for political violence can be tolerated and rationalized.\n\nIn both cases, Democratic politicians are merely following their base voters’ sentiments.\n\nIt’s long been clear that Democrats view even the hint of racism with hatred and scorn. That’s not surprising, since so many of them believe that America and its laws are systemically racist. President Joe Biden frequently expressed that view while vowing to root such malign patterns of belief out of American life. \n\nPoliticians cannot stay in office if they do not reflect and voice their voters’ views. Thus, Democrats rush to condemn anything and anyone their voters would consider to be racist. \n\nDemocratic voters, especially their most loyal and activist ones, do not today uniformly condemn political violence.\n\nThe online reactions to Charlie Kirk’s assassination are one example of that. Far too many people on the left openly rejoiced at his murder, costing some their jobs. Others condemned his death but essentially said he had it coming because of his active propagation of his views.\n\nPolls also show a significant element of the Democratic Party’s base is at a minimum willing to tolerate political violence. A recent poll found that 44% of very liberal voters agree with the statement that “violence is often necessary to create social change”. That poll also found that 49% of Gen Z liberals and 40% of people with a graduate or professional degree — an extremely Democratic voting demographic — also agree with this statement.\n\nAn Economist/YouGov poll taken shortly after Charlie Kirk’s assassination also found that support for political violence was significantly higher among liberals and Kamala Harris voters than it was among conservatives or Donald Trump voters.\n\nIt’s easy to see why so many Democrats believe this when one considers how many think Trump is literally destroying America. A late September New York Times/Siena College poll found that 58% of registered Democrats believe that our problems are so bad that “America is in danger of failing as a nation.” Eighty-four percent of Democrats believe that Trump’s second-term actions “are a unique threat to our system of government,” while around 50% of them think that the terms “free nation” and “democratic nation” do not describe America very well or at all.\n\nIn the face of such existential anger and despair, is it any wonder so many are at least tolerant of horrific behaviors to stop a catastrophe?\n\nAnd in the face of that large segment of Democratic Party opinion, is it any wonder that leading Democrats are choosing to “hate the sin” of Jones’ texts while “loving the sinner” who has sent them?\n\nThis center will not hold. Polls already show that Jones’ once significant lead has faded. Jones’ own internal poll shows him only 1 point ahead while one taken for the Republican Attorneys General Association has incumbent GOP AG Jason Miyares ahead by 2. Expect Jones’ position to deteriorate now that both Miyares and GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears are running ads focusing on this issue.\n\nRepublicans should keep their nerve and drive this home to Virginia voters in every opportunity they have. They should try to force Spanberger to call on Jones to step aside and repeat those calls even if she initially resists. Americans in the center do not want political violence, and they will start to think twice about Spanberger if she cannot bring herself to share their values.\n\nThey should also demand that every Democrats running for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates openly reject Jones’ candidacy. Republicans face an uphill battle to regain control in the 100-seat body, but there are enough seats that will support a Republican in the right circumstances to make this possible. \n\nIn short, the GOP needs to make this a partisan issue, not a personal one. It’s not enough for them to defeat Jones: they need to force Democrats to make the choice they are avoiding between siding with their rage-filled base or the average moderate voter.\n\nOne way to do that might involve an ad featuring Mrs. Gilbert and her children. With her kids by her side, she can calmly address the camera and tell voters what Jones wished upon her offspring. She can state the truth: that Democrats continue to endorse Jones’ candidacy despite his heinous texts. Mrs. Gilbert can conclude by noting there’s only one way Virginia voters can say they want a stop to the country’s downward fall towards increasing violence: reject the party that can’t bring itself to condemn it.\n\nAn ad featuring Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika, can make a similar claim. She knows what political violence can do as she and her young children have lost a father. She has the moral credibility to say this must end, and Democrats who can’t openly reject someone who disagrees can’t be trusted to hold office.\n\nOne suspects that ads like these would move the needle quickly, forcing Spanberger’s and the Democrats’ hands. Done rapidly enough, that could save them this time. But the ongoing problem – the party dynamic that means rejecting Jones is even a question – will remain.\n\nDEMOCRATS CLEARLY IN NEED OF ANGER MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Jones saga reminds us of how deeply sick some elements of the extreme Left are. America needs two healthy parties that reject violent extremes and seek to channel legitimate anger into positive, democratic action. If the Democrats cannot bring themselves to do that, then Republicans should lean into that sad opportunity with everything they’ve got.\n\nIn that sense, perhaps Jones touched on something when he noted that it sometimes takes personal pain for someone to change their politics. If Democratic politicians personally experience the political pain of defeat through their tolerance of their violent minority, perhaps we can finally start to see a reduction of the hateful rhetoric that is poisoning our politics.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

The anonymous reader explained his situation to columnist Kwame Anthony Appiah on Saturday. \"I’m an H.I.V.-positive gay man who is distraught with where the country is headed, so I am actively participating in protests. I have a liberal friend who lives in an overwhelmingly Trump-supporting small town and is married to a Trump supporter. She messages me often about her fears of what is going on and seems equally distraught. I’ve shared with her how current politics could affect my life and how, although I’m very aware of my privilege, I’m concerned about people who aren’t as privileged and how they could be affected,\" the reader seeking advice wrote. FAMILY BREAKUPS OVER POLITICS MAY HURT MORE THAN YOU THINK, EXPERT SAYS The reader continued his critiques, chastising his friend for only sharing her political beliefs on social media rather than attending protests in her small rural town. \"She comes off to me as someone who’s comfortable in her life and doesn’t want to shake anything up, which is the height of hypocrisy to me,\" he added. \"I feel like apathy is how we got here in the first place, and I’m really struggling with how and whether to keep people like this in my life.\" The Ethicist noted that for those who live in large urban cities in the U.S., attending progressive protests is about as \"contentious as an ice cream social\" and \"cost-free\" for its participants — \"Most people you know will be pleased to see you out there.\" YOUNG MEN SHIFTING TO POLITICAL RIGHT IS CAUSING WOMEN TO DISTRUST DATING APPS, SAYS ATLANTIC WRITER \"For her, in a small Trump-supporting town, it’s another story. Neighbors who see her at a protest are neighbors she’ll see at the supermarket and the school board. That could mean living with their disapproval; it could also mean ostracism,\" Appiah pointed out. \"And unlike in cities, where numbers can swell to visibility, protests in small, homogeneous towns may achieve little beyond reinforcing the majority’s sense that the minority is odd or out of step.\" Responding to the reader's assertion that her friend's unwillingness to fully express her political beliefs is the \"height of hypocrisy,\" the Ethicist questioned whether it's fair to label her friend a hypocrite. \"Hypocrisy means professing beliefs you don’t hold. She shares your views but confronts some very different costs when it comes to public action,\" he explained. \"And then, because she’s married to a Trump supporter, those costs run right through her daily life.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE While the reader claimed that \"apathy is how we got here,\" Appiah suggested that some researchers would say that \"condescension played a part\" in how he approached his friend's situation. \"The political scientist Katherine Cramer, for example, has explored how rural resentment has been fueled by perceptions of urban disdain,\" he noted. In his closing remarks, the Ethicist offered a humbling reflection — suggesting that perhaps it's the reader's friend who should rethink their relationship, not the reader. \"As you ask whether to keep people like your low-key friend in your life, I fear that the failure of empathy here is on your side. Your small-town friend may have assessed her circumstances more carefully than you give her credit for. Maybe the question is whether she should keep someone in her life who refuses to consider that possibility,\" Appiah concluded. In November 2024, after the presidential election, the Ethicist column responded to a reader question about how Democratic voters should deal with close relatives who supported Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. \"I strongly oppose Trump, as do my wife and her family, who live nearby. I’m troubled by my mother’s support of someone I consider morally abhorrent and dangerous, especially when she voted in a former swing state,\" the person seeking advice wrote. \"With the result of the 2024 election, my wife and her family are directing their understandable fury at my mother. My wife’s sister said, ‘‘If she voted for Trump again, I’m completely done with her.’’ I expect that the next time they interact it will not be pretty.\" The Ethicist has tackled a similar question in October 2024, answering a reader's question about whether it is appropriate to leave the country if the \"wrong\" candidate becomes president. In February 2025, a reader asked the advice column whether a \"straight White dude\" can date \"women of color\" to \"combat racism.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"NY Times Magazine&apos;s &apos;The Ethicist&apos; column suggested empathy after a liberal reader criticized his rural friend for not being politically active enough in her small rural community.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ny-times-advice-column-tells-liberal-reader-develop-empathy-rural-friend-trump-supporting-husband","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Trump-New-York-Times.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 20:05:44","author":"Marc Tamasco","authors":["Marc Tamasco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.336},{"id":368407260,"title":"Tech billionaire Marc Benioff says Trump should deploy National Guard to San Francisco","text":"By Clara Harter | Los Angeles Times\n\nLOS ANGELES — Marc Benioff has become the latest Silicon Valley tech leader to signal his approval of President Donald Trump, saying that the president is doing a great job and ought to deploy the National Guard to deal with crime in San Francisco.\n\nThe Salesforce chief executive’s comments came as he headed to San Francisco to host his annual Dreamforce conference — an event for which he said he had to hire hundreds of off-duty police to provide security.\n\n“We don’t have enough cops, so if they [National Guard] can be cops, I’m all for it,” he told the New York Times from aboard his private plane.\n\nThe National Guard is generally not allowed to perform domestic law enforcement duties when federalized by the president.\n\nLast month, a federal judge ruled that Trump’s use of National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act — which restricts use of the military for domestic law enforcement — and ordered that the troops not be used in law enforcement operations within California.\n\nTrump has also ordered the National Guard to deploy to cities such as Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, citing the need to protect federal officers and assets in the face of ongoing immigration protests. Those efforts have been met with criticism from local leaders and are the subject of ongoing legal battles.\n\nPresident Trump has yet to direct troops to Northern California, but suggested in September that San Francisco could be a target for deployment. He has said that cities with Democratic political leadership such as San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles “are very unsafe places and we are going to straighten them out.”\n\n“I told [Defense Secretary] Pete [Hegseth] we should use some of these dangerous cities as training for our military, our national guard,” Trump said.\n\nBenioff’s call to send National Guard troops to San Francisco drew sharp rebukes from several of the region’s elected Democratic leaders.\n\nSan Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she “can’t be silent any longer” and threatened to prosecute any leaders or troops who harass residents in a fiery statement on X.\n\n“I am responsible for holding criminals accountable, and that includes holding government and law enforcement officials too, when they cross the bounds of the law,” she said. “If you come to San Francisco and illegally harass our residents, use excessive force or cross any other boundaries that the law prescribes, I will not hesitate to do my job and hold you accountable just like I do other violators of the law every single day.”\n\nState Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, also took to X to express indignation, saying, “we neither need nor want an illegal military occupation in San Francisco.”\n\n“Salesforce is a great San Francisco company that does so much good for our city,” he said. “Inviting Trump to send the National Guard here is not one of those good things. Quite the opposite.”\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie’s office offered a more muted response, touting the mayor’s efforts to boost public safety in general, but declining to directly address Benioff’s remarks.\n\nCharles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the mayor, noted that the city is seeing net gains in both police officers and sheriff’s deputies for the first time in a decade. He also highlighted Lurie’s efforts to bring police staffing up to 2,000 officers.\n\n“Crime is down nearly 30% citywide and at its lowest point in decades,” Lutvak said. “We are moving in the right direction and will continue to prioritize safety and hiring while San Francisco law enforcement works every single day to keep our city safe.”\n\nWhen contacted by The Times on Friday night, the office of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who vociferously opposed the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, did not issue a comment in response to Benioff.\n\nBenioff and Newsom have long been considered friends, with a relationship dating back to when Newsom served as San Francisco’s mayor. Newsom even named Benioff as godfather to one of his children, according to the San Francisco Standard.\n\nBenioff has often referred to himself as an independent. He has donated to several liberal causes, including a $30 million donation to UC San Francisco to study homelessness, and has contributed to prior political campaigns of former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Hillary Clinton.\n\nHowever, he has also donated to the campaigns of former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, both Republicans, and supported tougher-on-crime policies and reducing government spending.\n\nEarlier this year, Benioff also praised the Elon Musk-led federal cost-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n“I fully support the president,” Benioff told the New York Times this week. “I think he’s doing a great job.”\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Very dated.\" EXPERTS WARN LEFTIST CELEBRATIONS OF CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH SIGNAL A DANGEROUS MAINSTREAM SHIFT IN POLITICS Ellis rejected one film critic's opinion that \"One Battle After Another\" was an \"important movie,\" arguing that the filmmakers failed to take the country's strenuous political climate into account. \"No, it is not. It has really not read the room,\" he countered. \"It has not read the room at all about what’s going on in America.\" The film, inspired by Thomas Pynchon's Reagan-era set novel \"Vineland,\" follows The French 75, a Weather Underground-like group of self-described revolutionaries rebelling against what they believe is authoritarianism. The revolutionary group breaks illegal immigrants out of detention centers and bombs courthouses and offices of lawmakers who pushed abortion bans throughout the course of the film. LEONARDO DICAPRIO IS 'SLOWING DOWN A BIT' IN HIS NEW CAREER PHASE AFTER DECADES IN HOLLYWOOD Hollywood veteran Sean Penn also stars in the film from director Paul Thomas Anderson, playing Army Col. Steven Lockjaw — a man auditioning for a secretive, elite White supremacist group known as the Christmas Adventurers. The organization wields significant political influence and devotes its time to hunting down members of The French 75. FoxNews.com columnist David Marcus slammed the movie as an \"ill-timed apologia for left-wing violence,\" comparing it to \"watching a World War II film in which viewers are meant to cheer for lovable Nazis.\" \"What is missing here is even the slightest bit of nuance about the glorious necessity to kill people, including innocents, in order to topple Anderson’s weird and paranoid version of the American government,\" Marcus wrote in an opinion column last month. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The conservative outlet National Review also criticized \"One Battle After Another,\" warning that \"there will be bloodlust\" inspired by the film. \"It’s a macabre coincidence that One Battle After Another opens so soon after the assassination of peaceable conservative debater Charlie Kirk,\" the outlet wrote. \"The film undeniably romanticizes political assassination … Anderson intentionally provokes the bloodlust of his woke confreres (and Gen Z viewers who know nothing about the Sixties) by celebrating the insipid, heretical, and violent activities of the liberal past and present. Anderson’s title lacks Pynchon’s pith but daydreams a culture of never-ending political obstruction and pandemonium. It is the year’s most irresponsible movie.\" Although some critics have voiced their concerns over the film's themes of political violence and revolution, it has been a massive hit at the box office — bringing in over $100 million globally since its premiere in September and currently sits as the highest rated film of 2025 on Metacritic.

Instead, anger is the first word that usually comes to mind. \n\nHere are ten examples of anger on display during Trump’s second term: \n\n“This dude [Ted Cruz] has to be knocked over the head, like, hard, right? Like, there is no niceties with him, like, at all!” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). \n\n“[Trump senior advisor] Stephen Miller needs to be THUMPED! That guy’s a freaking worm. I would be willing to go to jail for – I mean, how much [time] would I get for just cracking him a couple of times?” said North Carolina congressional candidate Richard Ojeda (D). \n\n“Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, Hitler and Pol Pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head. Spoiler – put [Republican Todd] Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time,” said Jay Jones (D), Attorney General candidate in Virginia, who also wished death upon Gilbert’s wife and two young children in text messages released this month by a Republican colleague. Jones also referred to the children as “little fascists.” \n\n“Let your rage fuel you!” Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger (D) said to supporters at a rally in June. Spanberger has refused to call on Jones to drop out of the race. \n\n“I’m like, ‘You know what? I’m not the one. Don’t come for me unless I send for you.’ And I did not send for this malignant clown,” said House Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, commenting on a confrontation he had with Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) during which he told Lawler to “keep your mouth shut.” \n\n“The visceral response from people across the country who feel cheated, ripped off, and threatened by the vile practices of their insurance companies should be a warning to everyone in the healthcare system,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said after Luigi Mangione murdered United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson by shooting him in the back in the middle of Manhattan. \n\n“Violence is never the answer,” Warren added. “But people can only be pushed so far.”\n\n“There is no legacy to honor. It was a legacy filled with bigotry, hatred, and white supremacy,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said in a podcast interview after Charlie Kirk was assassinated without citing any specific quotes to back up her farcical claim. “And as a black woman and as a Muslim in this country, I refuse to join the chorus that changes the history of what is on the record from this man.”\n\n“We’re going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said on his podcast, talking about Republicans. \n\n“Get out of my f****** shot!” exclaimed California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter to a staffer during a taped interview. The staffer tried to explain to Porter that her argument was wrong on electric vehicles, but Porter was livid despite the interview not being live.\n\n“You also were in my shot before that. Stay out of my shot,” Porter reiterated. \n\nThe clip has since gone viral to the tune of millions of views. But Porter will benefit from “news” shows like The View, which somehow falls under ABC’s news department. \n\nHere is co-host Whoopi Goldberg somehow defending Porter with the “everybody-treats-their-staff-this-way” argument.\n\n“I have done this, I have been rude to people…” Goldberg began. \n\n“But you’re not running for elected official,” co-host Sara Haines injected. \n\n“No, but I’ve been rude and that’s my point,” Goldberg continued. \n\n“And I understand, but I would expect something differently from her,” Haines replied. \n\n“No, she’s just another human being,” Goldberg shot back, as if this is normal behavior on display from Porter in any ordinary workplace that would get other people fired. \n\nThis wasn’t a one-off with Porter, either. Just a day before the video of her berating a staffer made it into the mainstream, she walked out of an interview with a Sacramento CBS affiliate because the reporter, Julie Watts, actually asked follow-up questions around winning over moderate and conservative voters in her gubernatorial race. \n\n“I don’t want to keep doing this. I’m going to call it,” Porter said in attempting to end the interview over perfectly reasonable questions. \n\n“I want to have a pleasant, positive conversation. … If every question you’re going to make up a follow-up question, then we’re never going to get there and we are just going to circle around.”\n\nThe anger management issue threatens to turn the California governor’s race into an unexpectedly competitive one. According to betting site Kalshi, Porter’s chances of being governor were 40% just one week ago, before the CBS interview and the staffer scolding video emerged. It’s now at just 16%. Actions have consequences, especially in a social media environment. \n\nDemocrats keep telling us that they simply need to fight President Donald Trump and Republicans harder while amping up the rhetoric. \n\n“We’re going to bring a knife fight to a knife fight,” declared DNC Chairman Ken Martin. \n\nBut the party continues to plummet in the polls. A CNN poll, for example, shows that just 16% of American adults say the party has strong leaders, while just 19% say it’s a party that can get things done. Those are the lowest numbers we’ve seen for any party in polling history. \n\nMeanwhile, on the Republican side and especially as it pertains to Trump, the once stuffy party of country club rich guys is now the fun party. The 2024 campaign said it all: While Trump was being compared to Hitler and a fascist even after two assassination attempts, he worked a drive-through at McDonald’s, smiling and chatting up customers. And when President Joe Biden angrily referred to all Trump supporters as garbage, Trump’s team quickly secured a garbage truck in Wisconsin while the candidate dressed up as a garbage man and loved every minute of it. \n\nBoth moments went viral in places that typical campaigns and all the TV ad buys in the world could not reach. So while Kamala Harris was doing forgetful interviews on CNN or MSNBC, Trump cast himself as the happy warrior while mocking Democrats in the process. That remains true to this day regarding the posture of both parties. \n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nAristotle once said: “Anybody can become angry — that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way — that is not within everybody’s power and is not easy.” \n\nBy being in desperate need of anger management, Democrats clearly need to heed this advice.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

The disease has metastasized to his bones, suggesting an advanced stage.\n\nWhat Is Prostate Cancer?\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, prostate cancer is a disease that begins in the prostate gland and is one of the most common cancers among men. While many prostate cancers grow slowly and may not cause significant harm, aggressive forms can spread rapidly to other parts of the body, such as bones and lymph nodes.\n\nHow Is Joe Biden Doing Today?\n\nAs of May 2025, Biden is meeting with his doctors to explore treatment options. According to CBS News and People, the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective treatment options.\n\nAccording to People and the BBC, he has expressed gratitude for the public’s support, saying, “Cancer touches us all… Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.”\n\nBiden also stated, “Man, I’ve learned this journey is full of unexpected turns. But we face them together. And I’m grateful to have this nation behind me.”\n\nIn October 2025, a rep for Biden told People, “As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment.” Sources told the outlet that the former president was “responding well” to his treatment.\n\nHow Old Is Joe Biden Now?\n\nBiden is currently 82 years old. He was born on November 20, 1942.\n\nIs There a Cure for Prostate Cancer?\n\nAccording to the Moffitt Cancer Center and MD Anderson Cancer Center, prostate cancer can often be cured if caught early. For advanced cases like Biden’s, treatment may not offer a cure but can effectively manage symptoms and slow the disease’s progression.","summary":"Image Credit: Getty Images Joe Biden is facing a new health battle following the announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis.

The condition is notably frequent in elderly men, with studies indicating approximately 80 percent of men over 80 have cancerous cells in their prostate gland.Despite being highly treatable when detected early, it ranks as the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men, according to the organisation.

Biden’s score of nine suggests his cancer is among the most aggressive.\n\nHis office noted that: 'While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.'\n\nBiden, who turns 83 next month, left office as the oldest serving president in US history – he was also elected as the oldest ever person to hold the highest office. \n\nIt's common for those of his advanced age to experience prostate issues. More than half of prostate cancers are found in men older than 65, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nA nodule is a firm lump or swelling that can develop throughout the body. While it can be benign and harmless, some can be associated with bigger health concerns like infections or, in this case, cancer.\n\nQuestions over the former president's age, health and fitness for office ultimately led him to ditch his reelection campaign and let then-Vice President Kamala Harris, 60, take over.\n\nLeaders within the Democratic Party have started to publicly admit that Biden should not have run for reelection in 2024. Some claim that they were duped by advisers who were shielding Biden from the public and telling members of the party he was fit behind the scenes.\n\nSources told The Washington Post that Biden remains bitter about dropping out of the 2024 race, and regularly debates with his team about responding to President Donald Trump's actions and policies. \n\nSince leaving office, Biden has been working on a memoir and a foundation to build a presidential library, The Post reported. \n\nBiden's son, Beau Biden, also died of cancer at the age of 46 in 2015 after he was diagnosed in 2013 with glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive type of brain cancer. \n\nHis father claimed the cancer was a consequence of his Beau's exposure to military burn pits when he was serving in Iraq.","summary":"A spokesperson for the politician announced on Saturday that the 82-year-old will undergo the treatment, as well as hormone therapy.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15183237/joe-biden-prostate-cancer-treatment-radiation.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/11/14/102905467-0-image-m-37_1760190278418.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 14:29:28","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":368336042,"title":"Joe Biden undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer treatment","text":"Former President Joe Biden is now receiving radiation therapy for his prostate cancer, a spokesperson for the former president confirmed to ABC News.\n\n\"As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe former president's office announced his prostate cancer diagnosis in May, noting that while it was an aggressive form, \"the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.\"\n\n\"It's all a matter of taking a pill, one particular pill, for the next six weeks and then another one,\" the 82-year-old said in May.\n\n\"Well, the prognosis is good.

It further indicates that the cancer cells look very different from normal prostate cells and are likely to grow and spread rapidly.\n\nThis places the cancer in the Grade Group 5, the highest-risk category, which is associated with a greater likelihood of metastasis and a more challenging prognosis. Yet despite the cancer's aggressiveness, its hormone-sensitive nature offers a viable treatment pathway, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S., according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nAn estimated 313,780 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed this year, representing 15.4% of all new cancer cases, according to the NIH. The five-year survival rate from prostate cancer is roughly 98%, the NIH says.\n\nProstate cancer usually grows very slowly. While finding and treating it before symptoms occur may not improve men's health or help them live longer, it is generally a more treatable type of cancer, even when it has spread.\n\nThe news of Biden's radiation therapy comes after he had Mohs surgery -- a common procedure to treat skin cancer -- in September, a Biden spokesperson said.\n\nBiden's health had been under scrutiny since before he dropped out of the presidential race in 2024, giving way to then-Vice President Kamala Harris to top the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\nPrior to the announcement of his prostate cancer diagnosis, Biden and former first lady Dr. Jill Biden appeared on ABC's \"The View,\" where they both pushed back against the slate of new books from reporters claiming that Biden was dealing with cognitive decline at the end of his presidency.\n\nABC News' Eric Strauss contributed to this report.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden is now receiving radiation therapy for his prostate cancer, a spokesperson for the former president confirmed to ABC News.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-undergoing-radiation-therapy-prostate-cancer-treatment/story?id=126428468","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/0dd69cd4-013d-42b8-a1c3-faead24b8488/joe-biden-gty-gmh-250901_1756760330223_hpMain_2_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 14:04:00","author":"Molly Nagle","authors":["Molly Nagle"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":368325698,"title":"Cardi B Proves Her Popularity By Trading One No. 1 Hit For Another","text":"Cardi B replaces herself at No. 1 as “ErrTime” leaps to the top of Billboard’s Rap Streaming Songs chart, giving her an eighth career leader on the tally.

Savenok/Getty Images for Revolve & FWRD)\nGetty Images for Revolve & FWRD\n\nCardi B’s latest album Am I the Drama? continues as one of the most popular releases in America, even as it begins to descend on multiple charts. The highly anticipated project — her first in seven years and only second full-length ever — arrived less than a month ago and quickly became a No. 1 on multiple rankings.\n\nThis frame, Cardi scores another No. 1 hit on a Billboard chart as Am I the Drama? tune “ErrTime” finds its way to the summit on just one list. What’s most interesting about her latest leader is that the rapper manages to replace herself atop a tally, trading a smash for another.\n\n“ErrTime” Gives Cardi B Another No. 1 Hit\n\n“ErrTime” debuted last week at No. 13 on Billboard’s Rap Streaming Songs chart. The ranking measures the most-played rap-only tunes in the United States on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and others, and this time around, Cardi rockets from just outside the highest tier to No. 1.\n\nCardi B Replaces Herself at No. 1 on a Billboard Chart\n\nAs “ErrTime” bolts to the summit, Cardi swaps one No. 1 for another on the Rap Streaming Songs ranking. Last week, she ruled alongside Kehlani with “Safe,” the most recent single from Am I the Drama? This period, “Safe” falls to No. 5, following a pattern that many Am I the Drama? tunes are experiencing at the moment.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nA Remix with Latto Makes “ErrTime” a Smash\n\n“ErrTime” appears on the standard version of Am I the Drama? as a solo cut, but it’s a collaborative remix that makes it a big win. Days after the album dropped, a reworked take featuring Latto became available. Sales of both songs are lumped together for charting purposes, which helps the track surge and hit No. 1.\n\nHow Many No. 1s Has Cardi B Charted?\n\nAs “ErrTime” shoots to No. 1, Cardi scores her eighth career champion on the Rap Streaming Songs tally. She has previously led with “WAP” (with Megan Thee Stallion), “Bodak Yellow (Money Moves),” “Up,” “Tomorrow 2” (with GloRilla), “Outside,” “Please Me” (with Bruno Mars), and, of course, “Safe.”\n\nHow Many Streaming Hits Has Cardi B Scored?\n\nCardi doesn’t just earn a new No. 1 this week — she also ups her count of top 10 smashes on the streaming-only roster. 33 tunes with her name attached have broken into the uppermost register on the Rap Streaming Songs chart. Only 10 other Cardi cuts have made it to the list without finding their way into the loftiest region.\n\n“ErrTime” Misses No. 1 By One Space\n\nCardi almost collects multiple new No. 1s in America this week but misses out on doing so by just one space. “ErrTime” pushes to the runner-up spot on the R&B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs chart after settling at No. 15 last week. In a bit of coincidence, Cardi is beaten to the peak position by “Folded” from collaboration partner Kehlani, which pushes from No. 3 to first place.\n\n“ErrTime” Becomes a Breakout Hit From Am I the Drama?\n\nWEST ALLIS, WISCONSIN - NOVEMBER 01: Cardi B speaks during a campaign rally for Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center on November 1, 2024 in West Allis, Wisconsin.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\n“ErrTime” is quickly turning out to be one of the biggest hits from Am I the Drama? The track appears on nine different Billboard charts this week, and it is almost uniformly climbing. The cut holds at its all-time best of No. 3 on the Rap Digital Song Sales chart and debuts at No. 25 on the all-genre Streaming Songs tally.\n\nThe tune reaches a new high point and improves on the other seven rosters on which it can be found, in what has turned out to be a huge week for a fan favorite from Cardi’s long-awaited sophomore set. The female rapper collects a new top 10 with “ErrTime” on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, R&B/Hip-Hop Streaming Songs, Hot Rap Songs and, as mentioned, the Rap Streaming Songs list simultaneously.\n\nAfter kicking off its time on the Hot 100 at No. 65, “ErrTime” manages to beat the odds and better its standing. Cardi nearly snags a new top 40 success, as it lifts more than 20 spaces to a new peak of No. 43. If this trend continues, “ErrTime” may crack that special region soon, and could potentially grow to No. 1 on multiple other rosters where it’s just a few spaces away at present.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Cardi B replaces herself at No. 1 as “ErrTime” leaps to the top of Billboard’s Rap Streaming Songs chart, giving her an eighth career leader on the tally.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2025/10/11/cardi-b-proves-her-popularity-by-trading-one-no-1-hit-for-another/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6659ec3651c84cf6c7b325c3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 13:30:00","author":"Hugh McIntyre,Senior Contributor,Trading One No","authors":["Hugh McIntyre","Senior Contributor","Trading One No"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.258},{"id":368323560,"title":"Why Napheesa Collier will change WNBA’s trajectory after calling out leadership","text":"When Napheesa Collier rolled up her sleeves on Tuesday, September 30, before her Minnesota Lynx season exit interview, something was about to shift in the WNBA forever.\nHer grandfather, Gershon Collier, helped Sierra Leone negotiate independence from Britain in 1961, according to a 2019 CBS Sports profile. A civil war in 1991 drove her father to the U.S., where he settled in Missouri and started a family.\n“When you picture the powerful people in history, my grandfather is one of them, and I’m directly related to him, so that’s pretty powerful,” Collier told CBS Sports then.\nHer college coach, Geno Auriemma, saw it early. “She carries herself as if there’s something beyond basketball in her life and whether that’s genetic…that’s a reflection of her heritage,” he said.\nNow she’s becoming that same kind of powerful. Now she’s negotiating for something the WNBA desperately needs: accountability.\n“We have the best players in the world, we have the best fans in the world, but right now we have the worst leadership in the world,” Collier said.\nThat line hit hard. Why do women always have to fight this hard?\nThe receipts \nCollier didn’t just complain. She came prepared with a written statement, rolled up her sleeves, and laid out receipts that should cost Commissioner Cathy Engelbert her job.\n“This conversation is not about winning or losing,” Collier said. “It’s about something much bigger. The real threat to our league isn’t money, it isn’t ratings or even missed calls or even physical play. It’s the lack of accountability from the league office.”\nShe detailed a February visit Engelbert made to Unrivaled, the league Collier co-founded, where she asked how the WNBA planned to address officiating issues. Engelbert’s response: “Only the losers complain about the refs.”\nWhen Collier asked how the league would fix the fact that players like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, and Paige Bueckers drive massive revenue while making minimal salaries their first four years, Engelbert said Clark “should be grateful she makes $16 million off the court because without the platform the WNBA gives her she wouldn’t make anything.”\nEnglebert also said, “Players should be on their knees thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them.” Collier adding, “That’s the mentality that’s driving our league from the top.”\nClark has not heard from Engelbert since.\nThe support keeps coming\nIn the days since Collier’s September 30 exit interview, support hasn’t just trickled in; it has poured.\n“I have a great respect for Phee, and I think she made very valid points,” Clark said. “I think what people need to understand we need great leadership in this time across all levels. This is a moment we have to capitalize on.”\nEven retired star Elena Delle Donne weighed in: “It’s the care for the human part for me. I’m not sure Cathy knows I’m retired. Heard from everyone but her.”\nThat last one stings. A decorated player retires and the commissioner doesn’t acknowledge it? That’s not leadership. Period.\nThen Thursday, on the show “Post Moves” with Candace Parker and Aliyah Boston, the conversation went deeper.\nParker didn’t mince words: “What was interesting was the amount of players that came to the defense of Phee and the crickets that came to the defense of Cathy for me.”\nThen she revealed something stunning. She receives gifts from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver every year but has never heard from Engelbert. She’s not alone. Sabrina Ionescu admitted she has a better relationship with Silver than with her own league’s commissioner.\n“Everyone’s had this same sentiment for a very long time,” Parker said, adding that the disconnect may be about relationships, not just business.\nAliyah Boston connected it to the bigger picture: “This is an important time. With the CBA negotiations. When you look at leagues around the world it is about caring for your athletes and that’s just not the feeling right now.”\nSustainability or excuses?\nCollier challenged the league’s “sustainability” claims in her exit interview, pointing out that teams are selling for $300 million with valuations approaching half a billion dollars.\nMeanwhile, the WNBA is benefiting more from Clark than she is from them. Clark’s Iowa fanbase drove record attendance numbers across the league. She delivered the most-watched WNBA game ever on cable. Yet Engelbert suggests Clark should be grateful for the platform?\nThat’s backward. The platform is booming because of Clark and players like her. This is the core problem: Leadership that sees players as lucky to be there, not as the reason anyone’s watching.\nEngelbert’s response to all of this was telling.\n“I am disheartened by how Napheesa characterized our conversations and league leadership, but even when our perspectives differ, my commitment to the players and to this work will not waver,” she said.\nThat’s not accountability. Collier called for action, and Engelbert didn’t acknowledge a single point she made.\nWhy Napheesa Collier will win\nHere’s why this moment is different. Collier is the 2024 MVP and two-time Defensive Player of the Year with the entire league’s respect. She’s earned her place and her platform. She’s vice president of the Players Association with the collective bargaining agreement deadline approaching. And she co-founded Unrivaled, a $340 million offseason league that allows players to earn in the U.S. instead of going overseas.\nShe’s brought these issues to Engelbert time and time again. Canceling their scheduled meeting to meet with Kamala Harris instead? That’s elevating this to a national conversation.\nIn that conversation with Harris, Collier emphasized that players aren’t seeing change, and she’s fed up.\n“Whether I was going to get annihilated for this or if people were going to support me, I felt what I was doing was right. I felt like it needed to be said.”\nCollier’s grandfather fought colonial powers for his country’s freedom. She’s fighting institutional power for players to be treated with respect in a league they have built. Both fights require the same thing, refusing to be silenced when the system fails the people it’s supposed to serve.\n“I will not stand quietly by and allow different standards to be applied at the league level,” Collier said.\nThe WNBA is in a defining moment. The league can evolve with leadership that values its players, or it can prove Collier right about having the worst leadership in the world while watching talent and credibility drain away.\nEither way, Napheesa Collier just changed the trajectory. The only question is whether the WNBA will change with her.","summary":"When Napheesa Collier rolled up her sleeves on Tuesday, September 30, before her Minnesota Lynx season exit interview, something was about to shift in the WNBA forever.

The Salesforce chief executive's comments came as he headed to San Francisco to host his annual Dreamforce conference — an event for which he said he had to hire hundreds of off-duty police to provide security. “We don’t have enough cops, so if they [National Guard] can be cops, I’m all for it,” he told The New York Times from aboard his private plane. The National Guard is generally not allowed to perform domestic law enforcement duties when federalized by the president. Last month, a federal judge ruled that Trump's use of National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act — which restricts use of the military for domestic law enforcement — and ordered that the troops not be used in law enforcement operations within California. Trump has also ordered the National Guard to deploy to cities such as Portland, Ore., and Chicago, citing the need to protect federal officers and assets in the face of ongoing immigration protests. Those efforts have been met with criticism from local leaders and are the subject of ongoing legal battles. President Trump has yet to direct troops to Northern California, but suggested in September that San Francisco could be a target for deployment. He has said that cities with Democratic political leadership such as San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles \"are very unsafe places and we are going to straighten them out.\" \"I told [Defense Secretary] Pete [Hegseth] we should use some of these dangerous cities as training for our military, our national guard,\" Trump said. Benioff's call to send National Guard troops to San Francisco drew sharp rebukes from several of the region's elected Democratic leaders. San Francisco Dist. Atty. Brooke Jenkins said she \"can't be silent any longer\" and threatened to prosecute any leaders or troops who harass residents in a fiery statement on X. \"I am responsible for holding criminals accountable, and that includes holding government and law enforcement officials too, when they cross the bounds of the law,\" she said. \"If you come to San Francisco and illegally harass our residents, use excessive force or cross any other boundaries that the law prescribes, I will not hesitate to do my job and hold you accountable just like I do other violators of the law every single day.\" State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) also took to X to express indignation, saying \"we neither need nor want an illegal military occupation in San Francisco.\" \"Salesforce is a great San Francisco company that does so much good for our city,\" he said. \"Inviting Trump to send the National Guard here is not one of those good things. Quite the opposite.\" San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie's office offered a more muted response, touting the mayor's efforts to boost public safety in general, but declining to directly address Benioff's remarks. Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the mayor, noted that the city is seeing net gains in both police officers and sheriff’s deputies for the first time in a decade. He also highlighted Lurie's efforts to bring police staffing up to 2,000 officers. \"Crime is down nearly 30% citywide and at its lowest point in decades,\" Lutvak said. \"We are moving in the right direction and will continue to prioritize safety and hiring while San Francisco law enforcement works every single day to keep our city safe.” When contacted by The Times Friday night, the office of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who vociferously opposed the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, did not issue a comment in response to Benioff. Benioff and Newsom have long been considered friends, with a relationship dating back to when Newsom served as San Francisco's mayor. Newsom even named Benioff as godfather to one of his children, according to the San Francisco Standard. Benioff has often referred to himself as an independent. He has donated to several liberal causes, including a $30-million donation to UC San Francisco to study homelessness, and has contributed to prior political campaigns of former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Hillary Clinton. However, he has also donated to the campaigns of former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, both Republicans, and supported tougher-on-crime policies and reducing government spending. Earlier this year, Benioff also praised the Elon Musk-led federal cost-cutting effort known as the Department of Government Efficiency. “I fully support the president,” Benioff told the New York Times this week. “I think he’s doing a great job.”","summary":"Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff says President Trump is doing a great job and ought to deploy the National Guard to deal with crime in San Francisco.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-11/tech-billionaire-marc-benioff-says-trump-should-deploy-national-guard-to-san-francisco","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7478a18/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5133x3422+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2F56%2Fdfa8268c4c08940a36af17a34527%2Fswitzerland-davos-for","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 12:00:00","author":"Clara Harter","authors":["Clara Harter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":368299708,"title":"Wendy Osefo and her husband Eddie staged home burglary: How were Real Housewives of Potomac stars' caught?","text":"Wendy Osefo and her husband, Edward “Eddie” Osefo, have issued a statement on their arrest for alleged fraud\n\nThe 'Real Housewives of Potomac' stars Dr. Wendy Osefo and husband Eddie Osefo were arrested on 16 fraud charges on Thursday, October 9, according to the Carroll County Sheriff's Office in Maryland.

(AFP pic)\nDEARBORN: Lifelong Democrat Samra'a Luqman became a vocal backer of Donald Trump in 2024, helping to rally support for him among the pivotal Arab American community in Dearborn, Michigan, in the hope that he could end the Gaza war.\nNow, after Trump helped to broker a ceasefire deal, Luqman feels thrilled and a bit vindicated after months of backlash from neighbours angry over Trump's support for Israel.\n\"It's almost an 'I told you so moment,'\" said Luqman, who is Yemeni American.\n\"No other president would have been able to force Bibi to approve the ceasefire,\" she said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nLuqman and other Arab American Trump supporters who spoke to Reuters expressed guarded optimism about the recently announced agreement, but said they worried that Israel could violate the ceasefire, as it has done in the past in Gaza and Lebanon.\n\"We're all holding our breath,\" said Mike Hacham, a Lebanese American political consultant and Dearborn resident who campaigned hard for Trump in 2024.\n\"I gotta give credit where credit is due ... but this isn't a peace deal. It's just the end of a bloody war and those lives that were lost on the Israeli side and the Palestinian side aren't going to be brought back,\" Hacham said.\nGuarded optimism over Gaza but mistrust of Israel\nIsraeli airstrikes in Qatar and other Arab nations in recent months fueled deep mistrust of Israel among Michigan's more than 300,000 people of Arab heritage.\nHowever, the agreement is the biggest step yet to end two years of war that Palestinian health authorities have said killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza.\nIn addition to a ceasefire, the deal calls for releasing the last 20 of 250 hostages seized by Hamas when it started the war with the Oct 7, 2023, attacks that killed more than 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government.\nIt comes after months of deepening frustration among Arab Americans over what they see as Trump's failure to rein in Netanyahu and end the war.\nTrump's renewed ban on travel from several majority-Muslim countries and crackdowns on freedom of speech targeting pro-Palestinian protesters have also unnerved many, according to more than a dozen Arab American voters who backed Trump in Michigan last year and spoke to Reuters in recent weeks.\nMany of those interviewed also felt disappointed that their community's support - thousands of votes that helped to push Trump to victory in Michigan - did not translate into more senior high-profile posts for Arab Americans and Muslims in his administration.\nIt remains unclear whether the ceasefire deal will sway skeptical voters as Trump's Republicans face competitive congressional and gubernatorial elections in Michigan next year, as well as the 2028 presidential election.\nHacham said Trump would be hailed as a \"champion of peace\" after brokering the Gaza ceasefire, but added that Arab American voters could turn against him and other Republicans if it fails.\n\"We are willing to abandon the Republicans and move back to the Democrats.\n\"We've shown Donald Trump that we have the power to swing whichever way we want,\" Hacham said.\nAnger over Gaza fueled switch to Trump\nTrump won Michigan by more than 80,000 votes in 2024, reversing his 154,000-count loss to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\nAn October 2024 Arab American Institute poll had shown Trump favoured by 42% of Arab Americans nationwide versus 41% for Kamala Harris - down 18 percentage points from Biden's share in 2020.\n\"In addition to anger over the Gaza war, Trump's 2024 campaign tapped into concerns raised by some conservative community members about Democrats' defense of transgender rights,\" Luqman said.\nShe expected those voters probably would stick with Republicans.\n\"However, a larger group of Arab Americans voted for Trump in 2024 \"out of spite\" at Democrats, and their continued support for the Republican Party likely depends on what happens with Gaza,\" Luqman said.\n\"I don't think they've found their political home with the Republicans just yet,\" she said, adding that Trump's pressure on Netanyahu could \"solidify support for JD Vance in the next election and for the midterms for any Republicans that run\".\nImam Belal Alzuhairi joined Trump on stage in Michigan just days before the 2024 election, alongside 22 other clerics, convinced that he offered the best chance for peace, but he said many Yemeni Americans later grew disenchanted after Trump reimposed a travel ban on many Muslim countries.\n\"Now, a lot of people are very upset. They are fearing for themselves and their families. There's a mistrust after the travel ban,\" he said.\nAfter facing personal backlash for his endorsement, the Yemeni American cleric says he is pulling out of \"soul-consuming\" politics to focus on religion and his family.\nTrump administration moves to tamp down frustration\nSpecial envoy Richard Grenell, a Michigan native tapped by Trump to lead his outreach to Arab American and Muslim voters, returned to the Detroit area last month for his first in-person meetings with community leaders since November.\nHis mission? To tamp down the mounting frustration and prevent Arab Americans from swinging to the Democratic Party, as they did after Republican president George W Bush's invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nAlzuhairi, Luqman and a dozen others grilled Grenell at a coffeehouse in Dearborn over the travel ban and US arms sales to Israel.\nAt a separate session, he was asked why the administration is not doing more to help Christians in Iraq.\nGrenell, former acting director of intelligence during Trump's first term, told Reuters the dialogue was important.\n\"I continue to believe that the Arab and Muslim communities in Michigan are the key to winning the state.\n\"I know these leaders well and they want and deserve access to political decision makers,\" Grenell said.\nAlthough Grenell faced tough questions from Arab American leaders during four events in the Detroit area, he said he would remain closely engaged, and emphasised Trump's commitment to peace around the world.\n\"You can't show up right before an election and expect to be a credible voice for any community,\" he told Reuters.\nAli Aljahmi, a 20-year-old Yemeni American who helped to galvanise young Arab Americans for Trump with a video viewed nearly 1 million times on X, credited him for coming to Dearborn twice during the 2024 campaign.\n\"But it's too soon to predict the next election,\" said Aljahmi, whose family operates four restaurants in the Detroit area.\n\"Trump promised a lot,\" he said. \"Okay, you came and showed your face, but I still think it's a mixture. Three years from now, we'll see what they're doing,\" he added.","summary":"It remains unclear if the ceasefire deal will sway skeptical voters as Trump’s Republicans face congressional elections in Michigan and the 2028 presidential election.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/10/11/trumps-arab-american-backers-hail-gaza-deal-but-worry-it-wont-hold","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/59050dc4-qatar.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 11:06:17","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":368294746,"title":"RHOP Star Dr. Wendy Osefo And Husband Eddie Arrested On Fraud Charges In Maryland!","text":"The Real Housewives of Potomac star Dr. Wendy Osefo and her husband Eddie Osefo have been booked on multiple criminal fraud charges in Maryland, according to TMZ. \n\nCourt documents reveal that Wendy faces 16 charges, including seven felonies for allegedly providing false or misleading information in a fraud case involving losses of over $300,000.

However, it’s too early to tell who Thursday night’s debate will end up helping, with both parties claiming victory.\n\nEarle-Sears, who has been lagging in polling, immediately began a one-hour-long fusillade on Spanberger once the debate started.\n\nShe didn’t stop there. She repeatedly hammered Spanberger throughout the debate, prompting the moderators to ask her to stop interrupting.\n\n“I was born in Jamaica, and when I was 10 years old, I saw that kind of political violence, which is why I’m asking my opponent to please ask him to get out of the race. Have some political courage,” Earle-Sears goaded her opponent.\n\nShe also took her Democratic opponent to task over transgender bathroom policies in public schools, access to abortion, and immigration. \n\nSPANBERGER SILENT ON JAY JONES ENDORSEMENT UNDER HEAT FROM EARLE-SEARS IN FIERY VIRGINIA DEBATE\n\nThe stunt won her praise from Republicans. \n\n“Winsome Earle-Sears showed courage, clarity, and conviction – she leads like a marine,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) wrote on X. “While Abigail Spanberger stood with her running mate Jay Jones and his murderous fantasies, and evaded every direct question including equivocating over men being in locker rooms with girls.”\n\n“I think it’s clear that this Jay Jones issue is going to carry right till Election Day, and even the most casual observer has seen that that’s what that debate was about,” Brian Kirwin, a GOP strategist in Virginia, told the Washington Examiner. “And I don’t think Spanberger liked that. She seemed very uncomfortable with the issue.” \n\nThroughout the event at Norfolk State University, Spanberger refused to address Earle-Sears as she blasted Spanberger for not calling on Jones to exit the race. The Democrat continued to face forward silently despite the taunting.\n\nKirwin compared Spanberger’s reaction to Democrat Michael Dukakis’s 1988 debate performance when he was asked whether he would support the death penalty if his wife, Kitty Dukakis, were raped and murdered.\n\n“No, I don’t, Bernard, and I think you know that I’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don’t see any evidence that it’s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime,” Dukakis told CNN’s Bernard Shaw.\n\n“He answered like he was a professor in class, and I saw that in Spanberger,” said Kirwin. “She froze, and no emotion.” \n\nSpanberger did condemn Jones’s texts again during the debate. “The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent. I denounced them when I learned of them, and I will denounce them every opportunity I get,” she said. “As a mother, as a public servant, as a candidate for governor, I denounce them.”\n\nBut she stopped short of calling for him to leave the ticket. Unsurprisingly, the GOP blasted Spanberger over her comments. \n\n“This answer should have been an easy one. Fantasizing about murdering politicians and their children is wrong. Anyone who cannot condemn that is not fit to be governor,” said Delanie Bomar, the Republican National Committee regional communications director, in a statement. \n\nDemocrats, however, blasted Earle-Sears’s constant interruptions during the debate as unwieldy.\n\n“I think Winsome Earle-Sears came off quite immature in a sense,” said Kaivan Shroff, a 2024 delegate for former Vice President Kamala Harris. “She was so combative. And when you’re arguing and fighting the moderator, and you’re not [President] Donald Trump … and it’s a local election where often those moderators are respected by the community, it’s not a good look. And she did it the entire time.”\n\nSome political experts claimed Earle-Sears’s combative persona may play well with Trump, who has not yet endorsed her campaign but has endorsed Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares for reelection.\n\n“Trump does like a fighter, or he says he does, so maybe that was part of her calculation,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. “He does seem to comment on when people are combative like that.” \n\n“I’m not sure that in the end it really did her a lot of favors. My impression was that she had some good attack points. Spanberger didn’t really respond to them, and it was kind of a lost opportunity,” Richards said of Earle-Sears’s performance. “I think Earle-Sears could have pinned Spanberger down and then sort of stepped back and let Spanberger flail. And instead, she just kept on coming and kept on interrupting. And after a while, that became the story instead of Spanberger’s non-answers.”\n\nKirwin suggested Trump would endorse Earle-Sears after the debate. “I think it’s gonna happen,” he said.\n\n“Trump is so in for Jason Miyares against Jay Jones. And I think he’s going to endorse Winsome and make it about Jay Jones and not about Winsome,” he added. “I think he’s going to criticize Abigail for defending Jay Jones, and that’s going to be why she can’t be governor.” \n\nEarly voting had already begun in Virginia when the Jones drama broke, but voters have roughly three more weeks to cast a ballot before election day.\n\nSpanberger’s campaign did find an inroad to lambast Earle-Sears during a disagreement they had on same sex marriage. \n\n“My opponent was asked about her record of discrimination. And importantly, my opponent has previously said that she does not think that gay couples should be allowed to marry,” Spanberger said during the debate. \n\n“That’s not discrimination!” Earle-Sears quipped back. \n\n“Virginia families deserve better than a leader who refuses to protect their rights under the law. The Lieutenant Governor last night showed Virginians that she is more focused on dividing people than solving problems,” Spanberger said in a statement on Friday morning.\n\nSpanberger still has the momentum heading into Election Day as she leads her Republican competitor in polling and fundraising. \n\nBut the Jones drama has overshadowed other key topics in the race, including the government shutdown, reduction-in-force notices, and their effect on the Virginia economy, where federal workers make up a sizable portion of the workforce.\n\n“Abby Spanberger will win. And I’m am voting for her but this COULD have been her own SISTER SOULJA moment that shows Democrats the way to win and she completely blew it,” wrote Michael LaRosa, former press secretary for former first lady Jill Biden. “THIS clip epitomizes the type ‘running scared’ public communication culture that plagues Dem candidates, incumbents, and staffers and VOTERS absolutely hate it and see through it.”\n\nJAY JONES’S VIOLENT TEXT MESSAGES IN VIRGINIA BLEED INTO THE NATIONAL DEBATE\n\n“I don’t think the Jones scandal is going to drag Spanberger down too far, honestly, orreally much at all,” added Shroff. “I think we are in a bit of a post sort of personal scandal environment in politics, obviously largely due to Donald Trump.” \n\n“And then how many people are paying attention to the AG race of all things, compared to the governor’s race? And I do think Spanberger is a much stronger candidate than Earle-Sears,” he continued. “And so, if anything, I think if Jay Jones wins, he owes it to her.”","summary":"Lt. Gov.

Proposition 50, or Prop 50, could add as many as five Democratic-held seats in Congress in time for the 2026 midterms. The measure asks California voters to temporarily allow the legislature to decide the state’s district maps through 2030, after which the power would return to the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission. If Prop 50 wins, it could leave as a few as four Republican-held seats across the state after 2026. Recent polling shows Prop 50 will likely pass. Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Democrats say Prop 50 is a necessary countermeasure to Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas. ABBOTT SIGNS TEXAS REDISTRICTING MAP INTO LAW, SECURING MAJOR GOP VICTORY AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS However, UC Davis Professor Jim Adams warned a win for the Democrats in the short term could have negative long-term consequences. \"I think that even if Prop 50 does help the Democrats win a handful of additional seats in California, by winning the battle in California, the Democrats may make themselves lose the war nationally,\" Adams told Fox. Adams, a Democrat, said he agrees with Prop 50 supporters that he wants to see something done to curb Republican redistricting efforts in other parts of the country. TRUMP-BACKED MAP VICTORY IN MISSOURI COULD TRIGGER REDISTRICTING BATTLES IN THESE STATES \"There is certainly a visceral satisfaction for the Democrats in feeling that Proposition 50 helps them to fight back. I don’t question the Democrats need to fight back. The question is, are they fighting smart with Proposition 50,\" he added. Prop 50 has the potential to spark political backlash, not only within California Republicans or independents in 2026, but on a national scale during the presidential election in 2028. If Prop 50 passes, California’s northern districts risk going from mostly red to completely blue after the midterms. Chico, California, sits in Republican-held District 1, which is represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa. It's one of the districts targeted in Prop 50. The proposed map would likely flip the district by pulling in voters from closer to the more Democrat-leaning Bay Area. In 2024, President Donald Trump won Butte County by about 3,000 votes over then-Vice President Kamala Harris. On the streets of downtown Chico, that political split showed when asking voters their feelings on Prop 50. VOTING UNDERWAY IN 2025 ELECTION THAT MAY DETERMINE IF REPUBLICANS HOLD HOUSE IN 2026 MIDTERMS Don Tarman and Martin Bettencourt both said they support the proposition, adding that it's a reaction to Trump's presidency. \"We agree with Gavin Newsom that Trump is trying to sway the election for the House. He picked up supposedly five votes in Texas. We'll see how the vote comes out when we get to the election. But yeah, we’re not Trump fans. I think Gavin Newsom is trying to fight back a little bit,\" Tarman said. Bettencourt said he doesn't typically support redistricting, but this is \"a different time.\" \"I don’t like redistricting. I think it’s mean to the voters. I think they take away power from them, because they move it around and adjust it,\" he said. \"I think we’re in kind of a different time, so we’re reacting off the top of the ticket, which is the president, and we have to do what we have to do to compensate for that until we get someone better in a position of power.\" Jim Henderson and Eleanor Engelbrecht are among those who don't agree with the proposition – both of them saying that redistricting in California is not an ideal response to the efforts in Texas. \"When say they do it in Iowa, then do we have to have Oregon do the same thing and the next thing you know everything is being gerrymandered? It’s unfortunate the governor of Texas didn’t recognize that this wasn’t an appropriate way of dealing with the elections, but he made his decision, and I don’t think we should feel compelled to say, well, if you’re gonna do it, we’re gonna do it also,\" Henderson said. Engelbrecht said the country is going through enough change and things need to just \"settle.\" \"Right now, we’re going through a lot of change already, and I don’t think this is the time we need to be, I don’t know, dusting and cleaning really. I think that we really need to let things settle.

Trump said that many of the affected employees worked for programs that were “Democrat-oriented” or were “people that the Democrats wanted,” without providing additional detail.The firings mark the first large-scale ouster of federal employees during a funding lapse in modern history, going beyond the furloughs that have characterized past temporary shutdowns. More cuts are under consideration, the government said in the filing. The move ups the stakes in a multi-week standoff with Democrats over federal funding and health-care subsidies.Labor unions representing hundreds of thousands of federal workers asked a judge Friday to immediately halt the mass firings. The emergency request to a federal judge in San Francisco seeks to bar the Office of Management and Budget from ordering officials to carry out the firings and block agencies from issuing reduction-in-force notices before the judge holds a hearing next week. The judge didn’t immediately rule but did move up the hearing by a day to Oct. 15..White House Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the cuts with a terse social media post on Friday. Spokespeople for HHS, DHS, the Department of Education and the Department of Housing and Urban Development confirmed workers at those agencies are among those affected by the firings. Commerce Department workers were also terminated, according to a US official. At the Internal Revenue Service, which sits within the Treasury Department, the administration plans to fire about 1,300 workers, people familiar with the situation said Friday. All staffers in Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund were laid off, according to people familiar with the matter. And the Environmental Protection Agency notified approximately 20 to 30 employees that they may be affected by cuts in the future, though a final decision has not been made, according to the filing.Senate Majority Leader John Thune sought to lay blame for the layoffs at Democrats’ feet.“To their credit, the White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” Thune said Friday before the layoffs were announced. In the days before the announcement, some congressional Republicans urged the White House to hold off, saying it dilutes their message that it’s Republicans who are standing up for federal workers.Susan Collins of Maine, the leader of the Senate’s appropriations panel, became the first Republican to publicly oppose Vought’s moves while still pinning the blame for the shutdown on Democrats.“Arbitrary layoffs result in a lack of sufficient personnel needed to conduct the mission of the agency and to deliver essential programs, and cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country,” Collins said in a statement.Democrats argue that spending money to conduct layoffs in a shutdown is illegal.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sought to cast the firings as an affront against US workers that sows “deliberate chaos.”“Let’s be blunt: nobody’s forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Schumer said in a Friday statement. “They don’t have to do it; they want to.”.More than two-thirds of civilian federal employees have remained on the job this shutdown — either as essential workers or in roles that receive longer-term funding — with the rest being sent home. The vast majority of federal employees go without pay.Federal DownsizingThe latest move is reminiscent of Elon Musk’s efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year to slash the federal workforce. The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer gutted the federal workforce through voluntary resignations, retirements, and targeted firings of probationary employees. About 150,000 of the voluntary departures took effect with the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, but some other staffing reductions have been tied up by court challenges. Friday’s job eliminations mark the latest effort by Trump to make the shutdown as painful as possible for Democratic constituencies while deeming his own priorities as essential services. Hours into the shutdown earlier this month, the Trump administration paused $18 billion in infrastructure spending in New York City, $2 billion for Chicago transit and $8 billion for green energy projects in 16 states — all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.The White House has previously admitted that the DOGE job cuts presented political risks. Trump has mused that Musk’s efforts weren’t politically popular and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said DOGE got its attempt to cut federal spending “backward” by leading with mass terminations, rather than looking to create efficiencies.The tactic gives Trump a chance to talk tough to his MAGA base. He has often derided the federal workforce as being stacked with bureaucrats who he says oppose his agenda. But it also leaves less room for Republicans to blame the most enduring consequences of a shutdown on Democrats. On Capitol Hill, bipartisan talks have continued in fits and starts, with a handful of Democrats crossing party lines to support short-term spending bills. But party leaders remain divided over whether to tie an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies to reopening the government.Democrats warned that Vought’s actions will make an agreement to end the shutdown even more difficult as they further erode trust. Reversing the cuts and layoffs will themselves become Democratic demands as part of any deal to stop the shutdown.","summary":"\"It'll be a lot, and we'll announce the numbers over the next couple of days, but it'll be a lot of people,\" Trump told reporters Friday in the Oval Office.","url":"https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/trump-fires-federal-workers-escalating-us-shutdown-fight","image":"https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint/2025-10-11/c9ymj1fj/441752414.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 02:32:37","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":368181080,"title":"We have to try and get on, says Swinney of Trump","text":"Scotland’s First Minister has said he has “to try and get on” with US President Donald Trump, following a series of meetings this year.\n\nJohn Swinney has met in person with the president on four occasions in recent months – twice during Mr Trump’s visit to Scotland, a third time during his own impromptu visit to Washington, and another during the president’s state visit to Britain in September.\n\nThe discussions focused largely on carving a deal for the Scotch whisky industry in trade talks with the US, but were remarkable for the First Minister’s shift in tone towards Mr Trump.\n\nIn the days before the president’s re-election, Mr Swinney endorsed his opponent Kamala Harris, telling journalists in the Scottish Parliament “I have not come to that conclusion only because Donald Trump is opposed to Scottish independence”.\n\nIn a speech to the SNP conference in 2019 when he was deputy first minister under Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Swinney accused Mr Trump – along with former prime minister Boris Johnson – of choosing “the gutter”, adding: “Their road leads to ruin.”\n\nBut speaking to the PA news agency ahead of his party’s conference in Aberdeen, the First Minister said: “We’re very different types of people. The world is made up of different types of people and we have to try and get on.\n\n“What do we need more of in the world today? It’s probably the ability to get on with each other.”\n\nPut to him there is a difference between sitting down with a political opponent to hash out a deal on the Government’s budget and doing the same with someone who has deployed troops on to the streets of his own country, Mr Swinney said he cannot “second-guess everything that’s going on within the United States”.\n\nAsked if he believes Mr Trump to be a liar, Mr Swinney said: “It has been demonstrated by public comment that there are things that President Trump says that are not based on evidence.”\n\nBut he added: “I’ve got a job to do, which is about protecting, promoting the interests of Scotland.\n\n“If the president of the United States is going to come to Scotland and take an interest in our country, I think it’s an opportunity for me to try to advance the interests of the country, which is what I’ve tried to do.”\n\nWith a Scottish election just months away, Mr Swinney also said he is concerned about the “division and lack of cohesion between communities”.\n\nHe said he has worked “very hard” to bring people together, pointing to his attendance at a synagogue in Edinburgh in the wake of the attack in Manchester last week, as well as a vigil of Jewish people outside Holyrood to commemorate those who died or were kidnapped in the October 7 attack – during which Mr Swinney was heckled.\n\n“I think it’s important that I make myself available to engage with communities in an attempt to try to create the conditions whereby we can continue to live in a peaceful, democratic society, the one that I’ve grown up in all my days, that I cherish, he said.\n\n“I really view that as a precious part of life.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/try-says-swinney-trump-230100012.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YjDZMtLMuufDx5SVY9o5gw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_uk_120/559c76cd3f81f8a57bf98706baa9abe0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 23:01:00","author":"Craig Paton, Pa Scotland Deputy Political Editor","authors":["Craig Paton, Pa Scotland Deputy Political Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":368414918,"title":"Katie Porter pushes back.

The weekday show runs from 6-10 a.m. \n\nMORE: Take a peek inside World of Flight, Nike's new Jordan Brand store in Center City\n\nThe programming change comes days after iHeartMedia laid off talent at stations across the country. The cuts included Power 99 hosts Mikey Dredd and MuthaKnows, who started their \"Rise & Grind Morning Show\" at the station in 2011 after years together hosting \"The Hot Boyz\" show on weeknights. \n\n\"The Breakfast Club,\" which debuted in 2010 on Manhattan's Power 105.1, is hosted by the trio of Charlamagne Tha God, DJ Envy and Jess Hilarious. The show is known for boundary-pushing gossip, entertainment news and high-profile guests that have included former president Barack Obama and former Democratic presidential nominees Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton. \n\nPhilly natives Kevin Hart, Will Smith and Patti LaBelle are among a long list of artists and comedians who have made appearances on the show in years past. \n\n\"The Breakfast Club\" reaches an audience of 6.6 million monthly listeners and has been streamed more than one billion times on its podcast, according to iHeartRadio data. The show now airs in more than 90 markets. Charlamagne and DJ Envy both entered the Radio Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\nIn a statement Friday announcing the move to Power 99, iHeartMedia executive vice president of programming Thea Mitchem called \"The Breakfast Club\" a \"cultural touchstone.\"\n\n\"Its unique blend of candid conversation, humor and insight keeps it as relevant today as ever, shaping culture while giving a platform to voices that matter,\" Mitchem said. \n\nThe hosts of \"The Breakfast Club\" have sometimes been embroiled in public feuds with their guests, including Charlamagne's intervention in a past beef between Philly rappers Meek Mill and Beanie Sigel. In a tense 2016 interview with Sigel, Charlamagne called the rapper a \"hater\" for taking shots at Meek Mill, who also has appeared on the show several times over the years. \n\nMore recently, Meek Mill criticized the show's hosts after they discussed his commentary on the federal sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. During Combs' trial in May, the hosts of \"The Breakfast Club\" brought up past speculation about Meek Mill's relationship with the convicted hip hop mogul. Combs was sentenced last week to spend 50 months in federal prison. \n\nIn a 2023 lawsuit filed against Combs, public court documents contained alleged details about the rapper's infamous parties at his home in the Hamptons. In the court filings, the redacted name of \"a Philadelphia rapper who dated Nicki Minaj\" prompted rumors about Meek Mill's sexual orientation after the lawsuit alleged Combs had sex with the unnamed rapper. Meek Mill dated Minaj about a decade ago. \n\nMeek Mill posted about the trial on social media in May, saying hip-hop blogs had \"amplified an agenda\" against him two years ago. The hosts of \"The Breakfast Club\" later spoke on their show about how Meek Mill's ties to Diddy had largely faded from public discussion by the time of Combs' trial. They wondered why Meek Mill, who has become a well-known advocate for criminal justice reform since serving time in prison, would have bothered to enter the fray again. \n\nMeek Mill responded to becoming a topic on the show in a comment posted on Instagram and later shared on Facebook by DJ Envy. \n\n\"...I been saving communities and helping families 10 plus years,\" Meek Mill wrote. \"We don't follow the world of talkers.\" \n\nThe layoffs at iHeartMedia come in advance of the company's quarterly earnings report, which is around the same time the nation's largest radio station owner made cuts last year. The company underwent restructuring when it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 and has made several rounds of layoffs in recent years. \n\nMikey Dredd and MuthaKnows both posted on social media after learning they had been let go from Power 99. \n\n“After 30 unforgettable years at Power 99, today I say goodbye to a place that became much more than just a job,\" Dredd wrote. \"From nights and mornings on air for 25 years, I’ve had the privilege of connecting not only with an incredible audience but also with friends and colleagues who became family.

Gavin Newsom assured us that the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht, the alleged arsonist who set the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles history, brought “closure” to the “thousands of Californians whose lives were upended.”\n\nHe couldn’t be more wrong.\n\nRinderknecht’s arrest isn’t an end to the January tragedy that killed 12 of my neighbors and wiped out 7,000 Pacific Palisades homes and businesses.\n\nIt is just the beginning of a reckoning for California — and for the nation.\n\nWhy? Because as the investigation and prosecution unfolds, the tentacles of the case will force us to face up to the mess we’ve gotten ourselves into on multiple fronts. \n\nThe devastating Palisades Fire, which blazed out of control for nearly three weeks, was a damning indictment of LA’s irresponsible leadership, with empty reservoirs and a missing mayor.\n\nBut we haven’t yet talked much about the missing firefighters.\n\nAt least 3% of Los Angeles County firefighters lived outside the state as of 2022 — many of them senior commanders.\n\nThey reside in border states like Arizona or Nevada, and even as far away as Florida and Alaska.\n\nThere they can afford to own homes and can send their children to schools that don’t replace math lessons with gender-identity quizzes.\n\nThey fly in to do a 7-to-12-day shift, then fly home for several weeks off.\n\nWho could blame them, given the Golden State’s exorbitant cost of living? \n\nOn the first night of the fires, when the winds turned a fever dream into a nightmare, the county put out an all-hands call for firefighters.\n\nEveryone was asked to report to work as soon as possible, no exceptions.\n\nBut with 3% of the force residing in other states — and hundreds more firefighters living hours away, in Central and Northern California — the investigation may uncover some uncomfortable truths.\n\nHow many of our firefighters were missing in action as Rinderknecht’s fire raged beyond control?\n\nHow many homes burned because they could not take their posts when ordered?\n\nWhy hasn’t Los Angeles set any sort of residency requirement for its emergency personnel, like most other big cities do?\n\nIt’s not just about questionable employment tactics; it’s about the interconnectedness of every terrible progressive idea — which we now know can literally burn down entire neighborhoods.\n\nHow can we expect our first responders to protect us when it counts if they can’t even afford to live here?\n\nHere’s another tentacle: The arsonist is a dual citizen, born and raised in France, who took up residence in the United States as an adult. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has made it his mission to wrestle with our illegal immigration problem, but as the arson arrest makes clear, America is going to need to take a long, hard look at its legal immigration system, too.\n\nRinderknecht’s chaos, the “despair and bitterness” of the rap song he had on repeat, should have been France’s problem, not ours.\n\nAmerica has enough of our own criminals and fringe lunatics. Why was this arsonist here at all?\n\nFinally, the case could make us confront the insidious concern lurking underneath this arrest: the specter of terrorism.\n\nRight now, the arson suspect is being dismissed as a lone wolf, but we’ve seen a concerning uptick in domestic terrorism since Trump was re-elected.\n\nIs there a connection to the deliberate and despicable anti-government chaos we’re seeing today in Portland, Chicago and elsewhere?\n\nWas Rinderknecht inspired by the online hatred that’s fueling violence all around us?\n\nThe accused arsonist was “agitated and angry,” witnesses say, and obsessed with “dystopian” visions.\n\nWhat happened in Los Angeles County in January has a lot of the markers of domestic terrorism — yet another tentacle that could reach out far beyond California.\n\nIf it turns out Rinderknecht had connections to groups like Antifa, this case goes from bad to worse . . . for all of us. \n\nThe arsonist will be held accountable, but his apprehension is not the end of anything. \n\nAll eyes are on California these days, as Newsom dangles his presidential ambitions and Kamala Harris tours the country to remain relevant.\n\nWith the recent epic meltdown of gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter, the rest of America is being treated to the daily insanity we suffer at the hands of both our politicians and our criminals.\n\nThe fires, the fallout and the felonies are part of that larger story — and this state and our nation must now grapple with the consequences.\n\nKira Davis is an independent opinion journalist and podcaster living in Southern California.","summary":"As the prosecution of the alleged arsonist unfolds, the tentacles of the case will force us to face up to the mess Californians have gotten ourselves into.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/10/opinion/la-palisades-firebugs-arrest-isnt-relief-but-a-reckoning/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/JRCAL1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 21:20:49","author":"Kira Davis","authors":["Kira Davis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":368180792,"title":"US senator seeks telecom firms' data on lawmakers from probe of Jan 6 capitol riots - Reuters","text":"CompaniesAT&T IncT-Mobile US IncVerizon Communications Inc\n\nWASHINGTON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn wants the CEOs of AT&T (T.N), opens new tab, Verizon (VZ.N), opens new tab and T-Mobile (TMUS.O), opens new tab to disclose whether they received or objected to subpoenas for phone data from eight U.S. senators related to a probe of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, according to letters seen by Reuters on Friday.\n\nOn Monday, Senate Republicans disclosed a 2023 document that showed the FBI obtained phone data known as \"toll records\" from senators' phones, including Blackburn, tied to the U.S. Justice Department's investigation of the riot.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nShe wants the telecom companies to answer questions including whether they provided \"the cell phone records of their personal devices, their official government devices, or both?\"\n\nSeparately, Republican Senator Bill Hagerty -- who is among the eight lawmakers whose information was seized -- said he had written to Verizon seeking answers about the disclosure of his phone records.\n\nVerizon on Friday told Reuters it had provided the requested customer information and call records.\n\n\"Federal law requires companies like Verizon to respond to grand jury subpoenas,\" Verizon said. \"We received a valid subpoena and a court order to keep it confidential.

(RELATED: San Francisco Opens First-Ever Sober Homeless Shelter, And The Results Are Exactly What You’d Expect)\n\nThe recommendation comes from five senior staffers at the city administrator and controller’s office, the Standard reports, and was sent for consideration to the Commission Streamlining Task Force.\n\n“It’s not clear that having multiple public bodies overseeing homelessness is making the city’s homelessness work more effective,” the report says, according to The Standard.\n\nYou can’t solve “homelessness” if you think of it in those terms. \n\n Last November, Gov. @GavinNewsom cleaned up San Francisco for Chinese President Xi.

It’s a good deal for the nonprofit leaders who earn $350 – $679k/year in salaries to run the city’s program of murdering the mentally ill. pic.twitter.com/KULuHF0TgT — Michael Shellenberger (@shellenberger) July 7, 2025\n\nBaker Places and Positive Resource Center asked San Francisco for millions in emergency funding months after receiving $1.2 million in emergency funding, the Standard reported in October 2022, citing sources inside city hall. \n\nThen there’s the United Council of Human Services, under investigation for alleged mismanagement of funds. San Francisco reportedly wasn’t aware that the homeless nonprofit had its nonprofit status suspended. \n\nSan Francisco was set to spend $1.7 million on a single public toilet, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in Oct. 2022.\n\nThe toilet opened in April 2024, according to NBC Bay Area, and “actually only cost the city around $300,000 after two companies donated materials and installation.”\n\nNevertheless, plenty of San Francisco residents prefer to do their business on public sidewalks.\n\nThe city also shelled out more than $8,500 per park bench, according to the Chronicle. At least those funds came from a donation.\n\nA 2024 statewide audit concluded that two of California’s five homelessness programs were cost-effective. Auditors were “unable to fully assess” the other three programs because California “has not collected sufficient data on the programs’ outcomes.”\n\nCalifornia allocated $24 billion for “homelessness and housing” from 2018-19 through 2022-23, according to the report. \n\nHey, who hasn’t lost a billion or two between the couch cushions?\n\nCalifornia funds Continuums of Care (CoCs), public and private organizations which are “charged with promoting and implementing evidence-based, best, promising, and emerging practices for preventing and ending homelessness.” \n\n“In multiple CoCs statewide we found a small number of likely fictitious clients,” auditors reported.\n\n“We identified more than 100 enrollment records with client names such as ‘Mickey Mouse,’ ‘Super Woman,’ or a name indicating it was a test client, such as ‘Test Participant.’”\n\nPoor Mickey.

When the talks between Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza were brought up, she interrupted and challenged the network to take charge of the story. She “came in hot,” the source said, suggesting names to book on the air—including Mike Pompeo, Hillary Clinton, and Antony Blinken—and offering to reach out to people herself if they hadn’t been contacted already. “I’m not sure she realizes we have an entire booking team that works through all of this,” the source said. “It was very clear right away that she doesn’t quite understand how things work.” After Weiss proposed getting in touch with Pompeo, top producer Jenna Gibson told her that he was a Fox News contributor and could not appear on CBS News.\nGrowing pains are to be expected for Weiss, a successful and charismatic operator who nonetheless has no experience running a TV news network, much less a newsroom as large as the one at CBS News. After the call, Weiss returned to her office, outside of which stood two burly private security guards. Later on Thursday, she had lunch with Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan and met with other correspondents. Earlier in the week, she lunched with O’Donnell. There was a dual purpose for her trip down to DC: On Wednesday night, she hosted an event for the website she cofounded just four years ago, The Free Press, which Paramount, under the new ownership of David Ellison, acquired for a reported $150 million in a deal that led to her installation as the top editor of CBS News.\nWeiss’s first week on the job offered glimpses into what kind of editor she’ll be at CBS, a lingering question that has been a source of endless speculation inside the network.\nWill she be the Bari Weiss who cofounded The Free Press, the popular but polarizing website known for assailing the liberal pieties of traditional media institutions like CBS News? The polemicist who began her career in the public eye with a crusade against university professors critical of Israel?\nOr will she bring some much-needed innovation to a nearly century-old news network, streamlining operations that insiders describe as antiquated and instilling fresh energy in a network whose flagship evening newscast is mired in third place in the ratings—while leaning on an experience with which she has undoubtedly had success: building up a robust, paying, and relatively young audience online?\nStaffers at 60 Minutes, the network’s iconic newsmagazine program, are anxiously waiting to find out. “Fair to say everyone here, from top down, is on edge,” said the staffer in the DC bureau. “There were a lot of jokes about loyalty tests on Monday morning.” They’re mostly keeping quiet, biting their tongues, and avoiding leaks as media reporters frantically hit the phones with questions about this uncertain new era at CBS.\n“Let’s do the fucking news,” is how Weiss signed off when she spoke to CBS News staffers for the first time on Tuesday, a cringe-inducing rallying cry perhaps better suited for a start-up like The Free Press than the venerable employer of Lesley Stahl.\nYet Weiss has given some staffers reason for optimism. “The mood right now is a lot different than if you had asked me 48 hours ago,” said one current CBS producer on Tuesday night. “People like her enthusiasm.” The memo she wrote introducing herself to staff also hit the right notes. Upholding the “journalistic values” she identified, said a former CBS producer who worked for decades at 60 Minutes, is “what 60 Minutes has been trying to do for 58 years.”\nWeiss, the current producer added, seems thus far “impressed” by the might of the CBS newsroom, suggesting that the worst fears about how she would approach the job are so far assuaged. Those fears are that this legacy-media apostate—who, after quitting The New York Times in dramatic fashion, launched a website premised on the notion that institutions like the Times and CBS are hotbeds of woke politics—might seek to gut CBS from the inside and reorient its coverage to appease the right.\nInstead, Weiss has emphasized in several meetings that she understands the true problems facing CBS News, pertaining less to its editorial direction and more to the future viability of its business model. “She’s mentioned in a couple of meetings that she wants to focus first on digital and social strategy,” the current producer said. “Which is smart.”\n“But the proof is not in what you say to the troops on opening day,” said the former CBS producer. “The proof is how you lead the troops during difficult times.”\nHer position at CBS News is an unusual one. Not only is “editor in chief” a new job at the outlet, but Weiss will report directly to Paramount boss Ellison, while Tom Cibrowski, the president of CBS News, reports to Paramount television head George Cheeks, who also reports to Ellison, as does Paramount president Jeff Shell.\nWhy Weiss will report directly to the boss of her outlet’s parent company has been a point of confusion among CBS staff.\nOne source with knowledge of the negotiations between Weiss and Ellison explained: “That’s easy. She made it a condition of the acquisition. She doesn’t want anyone meddling in editorial decisions other than the owner.” (Vanity Fair has reached out to Paramount for comment. A spokesperson for The Free Press declined to comment.)\nIn that sense, you can see Weiss’s role as that of editorial monarch, operating outside the org chart and accountable only to Ellison, while Cibrowski handles the gritty and unglamorous business of managing a network bracing for reported layoffs in the coming weeks as the newly merged Paramount Skydance looks to cut costs and consolidate resources. (Representatives for Paramount did not provide comment to several outlets that reported on the expected layoffs.)\nWhile the charm offensive may be working for now, sources cautioned that it shouldn’t be expected to last. “At no point has Bari Weiss ever had a light touch, socially or professionally,” said the source with knowledge of the deal negotiations. “The woman commands every room she enters.”\nOn Friday morning, Weiss sent an email to CBS News staff requesting a “memo from each person across our news organization” outlining “how you spend your working hours,” as well as “your views on what’s working; what’s broken or substandard; and how we can be better.”\nIn a conclusion seen internally as somewhat ominous, Weiss wrote that she wanted to “familiarize” herself with the staff “to know that we are aligned on achieving a shared vision for CBS News.”\nIn addition to taking the top editorial job at CBS News, Weiss will retain her titles of CEO and editor in chief of The Free Press. There will no doubt be friction between those two roles, not least because the latter outlet is a hard-charging commentary site that has frequently attacked the former. (A sampling: “How Is CBS Marking October 7? By Admonishing Tony Dokoupil”; “Does CBS News Know Where Jerusalem Is?”; “The Fallout at CBS Continues: At the home of Walter Cronkite, journalists debate Israel’s existence.”) Weiss has repeatedly emphasized in meetings with staffers that restoring “trust” in the media is a guiding principle. That mission will certainly be complicated by her side gig as the editor of a commentary site often seen as partisan, though the website will, according to a press release, “maintain its own independent brand and operations.”\nThe night before meeting with staff in the Washington bureau on Thursday, Weiss hosted a Free Press event at which she interviewed Palmer Luckey, the young Oculus founder who went on to launch defense-tech company Anduril. Luckey, who has claimed he was fired from Facebook over his support for Donald Trump, has also described himself as a “radical Zionist.” (Facebook has denied Luckey’s claim, with a spokesperson saying: “We can say unequivocally that Palmer's departure was not due to his political views.”) A number of CBS News stars attended the event, including senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang and political director Fin Gómez.\nAmid roiling anxieties about what the future holds under Ellison’s CBS, insiders hope both he and Weiss keep their hands off 60 Minutes, the vaunted Sunday news program that remains, in its 58th season, the crown jewel of the so-called Tiffany Network. “There’s nothing to fix at 60,” said the former producer who spent decades at the show. “And I think she’ll see that.” (Its latest season debuted to an impressive 10 million viewers, some four times the average prime-time audience for Fox News.)\nThat Weiss will let 60 be 60 might be wishful thinking. She is expected to be deeply involved in its programming—particularly when it comes to coverage of Trump’s administration, a fraught subject for the network, and the war in Gaza, a story of particular interest to Ellison and Weiss, both of whom are strong supporters of Israel.\nThe chief concern among those who see Weiss’s appointment as either a way to appease the Trump administration or an effort to instill coverage more supportive of Israel is that she will use her power to neuter coverage of those subjects. Both are fraught for the network: A 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris sparked a spurious Trump lawsuit, which CBS parent Paramount settled to the tune of $16 million ahead of its merger with Skydance, in an agreement House Democrats have denounced as a “bribe” to achieve regulatory approval. A January 2025 segment on atrocities in Gaza and US involvement in the war drew a rebuke from then Paramount chief Shari Redstone and prompted CBS to appoint a minder for 60 Minutes, eventually leading to the resignation of executive producer Bill Owens, who cited an inability to make “independent decisions.”\nEllison and his father, billionaire Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, are both staunch supporters of Israel. Weiss, who once said she “happily agreed” with being called a “Zionist fanatic” and whose site this summer published a widely criticized piece nitpicking cases of starvation in Gaza, has her own opinions about how the press should cover the Middle East. (When asked about the Free Press reporting on Gaza starvation, the former 60 Minutes producer sighed. “Isn’t that a sad thing to try to be debating the fine points of?” he asked. “That is pitiful.”)\nThose biases could set up a clash down the road between Weiss and 60 Minutes. One source pointed out that star correspondent Scott Pelley signed a new multiyear contract last year, saying that the deal gives him leverage to hold his ground should a conflict with Weiss come to a head, and adding that veteran Stahl is in a similar position to push back.\n“If their stuff starts getting censored or preempted or tabled or pushed, then all bets are off,” said one CBS staffer. Installing her own team in the standards and practices department could be a way that Weiss—and, by proxy, Ellison—plans to influence coverage in a manner more subtle and insidious than outright spiking stories or installing new producers.\nSixty Minutes is in good hands with executive producer Tanya Simon, a highly regarded journalist who served as executive editor of the newsmagazine for six seasons before ascending to the top job. Staffers there hope that she will stand firm against any undue interference or political pressure, acting as a buffer between the show and network leadership in the same way Owens tried to.\nWeiss may find there’s little to fix. Despite complaints from the right, the average episode of 60 Minutes is a remarkably moderate production. “Has anybody actually watched it?” joked a former CBS News executive. “If there’s a problem with it, it’s that it’s too inoffensive! It’s not taking any chances.”\nIn that sense, it might not be a conflict over coverage that ends up being Weiss’s first real test. The first hurdle for Weiss may very well be a president so intolerant of coverage that falls short of hagiography that he regularly takes Fox News to task.\nTrump has signaled openness to this new iteration of CBS News. With the president having vanquished CBS in his fight over the Harris interview, emerging with $16 million for his legal costs and future presidential library, his White House is reportedly now in talks with 60 Minutes about a sit-down interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker.\nWeiss has yet to signal how she might be involved with such a high-stakes interview. For now, the dozens of staff members who make up the workforce of 60 Minutes can only wait and see how their coverage will be handled, and which stories on the upcoming slate will trigger an intervention. I’m told there are few stories in the works that could generate controversy; the first two episodes of the season barely mentioned Trump. Still, anxieties persist.\n“It’s natural to be scared of something or someone that you don’t understand and you don’t know,” said the former 60 Minutes producer. “The fear of the unknown is one of the great fears in the human heart.”\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that George Cheeks reports to Jeff Shell; he reports to David Ellison.","summary":"As the Free Press cofounder takes the helm at CBS News, all eyes are on its preeminent newsmagazine—inside and outside the building.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/bari-weiss-gets-to-work-at-cbs","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68e81ec2ac22ea6851f8b406/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf1025-bari-weiss.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 19:31:59","author":"Aidan McLaughlin","authors":["Aidan McLaughlin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.111},{"id":368127516,"title":"The lyrics to Taylor Swift's song 'Elizabeth Taylor' pay homage to the starlet's life and scandals. Here are the details you missed.","text":"Taylor Swift&apos;s \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is sprinkled with nods to her fiancé&comma; her family&comma; and&comma; of course&comma; her adversaries — but the album&apos;s most overt homage is to a Hollywood icon with no apparent personal connection to the author.The second song on \"Showgirl\" is named \"Elizabeth Taylor\" after the famous actor&comma; who died in 2011 at 79 of congestive heart failure. Taylor became a box-office sensation in the &apos;50s and is often cited as the highest-paid movie star of the &apos;60s&comma; largely thanks to a historic multi-million payday for 1963&apos;s \"Cleopatra.\"Today&comma; Swift is likewise renowned as a commercial force; last year&comma; the Eras Tour became the first to gross over $2 billion&comma; and \"Showgirl\" just scored the biggest album sales week in history.The two women also share a knack for captivating critics&comma; casual onlookers&comma; and tabloids with their romantic exploits. Taylor&apos;s name is synonymous with her eight marriages and seven husbands&comma; which earned her a reputation as a dangerous seductress. The producers and distributors of \"Cleopatra\" even sued Taylor and her costar-turned-husband&comma; Richard Burton&comma; for \"depreciating the commercial value of the movie by their &apos;scandalous&apos; conduct&comma;\" The New York Times reported. (Both Taylor and Burton were married to other people when they began filming.)Swift has sparked similar moral outrage and mockery for her \"string of high-profile romances\" and \"super intense relationship patterns.\" Swift has repeatedly rejected this narrative: While promoting her 2017 album \"Reputation&comma;\" she observed that analysis of her music is often reduced to a \"paternity test.\"\"My mistakes have been used against me&comma; my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment&comma; and my songwriting has been trivialized as &apos;oversharing&comma;&apos;\" Swift wrote.Taylor&apos;s son&comma; Chris Wilding&comma; even said in an interview last year that he admires Swift&apos;s defiance&comma; specifically citing Swift&apos;s endorsement of Kamala Harris for president&comma; which she signed&comma; \"Childless Cat Lady.\"\"Huge props to her&comma;\" Wilding told The Guardian. \"That reminds me a little bit of the same spirit my mom had.\"In a clip from \"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl&comma;\" a theatrical event paired with the album&apos;s release&comma; Swift said \"Elizabeth Taylor\" explores themes of love&comma; notoriety&comma; and anxiety.Swift also said the lyrics are woven with biographical details about Taylor&comma; \"but the feelings of what it conveys are things that I&apos;ve absolutely experienced.\"Indeed&comma; Swift sings to open the song&comma; \"Elizabeth Taylor&comma; do you think it&apos;s forever?\" She uses the starlet&apos;s name to evoke a sense of public scrutiny&comma; posing a question like a cynical reporter (or&comma; in Swift&apos;s case&comma; a gossip blogger). The lyric reads like an attention-grabbing headline.During an interview with Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show&comma;\" Swift described Taylor as a role model for handling \"immense pressure\" and scrutiny.\"She kept making more and more daring art&comma;\" Swift said. \"It&apos;s almost like the more polarizing people were about her&comma; the more she just kept doing even more challenging roles&comma; taking bigger risks.\"Swift added that she admired how Taylor continued working diligently at the height of her fame and used humor to deflect attention from her detractors.\"I&apos;ve done that with songs like &apos;Blank Space&comma;&apos;\" Swift said&comma; referring to the No. 1 hit single she wrote as a satire of her serial-dater reputation. \"I think you have to be able to combat negativity with humor.\"In the first verse of \"Elizabeth Taylor&comma;\" Swift sings&comma; \"That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée.\"According to Taylor&apos;s website&comma; which is run by the trustees of her estate&comma; Burton proposed to her in Portofino&comma; Italy&comma; in 1964&comma; on a \"wisteria-covered balcony\" at the Hotel Splendido. Taylor&apos;s website also states that she and Burton lived at the Hôtel Plaza Athénée in Paris for six months in 1971.For her part&comma; Swift was in Paris in May of last year&comma; when she performed four shows at the La Défense Arena. Swift previously revealed that she wrote and recorded \"Showgirl\" during her downtime on the European leg of the Eras Tour — so it&apos;s possible these lyrics were inspired by that stopover.The reference also suggests that Swift was daydreaming about a romantic engagement&comma; à la Burton&apos;s proposal to Taylor&comma; over a year before Kelce proposed in Missouri.In the song&apos;s hook&comma; Swift sings&comma; \"If your letters ever said&comma; &apos;Goodbye&apos; &sol; I&apos;d cry my eyes violet&comma; Elizabeth Taylor.\"Taylor was known for her striking eyes&comma; which came across as blueish-purple onscreen.In the second verse&comma; Swift sings&comma; \"We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank&apos;s &sol; They say I&apos;m bad news&comma; I just say&comma; &apos;Thanks.&apos;\"This lyric nods to a Hollywood hot spot&comma; Musso & Frank Grill&comma; which Taylor reportedly frequented in the &apos;50s. It also nods to Taylor&apos;s reputation&comma; both as an outspoken woman in a male-dominated industry and as a serial heartbreaker — in short&comma; as \"bad news.\"Confronted with the same accusation&comma; Swift&apos;s semi-autobiographical narrator responds with dry sarcasm.Like many of the tracks on \"Showgirl&comma;\" \"Elizabeth Taylor\" is ostensibly a love song.Swift has frequently expressed anxiety about making love last&comma; as in 2019&apos;s \"The Archer\" (\"Who could ever leave me&comma; darling&comma; but who could stay?\")&comma; 2020&apos;s \"Peace\" (\"Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?\")&comma; and 2024&apos;s \"The Prophecy\" (\"I&apos;m so afraid I sealed my fate&comma; no sign of soulmates\").Swift&apos;s romantic anxiety is reinforced by her past experiences with dating in the public eye&comma; as she observes in the first verse of \"Elizabeth Taylor\" (\"All the right guys promised they&apos;d stay &sol; Under bright lights&comma; they withered away\").However&comma; in the song&apos;s bridge&comma; Swift takes pride in the body of work she has built off those disappointments: \"All my white diamonds and lovers are forever &sol; In the papers&comma; on the screen&comma; and in their minds.\"Not only is this a reference to Taylor&apos;s famous collection of jewels and her signature fragrance&comma; \"White Diamonds&comma;\" but Swift seems to compare her own songs to precious gems or historical artifacts. Swift&apos;s lovers and experiences are immortalized in her discography&comma; much like the enduring legacy of Taylor&apos;s filmography.Swift previously referenced Taylor in \"…Ready For It?\" in 2017. The opening track on \"Reputation\" is about the thrills and fantasies sparked by a budding romance.\"He can be my jailer&comma; Burton to this Taylor &sol; Every love I&apos;ve known in comparison is a failure&comma;\" Swift sings. \"I forget their names now &sol; I&apos;m so very tame now &sol; Never be the same now.\"Taylor was famously married twice to Burton. As husband and wife&comma; they costarred in classic films like \"Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966) and \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1967).In keeping with the core theme of Swift&apos;s sixth album \"Reputation\" — love and tenderness coexisting with scandal and notoriety — Wilding told The Guardian that his mother was the \"dominant figure\" in her relationship with Burton: \"He&apos;s sitting there quietly&comma; and she&apos;s protecting him&comma; fending off reporters and taking charge.\"Wilding also said he never questioned his mother&apos;s cycle of marriage and divorce&comma; despite the media frenzy it inspired.\"It seemed normal&comma;\" Wilding said. \"She was the anchor and the constant factor.\"","summary":"Taylor Swift's new album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" features the song \"Elizabeth Taylor.\" Here's a guide to the song's lyrics and their meaning.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-elizabeth-taylor-song-lyrics-explained-2025-10","image":"https://i.insider.com/68e7dadd1c1f80efbec5450c?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 19:01:47","author":"Callie Ahlgrim","authors":["Callie Ahlgrim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.234}]}
