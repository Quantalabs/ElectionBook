Published reports said that CBS' parent company, Paramount, has been talking to Trump's lawyers about a settlement.\n\nThe network said Friday that it was compelled by Brendan Carr, Trump's appointee as FCC chairman, to turn over the transcripts and camera feeds of the interview for a parallel investigation by the commission. “60 Minutes” has resisted releasing transcripts for this and all of its interviews, to avoid second-guessing of its editing process.\n\nThe case, particularly a potential settlement, is being closely watched by advocates for press freedom and by journalists within CBS, whose lawyers called Trump's lawsuit “completely without merit” and promised to vigorously fight it after it was filed.\n\nThe Harris interview initially drew attention because CBS News showed Harris giving completely different responses to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker in clips that were aired on “Face the Nation” on Oct. 6 and the next night on “60 Minutes.” The network said each clip came from a lengthy response by Harris to Whitaker's question, but they were edited to fit time constraints on both broadcasts.\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in Texas on Nov. 1, Trump charged it was deceptive editing designed to benefit Harris and constituted “partisan and unlawful acts of voter interference.”\n\nTrump, who turned down a request to be interviewed by “60 Minutes” during the campaign, has continued his fight despite winning the election less than a week after the lawsuit was filed.\n\nThe network has not commented on talks about a potential settlement, reported by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Paramount executives are seeking Trump administration approval of a sale of the company to another entertainment firm, Skydance.\n\nABC News in December settled a defamation lawsuit by Trump over statements made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, agreeing to pay $15 million toward Trump's presidential library rather than engage in a public fight. Meta has reportedly paid $25 million to settle Trump's lawsuit against the company over its decision to suspend his social media accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

The Democratic Party has been engaged in a long period of introspection after former-Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to President Donald Trump in November. Now, with the DNC choosing a new chair on Saturday, Harrison reflected on the past campaign as he spoke to the Associated Press. One key aspect he noted to the AP was that Harris would have had a better chance to win if she had more time because the party had been so oriented towards \"building a race\" for Biden up to the last minute. Even after Biden's disastrous debate performance, Harrison was still \"riding with Biden\" and seemed surprised when the former president dropped out. TIM WALZ ADMITS HE WAS SURPRISED BY ELECTION DEFEAT: ‘THOUGHT THE COUNTRY WAS READY’ \"I went into this thinking, OK, you’ve got probably the most successful of my lifetime legislative president who has poured tons of money into making sure that … Democrats get elected,\" Harrison said, raving about how people said Biden's 2024 address \"was one of the best State of the Unions that we’ve ever seen.\" \"Then we move forward to the debate, and people were like, that was a horrible debate performance. And then my thought was: ‘Joe Biden secured the nomination. The primary was done, and so, I’m a loyal guy. We’re riding with Biden,’\" he said. When asked if Democrats should have stuck with Biden in the presidential race, he argued that it was in his nature to do so, but the party had other plans. \"That’s my normal default, is that you stick by your people, right, particularly people who have worked hard on behalf of the party,\" he said. \"And that is not always the mentality of everybody in my party. And so sometimes, people look on the sidelines, ready to call in the backup.\" Harrison contrasted how Democrats panicked about Biden while Republicans circled their wagons around Trump despite his controversies, suggesting, \"sometimes, I think, Democrats can learn something in terms of, let’s put a line of defense around our folks and defend them as well.\" Harrison seemed unprepared for Biden to drop out, having just a small group of staffers gaming out what would happen ahead of time, then making calls to Democratic leaders after the news to get a sense of how the party should move forward, only to find Harris had already beat him to it and wrapped up their support. \"And so I started making phone calls just asking, ‘I’m sure you’ve heard the news about the president,’ and to a person, they’re saying, ‘I just got off the phone with the vice president, and I’m pledging my support.’ I must have been chasing her calls, because literally, I’m calling, and everyone said, ‘Well, I’m supporting her,’\" he said. TIM WALZ THOUGHT HIS LACK OF WEALTH WAS ‘REAL FLEX’ AGAINST TRUMP: ‘HOW… DID WE LOSE TO A BILLIONAIRE?’ Now, observing the aftermath, Harrison said, \"The DNC shouldn’t just be a rubber stamp to whatever the campaign wants.\" \"You don’t always have a seat at the table, in terms of, you take all of the arrows and the responsibility,\" he said. \"People want to give you all the blame, but you don’t have the power to make those decisions, and I really think there needs to be reapportionment of a better, a greater balance.\" After the interview was released, Harrison objected to the headline, which read, \"The DNC’s outgoing chair says Democrats should have stuck with Joe Biden in 2024.\" \"This headline isn't right. Stuck ‘by’ and stuck ‘with’ are two different things,\" he argued in a post on X. \"Yes, I believed we should have stuck by and defended President Joe Biden when he was our nominee, and at the same time when Joe Biden stepped down I was damn proud to fight for Vice President Harris to be our next POTUS.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When reached for comment, the AP said it stood by the headline.","summary":"Jaime Harrison, the outgoing chair of the DNC, said that his nature was ultimately to stand by President Biden, but the party ultimately had other plans.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/outgoing-dnc-chair-says-democrats-should-have-stuck-by-biden-2024-election","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/12/931/523/dnc-chairman-jaime-harrison-president-joe-biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 23:04:13","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":285876832,"title":"Trump Order Leaves Energy Project in NYC's Only Red Borough in Limbo","text":"The future of a wind energy project in Staten Island, the only Republican-majority borough in New York City, is unclear after President Donald Trump issued an executive order halting permitting on wind projects.Newsweek has reached out to the White House for comment via email.Why It MattersUpon reentering the White House earlier this month, Trump moved quickly to refocus U.S. investments on oil and gas production, shifting course from the Biden administration, which favored green energy like solar and wind. Trump signed an executive order halting permitting of wind projects.Critics say Trump's energy policies will accelerate climate change, which many scientists say poses a major threat to people across the globe. Proponents of oil and gas, however, point to economic factors, saying it's more efficient and cheaper than alternate sources.Arthur Kill Terminal (AKT) in Staten Island, which was projected to bring hundreds of jobs to the borough, is one project with a less certain future following the executive order.What to KnowThe project was set to bring offshore wind turbines to Staten Island, the city's only borough Trump won in the 2024 presidential race. Construction was set to begin this year, supplying about 750 jobs. Atlantic Offshore Terminals describes the project as an \"offshore wind staging and assembly port\" that would be an \"essential part of the infrastructure that will bring offshore wind energy to New York and the region.\"However, its future has been called into question after Trump's order, according to a Thursday report from the Staten Island Advance, which wrote the project now has a \"progressively lower\" chance of being built.The project has received bipartisan support from local officials who view it as an economic boon to the borough.Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for Representative Nicole Malliotakis, the Republican who represents Staten Island in Congress, told the newspaper that the congresswoman was planning to meet with developers behind the project and that the impact on the project remained unknown as of Thursday.\"This executive order puts a pause on issuing new permits and leases and calls for the incoming interior secretary to review wind permitting practices. We still do not know the impact this will have on Staten Island's project but the congresswoman will be meeting with Arthur Kill Terminal operators,\" Baldassarre said.Trump easily carried Staten Island with 64 percent of the vote in last year's election against then-Vice President Kamala Harris. His next best borough was Queens where he won only 37 percent support, a notable rise from 2020 when he only won 27 percent.New York was among the states that saw the largest shifts toward Trump last year, and Republicans are hoping to duplicate those trends over the next few election cycles to make the Empire State more competitive.The executive order signed by Trump, a longtime opponent of wind energy, doesn't necessarily ban all wind construction. It requires a temporary pause on permitting to allow Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to review projects. The former North Dakota governor will look at questions surrounding economic and environmental factors.Still, Trump has indicated support for ending wind energy projects, telling reporters during a January 7 press conference that \"we're going to try and have a policy where no windmills are being built.\"What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity last week: \"We don't want windmills in this country. We're putting an order on it, we've already sort of done it. We don't want windmills. If you've got a house, and your house is in vision of a windmill, your house is worth half. It's a disaster. Nobody wants them, and they're the most expensive energy of any kind of energy.Former Interior Deb Haaland previously told Newsweek about the president's promise to halt future offshore wind projects:\"Quite frankly, I'd like to see him try. That ship has sailed. I think that offshore wind is here to stay.\"What Happens NextProjects across the country are in question following Trump's order, which may have a chilling effect on the wind energy sector.","summary":"The Arthur Kill Terminal is among the projects that could be affected by Trump's order on wind projects.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-order-leaves-staten-island-energy-borough-limbo-2024478","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2578710/wind-project-new-york-limbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 22:44:37","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":285884300,"title":"FCC wants ‘60 Minutes’ to hand over Harris interview transcripts, footage as it reviews Paramount-Skydance merger","text":"The Federal Communications Commission has requested that CBS-parent Paramount Global turn over footage and transcripts from a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris — as part of its review of the company’s planned merger with Skydance Media, according to a report Friday.\n\nCBS News said it is working to comply with the FCC’s request for the “full, unedited transcript and camera feeds from our interview with Vice President Harris which aired on October 7, 2024,” according to a statement given to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.\n\nReps for the network did not respond to inquiries on when it intends to hand over the material. \n\nThe infamous interview led Donald Trump to file a $10 billion lawsuit, alleging the Tiffany Network “deceptively” edited the sit-down to make his presidential opponent look better just before the election.\n\nPreviously, CBS had said it aired a more succinct version of Harris’ answer to a question about Israel on “60 Minutes” than the one shown during a promo on “Face the Nation” the day before — and called the allegations meritless.\n\nBut Trump-appointed FCC chairman Brendan Carr has made it clear in recent weeks about wanting to see the unedited transcripts ahead of the agency’s review of Paramount’s $8 billion merger with Skydance. \n\nThe FCC can throw a wrench into the deal because it involves the transfer of broadcast television licenses held by CBS local stations.\n\nCarr has been vocal about examining accusations of bias by legacy media and that it could impact the deal.\n\nIn an interview in November, he cited a news-distortion lawsuit against CBS filed by the Center for American Rights as an element he would consider. \n\nThe FCC’s involvement comes after reports that Paramount is in talks to settle Trump’s lawsuit, which has led to anger at CBS among the rank-and-file. Staffers are fuming that a payout could have negative ramifications for press freedom. Legal experts have also dismissed the lawsuit as baseless.\n\nNevertheless, Shari Redstone, the 70-year-old daughter of the late media mogul Sumner Redstone, is believed to be eager to put the legal saga behind her in order to boost the odds that Trump administration regulators will rubber-stamp the merger, according to the New York Times.\n\nRedstone controls Paramount through her stake in National Amusements, which she plans to sell to Skydance for a reported $1.75 billion. \n\nCBS’ possible capitulation in the lawsuit lodged by Trump would come after the Walt Disney Company reached a settlement over a defamation lawsuit in December related to comments made by ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, who incorrectly stated that Trump had been found liable for rape in the E. Jean Carroll case, rather than sexual assault.\n\nTo resolve the matter, Disney reportedly agreed to donate $15 million toward Trump’s presidential library and cover $1 million in legal fees.\n\nSimilarly, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, settled a lawsuit with Trump after banning his accounts in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nThe agreement included a $25 million payment, with $22 million earmarked for Trump’s future library.","summary":"The infamous interview led Donald Trump to file a $10 billion lawsuit.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/media/fcc-wants-60-minutes-to-hand-over-harris-interview-transcripts-footage-as-it-reviews-paramount-skydance-merger/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/97681794.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 22:41:03","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":285873934,"title":"CBS Promises to Give FCC a Copy of the Transcript from Kamala Harris’ ’60 Minutes’ Interview","text":"CBS said that it will comply with an FCC letter of inquiry that it provide an unedited transcript of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nThe interview, which aired in the final weeks of the presidential election in October, did not involve Donald Trump. But in the segment, Harris gave a different answer to a question than the one that aired during a promo on Face The Nation. Trump, claiming that the network was intentionally editing the interview to help Harris, called for the network to lose its broadcast licenses and for him to file a $10 billion lawsuit.\n\nCBS News said that 60 Minutes and Face the Nation merely used different parts of the answer to the same question, with the edits due to time constraints. They denied that there was any deception taking place, but a conservative group, the Center for American Rights, filed a complaint with the FCC.\n\nCBS News said in a statement, “Late Wednesday, CBS News was sent a Letter of Inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission asking for the full, unedited transcript and camera feeds from our interview with Vice President Harris which aired on October 7, 2024. We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do.” The New York Times first reported on the FCC letter.\n\nFCC Chairman Brendan Carr, appointed by Trump, has given credence to the complaint under the agency’s “news distortion” policy, a rarely enforced policy designed to sanction stations who have been proven to have “deliberately distorted a factual news report.” But the agency also notes in its guidelines that its authority is narrow, and that it is “prohibited by law from engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press.”\n\nSeparately, Trump sued the network in October under Texas’ Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which generally is aimed at false advertising. He claimed that the 60 Minutes interview edits — a rather standard practice in the business — cost him billions of dollars in damages. The network has contended that its news decisions are fully protected by the First Amendment, and a number of legal observers see the lawsuit as frivolous.\n\nYet as Skydance seeks FCC approval for its acquisition of Paramount Global, sources say that there have been talks with the Trump team about settling the case, potentially removing an impediment to regulatory approval.\n\nCarr has said that the 60 Minutes complaint was “likely to arise” as part of the review of the transaction. A spokesperson for Carr did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAnna Gomez, one of two Democratic FCC commissioners, said in a statement that the FCC inquiry was “a retaliatory move by the government against broadcasters whose content or coverage is perceived to be unfavorable. It is designed to instill fear in broadcast stations and influence a network’s editorial decisions.”\n\nShe added, “The Communications Act clearly prohibits the Commission from censoring broadcasters and the First Amendment protects journalistic decisions against government intimidation.

Katy Perry brought the Intuit Dome to their feet with resilient hits like “Roar” and SoCal anthem “California Girls.” And Lady Gaga concluded the show with an original song for fire victims.\n\nThe concert featured heartfelt stories from fire victims, including one blind Altadena boy and his mother whose house is now ashes, a 16-year-old girl who rode her horse through Topanga Canyon to safely evacuate and a son who carried his disabled mother to safety before their condo burned down. \n\nStevie Nicks paused her set to deliver speech about her own Palisades community, her neighbors and her 1938 wooden house that survived.\n\nBetween thrilling performances by music legends, video packages that depicted the devastation and destruction and first-hand accounts encouraged viewers at home and in-person to donate. An estimate of total money raised was not available at the time of writing.\n\nEvery penny of money raised from the FireAid benefit concert will pour directly into the Annenberg Foundation to be distributed for short-term relief efforts and long-term initiatives to prevent future fire disasters throughout Southern California. \n\nPlenty of fire victims and first responders were all among the attendees of Thursday night’s mammoth show.\n\nKikka Hanazawa lost her Palisades home in the fires and was eager to bring her friends and neighbors to the FireAid Benefit Concert. The co-founder of Fashion Girls for Humanity gathered a group of 18, all of whose homes were burned down in the Palisades fires, and loaded a party bus for the concert. She spearheaded the charge, acquiring tickets for everyone and their children with the help of some of her work colleagues. \n\n“This is the first night where we’re eating outside of the home,” she told TheWrap as she dined in the club level of the Intuit Dome.\n\nHer striped dress and tweed coat felt a little dressy for the event, she said, but it was all she had. The dress was at the dry cleaners outside of the fire zone and survived unlike the rest of the fashion entrepreneur’s closet. \n\nHanazawa, who happens to be next-door neighbors with rock legend and FireAid performer Stevie Nicks, said she hosed down the “Landslide” singer’s hillside before evacuating just two weeks ago. \n\nBetween the group of 18, seven or eight houses did not survive. Several of the group’s members are parents and brought their kids with them to the Intuit Dome concert.\n\n“My kids are nomads right now,” Hanazawa said, as all of her kids’ neighbors and school friends are now scattered across the city. She said she was grateful that this event provided an opportunity for them all to be together. \n\nShawn Silletti, another member of the party bus crew pictured to the left of Hanazawa above, chimed in: “We’ll laugh, we’ll cry, we’ll dance and have a good time together again.” Silletti also lost her Palisades home but was ready to find a glimmer of hope and joy with her crew again. \n\nThe Intuit Dome was filled with all types of Angelenos: families, Gen Zers, date night couples and more. \n\nOne father-daughter duo sported “Stay Strong” Hawaiian shirts. Timothy Kubo and his daughter, who live in San Bernardino, attended the concert to support the fire relief efforts but also to see Olivia Rodrigo, his daughter’s favorite artist. \n\nAnother mother-daughter duo Monica and Lena Salazar told TheWrap it meant a lot that people with influence were “using their status” to show they care. It was 13-year-old Lena’s first concert. \n\nThe Intuit Dome kicked off a little later than the Forum, but fans in their seats still danced and sang along to the Forum’s musical guests, including No Doubt, a surprise Nirvana reunion and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. \n\nKamala Harris was in attendance at the Clippers’ home stadium and even entertained pictures from fans in the crowd. Though the former vice president did not take the stage, the Brentwood resident’s presence, alongside her husband Doug Emhoff, was known. \n\nSeveral of the artists’ in the Dome were born and raised in L.A., including Gracie Abrams, Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. The twenty-something singers reflected on how this city has always been home. Abrams told the audience how she grew up in the Palisades and is still mourning for her community before performing a Counting Crows cover of “A Long December.” Rodrigo reminisced on her own love letters to L.A. before performing her 2021 hit “deja vu.” And lifelong Pasadena resident Eilish stunned with an all-acoustic set of songs from her Grammy-nominated album, “Hit Me Hard and Soft.”\n\nThe FireAid concert simulstreamed on over 25 broadcast partners Thursday. The nearly six-hour concert is available to stream in full on YouTube.

JB Pritzker bars Jan. 6 rioters from state jobs, calling the conduct 'disgraceful'","text":"In a rebuke of President Donald Trump’s mass pardon of Jan. 6 rioters, Gov. JB Pritzker has blocked anyone who participated in the 2021 U.S. Capitol insurrection from getting a job with the state of Illinois.\n\nPritzker issued a directive Thursday to the state’s Department of Central Management Services, which oversees hiring, to consider “any participation” in the riot that sought to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss as “infamous and disgraceful conduct” violating Illinois’ personnel code.\n\nThe Democratic governor, a vocal Trump critic on the national political stage, wrote in the internal document that rioters “attacked law enforcement officers protecting people in the Capitol, disrupted the peaceful transfer of power, and undermined bedrock principles of American democracy.”\n\n“Our State workforce must reflect the values of Illinois and demonstrate honesty, integrity, and loyalty to serving the taxpayers,” the Democratic governor wrote in the directive obtained by the Sun-Times. “No one who attempts to overthrow a government should serve in government.”\n\nA mob of about 2,500 people broke into the Capitol in the unprecedented attack, injuring almost 200 police officers and causing almost $3 million in damage, according to FBI estimates.\n\nTrump distanced himself from the rioters in the insurrection’s aftermath, but embraced them as political “hostages” on the campaign trail last year.\n\nHours after retaking office last week, Trump declared he was ending “a grave national injustice” by pardoning more than 1,500 people “convicted of offenses related to events” at the Capitol on Jan. 6. The returning Republican president also commuted the sentences of an additional 14 participants and ordered the U.S. attorney general to seek dismissal of all pending indictments.\n\nAt least 53 Illinois residents from across the state faced federal charges stemming from the riot, including a onetime suburban CEO, a Chicago police officer and a member of the far-right Proud Boys.\n\n“These crimes… threatened public safety as Members of Congress, staff, and other workers were forced to hide from the violence for hours,” Pritzker wrote, calling Jan. 6 participation “antithetical to the mission of the State.”\n\nThat designation would violate state hiring law, precluding any rioter from getting a state job. Illinois employs more than 70,000 people.\n\nIllinois Republican Party Chair Kathy Salvi dismissed Pritzker’s directive as “grandstanding” by the governor “in his insatiable hunger for the White House in 2028.” Pritzker was floated as a potential vice president candidate last year for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, and has done little to quell notions of his own presidential ambitions. \n\n“Over the last two weeks, Gov. Pritzker has shown us that he is a vengeful and egotistical man who is out of touch with working men and women,” Salvi said in a statement.\n\n“Instead of working for Illinois families or with the new Republican administration to improve the lives of Illinoisans, he is creating division and chaos… His grandstanding ignores the will of the American people.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/01/31/jb-pritzker-jan-6-blocked-state-jobs-illinois-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/501eb89/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F79%2F9a%2F849f5e554dfcb7a05a020ff03f06%2Ftrumpf","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 21:56:38","author":"Mitchell Armentrout","authors":["Mitchell Armentrout"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":285873006,"title":"Federal workers told to remove pronouns from email signatures in Trump anti-DEI effort","text":"Getting “pink-slipped” may soon take on a new meaning.\n\nExecutive branch employees have been ordered to cut gender pronouns out of their email signatures, memos obtained by ABC News and other outlets show, apparently pursuant to anti-DEI executive orders President Trump signed soon after being sworn in as the 47th president.\n\nAgencies included in the directive — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Transportation Department and the Energy Department among them — informed workers to cut out the once-ubiquitous “he/him,” “she/her,” “they/them” and variations on such from communications, grant applications or other official documents, ABC reported.\n\n“Pronouns and any other information not permitted in the policy must be removed from CDC/ATSDR employee signatures by 5 p.m. ET on Friday,” the message to CDC employees read.\n\nDepartment of Energy employees asked for DEI “language in Federal discourse, communications and publications” to be excised, according to ABC.\n\nThe federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also fired off a memo telling agencies to review “email systems such as Outlook and turn off features that prompt users for their pronouns.”\n\nThe Post has reached out to OPM for comment.\n\nOn Day One, Trump ordered an end to “radical and wasteful government DEI programs,” calling on OPM, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Justice Department to end “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility “mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities.”\n\nHe also took action to eliminate “gender ideology extremism” and restore “biological truth to the federal government,” declaring it “the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.”\n\n“These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,” the second executive order stated.\n\nIt added: “Agencies shall remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages. Agency forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity.”\n\nLast week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio scrapped US passport applications allowing Americans to designate their gender identity as “X,” rather than male or female.\n\nThe executive orders were referenced in the memos distributed on Friday.\n\nUpon taking office in January 2021, then-President Joe Biden had signed an order to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nThen-White House press secretary Jen Psaki later defended the order when it caught flak from critics who said it would eliminate sex-segregated spaces for women and lead to the end of girl’s sports.\n\n“The president’s belief is that trans rights are human rights, and that’s why he signed that executive order,” Psaki told reporters in February 2021.\n\nThe Biden White House also courted several transgender influencers such as Dylan Mulvaney and other proponents of so-called “gender-affirming” care over the past four years — leading to fierce backlash from critics who argued sex-transition surgeries and hormone therapies were dangerous and irreversible for minors.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris further courted progressives by making use of pronouns in her public appearances, introducing herself at an LGBTQ roundtable in 2022 by saying, “I am Kamala Harris, my pronouns are she and her, and I am a woman sitting at the table wearing a blue suit.”\n\nShe later asked staffers for her failed 2024 campaign to list whether they were one of nine gender-neutral options when applying — and was exposed for having backed “taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners” in one of her Republican opponent’s most successful attack ads.\n\n“Even the liberal media was shocked Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens,” the narrator in the ad stated. “Kamala’s for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\nSince Trump’s victory, however, at least two high-profile Democrats — onetime Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Bronx and Queens Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — who once proudly displayed pronouns in their social media profiles have removed them.\n\nButtigieg scrubbed his own “he/him” designation as recently as Thursday after reports that he was considering a Senate run in the swing state of Michigan.","summary":"Getting &#8220;pink-slipped&#8221; may soon take on a new meaning.

Trump has also previously called for CBS to lose its broadcast license.\n\nThough CBS has maintained that Trump’s accusations of deceitful editing are false, its parent company Paramount Global has entered talks with Trump’s team about a possible settlement as it looks to get its pending $8 billion merger with Skydance Media through its FCC review, according to The New York Times. \n\nOn Friday, attorneys for Trump filed a request to postpone a deadline to respond to CBS’ motion to dismiss by Feb. 7, which was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Amarillo Division. The two parties must meet and confer on or before Feb. 11 and file a joint proposed scheduling order on or before Feb. 18, according to the court. Defendants must file pleadings, motions or a reply briefing on or before March 7. \n\nIn addition to Trump’s lawsuit, The Center for American Rights, a self-described “nonpartisan public interest law firm,” has accused New York’s WCBS-TV of “news distortion” over the “60 Minutes” interview. FCC chairman Brendan Carr has said that complaint would “likely arise” in his review of the Skydance transaction, which is required due to a transfer of broadcast licenses. \n\nIn a separate petition with the FCC, the Center for American Rights said CBS News has a “troubling track record of ideological bias and news manipulation” and that CBS Television has “apparently engaged in illegal racial quotas for its hiring.” It also said Tencent Holdings’ minority stake of less than 5% in Skydance raises “troubling questions about undue foreign influence from China.”\n\nIt has asked that the Paramount-Skydance merger approval be conditioned upon a commitment to promote viewpoint diversity, avoid foreign influence and treat all employees and candidates equally without regard to race or gender. It also requested that the FCC coordinate its review with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) due to Tencent’s recent designation as a “Chinese military company” by the Department of Defense. \n\nParamount and Skydance have called for the objection to the merger to be dismissed, arguing its viewpoint neutrality condition would “improperly encroach on broadcasters’ editorial discretion” and violate the First Amendment. The companies also said allegations of Chinese influence and racial discrimination have “no factual foundation and are legally unavailing” and that Tencent’s “entirely passive, non-attributable, minority interests present no basis for concern about undue influence.”\n\nBut the Center for American Rights argues that the 5% percent foreign ownership threshold is “not a hard-and-fast rule” and that Tencent’s designation as a Chinese military company should “refute the presumption under these circumstances.”\n\n It added that its proposed conditions could be met by adding board members from different geographies, industries, backgrounds and political persuasions; creating an “independent, empowered, balanced ombudsman” similar to Meta’s Oversight board; putting executive and editorial staff in cities besides New York and Los Angeles to “ensure a balanced set of viewpoints”; and committing to an “ideologically diverse hiring pipeline.”\n\nIn addition to the Center for American Rights, the FCC has received petitions of opposition from Paramount shareholder Mario Gabelli, Hollywood’s Teamsters union, the Latino-owned entertainment company Fuse Media, and LiveVideoAI.Corp. The Skydance deal is on track to close in the first half of 2025.","summary":" \"We are working to comply with that inquiry as we are legally compelled to do,” a network spokesperson tells TheWrap\n\n\nThe post FCC Asks CBS News to Turn Over Full, Unedited Transcript and Camera Feeds of Kamala Harris &#8217;60 Minutes&#8217; Interview appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/fcc-cbs-news-turn-over-unedited-transcript-kamala-harris-interview/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/brendan-carr-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 21:37:17","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":285882604,"title":"Paramount Seeking to Settle Trump's $10 Billion '60 Minutes' Lawsuit over Deceptively Edited Kamala Harris Interview","text":"Paramount Global is reportedly in talks to settle President Donald Trump’s $10 billion lawsuit over CBS News’s deceptively edited Kamala Harris interview that aired on 60 Minutes a month prior the November 5 election.\n\nExecutives at Paramount, which is the parent company of CBS, are in talks to bring the legal battle to a close, though no dollar figures have been made public, according to multiple reports.

The New York Times reports that the company started settlement negotiations because it is keen to avoid regulatory obstacles to its planned merger with Skydance Media.\n\nParamount's openness to a settlement represents quite a turnaround from the position that CBS took after Trump filed his lawsuit. \"The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit,\" the network said then, \"and we will vigorously defend against it.\" The striking change illustrates the pressure that a president can exert against news outlets that annoy him—a reality that is especially troubling when the White House is occupied by someone determined to \"straighten out the press.\" Although that mission is blatantly inconsistent with the First Amendment, Trump can pursue it indirectly by deploying executive power in service of his personal vendettas.\n\nAfter Trump sued CBS, the Times notes, \"many legal experts dismissed the litigation as a far-fetched attempt to punish an out-of-favor news outlet.\" That is arguably a charitable description of Trump's lawsuit, which avers that CBS violated a Texas consumer fraud statute by editing the interview with Harris in a way that made her seem slightly more cogent. His invocation of that law is patently frivolous. So is Trump's risible claim that the editing cost him \"at least\" $10 billion in damages.\n\nDuring the interview, 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker asked Harris about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response to the Biden administration's concerns regarding the war in Gaza. An October 6 preview of the interview on Face the Nation included this part of her response: \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in several movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.\" In the edited version of the interview that aired on 60 Minutes the next day, by contrast, Harris says, \"We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.\"\n\nHarris did not come across as especially forthright or intelligent in either version of her response. But Trump complained that \"her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better.\"\n\nIn response, 60 Minutes said the show gave Face the Nation \"an excerpt of our interview\" that \"used a longer section of her answer\" than the segment used in the interview that aired the next day. It was the \"same question\" and the \"same answer,\" the producers said, but \"a different portion of the response.\" They added: \"When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allow[ed] time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.\"\n\nAs Trump saw it, however, that decision was \"A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal.\" How so? In his lawsuit, which he filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Trump claims that CBS violated that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA), which prohibits \"false, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, CBS reiterated that \"the interview was not doctored\" and noted that 60 Minutes \"did not hide any part of Vice President Kamala Harris's answer to the question at issue.\" But the problems with Trump's case go far beyond the question of whether CBS engaged in responsible journalism.\n\nAs relevant here, the DTPA defines \"trade or commerce\" as \"the advertising, offering for sale, sale, lease, or distribution of any good or service,\" including \"any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this state.\" In other words, the statute is aimed at misrepresentations in connection with the promotion or sale of goods or services.\n\nWhen it edited the Harris interview, 60 Minutes was not advertising or selling anything. It was practicing journalism—poorly, in Trump's view, but in any case making the sort of editorial decisions that news outlets routinely make. Those decisions are indisputably protected by the First Amendment except in specific, narrow circumstances such as defamation. Whatever you make of Trump's objections to the Harris interview, they plainly do not support a claim for damages.\n\nTrump says his lawsuit is authorized by Section 17.50 of the DTPA, which says \"a consumer may maintain an action\" when he suffers \"economic damages\" or \"mental anguish\" as a result of false, misleading, or deceptive statements that he \"relied on\" to his \"detriment.\" A consumer also can sue based on \"breach of an express or implied warranty\" or \"any unconscionable action.\" The law defines that last phrase as \"an act or practice which, to a consumer's detriment, takes advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience, or capacity of the consumer to a grossly unfair degree.\"\n\nTrump's lawsuit claims he is \"a 'consumer' within the meaning of the DTPA, since he is an individual who sought and received CBS's broadcast services.\" But the statute defines \"consumer\" as someone who \"seeks or acquires by purchase or lease, any goods or services\" (emphasis added). Trump did not purchase or lease anything from CBS.\n\nWhile Trump may be a \"consumer\" of 60 Minutes in the sense that he watches the show, he is not a consumer who bought goods or services from CBS, let alone one who bought goods or services based on \"false, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices.\" Since there was no transaction, Trump likewise could not have suffered damages by buying something based on \"an express or implied warranty\" or because he lacked the \"knowledge, ability, experience, or capacity\" to assess the merits of the purchase.\n\nTrump's lawsuit notes that the DTPA covers practices that \"caus[e] confusion or misunderstanding\" regarding \"the source, sponsorship, approval, or certification of goods or services\" or regarding \"affiliation, connection, or association with, or certification, by another.\" He says CBS confused \"millions of Americans, and in particular residents of Texas,\" because it was \"impossible for even the most discerning viewers to determine whether the 60 Minutes interview was independent journalism or de facto advertising for the Kamala Campaign.\" He says viewers also would have been confused about \"the Interview's 'certification by' CBS given its legal obligation to broadcast news in a non-distortive manner.\" He adds that \"CBS's misconduct was unconscionable because it amounts to a brazen attempt to interfere in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.\"\n\nNone of this makes any sense in the context of the DTPA, because none of it is grounded in a commercial relationship between Trump and CBS. Trump is simply dressing up his criticism of news coverage as a consumer fraud complaint without any evidence that CBS engaged in the deceptive trade practices that the law covers. This is the same strategy he later used in his lawsuit against The Des Moines Register, which offended him by publishing a poll that inaccurately predicted a Harris victory in Iowa. If misleading journalism counted as actionable consumer fraud, news outlets would have to constantly worry about potentially ruinous litigation whenever their work might be characterized that way, which is almost always the case.\n\nTrump's estimate of the damages he supposedly suffered as a \"consumer\" who never bought anything from CBS compounds the absurdity of his lawsuit. He says the damages are \"reasonably believed to be at least $10,000,000,000.\" In case that seems like a number pulled out of thin air, a footnote avers that \"CBS's distortion of the 60 Minutes Interview damaged President Trump's fundraising and support values by several billions of dollars, particularly in Texas.\" Trump's 2024 campaign spent a total of about $355 million, which is a lot of money but a tiny fraction of the additional $10 billion he says he could have raised—\"particularly in Texas\"—if CBS had not aired an interview that was edited to make Harris look a bit less \"DUMB.\"\n\nWhy is Paramount so eager to settle this comical excuse for a lawsuit? Needless to say, it has nothing to do with the legal or logical merits of Trump's complaint.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder, \"supports the effort to settle\" because she \"stands to clear billions of dollars on the sale of Paramount.\" The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is now chaired by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, has the power to queer that deal by refusing to approve the transfer of the broadcasting licenses held by CBS-owned TV stations.\n\nThat approval could be contingent on what the FCC makes of the complaint that the Harris interview violated its rule against \"broadcast news distortion,\" which makes it \"illegal for broadcasters to intentionally distort the news.\" As the FCC put it in 1979, \"broadcasters are public trustees licensed to operate in the public interest and, as such, may not engage in intentional falsification or suppression of news.\"\n\nBecause the FCC is \"prohibited by law from engaging in censorship or infringing on First Amendment rights of the press,\" the agency says, it \"will only investigate claims that include evidence showing that the broadcast news report was deliberately intended to mislead viewers or listeners.\" It \"does not investigate claims of collateral inaccuracy in news reports or differences of opinion over the truth or validity of aspects of a news program.\"\n\nCarr has implicitly acknowledged that proving CBS \"deliberately intended to mislead viewers or listeners\" would be a tall order. \"In my view,\" he told Glenn Beck last year, \"the best way forward\" would be to \"release the transcript,\" which would mean \"there's no reason to have this before the FCC.\" Although \"CBS had refused previous requests from Mr. Trump's lawyers\" to release the complete transcript of the interview, the Times says, \"people inside Paramount have been expecting the F.C.C.\" to request it, and Carr \"has said that the commission would probably look into the '60 Minutes' interview as part of its review of the Paramount merger.\" Trump, for his part, argues that the editing of the Harris interview is sufficient reason for the FCC to \"TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE.\"\n\nThe upshot of all this is that Paramount is eager to settle Trump's ridiculous lawsuit, perhaps with some sort of clarification or apology. That outcome, the Times notes, is apt to provoke \"an uproar within CBS News and among the '60 Minutes' staff,\" since \"journalists at the network have expressed deep concern about the notion of their parent company settling litigation that they consider tantamount to a politician's standard-issue gripes about a news organization's editorial judgment.\"\n\nTrump can extort that outcome because of the FCC's antiquated and constitutionally dubious authority over the content of broadcast journalism, which the government treats differently from journalism disseminated via print, cable, satellite, the internet, or any other nonbroadcast medium. That is just one of many ways that a president can try to punish or suppress speech he does not like. Other levers of executive power include the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the IRS, antitrust enforcement by the Justice Department, privacy and financial regulations, and presidential support for new legislation. Trump has even suggested that the Justice Department \"should\" be policing the press to make sure it is telling the truth, an idea that is legally baseless and starkly at odds with the First Amendment.\n\nTrump and other Republicans rightly complained when the Biden administration persistently pressured social media platforms to suppress speech that federal officials viewed as a threat to public health, democracy, or national security. That pestering, they plausibly argued, violated the First Amendment because it carried an implicit threat of government retaliation against companies that refused to comply. Yet Trump is doing essentially the same thing in this case by pressuring Paramount to assuage his wrath by settling a lawsuit that was bound to fail on its merits.\n\nLike the Biden administration officials he despises, Trump is demanding that a private company kowtow to him—or else. Also like them, he claims to be serving the public interest: He argues that \"our press is very corrupt,\" which represents a threat not only to him but to democracy itself. But his chilling crusade against journalism that irks him, which he openly says is aimed at changing the way the press covers the news, is an assault on the values that distinguish a liberal democracy from one that elects autocrats who are free to punish speech that offends them.","summary":"The company is worried that the president's complaints about a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris could block a pending merger.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/01/31/why-is-paramount-so-keen-to-settle-trumps-laughable-lawsuit-against-cbs/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/01/Donald-Trump-1-30-25-Newscom-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 21:20:47","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":285857406,"title":"Donald Trump's media and tech lawsuits seemed like a stretch. Then he won the election.","text":"Disney paid Donald Trump $15 million. Meta paid $22 million.Next question: How much will Paramount pay?The question after that: How many more giant tech and media companies will pay the president of the United States to settle lawsuits?And the truly big question hanging over all of this: Is this just going to be how business works during Trump 2.0?Here's the context: Donald Trump has a history of filing lawsuits — or at least threatening to file lawsuits — against people and companies he says have besmirched his image. But until he won his second presidential election last fall, he had only scattered success when he did that.Things are different now.In December, Disney agreed to make a $15 million donation to Trump's future presidential library in order to settle a defamation suit. Earlier this week, Meta agreed to donate $22 million to the same library to settle a suit Trump filed after the company suspended his Facebook and Instagram accounts.Now Paramount is in talks to make a similar settlement, as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have reported and I've confirmed. (A Paramount rep declined to comment; I've asked the Trump White House for comment.) And there will be enormous pressure on newspaper publisher Gannett to settle another suit Trump filed after the election.There are some differences between the suits. The Disney suit, for instance, was a somewhat straightforward defamation claim, focused on comments ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos made during a live interview. The Meta case revolved around Trump's argument that the company had violated his First Amendment rights.The Paramount and Gannett filings accuse those companies of election interference and consumer fraud, respectively. Trump was specifically unhappy with the way Paramount's \"60 Minutes\" program handled an interview with Kamala Harris, and about a poll Gannett's Des Moines Register published before the election that projected he would lose in Iowa.What all of those suits had in common: Lots of skepticism and eye-rolling from legal experts, who said Trump would have a very difficult time making his case.But as it turns out, when the person making that case turns out to be the most powerful man in the world, the equation gets reworked.Again, each situation is different: Disney sources told The New York Times they were worried the suit could end up at the Supreme Court, and that a loss there could set back First Amendment rights. Meta's settlement comes as Mark Zuckerberg has made a loud and dramatic pivot to become a Trump supporter.In Paramount's case, both its current owner — Shari Redstone — and the man who wants to buy it — Oracle founder Larry Ellison, on behalf of his son David — are aligned with Trump to varying degrees. But that deal requires federal approval, and Brendan Carr, Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, has already said he intends to scrutinize the way Paramount's CBS handled the \"60 Minutes\" interview. Technically, Trump's suit and the FCC's approval of the deal are considered separate issues. But it's easy enough to draw a dotted line.It's also easy to see a stark pattern emerging: Powerful companies with enormous legal resources deciding that they're better off making a payment — in the form of a donation — to Trump than fighting him.If you're reading this, that suggests you have some interest in the news. For people who care about news — or any part of the protections the First Amendment provides — all of this likely sounds chilling. But even if you're a press/media/Big Tech skeptic or foe, you might worry about the lawsuits and settlements, and the precedent they set. What happens when Donald Trump — or a future president — comes after a company or industry you care about?","summary":"Powerful companies with enormous legal resources are deciding to pay Trump instead of fighting his lawsuits.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-meta-paramount-trump-lawsuit-settle-gannett-2025-1","image":"https://i.insider.com/679d3789eb4be2fff9a3266b?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 21:09:12","author":"Peter Kafka","authors":["Peter Kafka"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.085},{"id":285860878,"title":"Dr. Phil Participated in the Chicago ICE Raids.

The man says he recognizes McGraw from television.\n\n “You’ve been charged with sex with children?” the TV personality eventually asks.\n\n “Not really,” the man responds.\n\n “And you’ve never been deported?” asks McGraw, to which he responds, “Nope.”\n\n Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reported more than 5,000 arrests, The New York Times reports. The administration says that they are focused on first arresting migrants with criminal backgrounds.\n\n McGraw’s recent participation in a Chicago ICE raid comes after he spread anti-immigration rhetoric and aligned himself with Trump's campaign.\n\n In January 2023, per NBC News, McGraw gave one of his earliest indications about his perspective on the issue, stating on his talk show that he believed American immigration laws were not being properly enforced and that “we can’t get our act together by doing this the right way.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n But he became a much more vocal supporter of strict immigration enforcement following the end of the Dr. Phil show on CBS in May 2023 and as his new show, Dr. Phil Primetime, began to air on his own network, Merit Street Media, in February 2024.\n\n On Feb. 2, 2024, McGraw posted a photo posing with American border agents to his Facebook page, captioning the image, “Spent time at the border today with the men and women protecting our country. Searching for truth and answers… more on that to come.”\n\n Over the last year, he’s made more direct anti-immigration comments, suggesting on Fox News that Chinese immigrants were “spying” on American agricultural practices and telling his followers on X that the “crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border was “even worse than I had imagined.”\n\n McGraw hosted Trump on his talk show in August, where he asked the then-presidential candidate how he would “grade” Vice President Kamala Harris’ work after she was tasked by President Joe Biden's administration to investigate the root cause of migration.\n\n He delivered a speech at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally in New York City on Oct. 27, in the final days before the presidential election.\n\n On Wednesday, Jan. 29, Trump took action to fulfill his campaign promise of increasing deportations, signing into law the Laken Riley Act, which directs federal immigration authorities to detain and deport immigrants without legal status who are charged with a crime, per the Associated Press and NPR.\n\n At the ceremonial bill signing, Trump also announced his intentions to open a detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba — a prison known for its mistreatment of people who were accused of terrorism after the 9/11 attacks — to hold “dangerous criminals” and people who are “hard to deport,” according to the AP.\n\n “We have 30,000 beds in Guantanamo to detain the worst criminal aliens threatening the American people,” he said.","summary":"A video shared by the former daytime talk show host, 74, shows him questioning a detained immigrant on the street alongside President Trump's \"border czar\"","url":"https://people.com/dr-phil-chicago-immigration-raid-8783953","image":"https://people.com/thmb/Js--HySLIoXvHr4Rs9okXKt4488=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/dr-phil-ice-tout-013125-8d2dfccbfbeb4f64a720507092b67fec.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 20:46:27","author":"Luke Chinman","authors":["Luke Chinman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":285853262,"title":"Trump orders all federal employees to remove pronouns from their emails","text":"Trump orders all federal employees to remove pronouns from their emails\n\nPODCAST: The biggest takeaways from RFK Jr’s confirmation hearing – on Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy CHARLIE SPIERING, SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER, WASHINGTON, DC\n\nPublished: 20:36 GMT, 31 January 2025 | Updated: 20:36 GMT, 31 January 2025\n\nDonald Trump ordered federal employees to remove their pronounces from the email signatures as he continues his widespread purge of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from the government. \n\nFederal employees were sent memos ordering them to remove their pronouns from official government communications by the end of the week.\n\n'Pronouns and any other information not permitted in the policy must be removed from CDC/ATSDR employee signatures by 5.p.m. ET on Friday,' read one message from the Center for Disease Control's Chief Information Officer Jason Bonander, according to a copy of the memo obtained by ABC News.\n\nThe memos cited Trump's executive orders signed after taking office as responsible for the change.\n\nOne federal government employee from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) griped to ABC News about Trump's detailed restrictions.\n\n'In my decade-plus years at CDC I've never been told what I can and can't put in my email signature,' the employee said.\n\nThe use of pronouns in work emails has expanded in recent years to signal a company's commitment to inclusion of employees who identified as a different gender than the one they were born with. \n\nThe Democratic party sought to be as inclusive as possible, allowing potential employees for the Kamala Harris presidential campaign to select from nine different genders on employment applications. \n\nUnited States President Donald Trump signs two executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC\n\nA sign hangs on the wall outside the office of U.S. Rep.

When that gets done is still a point of debate,” Thune said of abolishing taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits.\n\n“Obviously there is a lot involved in crafting a tax bill,” Thune said. “There are a lot of moving parts. There are a lot of suggestions that have come up, and the president has put on the table, which we will take under consideration. \n\n“But in the end, we want to produce a bill that extends the existing tax policy that will prevent a $4.6 trillion tax increase on the American people at the end of the year, and hopefully accomplish some other things that the president has laid out as objectives.” \n\nTrump won the Nov. 5 election after promising a raft of tax cuts to working-class Americans, beginning with his plan to spare tips, a policy to which he has credited his victory in Nevada, where many Las Vegas hotel and restaurant workers depend upon gratuities.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, the then-vice president, ultimately backed the plan as well.\n\nTrump later rolled out plans to abolish federal taxes on overtime and Social Security benefits — along with a variety of other reforms, such as scrapping the $10,000 cap on the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted from federal tax bills, which particularly impacts high-tax jurisdictions like New York.\n\nHe additionally floated an initiative to allow people with car loans to write off the interest on domestic vehicles — similar to home mortgage deductions.\n\nTrump generally argues that tax cuts spur economic growth, thereby indirectly increasing federal revenue to offset reduced rates. \n\nThe president has also asserted that significant new tariffs would add to government coffers.","summary":"The legislative push may not come until after a March 14 government funding deadline.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/us-news/when-will-trump-end-taxes-on-tips-ot-and-social-security-white-house-says-gop-must-put-in-reconciliation-bill/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/97680501.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/MtxGdZS8-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-31 20:36:46","author":"Josh Christenson,Steven Nelson","authors":["Josh Christenson","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.073},{"id":285882608,"title":"Every Single DNC Chair Candidate Says Kamala Lost Due to 'Racism and Misogyny'","text":"Every single candidate running to chair the Democratic National Committee (DNC) blamed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss to President Donald Trump on “racism and misogyny.”\n\nThe committee’s final chair candidate forum, hosted by MSNBC at Washington, DC’s Georgetown University on Thursday, featured former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, former Maryland Gov.

In addition to disagreements on wages and benefits, the union said Costco had rejected proposals dealing with seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance.\n\nRELATED: ‘I’m putting Costco on notice’: 19 GOP attorneys general call on retailer to end DEI programs\n\nTeamsters members at Costco make up 8% of the 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings. But a strike by that many workers would be significant for the largely nonunion sector. Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions. Most of those unionized retail workers are in the grocery store sector.\n\nThe unionized store locations, which have not been identified by either the union or company, are in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington. Costco said on Friday that even if there is a strike and unionized workers don’t report to work, “all of our locations will be open for business this weekend,” an indication that it intends to use management and nonunion staff to keep stores operating.\n\nMeanwhile, while the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, the union is prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of nonunion Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remain on the job. Such a move could greatly increase the economic pressure on the company. While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for those other picket lines.\n\nHistory of above-market wages\n\nIn late 2023, when workers at a Costco store in Roanoke, Virginia, voted to join the Teamsters, the then-outgoing and incoming CEOs of Costco, Craig Jelinek and Ron Vachris, released a letter to employees.\n\n“We’re disappointed in the results in Norfolk,” the letter read. “We’re not disappointed in our employees; we’re disappointed in ourselves as managers and leaders. The fact that a majority of Norfolk employees felt that they wanted or needed a union constitutes a failure on our part.”\n\n“It was a pretty unique letter. I’ve never seen management take that position,” Jane Jacobs, an attorney at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, who typically represents employers in labor relations, told CNN.\n\nThe Teamsters have pointed to Costco’s strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package. Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion — up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a recent union rally held outside Costco’s annual meeting, union members held banners reading: “Pro worker? Prove it!” and “Record profits = record contract.”\n\n“Costco has two choices: respect the workers who made them a success or face a national strike,” Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said in a statement earlier this month. “If Costco thinks they can exploit our members while raking in billions, we’ll shut them down.”\n\nJacobs said that despite the differences at the bargaining table, there doesn’t appear to be a large difference in total cost between their bargaining positions. Costco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at nonunion stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years. Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20.\n\nJacobs said a good strategy for any employer is to give the nonunion employees the same pay and benefit package as unionized employees to remove the incentive to join the union. But she said it’s possible the Teamsters go on strike to press their current political advantage.\n\nO’Brien has gotten closer to President Donald Trump than many labor leaders, Jacobs said. He spoke at the Republican National Convention and did not endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco has refused to back off of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, which have become a focus of Trump’s attacks in the early days of the new term. Jacobs said she could see Trump publicly taking the side of the Teamsters if it goes on strike at Costco to put pressure on the company.\n\n“This union is set up as well as any union to go on strike,” she said. “One thing we know about this administration is they’ll reward their friends and punish their enemies.”\n\nMichael Baker, retail analyst at DA Davidson, said that while a strike at only 8% of Costco stores probably isn’t enough to prove a significant financial hit to the company’s bottom line, a deal that is seen as a win for the union could spur organizing efforts at other stores across the chain.\n\nKatherine Black, a partner in the food, drug and mass market retail segment at management consulting firm Kearney, told CNN that a strike would likely not last more than a week.\n\n“It’s very rare in this sector for a strike to lasts more than a few days,” she said. “The longest I know of was one at Stop & Shop in 2019 that lasted 11 days.”\n\nLast year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas. But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract.

That's the mentality that I had going into this,' Harrison explained. 'And my nature is, \"I'm on the team you know, you're my quarterback. You got sacked a few times. But you know what? I'm going to block the hell out of the next person that's coming at you.\"' \n\n'And that is not always the mentality of everybody in my party,' Harrison continued. 'And so sometimes, people look on the sidelines, ready to call in the backup.'\n\nBiden's bump in the road came in the form of his disastrous late June debate performance against Trump in Atlanta. \n\nOutgoing Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison doesn't believe Democrats should have kicked President Joe Biden off the presidential ticket\n\n'Joe Biden gave the State of the Union, people said it was one of the best State of the Unions that we've ever seen,' Harrison recalled. 'Then we move forward to the debate, and people were like, that was a horrible debate performance.'\n\nIt followed months of polling that said Americans had major reservations about giving the then 81-year-old another term. \n\nHarrison pointed out that Trump's major disqualifying feature didn't have Republicans questioning if he should remain on the top of the ticket. \n\n'And if you look at the other side, in terms of Repubilcans, Donald trump had just been convicted, how many times for all these felonies? And you didn't hear a peep from the Republicans, in terms of like, \"We need to jettison Donald Trump, and we need to open up a new primary and we need to do this and that,\"' Harrison said. \n\nBut Republicans did have a proper primary, with Trump vying for votes against formidable, established candidates including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Amb. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence and others. \n\nBiden, on the other hand, was only challenged by Rep. Dean Philips and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, despite party members sharing concerns about his age behind closed doors. \n\nHarrison argued that was enough of a primary for Biden to remain the Democratic nominee, telling the AP 'my thought was: \"Joe Biden secured the nomination. The primary was done, and so, I'm a loyal guy. We're riding with Biden.\"' \n\nThe exiting DNC chair gave a wishy-washy response on whether Harris would have won had Biden bowed out sooner. \n\nDemocratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, is photographed giving her concession speech on Wednesday, November 6, 2024 on the campus of her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C.\n\n'Had she had more runway, it would have been probably easier for her and for the campaign,' Harrison said. 'We were building a race for Joe Biden.' \n\nHe also didn't think there was 'one answer' for why Harris lost.\n\n'A lot of people like to come up with thing,s and they say it's the economy. Well, it could have been a part of it,' he said. 'I think every state had their own little nuance. In Michigan, the Palestinian issue played something there.' \n\n'The gap in which she lost wasn’t huge, but when you add up little pockets where it’s, some people because of Gaza, some people because of the economy, some people because she was a woman,' he added. \n\n'And I think in many of those states, those little nicks here and there added up to how she lost in some of those states,' Harrison argued. \n\nDemocrats will be voting on Harrison's replacement Saturday during their Winter Meeting at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe top contenders include two party chairs: Minnesota's Ken Martin and Wisconsin's Ben Wikler. \n\nOther notables are Williamson, the former campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign Faiz Shakir and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who ran for president during the 2016 cycle. \n\nDemocratsDonald TrumpRepublicansPolitics\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nOutgoing Democratic Party chief gives an astonishing assessment of Kamala Harris\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Outgoing Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison doesn't believe Democrats should have kicked President Joe Biden off the presidential ticket.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14347311/jaime-harrison-dnc-joe-biden-kamala-harris.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/31/17/94733339-0-image-a-31_1738345912074.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 19:57:53","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":285859338,"title":"Nolte: Chuck Todd Out at NBC News","text":"Chuck Todd, NBC’s chief political analyst and former Meet The Press moderator, is exiting NBC News after nearly 20 years with the far-left network.\n\n“There’s never a perfect time to leave a place that’s been a professional home for so long, but I’m pretty excited about a few new projects that are on the cusp of going from ‘pie in the sky’ to ‘near reality,’” Todd reportedly wrote in a memo to his NBC colleagues Friday. “So I’m grateful for the chance to get a jump start on my next chapter during this important moment.”\n\n“The ChuckToddcast is also coming with me (thank you NBC).

In addition to disagreements on wages and benefits, the union said Costco had rejected proposals dealing with seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time, and safeguards against surveillance.\n\nTeamsters members at Costco make up 8% of the 219,000 employees at 616 US stores, according to company filings. But a strike by that many workers would be significant for the largely nonunion sector. Labor Department statistics show that less than 5% of retail workers are represented by unions. Most of those unionized retail workers are in the grocery store sector.\n\nThe unionized store locations, which have not been identified by either the union or company, are in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington. Costco said on Friday that even if there is a strike and unionized workers don’t report to work, “all of our locations will be open for business this weekend,” an indication that it intends to use management and nonunion staff to keep stores operating.\n\nMeanwhile, while the Teamsters only represent workers at a small fraction of Costco stores overall, the union is prepared to set up picket lines at an undisclosed number of nonunion Costco stores nationwide, even if workers at those stores remain on the job. Such a move could greatly increase the economic pressure on the company. While there are only 18,000 Teamsters at Costco, the union has more than 1 million US members it can call on for those other picket lines.\n\nHistory of above-market wages\n\nCostco has a reputation for providing relatively good pay and benefits, especially compared to other retail chains. Its annual company filing states that “our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average.”\n\nIn late 2023, when workers at a Costco store in Roanoke, Virginia, voted to join the Teamsters, the then-outgoing and incoming CEOs of Costco, Craig Jelinek and Ron Vachris, released a letter to employees.\n\n“We’re disappointed in the results in Norfolk,” the letter read. “We’re not disappointed in our employees; we’re disappointed in ourselves as managers and leaders. The fact that a majority of Norfolk employees felt that they wanted or needed a union constitutes a failure on our part.”\n\n“It was a pretty unique letter. I’ve never seen management take that position,” Jane Jacobs, an attorney at Tarter Krinsky & Drogin, who typically represents employers in labor relations, told CNN.\n\nThe Teamsters have pointed to Costco’s strong financial results as an argument for an improved wage and benefits package. Costco reported record annual net income in the most recent fiscal year of $7.4 billion — up 17% from a year earlier and nearly double what it earned in 2019 ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a recent union rally held outside Costco’s annual meeting, union members held banners reading: “Pro worker? Prove it!” and “Record profits = record contract.”\n\n“Costco has two choices: respect the workers who made them a success or face a national strike,” Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said in a statement earlier this month. “If Costco thinks they can exploit our members while raking in billions, we’ll shut them down.”\n\nJacobs said that despite the differences at the bargaining table, there doesn’t appear to be a large difference in total cost between their bargaining positions. Costco confirmed a Reuters report that it recently sent a letter out to all employees at nonunion stores announcing it was raising pay by a dollar an hour to $30.20 this year and another dollar an hour each of the next two years. Starting pay would be raised by 50 cents an hour to $20.\n\nJacobs said a good strategy for any employer is to give the nonunion employees the same pay and benefit package as unionized employees to remove the incentive to join the union. But she said it’s possible the Teamsters go on strike to press their current political advantage.\n\nO’Brien has gotten closer to President Donald Trump than many labor leaders, Jacobs said. He spoke at the Republican National Convention and did not endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco has refused to back off of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, which have become a focus of Trump’s attacks in the early days of the new term. Jacobs said she could see Trump publicly taking the side of the Teamsters if it goes on strike at Costco to put pressure on the company.\n\n“This union is set up as well as any union to go on strike,” she said. “One thing we know about this administration is they’ll reward their friends and punish their enemies.”\n\nMichael Baker, retail analyst at DA Davidson, said that while a strike at only 8% of Costco stores probably isn’t enough to prove a significant financial hit to the company’s bottom line, a deal that is seen as a win for the union could spur organizing efforts at other stores across the chain.\n\nKatherine Black, a partner in the food, drug and mass market retail segment at management consulting firm Kearney, told CNN that a strike would likely not last more than a week.\n\n“It’s very rare in this sector for a strike to lasts more than a few days,” she said. “The longest I know of was one at Stop & Shop in 2019 that lasted 11 days.”\n\nLast year, the Teamsters staged a five-day strike at Amazon that ended the day after Christmas. But unlike the situation at Costco, Amazon does not recognize the union as representing any of its workers and has refused to negotiate, let alone agree to terms on a contract. Amazon doesn’t even recognize that many of the strikers, who are drivers for third-party delivery services and have exclusive contracts with the online retailer, are its employees.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Those items include pharmaceuticals, microchips, and steel. Earlier that day, however, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was pushing for a plan to begin with a 2.5% tariff on all goods and gradually increase them, according to the Financial Times, but Trump told reporters he would reject that plan, saying “that would not be acceptable to me,” saying tariffs needed to be “much, much bigger.”\n\nLeavitt did not specify if there will be any exemptions or if the administration is moving forward with the original plan to issue blanket tariffs on all goods imported from the three countries.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump used the threat of tariffs as a bargaining chip with several countries, including China. \n\nGas, food, and alcohol prices are expected to rise when the tariffs against Canada and Mexico begin, threatening to undermine a key promise Trump made on the campaign trail to bring down the price of consumer goods. \n\nHere are some of the items imported from Canada and Mexico that could be affected.\n\nCanada is the U.S.’s second-largest trade partner, including being its largest export partner and third-largest import partner. Canada accounts for 12.8% of imports into the U.S., according to the Census Bureau.\n\nIn 2022, the most recent year that has data available, the U.S. imported $481.2 billion worth of goods from Canada, including crude petroleum, cars, and petroleum gas, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Machinery, materials such as plastics, aluminum, and wood, along with agriculture, among other products, are also major exports from Canada to the U.S., according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe tariff on crude petroleum could be especially painful for the U.S., which imported more from Canada than from any other country in 2023. Canada shipped $97 billion worth of crude petroleum to the U.S. that year, compared to $20 billion from Mexico and $55 billion worth from the rest of the world. \n\nTariffs on these products would likely affect the prices of a wide range of items that use these materials and could also affect fuel prices. \n\nOne of the primary drivers behind Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month was a general sense of dissatisfaction with the economy. In particular, voters feel an overwhelming sense that their cost of living is going up and there is little anyone can do to ease their pain.\n\nThe cost of housing is particularly painful for families. Though interest rates are beginning to fall, there is still a dearth of new housing, keeping the supply down and costs high.\n\nCanada exports roughly $8 billion in softwood lumber every year, with the U.S. being the single largest purchaser. Cranking up costs for lumber could keep housing starts low, undercutting one of Trump’s primary promises to voters to make their lives more affordable. \n\nCanada is also preparing to install retaliatory tariffs, if needed. Canadian officials are working on a list of dozens of American products that the United States exports to Canada to include, according to CNN.\n\nSouth of the border is the U.S.’s top trading partner, including for imports and exports, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. imported $493.1 billion worth of goods from Mexico, primarily in the form of cars, car parts, and computers, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.\n\nOther major exports include electronic equipment, agriculture, and materials such as plastic, aluminum, rubbers, and glass, among other products, according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe price of the No. 1 beer brand in the country, Modelo, will also rise. Constellation Brands, which imports Modelo and Corona beer, could see its costs increase by 16% under Trump’s proposed tariff and would likely have to raise prices by about 4.5%, according to Chris Carey, a Wells Fargo equity analyst. Tequila made in Mexico would also be more expensive. \n\nThe southern border between the U.S. and Mexico was at the center of Trump’s pitch for another four years in the White House. His focus in his first term on building a wall to keep illegal immigrants out of the country has been largely replaced by a broader promise to crack down on illegal border crossings and a promise to deport anyone who enters illegally. \n\nU.S. trade with Mexico has gone up across the board since Trump’s first term. \n\nWhile the countries’ trade-in vehicles and auto parts was always robust, it has soared since 2017, with the U.S. importing $30.43 billion in vehicles in 2017 and $44.76 billion in 2023. Similarly, the U.S. imported roughly $22.6 billion in auto parts in 2017 and $34.3 billion last year.\n\nThe U.S. has also nearly doubled its imports of petroleum oil, tractors, and medical instruments from its southern neighbor in that time. \n\nTrump’s introduction of steep tariffs on China in 2018 flipped the script on the country’s trade relationships. China nosedived from making up more than 21% of U.S. imports in 2018 to only slightly outpacing Canada in 2023 when it made up 13.86%. Last year, Mexico made up 15.43% of the U.S.’s imports.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum hinted at retaliatory tariffs if Trump follows through with his threat of 25% tariffs on all imports into the U.S. from Mexico.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile the country’s trade relationship with China is not as significant as the other countries, the U.S. does rely heavily on the East for key electronics such as phones ($55 billion worth imported in 2023) and computers ($40 billion worth in 2023).","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump is following through on his threat to levy 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada after they failed to meet his demands to stop drugs and illegal immigrants from entering the United States.

No, it wasn’t a landslide, as Democrats point out. But the party lost the White House, including the popular vote, and also lost the House and Senate. It lost all seven of the swing states. Nearly every jurisdiction — states, counties, cities, and suburbs — moved to the right from the 2020 election. The Democratic Party’s losses were across the board.\n\nOne might think such a drubbing would motivate a party to examine its mistakes and take a hard look in the mirror. But that would not be the DNC way, or the MSNBC way. So, the Georgetown forum was, in significant part, an exercise in denial.\n\nPerhaps the key moment came when Capehart asked the candidates and the audience for “a show of hands — how many of you believe that racism and misogyny played a role in Vice President Harris’s defeat?” Everyone onstage and in the audience raised his or her hand. It was unanimous. “OK, so that’s good,” Capehart said. “You all pass.”\n\nYou all pass. In a brief moment, Capehart gave voice to the test the Democratic Party has imposed on itself on the question of why Harris and the entire party lost ground in 2024: You can talk about the issues if you want, but we know it was racism and misogyny.\n\nOthers echoed the moment. “We have a racist, homophobic, misogynist president and party on the other side,” said Michael Blake, a candidate for DNC vice chairman, “and too often, we’re unwilling just to call it what it is. There is anti-blackness that is happening, there is racism that is happening, there is sexism that is happening, and if we are unwilling to be real about that, that’s why we’re going to keep losing.”\n\nOthers stressed the timing of the race in which President Joe Biden, mentally and physically unable to campaign at a high level or serve another term, withdrew on July 21, after which the party raced to give the nomination to Harris. “Remember, we had 107 days to run this campaign with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket,” said Nikema Williams, another candidate for DNC vice chairman. “So, it was difficult to get into communities and help people to understand or feel like they knew who Vice President Harris was and that she was the person fighting for them.”\n\nAs for Biden, the problem, as the DNC candidates saw it, was that he and the party did not do an effective job of explaining to the public what a great president he was. “We lost black men by the boatload,” said Robert Stephens, another candidate for DNC vice chairman, “and I began to explain to them all the wins that President Biden accomplished in his first two years, like capping the cost of insulin … these things impact people in real places, and we have to message them effectively.”\n\nOther topics received almost no attention. Inflation was one. The border was another. Crime was another. In other words, you heard little or nothing about the issues that most concerned voters in the presidential election. Indeed, the Georgetown session was newsworthy not because of party introspection or self-analysis but because it was interrupted many times by far-left-wing environmental protesters from a group known as the Sunrise Movement. The constant interruptions clearly irritated some Democrats, but not enough to crack down on the party’s leftist troublemakers.\n\nIn the big picture, as the DNC, choosing new leadership, surveyed its current position — out of power — leaders told themselves that the causes of the party’s failures are 1). racism and misogyny, and 2). poor communications. That is what losing parties do. Somebody else is to blame. Our only fault is insufficiently communicating to voters how wonderful we are.\n\nIn fact, of course, Democrats have a substance problem that they just don’t want to face. Biden’s wild spending helped fuel inflation. His border policy was a historic disaster. The party was soft on the crime that arose in the president’s first two years. Throw in the global chaos that Biden’s policies encouraged, and you have a catastrophically bad presidency. Of course, the party lost.\n\nSuch ideas are worth considering if you want to become a leader of the DNC. But don’t expect to hear them at this year’s DNC election.","summary":"CHOOSING NEW LEADERS, DEMOCRATS ARE STILL IN DENIAL. The Democratic National Committee will elect a new chairman and other officers this weekend.

Kennedy Jr. as President Donald Trump’s lead health czar called out the newspaper’s owner after the piece ran without the critiques and a “misleading” new headline.\n\nPolitical anthropologist Eric Reinhart’s original op-ed headline “RFK Jr’s Wrecking Ball Won’t Fix Public Health,” was changed to the complete opposite: “Opinion: Trump’s healthcare disruption could pay off — if he pushes real reform,” as seen in the published piece.\n\nReinhart quicklu called out the paper’s billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong on X on Friday, writing, “I am the author of this OpEd, which was given a misleading title and from which key lines were cut — lines that made very clear that RFK Jr. is dangerously ignorant, has absolutely no business near HHS, and is effectively a mass murderer in waiting.”\n\nThe Chicago-based writer was even more blunt on Bluesky, where he wrote, “My first and definitely last time working with the Los Angeles Times. Editing out the most urgent point of an OpEd in the minutes before sending to press while then also assigning a title and image that suggest an argument entirely opposite to the author’s clear intent is pretty shi–y.”\n\nOn X, Reinhart added, “A vote for RFK Jr. is a vote for nothing but chaos, the opposite of the essential public-systems building I argue for in the OpEd, and mass death.”\n\nHe further clarified that he expects headlines to change and for pieces to be edited, “But editing out a very central and timely point in the minutes before sending to press while then also assigning a title and image that suggest an argument entirely opposite to the author’s clear intent is bad.”\n\nSoon-Shiong’s recent actions at the newspaper, including killing a pre-election endorsement for Kamala Harris, have prompted several resignations from top editors. Columnist Harry Litman cited what he called the tech billionaire’s “shameful capitulation to Trump” as his reason for resigning in December.\n\nDuring confirmation hearings this week, Kennedy tried to distance himself from his previous anti-vaccine stance, but senators, including Bernie Sanders, had ample evidence from previous statements and public appearances.\n\nKennedy’s cousin, Caroline Kennedy, has also condemned him as a “predator” who has “gone on to misrepresent, lie and cheat his way through life.”","summary":"\"Key lines were cut -- lines that made very clear that RFK Jr. ... is effectively a mass murderer in waiting,\" Eric Reinhart says\n\n\nThe post LA Times Owner Slammed for Cutting RFK Jr. Criticism From Writer&#8217;s Op-Ed appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/la-times-owner-changed-rfk-article-writer-eric-reinhart/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Patrick-LA-Times-owner.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 18:05:51","author":"Sharon Knolle","authors":["Sharon Knolle"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.383},{"id":285828176,"title":"Trump puts blame on DEI for plane crash. It's meant to exhaust us | Opinion - Detroit Free Press","text":"My eyes couldn’t believe what I was reading: President Donald Trump called Wednesday night’s tragic plane crash a product of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion hiring.\n\nTrump had just finished a moment of silence for the victims of the plane crash — the midair collision of a regional jet and a U.S. Army helicopter at a Washington airport killed 67 — when he turned the moment into a political launching pad.\n\n“We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” Trump said. “I changed the Obama standards from very mediocre at best to extraordinary.\n\n“You remember that. Only the highest aptitude. They have to be the highest intellect and psychologically superior people were allowed to qualify for air traffic controllers. That was not so prior to getting there.”\n\nThose comments and others sent folks into a tizzy. An upset white journalist in Pittsburgh sent the story to me first, but soon it was all over my social media feeds.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWho could blame them? It was an irresponsible move by the president, blaming the administrations of Barack Obama and Joe Biden (omitting that he served a term between them) without any evidence that a person of color, someone from the LBGQ+ community, a woman, or a person with a disability were involved with the crash. And it came just days after Trump issued an executive order ending affirmative action in federal contracting, and ending federal DEI programs from anti-bias training to funds for farmers and homeowners. \n\nAt issue: Trump is alleging that the Federal Aviation Administration has somehow lowered the standards for air traffic controllers in order to include DEI hires.\n\nBut what it inherently said to Black people — Black Detroiters, who make up 77% of this city — was that the people responsible for Wednesday's crash were in “one of those Black jobs.”\n\n“I have common sense, OK?” Trump said, as quoted by CNN, when pressed what evidence he had to the blame the Biden and Obama administrations. “Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t.”\n\nTrump added the FAA must hire only the most qualified.\n\n“… In 2016, I made that change very early on, because I always felt this was a job that, and other jobs too, but this was a job that had to be superior intelligence, and we didn’t really have that.\n\n“And we had it. And then when I left office and Biden took over, he changed them back to lower than ever before. Their policy was horrible and their politics was even worse.\"\n\nMore from Freep Opinion:Trump's anti-trans executive order is breathtaking cruelty\n\n'Make America pre-Reconstruction again'\n\nAs of Thursday night, there were no survivors after the midair collision, the deadliest U.S. air disaster in more than 20 years. U.S. authorities said the causes of the crash were not yet clear. The American Airlines Bombardier jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew members collided with the Army Black Hawk helicopter and crashed into the Potomac River as it prepared to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Wednesday night. The investigation into the crash in the nation's capital is just beginning.\n\nThe names of all the victims have not yet been released, but it included a number of promising young figure skaters and others traveling from Kansas, where the flight originated. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, told Reuters that the dead included citizens from Russia, the Philippines and Germany.\n\nIn what should have been a news conference to discuss the deadliest plane crash since 2001, somehow the president found a way to inject DEI into the mix.\n\nIt was not only a slap in the face of those who, only hours ago, lost family members, but to what DEI represents.DEI is not a handout, as the president suggests, but a starting point for those who historically have been left behind. The purpose of DEI in hiring is not to hand jobs to unqualified candidates, but to ensure that qualified candidates from marginalized communities have a fair opportunity to compete.\n\nIn Detroit, it’s much like making contractors include 30% of women and minorities on major construction jobs, like the casinos, Comerica Park, Ford Field and Campus Martius projects in the late 1990s.\n\n“The tragedy of this lie is the fact that it covers up the DEI appointments (Trump) had made for unqualified people to lead the Defense Department, Health and Human services, FBI, Intelligence and Education, to name only a few,” said the Rev. Wendell Anthony, Detroit Branch NAACP president.\n\nWhat Trump is after, Anthony said, is what he calls, “White Exclusivity Inclusion.”\n\n“This will not make America ‘great again,’” Anthony said. “This will make America pre-Reconstruction again. We must be better than this.”\n\nMore from Freep Opinion:What it will take to survive a 2nd Trump presidency\n\nIt's only been two weeks\n\nIt’s hard to believe Trump has only been in office since Jan. 20.\n\nIn response to Trump’s anti-DEI executive order, the U.S. Department of Defense’s intelligence agency announced that they’ll eliminate activities for Martin Luther King Day, Black History Month, the Holocaust Day of Remembrance and Pride Month.\n\nOthers are skeptical about opening up the formerly classified files about the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which may — after more than 50 years — reveal infidelity or other misdeeds by the Civil Rights icon.\n\nThese incidents are triggering to some Detroiters, and infuriating to others.\n\nI say to them, paraphrasing football coach Dennis Green: Trump is who we thought he was.\n\nThe president is operating by the same playbook he used during his first term, and what promised during the campaign. Less than two weeks into his regime, it’s felt like nearly a year already. Surely there is much more to come.\n\nThe scary part to some — and praised by his campaign supporters — is that this is exactly what America signed up for at the ballot box.\n\nMore from Freep Opinion:Trump is making good on his promises, and I couldn't be more excited\n\nUse your outrage carefully\n\nFor those who oppose his policies, it must require some restraint when he pops off with his usual rhetoric. It’s the same as when he said “the whole country will end up like Detroit if (Kamala Harris) is your president. You’re going to have a mess on your hands.”\n\nThere’s certainly more to come.\n\nAs long as what Trump says won’t permanently harm the country, don’t let it fester inside of yourself, even when it’s something you know is untrue. You’ll be doing yourself a favor. Their strategy is to exhaust and overwhelm us. We have to keep our eyes on the ball.\n\nFor incidents such as Thursday, it’s OK to get upset for a while, get it off your chest and find a way to let it roll off your back.\n\nWhat the president said Thursday was inexcusable and reprehensible — to make an American tragedy about anything other than the 67 people who lost their lives in a plane crash. Their families are at least owed some time to process and grieve a horrible incident in front of the world.\n\nThe division has begun in Trump’s new term. What Trump decided to say was reprehensible, no doubt. But we must find a way to rise above this and not let it permanently take room in yourself and let it harm your wellbeing.\n\nOtherwise, this presidential term will go by much slowly than you want it to.\n\nDarren A.

The next DNC chair, Harrison said, needs to insist that the party not be a “rubber stamp” to its presidential candidate.\n\nHere are excerpts from that conversation:\n\nWhy did Harris and Democrats lose the White House?\n\nHARRISON: “I don’t know that there’s one answer. A lot of people like to come up with things, and they say it’s the economy. Well, it could have been a part of it. I think every state had their own little nuance. In Michigan, the Palestinian issue played something there.”\n\n“The gap in which she lost wasn’t huge, but when you add up little pockets where it’s, some people because of Gaza, some people because of the economy, some people because she was a woman. And I think in many of those states, those little nicks here and there added up to how she lost in some of those states.”\n\nDid Harris’ shortened campaign timeline hurt her chances?\n\nHARRISON: “Had she had more runway, it would have been probably easier for her and for the campaign. We were building a race for Joe Biden.”\n\n“Joe Biden gave the State of the Union, people said it was one of the best State of the Unions that we’ve ever seen. Then we move forward to the debate, and people were like, that was a horrible debate performance. And then my thought was: ‘Joe Biden secured the nomination. The primary was done, and so, I’m a loyal guy. We’re riding with Biden.’”\n\n“And if you look at the other side, in terms of Republicans, Donald Trump had just been convicted, how many times for all these felonies? And you didn’t hear a peep from the Republicans, in terms of like, ‘We need to jettison Donald Trump, and we need to open up a new primary, and we need to do this and that.’ And so sometimes, I think, Democrats can learn something in terms of, let’s put a line of defense around our folks and defend them as well.”\n\nShould Democrats have stuck with Biden?\n\nHARRISON: “That’s my normal default, is that you stick by your people, right, particularly people who have worked hard on behalf of the party.”\n\n“I went into this thinking, OK, you’ve got probably the most successful of my lifetime legislative president who has poured tons of money into making sure that not just Joe Biden and Kamala Harris get elected, but Democrats get elected — not just in the battleground states, but all states who support a lot of resources and his own time fundraising in order to strengthen the state parties.”\n\n“And then when he hits a roadblock, when he hits a bump in the road, do we stick with him, or do we jettison him? That’s the mentality that I had going into this. And my nature is, ‘I’m on the team with you, you’re my quarterback. You got sacked a few times. But you know what? I’m going to block the hell out of the next person that’s coming at you.’ And that is not always the mentality of everybody in my party. And so sometimes, people look on the sidelines, ready to call in the backup.”\n\nWas the party prepped for a possible candidate switch?\n\nHARRISON: “I had a very small group to whom I basically said, just game out for me what happens … if I have to do something, because people were asking for a big primary and this and that — and again, we have a short time frame, and so basically it was going back to the rules.”\n\n“I didn’t even talk to all of the people in my inner circle. There were two staffers … just in case anything happened, I wanted to make sure that I knew what we could do. And so we had some structure for what something would look like.”\n\nDid Harris act quickly enough to start acquiring support?\n\nHARRISON: “She was literally on it. I wanted to get a sense of whether or not we were going to have a lot of people who were going to throw their hats in the ring.”\n\n“And so I started making phone calls just asking, ‘I’m sure you’ve heard the news about the president,’ and to a person, they’re saying, ‘I just got off the phone with the vice president, and I’m pledging my support.’ I must have been chasing her calls, because literally, I’m calling, and everyone said, ‘Well, I’m supporting her.’”\n\nWhat changes does the DNC need to make?\n\nHARRISON: “The DNC shouldn’t just be a rubber stamp to whatever the campaign wants.”\n\n“You don’t always have a seat at the table, in terms of, you take all of the arrows and the responsibility. People want to give you all the blame, but you don’t have the power to make those decisions, and I really think there needs to be reapportionment of a better, a greater balance.”\n\n“I did not always have a seat at the table, was not always invited in the room. And I just think that is inherently problematic because of the perspectives that you bring.”\n\nDo Democrats need to work harder with nonwhite voters?\n\nTrump gained larger shares of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost those groups to Biden, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters.\n\nHARRISON: “People think, well, it’s just about turnout in the Black community, right? It’s just about turnout with this group. No, it’s not. It’s more than just turnout. It’s about persuasion. You have to persuade people why you are the best person for them. You have to talk to them about the issues that are important to them. You have to show them that you really are fighting for them, and that means having those individual conversations, but having targeted conversations specifically geared towards the people that you’re talking to.”\n\n“You cannot take anybody for granted. You cannot just assume just because you’re a Black man, you’re gonna vote for a Democrat.”\n\nHow has the DNC changed under your leadership?\n\nHarrison, who lost his 2020 Senate campaign against South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham but broke fundraising records during his run, said he has no immediate political plans. He didn’t close the door on another campaign. He has long been mentioned as a possible future contender for the seat held for decades by his mentor, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nHARRISON: “I’m proud of what we started here at the DNC. I created a red-state fund, where we’re pouring more money into those red states to help them rebuild the infrastructure. But there’s a lot more that has to be done.”\n\n“I’ve been thinking to myself, wouldn’t it be appropriate for another southerner, another South Carolinian, a former DNC chair, to figure out how to re-establish the Democratic Party back in the South? And so I think I’m going to spend my time doing that.”","summary":"Jaime Harrison is reflecting on why his party lost to Trump.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/01/31/dnc-outgoing-chair-jaime-harrison/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DNC_Chair_What_to_Watch_50033_73d94e.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 17:50:17","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.436},{"id":285825898,"title":"David Hogg Knows Why Democrats Lost Young Voters","text":"The conference room where David Hogg is mounting his bid for vice chair of the Democratic National Committee has exposed brick and a nice view of a specific Washington D.C. landmark, but he’s asked me not to disclose which one. Ever since his high school was shot up on Valentine’s Day seven years ago, and Hogg became one of the faces of the student-led movement for gun control, he has had to be careful about sharing details like that. He’s been doxed, his parent’s home was swatted, and he’s gotten used to heavily armed men showing up at his public appearances, demanding to speak with him. \n\n On Tuesday afternoon, Hogg was sitting at the table in that conference room, staring at a spreadsheet containing some 450-odd names of individuals voting in the DNC elections this Saturday. He was working through the sheet one cell at a time, making the case for his candidacy over the phone to everyone from a DNC member in the Northern Mariana Islands to the Democratic mayor of mid-sized Midwestern city. \n\n The short version of the pitch is obvious: Democrats absolutely hemorrhaged young voters in the last cycle, and Hogg — a 24-year-old Harvard grad who has spent virtually every spare moment of the past seven years organizing, registering, and working to elect members of Gen Z — understands this particular demographic in way most prominent voices in the party don’t. \n\n “This election was much more an indictment, frankly, of our party than it was of our country,” Hogg says.\n\n In his view, there is not one reason why so young people deflected from the Democratic Party — there are many. Members of Gen Z “do not have the privilege of being single-issue voters,” Hogg says. “We had to grow up worrying about dying in a school shooting today, or dying of climate change tomorrow, and then being crushed by student debt and the housing crisis in between… and I think on the issue of Gaza in particular, it was emblematic of the fact that people felt like we were not listening to them — that we didn’t care.”\n\n The bigger problem — and the one he is committed to addressing if he wins a spot in DNC leadership — is a growing deficit of trust. “Young people do not trust political parties, and I don’t think this election, the shift to the right, was a reflection of the fact that young people have an enormous amount of faith in the Republican Party… It’s more testament to the fact that they have lost faith in us, as a party to deliver for them.” \n\n The son of a teacher and an FBI agent, Hogg lived in Southern California until the fifth grade, when his father was diagnosed with early on-set Parkinson’s disease. With his father medically retired, the family realized “we probably would not be able to continue to afford to pay our mortgage in California,” Hogg recalls. “We moved out to Florida — to Parkland — because it was the safest community that we could find.”\n\n He was in the last half of his senior year when a 19-year-old former student stormed the halls of his high school with an AR-15, murdering 17 people and injuring 17 more. During the lockdown, Hogg recorded video of himself interviewing fellow students. The footage was aired by a local TV station, a succession of cable news interviews followed, and he quickly emerged as one of the massacre’s most outspoken survivors. \n\n At the time of the shooting, Maxwell Frost lived across the state. Frost was 21, and working as an organizer for the American Civil Liberties Union. He DMed a few students, offering to help, and one of them wrote back with an address. It was three hours away, but Frost packed a bag and jumped in his car. “I got there 2 a.m., pulled up to a house, and there was David and all the March for Our Lives founders sitting criss-cross on the floor of a living room figuring out what to do after their school just got shot up,” recalls Frost, now a congressman representing Orlando.\n\n An estimated 1.7 million participated in that first march, which took place in Washington D.C., and thousands more joined satellite protests around the country, making it one of the largest demonstrations in U.S. history. When they got back to Florida, Hogg and his cohort successfully pressured lawmakers to raise the age to buy a gun to 21, and to pass a red flag law. According to Hogg, that law has been used at least 19,000 times since the shooting at Stoneman Douglas.\n\n But the work of getting that legislation passed took a toll on all of the students, says X Gonzalez, a classmate of Hogg’s. “We were taught that if people want to effect change, they go to their legislators, and they raise the issue, and the legislators listen to the people, and then they make the change,” Gonzalez says. Those illusions were quickly shattered. They recall feeling like the two of them — Gonzalez and Hogg — were deliberately made into caricatures to make it easier for lawmakers to brush their concerns aside: “Legislators were like: ‘You’re a skinhead lesbian, and you are a robot built by the Left.”\n\n Like Hogg’s, Gonzalez’s profile grew after the shooting, fueled by their righteous denunciation of the National Rifle Association, but Gonzalez noticed a difference in the way they each were regarded by the public. “People were very forgiving of me, in my feeling of my emotions,” Gonzalez says; Hogg on the other hand was labeled a crisis actor by Alex Jones, likened to a Nazi on Breitbart, mocked by Laura Ingrahamt. “Obviously it affected him,” Gonzalez says. “But he understood the motives behind it, [and recognized it as] much more than a personal attack… He was like: They don’t know me. If anyone is against this, clearly they’re in favor of people dying every day due to gun violence… They’re trying to confuse that fact by saying incendiary things and going viral on Twitter.”\n\n Eventually, it got to be too much for them: “It was killing me,” Gonzalez says. Virtually every other person in the original March For Our Lives cohort stepped back from activism at a certain point to focus on themselves. Everyone except Hogg. “I had conversations with him like: Why? Why don’t you want to enjoy your life? He likes surfing; he’s a beach-dwelling person. I was like: Why can’t you let go a little bit? Give your body back to yourself,” Gonzalez says. “But he just can’t let go when he knows there is a problem.” \n\n Back in 2018, when March for Our Lives was still getting started, Hogg thought he would run for office one day. But he’s sober about the fact that his activism has made him a polarizing figure. “I’m such a lightning rod for Republicans, specifically because of my views on guns. They would raise twice as much money fear-mongering about me being in Congress than I ever could hope to raise for myself,” he says. It’s also the reason why he started a PAC, Leaders We Deserve, to help elect young candidates. “With this role, I’m able to help get 20 to 30 phenomenal young progressives elected to state legislatures, and Congress all over the country, and help grow the power of young people in our party much more than I would be if I was just one person.”\n\n The idea of running for DNC vice chair appealed to him for similar reasons — and because he’s furious about the outcome of the 2024 campaign. One of the biggest driving factors for Democrats’ loss in 2024 was massive drop in support from 18-29 year olds. Hogg remembers hearing the staggering figures — a 20-point shift to the right — when a Kamala Harris campaign pollster shared her findings with the DNC after the election. He recalls looking around the room during that briefing. “I did not see a single person in that room under the age of 30,” he says. \n\n For months leading up to the election, Hogg says he was raising alarms about young voters opting away from the Democrats. “I was trying to say, like, ‘Hey guys, this is a problem.’ And this was repeatedly written off by different sycophants and consultants throughout the party that told me that it wasn’t a problem. It sucks, because here we are, and we’re seeing the disastrous effects of that — and the disaster effects of our party surrounding itself with people who only tell it what it wants to hear.”\n\n The reason why Democrats lost ground with young people — and with Americans more broadly — in 2024, in Hogg’s view, is pretty simple: “People felt like we were not listening to them.”\n\n In poll after poll, people were saying: Joe Biden is too old, the cost of living is too high, the war in Gaza needs to end, but the party was not responding to those signals — any of them. “Rents skyrocketed for the past four years, and our party has done such a good job of making our consultants so fabulously wealthy that they’ve become detached from that reality. If you own a house and you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your cost of living, in terms of how much it costs for you to have your home, it’s actually going down over time,” he says. \n\n Even now, after the fact, he says, it still feels like no one is listening. “We went out there for eight years saying ‘Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. If he’s elected, the world is going to end and democracy is over.’ And then he got elected, and after he was elected, [Democrats] effectively said: ‘Well, guys, there isn’t anything different we could have done. Let’s throw our hands up in the air, and we’ll see you again in four years. And we hope that you keep donating [and opening] our bullshit emails that treat you like an ATM instead of a human being.’”\n\n Hogg does not exempt himself entirely from blame. Eighteen months ago, he says, he was invited to the White House for a one-on-one in the Oval Office with President Joe Biden. “The first thing he asked me was, ‘How do we win young voters?’ I wish that I told him — and I know I would have been kicked out of the White House and probably ostracized more broadly within the party — but what I wish I had said is that he needed to drop out.”\n\n His willingness to publicly admit that Biden should have left the 2024 presidential race sooner sets Hogg apart from the DNC’s outgoing chair, Jaime Harrison — as well as several of the candidates running to replace him. \n\n The turning point for Hogg — the moment he resolved to seek a bigger role in the party — came this summer, after the Democratic National Convention in August. I remember seeing him posing for selfies with the throngs of young cocktail-and-coconut-swilling revelers at a convention after party. He looked like he was having the time of his life, and he had reason to celebrate — Leaders We Deserve, the Super PAC he founded last year — raised more than $8 million on behalf of 12 candidates. (Five won, seven lost.)\n\n But after the convention, he flew back to Florida, where he was back in front of a computer, pouring over a different Excel spreadsheet. His father’s health had taken a turn for the worst. “He just stopped eating. We did everything we could to get him to eat and make him better, and he just refused,” Hogg says quietly. “When he was in hospice, we needed to have at least 12 hours a day of care for him. I had to make a spreadsheet to figure out how long we could afford to keep him alive, because — even though he was a veteran and retired FBI agent with relatively good health care — his cost of at-home care was going to be $19,000 a month.”\n\n “The only reason my family didn’t go bankrupt is because my dad didn’t live long enough for that to happen,” he says. “No one should ever have to make that calculation, and increasingly, it is one that too many Americans are having to make as our population gets older. And the only way we’re going to address that is with our government. There’s no market solution that’s going to fix that.”\n\n “That’s why I’m running for this position,” Hogg says. “I’ve been impacted by that failed political system far too much, and I want to fucking fix it.”","summary":"The Parkland survivor and DNC vice chair candidate on the “failed political system” and how Democrats can win back America’s youth","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/david-hogg-democrats-dnc-1235251469/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/David-Hogg-lead-new.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 17:50:02","author":"Tessa Stuart,Tessa Suart","authors":["Tessa Stuart","Tessa Suart"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":285833074,"title":"Democrats rally around lightning rod issue during unruly DNC debate despite voter backlash in 2024","text":"There was a heavy focus on systemic racism and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs during the final debate among the eight candidates vying to chair the Democratic National Committee (DNC), as the party aims to exit the political wilderness.

In October, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News alleging election interference over its handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of aiding his Democratic rival through deceptive editing. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that CBS parent company Paramount Global was considering settling the suit ahead of a planned merger that ultimately must pass muster with the new Trump administration. The New York Times reported on Thursday night that \"settlement discussions between representatives of Paramount and Mr. Trump are now underway,\" citing \"three people with knowledge of the talks.\" TRUMP SUES CBS NEWS FOR $10 BILLION ALLEGING 'DECEPTIVE DOCTORING' OF HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW The Times added that there is \"no assurance\" the talks will result in a deal but \"Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, strongly supports the effort to settle.\" \"Many executives at CBS’s parent company, Paramount, believe that settling the lawsuit would increase the odds that the Trump administration does not block or delay their planned multibillion-dollar merger with another company, according to several people with knowledge of the matter,\" the Times reported. The Wall Street Journal previously suggested Paramount honchos wanted to reach a deal ahead of a merger with Skydance Media. Ed Paltzik, an attorney for President Trump, said CBS needs to be held accountable. \"President Donald J. Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in deception and fake news accountable. CBS and its parent company Paramount deceived the American People by unlawfully tampering with their interview of Kamala Harris, and then hiding the transcript from the public in an attempt to save the failing, and now failed, Harris campaign, all in desperate commercial pursuit of increased profit and viewership,\" Paltzik told Fox News Digital. \"Real accountability for CBS and Paramount will ensure that the President is compensated for the harm done to him, and will deter the Fake News from further distorting the facts to advance a partisan agenda,\" Paltzik continued. \"President Trump looks forward to seeing this case through to a just conclusion.\" CBS NEWS STATEMENT ON CONTROVERSIAL ’60 MINUTES’ EDIT FALLS FLAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA: 'PUBLISH. THE. TRANSCRIPT.' Trump’s lawsuit focused on an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker. In a preview clip that aired on \"Face the Nation,\" Harris was asked why it seemed like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t listening to the U.S. \"Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,\" Harris responded in the \"Face the Nation\" clip. Harris was mocked by conservatives for offering a lengthy \"word salad\" to Whitaker. But when that same question aired the following night in the primetime election special, a shorter, more focused answer from the vice president followed. \"We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,\" Harris said in the primetime special. Critics accused CBS News of editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the vice president from further backlash. Trump lawyers argue that news organizations \"are responsible for accurately representing the truth of events, not distorting an interview to try and falsely make their preferred candidate appear coherent and decisive, which Kamala most certainly is not.\" CBS News and Paramount did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. TRUMP SENDS LETTER TO CBS DEMANDING UNEDITED ‘60 MINUTES’ HARRIS TRANSCRIPT, TEASES POTENTIAL LAWSUIT CBS News previously refused to release the full transcript, citing the First Amendment, and rejected the assertion that it had \"doctored\" the Harris interview to mislead the American people. The network insisted that \"the interview was not doctored\" and that the program \"did not hide any part of the vice president’s answer to the question at issue.\" CBS settlement speculation comes just weeks after ABC News settled its defamation lawsuit filed by Trump, resulting in giving him $15 million and a written apology.

The only certainty happens to be the most significant: they will be in office together for four years.\n\nIt is rare for a prime minister and a president to have the luxury of knowing – barring extreme unpredictabilities, such as death or incapacity – they have a full term in harness. And personal chemistry matters. \n\nTrump emphasises (rather too much for the liking of America’s allies) the deal, the handshake, the gaze; the bond that only the lonely, only those who lead, can have. Starmer emphasises level-headedness (although his government has not been particulary conspicuous in evincing it). \n\nOpposites may well attract, but the precedents for coterminous presidents and prime ministers are not encouraging. John Major and Bill Clinton, elected seven months apart, spent 1992 to 1997 together. But in the very definition of what not to do before an election, London had made its preference for the result of the election in America known – and the other guy won. The Conservative and the Democrat were no more than coolly cordial thereafter.\n\nOn his re-election in 2001, Tony Blair knew he had George W. Bush for at least four years – it turned out to be eight – but the consequences for him were disastrous once the two decided to partake in a war on “terror”.\n\nIn 1964, Harold Wilson and Lyndon Johnson were elected almost simultaneously, and spent 1964 to 1968 together. Though they were Labour and Democrat, and therefore from sister parties, it was not a harmonious pairing. Wilson’s meddling in, but lack of support for, Johnson’s war in Vietnam was a source of unbridled irritation in the White House.\n\nTrump and May\n\nThe last time Trump became president, Theresa May was prime minister and she travelled with undisguised haste to the White House. There she achieved a highly untypical diplomatic coup in getting Trump to commit publicly to Nato (that bars should be so low was a general feature of the presidency). \n\nTheir subsequent relationship was, however, toxic. No prime minister has been less likely to gaze, to bond (despite pictures of them holding hands), and the president held her as having mangled Brexit, a bid for freedom with which he was keen to associate himself.\n\nBefore the US election, Starmer displayed a unfamiliar deftness of touch, and banked some credit. His immediate phone call to candidate Trump following an attempt on his life in July was both bold and smart. There followed the fabled Trump Tower two-hour chicken dinner.\n\nIt was more typical for Starmer that when it emerged, in a most unfortunate echo of 1992, Labour activists – and Starmer’s own pollster – were working on the Kamala Harris campaign, Trump’s people cried foreign interference and threatened legal action.\n\nAnd the two in Starmer’s team who will have the most exposure to the new administration have both been publicly rude about Trump. David Lammy, now foreign secretary, called him “deluded, dishonest, xenophobic [and] narcissistic” in 2019. \n\nPeter Mandelson, nominated but not yet confirmed as the UK ambassador to the US, has made comments about Trump being a “bully” and a “danger to the world”. To appease opposition in DC on his appointment, Mandelson has since turned on a sixpence (or perhaps a dime).\n\nThis is, at root, about Trump. No other president would have attracted such comments from frontline politicians. But from TV studio to TV studio, Lammy and Mandelson will have those quotes hung about their necks as if they were modern-day ancient mariners. Starmer’s innate caution in public utterance, in this area at least, has inured him.\n\nIndeed, the repercussions of his unusual boldness in picking Mandelson over a career diplomat may discourage Starmer from ever thinking imaginatively again.\n\nMost members of the Trump administration would be naturally hostile to a Labour government even without its leading figures insulting their boss or campaigning for his opponent. Certainly, the grounds for disagreement are great: the threat of tariffs, demanded increases in defence spending, the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, co-operation with China and support for Ukraine.\n\nThus Morgan McSweeney – architect of Labour’s 2024 victory, planner of its re-election and Starmer’s chief of staff – flew out to meet Susie Wiles, his equivalent in the White House. (It did not, a person privy to such information told me, go well. Voices were raised.)\n\nElon Musk, this moment’s most prominent presidential acolyte inveighed on X, “Starmer must go”, adding for good measure, “He is a national embarrassment.” It is indeed embarrassing – for Starmer – but he will be consoled with the well-founded suspicion that the life-expectancy of Musk and Trump’s tech bromance will be much less than four years.\n\nCause for self-reflection\n\nThe return of Trump, emboldened and more powerful than before, has effectively forced the posing of the age-old question: over which expanse of sea should Britain gaze – the Channel or the Atlantic? Churchill thought it should – and that only Britain could – do both.\n\nHence, perhaps, Trump’s own public statement about the possible destination of his first international trip: “It could be UK. Traditionally, it’s been UK.”\n\nIt hasn’t. Only Jimmy Carter, in 1977, and Joe Biden, in 2021, visited the UK first – and then because of summits. More than a few presidents (most recently Ford and Johnson) didn’t visit at all.\n\nBut even what might have been a supportive comment was laced with arsenic: “Last time, I went to Saudi Arabia because they agreed to buy 450 billion dollars’ worth of United States merchandise … And if that offer were right, I’d do that again.” Which at least may free the British government to be as unsentimentally transactional.\n\nTrump and Starmer achieved big victories, albeit when painted in the most flattering terms. Starmer’s came on a historically low combination of vote share and voter turnout, Trump’s with fewer votes than Biden. But Trump will like that Starmer won a large majority. When May managed to lose hers in 2017, what little respect Trump had for her went with it.\n\nStarmer would much rather have had four years with Biden, and even more with Harris, another public prosecutor of the left. But he has to deal with the transatlantic relationship as it is, rather than as he would wish it to be, and this one is most unlikely to be special.\n\nStarmer is, moreover, a realist. Which is why he’ll also know that the second Trump presidency will be much more consequential than the first. Caution may have limited effect.","summary":"Relations between presidents and prime ministers aren’t always easy, even without Elon Musk weighing in with his views.","url":"https://theconversation.com/how-should-keir-starmer-handle-donald-trump-and-hows-it-going-so-far-248697","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/645818/original/file-20250130-15-fi1lij.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=12%2C103%2C1425%2C711&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 16:18:42","author":"Martin Farr,Newcastle University,Senior Lecturer in Contemporary British History","authors":["Martin Farr","Newcastle University","Senior Lecturer in Contemporary British History"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":285889740,"title":"Will CBS News' parent company settle Trump’s ‘frivolous’ 60 Minutes lawsuit to secure huge merger?","text":"Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, is currently in discussions with Donald Trump’s legal team about settling the president’s $10 billion lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview that the network says is “completely without merit,” and legal experts have labeled “frivolous and dangerous.” \n\nThe possibility of a settlement, first reported by The New York Times, comes as Paramount looks to complete a merger with Skydance Media. This deal requires regulatory approval from the FCC, which is now led by Trump-appointed Brendan Carr. Carr, meanwhile, has already indicated that the 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris would be part of the agency’s review of the merger and, in fact, ordered the network this week to hand over the entire unedited transcript along with all of the film footage.\n\nAny settlement would be seen as effectively bending the knee to the president, especially at a time when Trump and his allies have relished the opportunity to use the federal government to punish his media critics. Besides suggesting that CBS would be investigated over the interview, Carr recently ordered a probe into NPR and PBS regarding their financial sponsors. \n\nParamount settling with Trump would also come after ABC News’ parent company Disney decided to pay the president $15 million (along with $1 million to his lawyers) to settle his lawsuit against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos, who said Trump had been found “liable of rape” in the E. Jean Carroll defamation trial. The jury had instead found the president liable for sexual abuse, though the judge noted there was no material difference between Trump’s actions and rape. \n\nThat settlement prompted First Amendment and press organizations to warn about the “chilling effect” Trump could have on the free press, adding that “there is concern that we are embarking on some scary times.”\n\nEarlier this week, Facebook’s parent company Meta revealed that it agreed to pay Trump $25 million to settle his complaint over the social media platform banning him following the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump’s account has since been restored, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been cozying up to Trump in recent months.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that Paramount will agree to a deal with Trump’s legal team, and it is unclear what a possible settlement would even entail, The New York Times reported that Paramount head Shari Redstone is fully behind settling. Redstone, whose father founded Paramount, would make billions of dollars off the merger with Skydance, which is backed by Trump-boosting billionaire Larry Ellison and run by his son David. \n\nParamount offering up a major concession to the president would also not be taken kindly by the newsroom at CBS, particularly because the network dismissed Trump’s complaint – which was filed just before the election – as “false” and “completely without merit” and that it intended to “vigorously defend” against the lawsuit.\n\nIn his Status News newsletter, Oliver Darcy reported that CBS News chief Wendy McMahon and 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens “have made it crystal clear that they oppose any settlement with the Trump team and do not wish to cave on this front.”\n\nIn his lawsuit, which was filed in Texas to test the state’s law on false advertising, Trump accused 60 Minutes of “partisan and unlawful acts of election and voter interference” intended to “mislead the public and attempt to tip the scales” of the presidential election in Harris’s favor. The complaint centers on the network airing a preview of Harris’s interview with Bill Whitaker on Face the Nation that included a different answer to a question than the version aired on 60 Minutes. \n\n“To paper over Kamala's ‘word salad’ weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” Trump’s lawsuit alleged.\n\n“The interview was not doctored,” the network said at the time. “60 Minutes did not hide any part of Vice President Kamala Harris's answer to the question at issue. 60 Minutes fairly presented the interview to inform the viewing audience, and not to mislead it.”\n\nCBS has also argued that Trump has no standing in Texas to file the lawsuit and has filed motions to dismiss it. Meanwhile, legal and First Amendment experts have rejected the lawsuit as meritless and ridiculous.\n\n“This is a frivolous and dangerous attempt by a politician to control the news media. The Supreme Court has made it crystal clear: the First Amendment leaves it to journalists – and not the courts, the government or candidates for office – to decide how to report the news,” attorney Charles Tobin of the law firm Ballard Spahr told CNN in October.\n\n“The First Amendment was drafted to protect the press from just such litigation,” famed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams said. “Mr. Trump may disagree with this or that coverage of him, but the First Amendment permits the press to decide how to cover elections, not the candidates seeking public office.”\n\nIn the end, though, it isn’t just Trump who has been highly critical of 60 Minutes – the show has also faced scrutiny from Redstone herself. After the Anti-Defamation League claimed a 60 Minutes story featuring former State Department employees expressing concern about the United States’ handling of the war between Israel and Hamas was “one-sided and biased,” Redstone complained to CBS News executives about the piece. A day later, former CBS News president Susan Zirinsky was hired as a temporary executive editor to address “perceived bias.”\n\nRedstone’s interference came months after she made it clear that she had CBS Mornings’ co-anchor Tony Dokoupil’s back after he sparked internal backlash and admittedly violated the network’s standards and practices over his explosive interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates.","summary":"Paramount head Shari Redstone stands to clear billions of dollars once the merger with Skydance Media goes through.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cbs-news-paramount-trump-settlement-b2689946.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/12/02/SEI221060678.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 16:00:50","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":285791480,"title":"Watch the Best Performances From the FireAid Concert: From a Nirvana Reunion to Lady Gaga","text":"FireAid drew a slew of massive performances on Thursday night, all raising money to help relief efforts following the devastating LA wildfires.\n\nSpanning multiple hours, the show saw legends like Stevie Nicks, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell and more, while also bringing out newer artists, like Olivia Rodrigo, Gracie Abrams and others.

Rogan was supposedly adamant that the interview would not be conducted elsewhere, so Harris’ team had to figure out how to get her to Texas without seeming “desperate” to the press.\n\nHer team ultimately decided to host a rally in Houston, another blue Texas city, to serve two purposes: to justify Harris’ presence in the historically red state under the guise of calling attention to Texas’ restrictive abortion laws, and to satisfy Rogan’s demand that they have their interview in Austin.\n\nBefore the scheduled interview, Harris reportedly sent a team to Rogan’s studio while plans for the Houston rally were finalized. Harris was willing to accept Rogan’s terms, according to the book, so she authorized her team to let Rogan know when she’d be visiting the state. \n\nThat’s when Rogan started to act fishy, an excerpt from the book revealed.\n\n“We could do Friday, the 25th,” [Harris’ deputy campaign manager, Rob] Flaherty reportedly told Rogan’s associates on October 18.\n\n“Wish we had known about this sooner, because he has the 25th blocked out as a personal day,” a Rogan rep allegedly responded.\n\n“What about Saturday morning?” Flaherty countered, according to the book.\n\nA terse response allegedly followed: “Only if it’s before 8:30 a.m.”\n\nThe book suggests that Flaherty was mystified as to why Rogan didn’t seem eager to interview Harris. After all, Election Day was just around the corner. \n\nDays later, Harris’ campaign team realized why Rogan’s team was acting so strange: He scheduled an interview with Trump on Oct. 25, the alleged “personal day” for which Rogan’s team said he was unavailable.\n\nNews of Trump and Rogan’s interview came as a shock to anyone familiar with their on-again-off-again professional relationship. While Rogan has since become rather chummy with the president, he once called Trump “an existential threat to democracy.” He also referred to Trump as a “man baby” during a 2022 episode of his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nBut the book purports that Rogan and Trump set aside their differences and that Musk and Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, convinced them to bury the hatchet and do the interview. \n\nAnd it paid off. \n\nRogan and Trump’s conversation garnered nearly 40 million views on YouTube within three days.\n\nAs for Harris? She was hung out to dry. Rogan refused to speak with her in Washington, D.C., and she couldn’t justify a second trip to Texas so close to Election Day. Even if she could make it back to the Lone Star State, it would arguably look bad for a Democrat to twice visit a state she had no chance of winning while swing states, like Georgia and Nevada, were so close by.\n\nHarris didn’t leave Texas that weekend with nothing to show for it, of course. Her Houston rally still happened as planned, and she was joined by Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland, both of whom endorsed Harris’ candidacy. \n\nUnfortunately, Beyoncé did not sing, and the event was taking place on a Friday night, when many Texans were otherwise consumed with high school football. \n\nWhat’s worse, Trump’s interview with Rogan went viral, and the podcaster later lied by blaming the missed connection on Harris’ refusal to talk about cannabis on his show. (Notably, Harris had endorsed full legalization.) \n\nRogan later backed Trump’s bid for the presidency—one day before the election.\n\nAnd the rest, sadly, is history.","summary":"After suffering a brutal defeat this past November to President Donald Trump, former Vice President Kamala Harris received a fair deal of pushback for underperforming among young men.

Hernandez also injured Wilson’s husband, Ryan Wilson, with whom she had two sons.\n\nThe Wilsons were out celebrating their 15th wedding anniversary when Hernandez struck their car while driving westbound in the eastbound lanes of Interstate 44, as the St Louis television station KDSK reported.\n\nVictoria Wilson, 32, died of her ensuing injuries. Court documents note that Ryan Wilson endured a disabling injury to his right foot. And investigators later determined Hernandez had a blood-alcohol content of .125, over Missouri’s legal limit of .08 for most motorists.\n\nOn 5 November, the day Trump defeated Kamala Harris to clinch a second presidency, Hernandez pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated leading to a person’s death and a separate charge of DWI resulting in serious injury. Her attorneys then filed documents contending that Hernandez deserved no more than about four months in prison, saying she acknowledged her actions were deadly and shameful.\n\n“Emily’s emotional make-up will forever contain feelings of remorse, grief and shame,” Hernandez’s attorneys wrote in the filings ahead of her sentencing.\n\nThe January 6 attack on Congress was a desperate attempt to keep Trump in office after his first presidency ended in defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Hernandez pleaded guilty in federal court in January 2022 to a misdemeanor charge of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds on the day of the Capitol insurrection.\n\nAs he successfully campaigned for a return to the White House four years later, Trump promised to pardon those who participated in the attack on Congress, during which the mob of the president’s supporters beat police officers and trashed the Capitol building. Their attack was linked to several deaths, including suicides of traumatized officers.\n\nTrump has been subjected to bipartisan criticism for the sweeping clemency he afforded the Capitol attackers, including those who inflicted violence on police at the building.\n\n“It sends a message to others out there: if you use violence to keep Donald Trump in power, or use violence in the service of Donald Trump, he will have your back,” Adam Schiff, a California Democratic senator, said on NBC’s Meet the Press on 26 January. “Because he did have their back ultimately.”\n\nHernandez joined a number of pardoned Capitol attackers who have since made headlines over other brushes with the law.\n\nAmong those in that group is a man left grappling with unresolved charges in Texas of having solicited a minor. And yet another pardoned January 6 attacker was recently shot to death by police during a traffic stop in Indiana.","summary":"Emily Hernandez, 24, killed Victoria Wilson, 32, and injured her husband in a 2022 Missouri wreck\n\nOne of the US Capitol attackers pardoned by Donald Trump at the start of his second presidency has been handed a 10-year prison sentence for killing a woman in a drunk-driving crash, according to authorities.\n\nEmily Hernandez served 30 days in federal prison after she joined the mob of Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 and was photographed holding the broken nameplate of Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker at the time.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/jan-6-attacker-drunk-driving-crash","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3750f42380b0189c33b4a280a92312232725c9f8/0_163_4887_2932/master/4887.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-31 14:57:55","author":"Ramon Antonio Vargas","authors":["Ramon Antonio Vargas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":285783836,"title":"Lady Gaga debuts track written with fiance for LA wildfire victims at relief concert","text":"Lady Gaga closed out FireAid Concert for LA wildfire victims on January 30 with a new song that she wrote with her fiance Michael Polansky.

A string of recent killings has been linked to a Vallejo, California, death cult that's connected to the rationalist scene. Sex worker/data scientist Aella has more. I'll attempt an abbreviated summary, drawing from Aella's reporting, a solid SFGate explainer, and an X user named @kenthecowboy_.\n\nIn 2022, Curtis Lind, a Vallejo landlord who had been letting folks live on his property in \"trailers and containers\" was stabbed—allegedly by tenants who had stopped paying rent—with a Samurai sword. Lind shot two of his attackers and killed one of them—31-year-old Emma Borhanian. Two weeks ago, Lind was stabbed to death on his property, just before he was scheduled to testify in the case. On Tuesday, 22-year-old Maximilian Snyder was charged with the murder.\n\nThis killing is linked to six other deaths across the country. The suspected killers—the tenants-turned-delinquents who had been living as a cult—are almost all transgender and part of the Berkeley-based rationalist community, following their leader, Jack LaSota (Ziz). Some of them are romantically linked to one another: Snyder, for example, applied for a marriage license in the state of Washington back in November along with girlfriend Teresa Youngblut, the suspect in a Vermont-Canadian border shootout that killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent.\n\nBack in January 2023, 71-year-old Richard Zajko and his 69-year-old wife, Rita, a Pennsylvania couple suspected to be the parents of one of the cultists, were murdered. And all the way back in February 2018, a woman named Maia Pasek killed herself after being in heavy contact with Ziz, and seemingly under her influence (more on that in a second).\n\nThe purported cult leader, Ziz, had attended workshops at the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR). In 2019, CFAR reportedly banned both Ziz and another cult member, Gwen, from events; multiple followers started protesting the organization (even alleging transphobia). At an unclear time, possibly several years prior in 2016, Ziz started a blog, advocating \"a ruthlessly enforced altruism towards all living creatures, and to follow the principle that it's never valid to surrender\" and promoting \"the punishment of 'non-good' people, particularly those who are not vegans,\" per Aella's writeup. The group's members claimed to have invented things like \"unihemispheric sleep\" (UHS), \"a form of sleep where only one half of the brain rests at a time,\" per a writer named Apollo Mojave. \"Entering UHS requires the sleeper to be exhausted, it also has disorienting effects so they are not quite themselves. The Zizians exploit this state to convince the unwary that they are actually two people. Ziz believes themselves to be 'double good', and almost without exception tells the people she is recruiting that they are 'single good'. By doing this Ziz establishes a relationship of moral superiority over her followers.\" (Pasek reportedly killed herself after UHS experiences.)\n\nA February 2023 post from the rationalist blog LessWrong warned of this cult and possible violence, and many members of the rationalist community have made clear that the Zizians have long been unhinged and disturbed. \"Ziz preaches a doctrine of radical high-tech veganism that promotes punishing your ideological enemies,\" concludes Mojave. \"She rejects the idea of 'niceness, community, and civilization' that's often at the core of Effective Altruism and AI safety movement member concerns.\"\n\nAt various points, different Zizians have faked their own deaths, but the majority appear to be at large. \"We still don't know the whereabouts of the people in this story who aren't either dead or in custody, and we sort of expect them to continue doing murders,\" writes Aella.\n\nAir traffic control failures: The accident on Wednesday night, in which a Black Hawk helicopter crashed into an American Airlines flight attempting to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, resulted in 67 casualties—all three people aboard the military helicopter and all 64 people aboard the commercial aircraft. New information emerged yesterday about how air traffic control was short-staffed, with one person covering a job normally done by two people. A supervisor had reportedly allowed one of the controllers to go home sometime before 9:30 p.m., leaving the job to one person alone, who was managing helicopter traffic around the area as well as communicating with planes both landing and taking off.\n\n\"Controllers can use different radio frequencies to communicate with pilots flying planes and pilots flying helicopters,\" reports The New York Times. \"While the controller is communicating with pilots of the helicopter and the jet, the two sets of pilots may not be able to hear each other.\"\n\n\"Like most of the country's air traffic control facilities, the tower at Reagan airport has been understaffed for years. The tower there was nearly a third below targeted staff levels, with 19 fully certified controllers as of September 2023, according to the most recent Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, an annual report to Congress that contains target and actual staffing levels. The targets set by the F.A.A. and the controllers' union call for 30.\"\n\nOf course, just because the union said so doesn't mean it's true, but maintaining a certain high standards both for how qualified controllers are, as well as how many there are and for how long they must work, makes sense.\n\nChi Ossé, a member of the city council (formerly my representative), has started a new series, \"Why Shit Not Working,\" which chronicles the many areas of New York suckage.

What emerged through all the snide screeching and sarcastic snobbery is a Democratic Party that is pushing a Big Pharmaceutical agenda, agitating for forever wars, obsessed to the point of mania with January 6, and that believes the Army should be performing sex change operations. And they wonder why they lost the election. WHERE TRUMP'S CABINET NOMINEES STAND IN SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS In a pair of hearings featuring Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the Democrats railed against his views on food and health, while ignoring the chronic disease and overprescription of drugs for our kids he seeks to address. Sen. Bernie Sanders was specifically called out by RFK Jr. in the hearing for taking $1.5 million dollars from Big Pharma, to which the Vermont Senator shot back, \"out of $200 million!\" while insisting that money came from pharmaceutical workers. The American people aren’t dumb, they know that big pharma employees are, by and large, big fans of big pharma, and what RFK, Jr. was pointing out was that so are most Democrats in Congress. When it came to Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for director of National Intelligence, Sen. Mark Kelly D-Ariz., gravely expressed concern that her criticism of Middle East regime change wars was somehow Russian propaganda, not a legitimate policy position. To this Gabbard wisely responded, \"My fear was a repeat of the deployment of another half a million soldiers like we saw in Iraq toward what was the Obama administration’s goal, which was regime change in Syria.\" Avoiding new wars is a big part of why Trump was elected and Kamala Harris was defeated. The American people want a sound foreign policy, not simply a knee-jerk reaction to whatever dictators around the globe say or do. But the Democrats weren’t done impugning the president’s nominees. They saved particular ire for Kash Patel, who Trump tapped to head the FBI. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., leading purveyor of the Russian Collusion Hoax, at one point asked the nominee to stand and face the Capitol Police in the room while the senator discussed Patel’s efforts to help the families of those imprisoned for the Capitol riot. First of all, these are exactly the kinds of stupid antics that make Americans furious, and second, Schiff needs to realize that voters rejected Democrats' constant hemming and hawing about January 6, they just want a fair FBI that doesn’t target political enemies. Finally, in Pete Hegseth’s hearing for the top spot at the Pentagon, Democrats seemed more interested in making sure mothers can serve in combat and that the military perform sex change operations than ensuring the lethality and readiness of our armed forces. What we witnessed this month in the senate is not just a Democratic Party out of touch with the American people, but one that isn’t even in the same ideological galaxy. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Voters made clear that they want to Make America Healthy Again, they don’t want forever wars, they don’t want politics in the FBI, and they want a military focused on fighting, not social justice. The Senate Democrats seem to oppose all of this. These are the wages of a political party that has spent the last decade solely defining itself as the opposite of Trump. Whatever Trump says or does, they’re against it. It is the only platform they have left. And Trump knows and uses this fact, by putting himself on the common sense side of issue after issue, he forces Democrats, or maybe we should say tricks them, into defending the absurd and indefensible. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A glass-half-full Democrat may look at the abysmal poll numbers and say that this is natural after a big loss, or that there is plenty of time to fix it before the next election, but they have to want to fix it, and know what to fix. In order to do this, Democrats must take their laser focus away from Donald Trump and his pugnacious braggadocio and put that focus where it belongs, on the American people. If they don’t, if Democrats remain nothing more than the Anti-Trump party, then their period in the political wilderness could last a very, very long time.
