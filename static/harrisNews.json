The United States Department of Justice?”\n\nThe Department of Justice indicted the former FBI director in documents that were made public Thursday, accusing him of making false statements and obstructing justice during congressional testimony in September 2020.\n\n“No one is above the law,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. “[It] reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.”\n\nDuring her failed presidential campaign against Trump in 2024, Harris – also a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general – warned that he would go after his political enemies.\n\n“He said it, we knew he would do it,” Harris told CNN. “But it is every day, unrelenting.”\n\nThe indictment of Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017, is the first in a series of potential charges against critics of the president, who has demanded that Bondi launch swift prosecutions against his political adversaries.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday September 20, the president publicly told Bondi, “We can’t delay any longer” and called for action “now” against Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California, another frequent critic of his.\n\nTrump also replaced the U.S. attorney for the district where Comey was indicted with Lindsey Halligan, an administration official with no prior experience as a prosecutor.\n\nIn her interview with CNN, Harris also noted that Trump’s social media post had been addressed to “Pam” and suggested it had been a direct order to the attorney general.\n\nAsked if the indictment of Comey signaled the “crossing of a Rubicon,” Harris replied, “I don’t know. Define Rubicon.”\n\nIn a statement released following news of his indictment, Comey said his heart “is broken” for the Justice Department and described Trump as a “tyrant.”\n\n“My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way,” Comey said. “We will not live on our knees and you shouldn’t either.”\n\n“My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system and I am innocent, so let’s have a trial,” he added.","summary":"‘It’s frustrating, but more than that, it’s painful to see,’ Harris said, speaking to CNN Friday","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-comey-indictment-reaction-b2834733.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/23/15/02/Kamala-Harris.jpeg?crop=2715,1810,x259.5,y0&trim=0,260,0,259&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vFaop588-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-27 00:13:53","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":363833206,"title":"Springsteen says Dems too far-left for America, but Trump still belongs in 'trash heap of history'","text":"Rock star Bruce Springsteen warned that the Democratic Party has alienated Americans with its far-left policies, even as he remains a staunch critic of President Trump. Springsteen, who remains an all-American icon known for anthems like \"Born to Run,\" \"Thunder Road\" and \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" has not been shy about sharing his political views over the past few decades. The rocker campaigned for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 and President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. In an interview with Time Magazine, Springsteen revealed that he is one of many left-leaning figures who believe the Democratic Party has lost touch with everyday Americans. EX-NBC NEWS HOST CHUCK TODD LAMENTS DEMOCRATIC PARTY A 'COLLECTION OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE TRUMP' \"We’re desperately in need of an effective alternative party or for the Democratic Party to find someone who can speak to the majority of the nation. There is a problem with the language that they’re using and the way they’re trying to reach people,\" he said. Time magazine noted the irony in that left-leaning Springsteen appeals to working-class fans while being wealthy, particularly as many of his core audience have \"flocked to Trump.\" \"A lot of people bought into his lies,\" the rocker lamented to Time Magazine. \"He doesn’t care about the forgotten anybody but himself and the multibillionaires who stood behind him on Inauguration Day. \"You have to face the fact that a good number of Americans are simply comfortable with his politics of power and dominance. EX-NBC NEWS HOST CHUCK TODD LAMENTS DEMOCRATIC PARTY A 'COLLECTION OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE TRUMP' \"He’s the living personification of what the 25th Amendment and impeachment were for. If Congress had any guts, he’d be consigned to the trash heap of history,\" he concluded. In 2020, Springsteen’s 2002 hit \"The Rising\" became something of an anthem for the Biden campaign during the Democratic National Convention that year, to the point an Esquire article warned about the risk of its potential parallels with Clinton’s campaign using a \"Glee\" version of Rachel Platten's \"Fight Song.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on Springsteen’s remarks and has not received an immediate response.

The Herald’s requests for comment from the Board of Bar Overseers and Rollins were not returned on Friday.\n\nProceedings are generally triggered by allegations of misconduct against an attorney, which could lead to disbarment, resignation, or suspension by the court, public reprimand by the board, or admonition by the bar counsel, according to Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01 for Bar Discipline.\n\nRollins’ law license was suspended last spring for non-payment of registration fees. Her license was reinstated in April 2024. At that point in time, she was not listed as facing public discipline.\n\nWhile the circumstances of what alleged violation triggered the public disciplinary proceedings are unclear, the Board of Bar Overseers is listed as beginning to review the matter roughly two years after Rollins resigned in disgrace from her former position as Massachusetts U.S. Attorney.\n\nRollins stepped down in May 2023 after being scorched in two federal reports that found she abused her position, in part, by leaking false information to the media in an effort to influence the outcome of the Suffolk District Attorney’s race in favor of her preferred candidate, ex-Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo, who lost to DA Kevin Hayden.\n\nThe violation was “among other” instances of serious misconduct flagged by then-Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz in his scathing report to Congress.\n\nThe two Department of Justice reports stated that Rollins faced further discipline from the feds if she did not promptly quit.\n\nThe federal investigation was sparked by Rollins’ appearance at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser headlined by then-First Lady Jill Biden, in potential violation of the Hatch Act, after it was first reported by the Herald.\n\nThe Hatch Act, a federal law passed in 1939, limits certain political activities of — and serves as an ethical roadmap for — federal employees.\n\nSince her departure, the Herald has since reported on potential misconduct committed by Rollins during her tenure as Suffolk District Attorney. Rollins departed that role after she was appointed U.S. Attorney by former President Joe Biden, which was narrowly confirmed by the Senate in December 2021.\n\nThen-Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote after Republican senators hammered Rollins on her progressive policies and do-not-prosecute list, which has since been thrown out by her predecessor, Suffolk DA Hayden.\n\nThe Herald has reported, based on public records, that Rollins tore through her taxpayer-funded credit card during her first year as Suffolk District Attorney, for fine dining, jet-setting trips, and posh hotels, in what appears to be a blatant violation of state law.\n\nDuring her time in office as DA, Rollins spent $33,132 on her P-card — a taxpayer-paid procurement card with her name on the front. According to the state Comptroller’s office, it was her job to police the use of such cards given to her office.\n\nRollins was paid $191,000 as Suffolk DA, state payroll records show.\n\nRecords show she is now listed as a full-time employee at Roxbury Community College, where she is paid an annual rate of $109,852 as a special projects administrator focused on developing a program for formerly incarcerated people.","summary":"Disgraced former U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins, who resigned under a cloud of ethics violations, is facing “public discipline” from the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/26/disgraced-former-us-attorney-rachael-rollins-facing-public-discipline-from-from-state-bar/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AP22311778749841.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 21:05:31","author":"Gayla Cawley","authors":["Gayla Cawley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":363806212,"title":"The View audience groans in agony after Alyssa Farah Griffin makes prediction that Donald Trump will love","text":"The View's Alyssa Farah Griffin left the talk show's audience in shock after saying that Donald Trump would likely defeat Kamala Harris if the 2024 election were held again today.\n\n'I'm going to say something that makes this table and this audience very upset, but I want to tell the unvarnished truth,' Griffin, 36, said on Friday's show, during a discussion about the Democratic Party's recent lack of success with voter outreach.\n\n'I think if the election were re-held today, Donald Trump would win by the same if not a bigger margin.'\n\nThe remarks elicited groans from the crowd before co-host Joy Behar pressed Griffin on her statement.\n\n'How do you say that, though?'

The Independent answers your questions","text":"Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Ronald F. Kennedy Jr. pledged to find the ‘cause’ of autism. On Monday, September 22, 2025, the administration announced a link between autism and the use of the pain reliever acetaminophen during pregnancy.\n\n“Don’t take Tylenol,” the president said at a press conference at the White House, claiming that “there is no downside.”\n\nThis claim follows Trump and RFK Jr. 's long espoused idea that an artificial external factor, such as vaccines or the environment, is responsible for increasing autism diagnoses. Researchers and medical evidence do not back these theories. \n\nThe Independent’s Washington Bureau Chief Eric Garcia, who was diagnosed with autism in the 1990s and has been travelling around the country for years interviewing autistic people about their experiences, held a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” forum to answer your questions about autism and the administration’s fear-mongering:\n\nQ: Simple question... I know I'm not the first to think of it… Did autism exist before tylenol? Just checking.\n\nEG: Yes. The first major study on autism in the US came out in 1944 by a researcher named Leo Kanner, years before Tylenol came out on the market. Autism has likely been with us as long as there have been human beings. Some people suspect that people like Lord Cavendish might have been. Others say Mozart or Jefferson. I’ve never been in the business of speculating who is autistic and who isn’t (though in my day job, I often suspect certain elected officials or members of presidential administrations are). But the point is, autism has always been with us.​\n\nQ: What are your thoughts about the fact that neurodivergent people are more often chronically in pain, therefore they take Tylenol more often, and then have children and pass on those genetics, through no fault of Tylenol.​\n\nEG: This is actually a great question. One of my close friends, who is autistic and is a mom, dealt with hypermobility, and she mentioned how Tylenol can be one of the few sources of pain relief. Hypermobility has a hormonal component, and stigmatizing acetaminophen might make matters worse.\n\nQ: As a journalist, what aspects of the job are hardest for you as an autistic person? Which aspects are naturally stronger for you?​\n\nEG: The hardest one is that I struggle with social cues and interactions. So I know I will probably never be good at talking to sources on deep background or anything. I also don’t drive because of sensory overload. However, I am a sucker for going down a document rabbit hole. I love going through campaign finance documents or court rulings. And I am also good at being a jerk in a press gaggle or press conference and asking a really blunt question and not caring about the social ramifications. \n\nQ: Hi. I’m an autistic woman and find this political climate very hostile. When Trump/RFK Jr talk about autism, do you think they are referring to the entire spectrum? Is their issue with the support needs of disabled people, the suffering of the people themselves, or the actual autistic traits?\n\nEG: A lot of it is a willful misreading of the data. Even the CDC, which is under Kennedy’s purview, released its biennial report saying improved screening and diagnoses led to increased cases. A lot of it generally goes to fearmongering and conspiracy theories. Trump came to it the same way he’s come to many of his other conspiracy theories. RFK Jr. came to it through his environmental activism. The problem is that they now have access to all of these incredible scientists and continue to disregard the facts. The unfortunate thing is that Trump and Kennedy both have incredible megaphones, and they have diehard followers who would be receptive to whatever they say. We’ve seen how Republicans changed their views on the economy and foreign policy to go with whatever Trump said. The same could be true if he followed the science on autism and vaccines. Ironically, by nominating Kennedy, Trump has undermined the biggest accomplishment during his first presidency: The rapid rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nQ: I wanted to get your perspective on whether or not autism will remain conceptualized in the DSM as a broad spectrum or if we will return to narrower diagnoses. \n\nEG: Great question. It’s important to remember that the government doesn’t create these labels but rather the American Psychiatric Association. There is a lot of push to relabel autistic people who were once known as having “classic autism” or “low-functioning autism” as having “profound autism” and returning the label of “Asperger’s syndrome” (despite Hans Asperger’s collaboration with the Nazi regime in Austria). I tend to worry about separating them because calling something “profound” tends to set low expectations or adds more stigma that autism is a disease or that they can never accomplish much. But autistic people with high support needs still have incredible value as human beings. In addition, many people we consider “profoundly autistic” can and have gone to college, write and publish poetry or make art. I fear calling them “profound” or “severely” autistic will automatically stick people with how we perceive them rather than what they need to thrive. And this is not to diminish their needs. To the contrary. Having those labels like “high support needs” or “autistic person with intellectual disabilities” helps us determine what supports would best help someone.\n\nQ: Genuine question: If Biden were the POTUS and had said the same thing about Tylenol and autism, would you have slammed him just as hard, or praised him?\n\nEG: No question! I wrote plenty of negative stories about the Biden administration and its mismanagement of Covid, such as when his CDC director Rochelle Walensky said that Covid-19 deaths among people who were vaccinated were “people who were unwell to begin with.” I gave the Biden team hell for saying inflation was “transitory” when it was clear prices were going up. I also wrote about how Biden’s age was going to be an issue in the 2024 election before the debate, and his campaign needed to be upfront about it and not cavalier. I criticized Biden in my book for not releasing a disability policy in the 2020 campaign until he won the Democratic nomination for president (fun fact: Kamala Harris released the first disability policy in that primary, and I criticized her too). \n\nQ: I have two young kids with ASD diagnoses, and I am deeply disturbed and scared, and trying to figure out how to navigate this environment. What are your thoughts on supporting children in this moment?​\n\nEG: I’ll say what I’ve always said, which is that autistic people need your love, especially now more than ever. That love will power you to build a better world and fight for accommodations, and make it easier for the next people who come after you. Love and acceptance are contagious, and they set an example. \n\nQ: How are you taking care of yourself as an autistic man covering all this nonsense?\n\nEG: Ha! I talked about this with my mom on Sunday before all this, and I said that covering this actually gives me a sense of purpose. When I am covering the normal politics of the day, I am chasing the same stories everyone else is. But when I cover autism, I have been writing about it for a decade and focused on including autistic voices, so it gives me a strong sense of direction I probably otherwise wouldn’t have amid the Trump chaos.","summary":"The Independent answered your questions about the Trump administration’s fear-mongering on autism during a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything’ forum","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rfk-jr-autism-questions-tylenol-b2834631.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/12/19/33/GettyImages-2227086634.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XdfNqITd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-26 20:30:06","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":363799946,"title":"Fans turn on Jennifer Lawrence as she reveals stance on Palestine after praising Amy Schumer's Israel remarks","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Sep 26th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Andrew 'flew on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet and had massages paid for by paedophile' while Elon Musk 'planned to visit island', according to bombshell documents\n\nLiverpool pay out Diogo Jota's £140,000-a-week contract to his widow and family: Manager Arne Slot reveals club's 'not normal' gesture\n\nDelegates storm out moments before Netanyahu begins UN assembly address, with the Israeli PM declaring western recognition of Palestine shows 'murdering Jews pays off'\n\nMy year from hell: RICHARD HAMMOND breaks his silence on the 'devastating' collapse of his marriage - as he reveals terrible impact of his father's death and how his new car business has lost half a million pounds\n\nI was terrified of driving, like so many women.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy EVE BUCKLAND, US SHOWBUSINESS DEPUTY EDITOR \n Published:20:41 BST, 26 September 2025 |Updated:21:27 BST, 26 September 2025 \n\nJennifer Lawrence sparked uproar from fans as she publicly revealed her political stance amid the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian war this week.\nThe Oscar-winning actress, 35, spoke out in support of Palestine two years after the October 7 attacks, and said what is happening in Gaza 'is no less than a genocide.'\nAppearing at the San Sebastian Film Festival press conference on Friday to promote new movie, Die My Love, Lawrence said of Palestine: 'I’m terrified and it’s mortifying. \n'What’s happening is no less than a genocide and it’s unacceptable, I’m terrified for my children, for all of our children.'\nLawrence also lashed out about the 'disrespect and discourse' in American politics, adding: 'I mean, the kids who are voting right now at 18, it’s going to be totally normal to them that politics has no integrity. \n'Politicians lie, there is no empathy. And everybody needs to remember that when you ignore what’s happening on one side of the world, it won’t be long until it’s on your side as well.\n\nJennifer Lawrence sparked uproar from fans as she publicly revealed her political stance amid the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian war this week\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress, 35, spoke out in support of Palestine two years after the October 7 attacks, and said what is happening in Gaza 'is no less than a genocide'\n\nLawrence's comments were slammed by fans online after she previously praised her friend, actress and comedian Amy Schumer, for choosing to speak up in support of Israel amid the conflict - pictured together 2021\n'I wish that there was something I could say, something that I could do to fix this extremely complex and disgraceful situation. It breaks my heart.'\nLawrence, who publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election, said she feared 'speaking out too much' or 'answering too many of these questions' that 'my words will just be used to add more fire and rhetoric to something that is in the hands of our elected officials.\n'I just want people to stay focused on who is responsible and the things that they can do and when they need to show up and vote, and not let the actors and the artists who are trying to express freedom of art, freedom of speech take the heat for the individuals that are actually responsible.'\nLawrence's comments were slammed by fans online after she previously praised her friend, actress and comedian Amy Schumer, for choosing to speak up in support of Israel amid the conflict.\nSchumer was forced to disable her Instagram comments in November 2023 after posting in support of Israel following Hamas' deadly attack on October 7, after which Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza, prompting protestors to call for a cease-fire.\nHer posts received a slew of harsh comments critiquing her views, her looks, and weight.\nAfter sharing a number of videos that explained what a ceasefire would mean for Israel, she turned off comments on the posts.\nShe later shared a note reading: ''Couple things. What I want is EVERY HOSTAGE BACK I want safety and freedom from Hamas for Palestinians and Israelis. I want safety for Jewish people and Muslims as well. Everyone. Just like you. I want peace.'\n\nBe the first to commentBe one of the first to commentComments\n\nWhat's your take on Jennifer's revelation?Comment now\n\nSmoke rises from ongoing strikes as Palestinians, carrying their belongings by vehicle or on their backs, continue to flee toward southern Gaza via al-Rashid Street after intensified Israeli attacks and ground operation amid forced evacuation orders in Gaza City on September 26\n\nAppearing at the San Sebastian Film Festival press conference on Friday to promote new movie, Die My Love, Lawrence said of Palestine: 'I’m terrified and it’s mortifying. 'What’s happening is no less than a genocide and it’s unacceptable, I’m terrified for my children'\n\nThe October 7 attack by Hamas left 1,400 Israelis murdered and over 200 kidnapped - pictured the Supernova Music Festival site where the attacks happened\n\nFans erupted on social media and claimed Lawrence had performed a 'back track' after supporting Schumer last year - as well as lambasting the star for taking years to comment on the conflict\n\nOthers defended the 'hero' star for publicly speaking out\n\nLawrence also lashed out about the 'disrespect and discourse' in American politics - she endorsed defeated Democrat Kamala Harris, who was beaten by Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election\n'You will never see me wishing harm on anyone. Saying I'm Islamophobic or that I like genocide is crazy. So here you go by popular demand. Comments on. Please keep the below in mind.\nIn April 2024 Lawrence had high words of praise for Schumer, and her mettle in facing personal attacks for her activism.\n\n Amy Schumer turns Instagram comments back on after being schooled by MLK's daughter \n'Amy's choice to use her voice to speak for justice puts her under immense fire,' the Academy Award-winning actress told Variety as part of a profile on Schumer.\nLawrence continued: 'I wouldn't say she navigates it so much as she throws her middle fingers up and walks away from negative comments like a gas station fire in a Michael Bay movie.' \nFans erupted on social media and claimed Lawrence had performed a 'back track' after supporting Schumer last year - as well as lambasting the star for taking years to comment on the conflict. \nOne wrote: 'Hmmm looks like a bit of a back track! Wonder what changed? Definitely hasn’t done the right thing from the start, and we knew people would try to act like they have been on the right side of history once the tide turned.'\n\nSchumer faced huge backlash over her Israeli-Palestinian conflict remarks; seen in March 2023\n\nShe spoke about feeling 'ashamed' of her Jewish identity during her younger years and how she had to 'laugh along' with hurtful jokes to fit in\nOthers typed: 'Let’s hold off on deifying celebrities that have waited so long to come to reality. Stop putting these people on a pedestal. Has the last decade not shown us that these people are as brain dead as anyone else. Their celebrity means nothing. I’m glad they have a platform to speak about Gaza, but come on guys. Don’t fall back into old habits or celebrity worship.\n'Oh now she wants to change her tune? After two years?! What was she doing defending Amy Schumer when people were angry at her for defending the settler-colonialist genocidal entity? \n'Isn’t she best friends with Amy Schumer… I’m sure I remember her defending Amy schumer’s stance on Gaza\n'No, she is NOT a hero. She was defending Amy schumer and kept silence until now. If she is not being asked about Palestinians children in that interview, she won't utter this kind statement and kept silence in Genocide, which is complicity in it itself. \n'Hey remember when she was supporting Amy Schumer? Yeah, Jennifer, sit down. \nOthers defended the 'hero' Hunger Games actress for her comments, saying: 'Jennifer Lawrence spoke truth with courage, naming Gaza a genocide and exposing the moral collapse of U.S. politics. Her fear reflects millions: silence feeds oppression. She reminds us responsibility lies with leaders, not artists, and justice ignored abroad will reach home soon\n'She’s absolutely right and I would love to see other celebrities with big platforms to speak up about this issue too \n'THANK YOU JENNIFER YOU ARE A HERO!'\nLast year Schumer told Variety about an instance in March in which she was verbally abused, months after stating her support for Israel following Hamas' October 7 attack on a music festival, triggering the ongoing heightened conflict in the Middle East.\nSchumer said she was in Brooklyn near the subway, working on an upcoming film titled Kinda Pregnant, when a passerby yelled at her, 'F*** you, Amy Schumer! You're a Zionist! You love genocide!'\nThe Trainwreck actress, who has past turned off her social media comments amid vitriolic remarks, said that she's gotten used to it at this point.\n'It didn't even raise my heart rate,' Schumer said of the incident on the set. 'I didn't cry. Nothing.'\nSchumer said that she 'can't help' herself in making remarks that could generate controversy and a backlash against her.\n'A lot of people can help it, but I've never been able to,' she told the outlet. 'But I also want to be helpful. Do you know what I mean?'\n\n In a later post the comedian shared a note announcing she was opening up her comments section and 'accepting love and feedback'\n\nSchumer wrapped up the post writing, 'We are all in a lot of pain. What hurts the most is that we all actually love each other. You hate Jews. You don't know why. I still love you'\n\nIn the chat with Variety, Schumer said she found inconsistencies with the public's perception of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.\n'The focus is so razor-sharp on Jewish people but not on Hamas,' she said. 'It's very strange.\n'So I'd recommend people read a book - Israel: A Simple Guide to the Most Misunderstood Country on Earth by Noa Tishby. Or anything - Jewish people wrote everything down.'\nHamasJennifer LawrenceIsraelPalestine\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFans turn on Jennifer Lawrence as she reveals stance on Palestine after praising Amy Schumer's Israel remarks\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 860\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

On Thursday, Evans entertained a guest with secret service stature. During her visit, Harris discusses her book “107 Days,” which entails her experience as a presidential candidate during the 2024 election. She revealed to Evans he was the first person she discussed the book with outside of her team. The housewarming vibes set the tone for a conversation that allowed Harris to speak with comfort and embrace emojis, a delicacy she had been without during her time in the White House. As they discussed her book, Evans and Harris shared a cheese and anchovies pizza. The host made the choice to commemorate the day she found out President Joe Biden was going to drop out of the race for the house on Pennsylvania Avenue. “The first day you found out that Joe Biden was not going to be running for reelection and that you got the go-ahead,” Evans said, “cheese pizza with anchovies is where you went.” Harris reveals she found out Biden was going to drop out of the presidential race while playing with her niece’s daughters. She was in her sweatpants, with her hair in a ponytail, when the unexpected call went through. “This is really happening and the only people staffing me are both under 4 feet tall,” Harris said. “My little baby nieces … firsthand witnesses to history.” She recalls her team coming together immediately and turning her dining table from a breakfast setting to business. Work for her campaign began and as the day elongated and dinner time passed, they ordered pizza, including one with cheese and anchovies. In her book, Harris calls the day she certified the election one of the hardest things she’s ever had to do. As vice president and president of the senate, it was her responsibility to confirm the election on Jan. 6, a date in infamy after the insurrection that took place on the same date in 2021. Evans asked her if there was ever a moment in which she didn't want to take the high road. “It was nonnegotiable in my mind that I would stand there and give it the process, the dignity that it deserves of showing what leadership should be about, which is a peaceful transfer of power,” Harris said. “I was not going to let them, in any way, compromise every reason that I ran for president, which is that I do believe in the importance of the rule of law,” she added. After conceding the election, Harris tells Evans she grieved and experienced emotions that resembled those she felt when her mother died. “I choose not to allow circumstances or individuals disempower my spirit,” she added as an emotional Evans added: “If you can say that, if you can really believe that, then there are so many others of us who can feel confident in that as well.”","summary":"Kamala Harris appeared on YouTube show 'House Guest' to discuss her memoir '107 Days' about the 2024 presidential campaign.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-09-26/kamala-harris-speaks-about-her-upcoming-book-on-house-guest","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/709810d/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2048x1365+0+0/resize/1486x990!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F9a%2F6c70ddf94dd780987eb41f694a66%2Fhouse-guest-lead-phot","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 18:57:48","author":"Anthony Solorzano","authors":["Anthony Solorzano"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.35},{"id":363775844,"title":"Meet the new Jimmy Carter, worse than the old one","text":"Former President Joe Biden is destined to inherit Carter’s ignominious legacy, becoming, in the modern era, the new avatar for presidential incompetence and impotence. That he has managed this despite enjoying the unqualified support of the news and entertainment industries is a testament to his preternatural ability to, as former President Barack Obama once said, “f*** things up.”\n\nThere are the little things that point to Biden’s destiny as the new Carter, a president for whom nothing nice can be said of his administration, for which everything he attempted ended in disaster, and for whose “leadership” neither the country nor the international community benefited.\n\nThere’s the fact that Biden’s dunce of a running mate, former Vice President Kamala Harris, is doing the rounds now on television, hawking a new book in which she explicitly criticizes her former boss. That Harris, whose years in D.C. politics before she was nominated as vice president could be counted on one hand, is publicly criticizing a man who has been in the nation’s capital since she was 8 years old, suggests a great deal about the former president’s current standing within his own party. Harris apparently fears no reprisal from Biden or leadership, and that says a lot.\n\nThat neither Democratic leadership nor anyone of real influence has mounted a defense for him says even more.\n\nThere are also these telling tidbits from the Wall Street Journal:\n\nBiden, 82 years old, is charting a postpresidency that is less lucrative than what he’d expected when he left office. Options for big jobs are limited by his advanced age, his unpopularity in Democratic circles and companies—concerned about retribution from President Trump—that aren’t offering speaking gigs. His own allies have grown critical of his presidency, most recently former Vice President Kamala Harris, who in a new book says the Democratic Party was reckless to allow Biden to run a second time. \n\nThe result for Biden is a leaner next chapter that lacks the well-funded foundations, plans for exquisite libraries and full calendar of paid speeches his peers enjoyed. \n\nInstead of private jets, Biden has been spotted with a book on his lap in the first-class cabin of American Airlines flights or (talking) aboard Amtrak’s quiet car. Paid speaking appearances can range from $300,000 to $500,000, people briefed on the matter said. Takers are limited, and at least one organization tried to negotiate below that range, some of the people said.\n\nEven former President George W. Bush, who enjoyed a modest “poll bounce” after leaving office in 2009, didn’t experience this sort of trouble following his final term. Then again, Bush is no Biden. Lucky him.\n\nIt gets worse for the man who promised to “restore the soul of the nation.”\n\nOf all the signs pointing to Biden’s future as the new Carter, perhaps none are so suggestive as the fact that voters prefer Biden’s predecessor and successor, President Donald Trump, on several key issues, despite having an even lower opinion of the Queens businessman.\n\nWhere voters are 41% and 57% approval/disapproval for Trump, they’re 43% and 54% approval/disapproval for Joe Biden, according to Gallup, which has current favorability data on both men.\n\nYet, when it comes to the issues that move voters to the polls, they prefer Trump to Biden. The most remarkable thing is that Trump does this while also being underwater with voters. This is hardly a reason for Trump to celebrate, but what does it say of Biden?\n\nOn the economy, voters are happier now with Trump (41%) than they were with Biden at the end of his term (38%), according to a RealClearPolitics polling average. Trump also polls higher now on foreign policy (42% to 35%), immigration (47% to 33.5%!), inflation (39% to 34%), and crime (47% to 38%) than Biden did in his last year as president. On the matter of crime specifically, CNN found voters overwhelmingly prefer Trump to Biden. Public support for Trump’s handling of crime went from -13 in March 2024, according to an assessment of his first term, to +1 in August, a fairly stunning rebuke of the “empathy” president. Along with CNN’s data on Trump’s net approval on crime, the network’s data also show that Biden’s favorables last year for his approach to crime hovered at around -26. That’s a wide gap.\n\nThere’s also the relevant matter that, though his numbers are less than stellar, Trump enjoys a slightly higher approval rating now than he did when he left office in 2021, amid a riot, shouts for former Vice President Mike Pence’s head, and an impeachment trial. It’s enough to make one suspect that Biden was such a massive flop as president that voters were almost happy to welcome back the “American carnage” candidate.\n\nFor every president between Carter and the present, there has typically been at least one issue or policy matter in which even a slim majority of voters had something positive to say. Biden appears to have no such luck — from his hands-off approach to crime to his head-in-the-sand approach to inflation, to his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration seems hard-pressed to find admirers. \n\nIn fact, when it comes to overall approval for job performance, 54% of voters believe Trump is doing a better job than Biden did as president, according to a new August Harvard CAPS-Harris survey. \n\nIn other words, voters view the Biden presidency as an unmitigated disaster, even if they hold a higher opinion of him than the current chief executive.\n\nVOTERS DON’T TRUST DEMOCRATS TO RUN A LEMONADE STAND\n\nA nice guy, sure, but a rotten president.\n\nThat sounds familiar.\n\nBecket Adams is a writer in Washington and program director for the National Journalism Center.","summary":"For nearly 50 years, one U.S. president has stood above all others as an unqualified failure.

All celebrity voices are impersonated … poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.”\n\nWhile some of that language must be required by an exhausted legal team behind the scenes, the long-running satirical cartoon is known for pressing hot-button topics and rapidly churning out searing parodies. Season 27, which premiered in July, is no exception, focusing on President Donald Trump, his associates, policies and other current events. Some members of Trump’s Cabinet have been outspoken about their likeness appearing in “South Park,” but others have shrugged it off. Over the years, the animated series has depicted conservatives and liberals alike, leaving almost no public figure, politician or activist shielded from critique or crude depiction.\n\nThis season has had an unusual cadence of episodes, with the first two arriving on a weekly schedule, then biweekly before the arrival of Episode 5, which aired three weeks later on Wednesday. The delayed episode arrived after the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose debate style was depicted in the Episode 2. However, “South Park” creators Matt Parker and Trey Stone told the Denver Post the delay was unrelated to recent events, like Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, or the content: “No one pulled the episode, no one censored us, and you know we’d say so if true.” The pair had issued a statement on Sept. 17 saying the episode wasn’t finished in time. Future episodes will air every two weeks through Dec. 10.\n\nHere is a guide to every parody and reference so far on this season of “South Park.”\n\n‘Sermon on the ‘Mount,’ Episode 1\n\nCutting funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting\n\nCartman is dismayed to find out National Public Radio has lost its federal funding after he tunes in to hear static — an NPR program is his “favorite show,” he says, where “all the liberals b— and whine about stuff.” He rants to his friends about how the government “can’t cancel a show” and wonders what might be next on the chopping block.\n\nIn July, the Senate voted to approve the Trump White House’s proposal to claw back roughly $1 billion in federal funding previously allocated for public broadcasting. NPR and PBS are still operating despite the funding cuts, but layoffs and reduced programming are expected.\n\nChristianity in public schools\n\nHead of South Park Elementary PC Principal, whose name was a play on the initialism for politically correct, announces to the school that his name now stands for “Power Christian Principal.” He holds an assembly where he says that “our Lord and savior Jesus Christ” is the only thing that can bring back some normalcy to these “corrupt times.” He proceeds to welcome Jesus to the assembly as a guest speaker. When the students go back home, their parents and the people of South Park are alarmed to hear about the emphasis on Christianity — and the presence of Jesus — in the town’s public school.\n\nTrump has previously endorsed displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms amid a push to incorporate more Christianity into public schools.\n\n‘Woke is dead’\n\nThe phrase frequently used by Trump was inscribed on a T-shirt Cartman wears after he realizes the concept of “wokeness” is no longer prominent. “Everyone hates the Jews, everyone’s fine with using gay slurs,” he says, lamenting that he no longer feels purpose if there’s no wokeness to contest.\n\nKaroline Leavitt\n\nThe White House press secretary is depicted corralling the president, sporting a large cross necklace, as she often does during press briefings. Leavitt tells Trump a lot of his supporters are starting to turn against him and begs him to talk to them, adding that they’re “really riled up.” Trump’s base has expressed frustration over the administration’s approach to sharing information about the Jeffery Epstein case after he promised more transparency about the convicted sex offender, who died by suicide in 2019, and the sex trafficking investigation involving the late financier.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nTrump appears this season with an image of his face over an animated body, frequently repeating the phrase “Relax, guy” and threatening lawsuits against anyone who’s in his way. He is shown berating a White House portrait painter for an unflattering depiction of him and there are references to the size of the president’s genitalia. He’s also depicted as being in an abusive relationship with Satan — in which Trump is the abuser. “South Park” has previously depicted Satan as being the victim in an abusive relationship with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe Epstein list\n\nSatan laments the speculation that Trump’s name is on the “Epstein list,” a purported list of his alleged clients. In reality, the Justice Department has said no such list exists, walking back comments Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi made in a Fox News interview earlier this year that the list was “sitting on my desk” in preparation for release. When the list is brought up in the series, fictional Trump says, “Are we still talking about that?,” mirroring comments he made in real life.\n\nCBS’ ’60 Minutes’ and Paramount drama\n\nThe stopwatch featured in the introduction to “60 Minutes” is strapped to a bomb when it appears on “South Park.” The hosts of the show are visibly nervous and continue praising the president while covering his lawsuit against the town of South Park, adding that they don’t agree with Trump’s detractors.\n\nThe scene references the legal tussle between Trump and Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, which airs “60 Minutes.” The president sued over edits to a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which led to Paramount agreeing to pay $16 million to settle the lawsuit in July; shortly after, the Federal Communications Commission, led by a Trump appointee, approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance.\n\nBetween the settlement and merger approval, CBS announced it is canceling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Colbert frequently skewers the president on his show, and Trump praised the cancellation. Paramount also recently bought the global streaming rights to “South Park” in a lucrative $1.5 billion deal for Parker and Stone.\n\nDuring the episode’s fictitious “60 Minutes” segment over Trump’s lawsuit against the town, Jesus comes to visit the townspeople. Through whispers, he tells them, “I didn’t want to come back and be in the school, but I had to because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount.”\n\n“The president’s suing you?” a protester asks.\n\nJesus, through clenched teeth, explains: “The guy can do what he wants now that someone backed down. … You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert? You guys gotta stop being stupid. … If someone has the power of the presidency and also has the power to sue and take bribes, then he can do anything to anyone.”\n\n“All of you, shut the f— up or South Park is over!” Jesus says.\n\nThe people of South Park end up settling their lawsuit with the president for $3.5 million, saying it will be fine as long as they cut some funding for their schools, hospitals and roads. And as part of the settlement, they have to agree to “pro-Trump messaging.” Cut to a live-action deepfake video of Trump trekking through the desert in a show of loyalty to his supporters before he strips naked.\n\n‘Got a Nut,’ Episode 2\n\n[Note: This episode aired on Aug. 6, more than a month before political commentator Charlie Kirk, who is parodied throughout the episode, was shot and killed.]\n\nICE recruitment and immigration raids\n\nThis episode is focused on the ongoing raids carried out across the country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security officials since earlier this year.\n\nWhen South Park Elementary counselor Mr. Mackey is fired — the government is doing away with needless spending in schools, he’s told — he signs up for a job with ICE, enticed by a generous signing bonus and a higher salary. Mackey watches a promotional video, complete with animations of officers wearing gaiters and a theme song: “We don’t ask for experience, just show up/ We don’t care if you’ve read a book or grown up/ If you’re crazy or fat and lazy, we don’t care at all … If you need a job, it’s a job to have.”\n\nMackey is hired with alarming speed and proceeds to go on his first raid, targeting a “Dora the Explorer” live show, which has a not-so-intimidating audience of young children and abuelitas. After ICE agents hear from protesters that there are “many Latinos in heaven,” they make the pearly gates their next stop.\n\nKristi Noem\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security secretary leads ICE agents through a series of raids this episode, but she first appears in an orientation video. She tells the new recruits, “A few years ago, I had to put my puppy down by shooting it in the face because sometimes doing what’s important means doing what’s hard,” and she proceeds to going on a shooting spree targeting yelping puppies (including Krypto the Superdog) throughout the episode. In her 2024 book, Noem wrote about how she killed her 14-month-old dog for exhibiting aggressive behavior.\n\nShe’s also seen rounding up as many immigrants as possible in raids, shouting orders like, “If it’s brown, it goes down.”\n\nAnd in a running gag, her face periodically melts off, requiring a glam squad equivalent to a pit crew, and at one point, it seems to take on a life of its own. Trump also says her face “freaks me out” during the episode.\n\nNoem responded to the depiction on Glenn Beck’s podcast, calling it “lazy” to target her looks. “If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can’t, they just pick something petty like that,” she said.\n\nRight-wing debate podcasts\n\nWhile conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk does not appear as a character in this episode, his style of debate content — and his name — are featured.\n\nLoudmouthed Cartman is frustrated that so many others, namely his classmate Clyde Donovan, are profiting off of “his shtick” of arguing against liberal views.\n\nClyde has a debate podcast, inviting viewers to watch as he “totally destroys these woke liberal students.” He’s set up in a tent on a college campus where he waits as a line of students come to speak with him, and he challenges them to “prove me wrong.” Cartman eventually takes over, saying that he is the “master debater” and sporting a haircut similar to Kirk’s. He shuts down his opponents’ arguments with phrases like, “You just hate America and you love abortions.”\n\nClyde and Cartman’s content replicates Kirk’s well-known style. The founder of the conservative organization Turning Point USA frequently toured college campuses and hosted events just like the one depicted in the episode. The phrase “prove me wrong” was used frequently by Kirk to promote his events, inviting students to challenge his political and cultural views.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Kirk was shot and killed while hosting such an event at Utah Valley University, the first stop of his “American Comeback” tour. Weeks before he was killed, Kirk responded to the episode with a 30-minute YouTube video, finding it humorous.\n\n“I think a lot of it was hilarious towards me,” he said. “Some of it was very funny and I don’t think we should have too thick of skin.”\n\nHe also touched on the reach of his organization and events, noting that his name is enshrined in “The Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters” that Cartman and Clyde compete for in the episode. “So a campus thing I’ve been doing for 13 years to debate random college kids has now been so important that it gets prominent prime-time placement on Comedy Central?” he asked through laughs. “I think the whole thing is just awesome and hilarious.”\n\nWhen Mr. Mackey is rewarded for good work as an ICE agent, he’s flown to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, where he frequently stays and hosts events.\n\nHe’s greeted by giggling women who hand him a drink and put flower leis around his neck before the president meets him and gives him a brief tour of Mar-a-Lago. While there, Mackey accidentally walks in on two older men receiving massages from younger women, one of whom is a tearful Dora, detained in the raid that took place earlier in the episode. The scene is likely a reference to Epstein and accounts from survivors who say they were forced to give massages to him and his associates. Trump said this summer that Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa, which caused them to have a falling-out.\n\nThe vice president is depicted as a version of Tattoo, the character from late-’70s drama “Fantasy Island,” and is animated similarly as Trump, except the photo used for his face is lifted directly from viral memes. He often does the president’s bidding, calling him “boss.” In turn, Trump frequently calls Vance “stupid.” Acknowledging the caricature, Vance wrote on X, “Well, I’ve finally made it.”\n\n‘Sickofancy,’ Episode 3\n\nImmigration raid at cannabis farm\n\nRandy’s hemp farm business, Tegridy Farms, is the site of an immigration raid at the the beginning of this episode. While Randy is shooting a commercial, complete with calming guitar music and a trite script, ICE officers interrupt by detaining almost all the workers. “You sons of b—,” Randy screams after the vans as they drive away. “Those are my Mexicans!”\n\nIn July, chaotic raids targeting a cannabis company’s growing site and greenhouse in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties drew national attention after a man who was fleeing immigration officials died.\n\nMicrodosing ketamine\n\nWith his business in shambles, Randy rethinks his strategy with the help of an over-complimentary AI chatbot. Perhaps in a nod to Trump’s former ally and onetime “special government employee” Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman behind Tesla, SpaceX and X, Randy turns to ketamine. Randy insists a slew of “tech guys” are taking small doses of ketamine and the drug “gives their minds the edge to work with AI.” Ketamine “bolsters our focus and creativity,” he tells his partner Towelie. Under the influence of the drug, Randy transforms Tegridy Farms from a “quaint farm” into an “AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions.”\n\nMusk’s use of ketamine and other drugs has been previously reported, with the tech leader saying in a 2024 interview that ketamine has been prescribed to him and is “helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.” He has denied abusing it. “If you use too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done. I have a lot of work, I’m typically putting in 16-hour days,” he said. “So I don’t really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.”\n\nMusk supported Trump’s campaign and served as an advisor to the president, helming the Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year with the goal of slashing spending.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook\n\nMeta and Apple chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, who were both present at Trump’s inauguration and have maintained friendly relationships with him, are both portrayed in this episode as members of a long line outside of the Oval Office waiting to bestow a gift on the president.\n\n“Mr. President, your ideas for the tech industry are so innovative,” Cook says to Trump. Cook gives the president a gift on behalf of Apple, which actually happened this summer. Zuckerberg is later seen giving the president a gift that appears to be a gold and bejeweled Meta virtual reality headset.\n\nLuxury jet from Qatar\n\nQatar’s leader is also seen in line holding a model gold plane with a tag that says “Air Force One.” Like everyone else, the leader compliments the president and insists his genitalia is not small before giving him the gift. Trump and the Defense Department accepted a luxury Boeing 747 aircraft from Qatar for President Trump to use as Air Force One this summer, despite ongoing questions about the ethics and legality of taking the expensive gift from a foreign nation.\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWhen Towelie takes a trip to the capital in this episode, he sees armed troops guarding monuments like the Washington and Lincoln memorials and the Capitol surrounded by tanks and jets. In the episode, the Lincoln Memorial has been replaced by a statue of a stern-faced Trump with exposed genitalia.\n\nIn August, Trump called up National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to “reestablish law and order” by targeting criminals — though crime has been down in the city — and the homeless. Although troops were not initially armed, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later ordered them to carry service-issued weapons.\n\nReclassifying marijuana\n\nRandy sends Towelie to meet with Trump and give him a gift in hopes of persuading him to reclassify marijuana on the national level. (The gift is Towelie himself.) Randy, in the form of a hologram, tells Trump he thinks they can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nTrump said in an August press conference that his administration was considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, which would be a significant change in policy but would not make the drug legal across the country.\n\n‘Wok is Dead,’ Episode 4\n\nTariffs and Labubus\n\nThe clerk at the City Pop-Up — rebranded from City Wok — the lone purveyor of Labubus in the area, says the popular dolls are hard to keep in stock, and they’re very expensive because of tariffs. The “mystery box” that Butters has to purchase for the chance of getting the exact Labubu his girlfriend wants sets him back $85, and later, the price shoots up to $120 to offset a rise in tariffs. (The real-life dolls often fetch much more than that on resale sites, especially if they are rare.) When Butters balks at the price, the store owner explains that the cost of tariffs is passed onto the customer.\n\nThis episode shows a clip from a Fox News segment where an anchor is overly complimentary of the president. The anchor says the president will take questions from a “diverse crowd of reporters” after returning to the U.S. from a historic tariff summit, only to reveal all of the reporters are from Fox.\n\nThe Fox News reporters also fixate on President Trump’s relationship with his wife, Melania, and his increasingly frequent appearances with Satan. There’s a heavy use of wordplay that suggests the anchors could be asking about the affair between the president and Satan or about whether Trump is actually the devil himself.\n\nFox News reporters check in with Trump ally Kid Rock after breaking the news that — buckle up — Trump has impregnated Satan. A sobbing Kid Rock tells the reporters, “I’m just so happy.” The musician is a friend and ardent supporter of Trump, having performed at his inaugural rally in January and spoken many times publicly about his support of the president.\n\n‘Conflict of Interest,’ Episode 5\n\nIsrael and Gaza\n\nKyle becomes irate when his classmates place bets on a popular market prediction app that his mother would “strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital.”\n\nThis episode marks the first time this season that the show has touched on the current conflict in Gaza, and it referenced real-life Israeli strikes on hospitals in the area.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\n\nTrump’s eldest son appears in this episode as someone with many roles — he’s a strategic adviser for predictive markets, he answers the phone for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and also acts as a special adviser to Israel. Although he wears all those hats, the series doesn’t portray him as particularly bright — he has a complete conversation over the phone with himself.\n\nHe’s also animated to look as if he’s had extensive plastic surgery and he speaks with a strained voice, as if he can’t move his face.\n\nTrump Jr. holds several key roles in his family’s business and his father’s political sphere in real life, and he serves as an adviser to both Polymart and Kalshi, two prediction market apps that are named and spoofed in this episode.\n\nTrump’s stance on abortion\n\nLess keen on the baby he’s expecting with Satan, Trump looks for different ways to harm the pregnancy in hopes of terminating it. He asks Satan if he wants to smoke and hang out in a hot tub, holds up a wire hanger, tries to get him to trip down the stairs or fall under a pile of cat feces, and even makes Satan a soup full of emergency contraceptive pills.\n\nIn reality, Trump has repeatedly shifted his messaging on abortion but has most recently said he believes specific abortion policies and access should be decided not by federal law but by individual states.\n\nBrendan Carr\n\nThe chairman of the Federal Communications Commission comes into the fold this episode when Kyle goes through several hoops to try to file a complaint over the bet involving his mom, which he finds offensive. The FCC is “dealing with all the offensive stuff now,” Kyle is told.\n\nCarr says he needs to speak with the president after learning about the offensive content, but he ends up falling victim to all of Trump’s antics in his attempt to terminate Satan’s pregnancy, which send him to the hospital. The doctors say they’re “afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.”\n\nVance later threatens Carr, who keeps interfering with Trump’s attempts to end Satan’s pregnancy (Vance doesn’t want anything to mess with his proximity to the presidency). “We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way,” Vance says to Carr.\n\nThose words match the phrase Carr said in real life a week before this episode aired in reference to his call on ABC to act on comments late-night host Jimmy Kimmel made about Kirk’s suspected killer and his death. Carr has remained in the headlines since then as backlash grew against the FCC’s role in Kimmel’s suspension.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n\nFrustrated by the bet about her and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, Kyle’s mom storms into the office of the Israeli prime minister. “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighborhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism?” she says. “You’re making life for Jews miserable and life for American Jews impossible.” She continues to berate him and a group of officials while the credits roll. Netanyahu does not say anything in response.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com.

All celebrity voices are impersonated … poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.”\n\nWhile some of that language must be required by an exhausted legal team behind the scenes, the long-running satirical cartoon is known for pressing hot-button topics and rapidly churning out searing parodies. Season 27, which premiered in July, is no exception, focusing on President Donald Trump, his associates, policies and other current events. Some members of Trump’s Cabinet have been outspoken about their likeness appearing in “South Park,” but others have shrugged it off. Over the years, the animated series has depicted conservatives and liberals alike, leaving almost no public figure, politician or activist shielded from critique or crude depiction.\n\nThis season has had an unusual cadence of episodes, with the first two arriving on a weekly schedule, then biweekly before the arrival of Episode 5, which aired three weeks later on Wednesday. The delayed episode arrived after the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose debate style was depicted in the Episode 2. However, “South Park” creators Matt Parker and Trey Stone told the Denver Post the delay was unrelated to recent events, like Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, or the content: “No one pulled the episode, no one censored us, and you know we’d say so if true.” The pair had issued a statement on Sept. 17 saying the episode wasn’t finished in time. Future episodes will air every two weeks through Dec. 10.\n\nHere is a guide to every parody and reference so far on this season of “South Park.”\n\n‘Sermon on the ‘Mount,’ Episode 1\n\nCutting funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting\n\nCartman is dismayed to find out National Public Radio has lost its federal funding after he tunes in to hear static — an NPR program is his “favorite show,” he says, where “all the liberals b— and whine about stuff.” He rants to his friends about how the government “can’t cancel a show” and wonders what might be next on the chopping block.\n\nIn July, the Senate voted to approve the Trump White House’s proposal to claw back roughly $1 billion in federal funding previously allocated for public broadcasting. NPR and PBS are still operating despite the funding cuts, but layoffs and reduced programming are expected.\n\nChristianity in public schools\n\nHead of South Park Elementary PC Principal, whose name was a play on the initialism for politically correct, announces to the school that his name now stands for “Power Christian Principal.” He holds an assembly where he says that “our Lord and savior Jesus Christ” is the only thing that can bring back some normalcy to these “corrupt times.” He proceeds to welcome Jesus to the assembly as a guest speaker. When the students go back home, their parents and the people of South Park are alarmed to hear about the emphasis on Christianity — and the presence of Jesus — in the town’s public school.\n\nTrump has previously endorsed displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms amid a push to incorporate more Christianity into public schools.\n\n‘Woke is dead’\n\nThe phrase frequently used by Trump was inscribed on a T-shirt Cartman wears after he realizes the concept of “wokeness” is no longer prominent. “Everyone hates the Jews, everyone’s fine with using gay slurs,” he says, lamenting that he no longer feels purpose if there’s no wokeness to contest.\n\nKaroline Leavitt\n\nThe White House press secretary is depicted corralling the president, sporting a large cross necklace, as she often does during press briefings. Leavitt tells Trump a lot of his supporters are starting to turn against him and begs him to talk to them, adding that they’re “really riled up.” Trump’s base has expressed frustration over the administration’s approach to sharing information about the Jeffery Epstein case after he promised more transparency about the convicted sex offender, who died by suicide in 2019, and the sex trafficking investigation involving the late financier.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nTrump appears this season with an image of his face over an animated body, frequently repeating the phrase “Relax, guy” and threatening lawsuits against anyone who’s in his way. He is shown berating a White House portrait painter for an unflattering depiction of him and there are references to the size of the president’s genitalia. He’s also depicted as being in an abusive relationship with Satan — in which Trump is the abuser. “South Park” has previously depicted Satan as being the victim in an abusive relationship with Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe Epstein list\n\nSatan laments the speculation that Trump’s name is on the “Epstein list,” a purported list of his alleged clients. In reality, the Justice Department has said no such list exists, walking back comments Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi made in a Fox News interview earlier this year that the list was “sitting on my desk” in preparation for release. When the list is brought up in the series, fictional Trump says, “Are we still talking about that?,” mirroring comments he made in real life.\n\nCBS’ ’60 Minutes’ and Paramount drama\n\nThe stopwatch featured in the introduction to “60 Minutes” is strapped to a bomb when it appears on “South Park.” The hosts of the show are visibly nervous and continue praising the president while covering his lawsuit against the town of South Park, adding that they don’t agree with Trump’s detractors.\n\nThe scene references the legal tussle between Trump and Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, which airs “60 Minutes.” The president sued over edits to a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which led to Paramount agreeing to pay $16 million to settle the lawsuit in July; shortly after, the Federal Communications Commission, led by a Trump appointee, approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance.\n\nBetween the settlement and merger approval, CBS announced it is canceling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Colbert frequently skewers the president on his show, and Trump praised the cancellation. Paramount also recently bought the global streaming rights to “South Park” in a lucrative $1.5 billion deal for Parker and Stone.\n\nDuring the episode’s fictitious “60 Minutes” segment over Trump’s lawsuit against the town, Jesus comes to visit the townspeople. Through whispers, he tells them, “I didn’t want to come back and be in the school, but I had to because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount.”\n\n“The president’s suing you?” a protester asks.\n\nJesus, through clenched teeth, explains: “The guy can do what he wants now that someone backed down. … You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount! You really want to end up like Colbert? You guys gotta stop being stupid. … If someone has the power of the presidency and also has the power to sue and take bribes, then he can do anything to anyone.”\n\n“All of you, shut the f— up or South Park is over!” Jesus says.\n\nThe people of South Park end up settling their lawsuit with the president for $3.5 million, saying it will be fine as long as they cut some funding for their schools, hospitals and roads. And as part of the settlement, they have to agree to “pro-Trump messaging.” Cut to a live-action deepfake video of Trump trekking through the desert in a show of loyalty to his supporters before he strips naked.\n\n‘Got a Nut,’ Episode 2\n\n[Note: This episode aired on Aug. 6, more than a month before political commentator Charlie Kirk, who is parodied throughout the episode, was shot and killed.]\n\nICE recruitment and immigration raids\n\nThis episode is focused on the ongoing raids carried out across the country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security officials since earlier this year.\n\nWhen South Park Elementary counselor Mr. Mackey is fired — the government is doing away with needless spending in schools, he’s told — he signs up for a job with ICE, enticed by a generous signing bonus and a higher salary. Mackey watches a promotional video, complete with animations of officers wearing gaiters and a theme song: “We don’t ask for experience, just show up/ We don’t care if you’ve read a book or grown up/ If you’re crazy or fat and lazy, we don’t care at all … If you need a job, it’s a job to have.”\n\nMackey is hired with alarming speed and proceeds to go on his first raid, targeting a “Dora the Explorer” live show, which has a not-so-intimidating audience of young children and abuelitas. After ICE agents hear from protesters that there are “many Latinos in heaven,” they make the pearly gates their next stop.\n\nKristi Noem\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security secretary leads ICE agents through a series of raids this episode, but she first appears in an orientation video. She tells the new recruits, “A few years ago, I had to put my puppy down by shooting it in the face because sometimes doing what’s important means doing what’s hard,” and she proceeds to going on a shooting spree targeting yelping puppies (including Krypto the Superdog) throughout the episode. In her 2024 book, Noem wrote about how she killed her 14-month-old dog for exhibiting aggressive behavior.\n\nShe’s also seen rounding up as many immigrants as possible in raids, shouting orders like, “If it’s brown, it goes down.”\n\nAnd in a running gag, her face periodically melts off, requiring a glam squad equivalent to a pit crew, and at one point, it seems to take on a life of its own. Trump also says her face “freaks me out” during the episode.\n\nNoem responded to the depiction on Glenn Beck’s podcast, calling it “lazy” to target her looks. “If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that, but clearly they can’t, they just pick something petty like that,” she said.\n\nRight-wing debate podcasts\n\nWhile conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk does not appear as a character in this episode, his style of debate content — and his name — are featured.\n\nLoudmouthed Cartman is frustrated that so many others, namely his classmate Clyde Donovan, are profiting off of “his shtick” of arguing against liberal views.\n\nClyde has a debate podcast, inviting viewers to watch as he “totally destroys these woke liberal students.” He’s set up in a tent on a college campus where he waits as a line of students come to speak with him, and he challenges them to “prove me wrong.” Cartman eventually takes over, saying that he is the “master debater” and sporting a haircut similar to Kirk’s. He shuts down his opponents’ arguments with phrases like, “You just hate America and you love abortions.”\n\nClyde and Cartman’s content replicates Kirk’s well-known style. The founder of the conservative organization Turning Point USA frequently toured college campuses and hosted events just like the one depicted in the episode. The phrase “prove me wrong” was used frequently by Kirk to promote his events, inviting students to challenge his political and cultural views.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Kirk was shot and killed while hosting such an event at Utah Valley University, the first stop of his “American Comeback” tour. Weeks before he was killed, Kirk responded to the episode with a 30-minute YouTube video, finding it humorous.\n\n“I think a lot of it was hilarious towards me,” he said. “Some of it was very funny and I don’t think we should have too thick of skin.”\n\nHe also touched on the reach of his organization and events, noting that his name is enshrined in “The Charlie Kirk Award for Young Masterdebaters” that Cartman and Clyde compete for in the episode. “So a campus thing I’ve been doing for 13 years to debate random college kids has now been so important that it gets prominent prime-time placement on Comedy Central?” he asked through laughs. “I think the whole thing is just awesome and hilarious.”\n\nWhen Mr. Mackey is rewarded for good work as an ICE agent, he’s flown to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, where he frequently stays and hosts events.\n\nHe’s greeted by giggling women who hand him a drink and put flower leis around his neck before the president meets him and gives him a brief tour of Mar-a-Lago. While there, Mackey accidentally walks in on two older men receiving massages from younger women, one of whom is a tearful Dora, detained in the raid that took place earlier in the episode. The scene is likely a reference to Epstein and accounts from survivors who say they were forced to give massages to him and his associates. Trump said this summer that Epstein “stole” young women who worked at the Mar-a-Lago spa, which caused them to have a falling-out.\n\nThe vice president is depicted as a version of Tattoo, the character from late-’70s drama “Fantasy Island,” and is animated similarly as Trump, except the photo used for his face is lifted directly from viral memes. He often does the president’s bidding, calling him “boss.” In turn, Trump frequently calls Vance “stupid.” Acknowledging the caricature, Vance wrote on X, “Well, I’ve finally made it.”\n\n‘Sickofancy,’ Episode 3\n\nImmigration raid at cannabis farm\n\nRandy’s hemp farm business, Tegridy Farms, is the site of an immigration raid at the the beginning of this episode. While Randy is shooting a commercial, complete with calming guitar music and a trite script, ICE officers interrupt by detaining almost all the workers. “You sons of b—,” Randy screams after the vans as they drive away. “Those are my Mexicans!”\n\nIn July, chaotic raids targeting a cannabis company’s growing site and greenhouse in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties drew national attention after a man who was fleeing immigration officials died.\n\nMicrodosing ketamine\n\nWith his business in shambles, Randy rethinks his strategy with the help of an over-complimentary AI chatbot. Perhaps in a nod to Trump’s former ally and onetime “special government employee” Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman behind Tesla, SpaceX and X, Randy turns to ketamine. Randy insists a slew of “tech guys” are taking small doses of ketamine and the drug “gives their minds the edge to work with AI.” Ketamine “bolsters our focus and creativity,” he tells his partner Towelie. Under the influence of the drug, Randy transforms Tegridy Farms from a “quaint farm” into an “AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions.”\n\nMusk’s use of ketamine and other drugs has been previously reported, with the tech leader saying in a 2024 interview that ketamine has been prescribed to him and is “helpful for getting one out of a negative frame of mind.” He has denied abusing it. “If you use too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done. I have a lot of work, I’m typically putting in 16-hour days,” he said. “So I don’t really have a situation where I can be not mentally acute for an extended period of time.”\n\nMusk supported Trump’s campaign and served as an advisor to the president, helming the Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year with the goal of slashing spending.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook\n\nMeta and Apple chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, who were both present at Trump’s inauguration and have maintained friendly relationships with him, are both portrayed in this episode as members of a long line outside of the Oval Office waiting to bestow a gift on the president.\n\n“Mr. President, your ideas for the tech industry are so innovative,” Cook says to Trump. Cook gives the president a gift on behalf of Apple, which actually happened this summer. Zuckerberg is later seen giving the president a gift that appears to be a gold and bejeweled Meta virtual reality headset.\n\nLuxury jet from Qatar\n\nQatar’s leader is also seen in line holding a model gold plane with a tag that says “Air Force One.” Like everyone else, the leader compliments the president and insists his genitalia is not small before giving him the gift. Trump and the Defense Department accepted a luxury Boeing 747 aircraft from Qatar for President Trump to use as Air Force One this summer, despite ongoing questions about the ethics and legality of taking the expensive gift from a foreign nation.\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nWhen Towelie takes a trip to the capital in this episode, he sees armed troops guarding monuments like the Washington and Lincoln memorials and the Capitol surrounded by tanks and jets. In the episode, the Lincoln Memorial has been replaced by a statue of a stern-faced Trump with exposed genitalia.\n\nIn August, Trump called up National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to “reestablish law and order” by targeting criminals — though crime has been down in the city — and the homeless. Although troops were not initially armed, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later ordered them to carry service-issued weapons.\n\nReclassifying marijuana\n\nRandy sends Towelie to meet with Trump and give him a gift in hopes of persuading him to reclassify marijuana on the national level.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin argued that the reason voters have lost trust in the Democratic Party is because they feel elected officials \"don't actually believe the s--- we're selling them,\" prompting Stewart to draw a parallel to Harris' explanation for why she didn't choose Buttigieg as her running mate. \"To my point, in [her new book ‘107 Days’] when she says, 'I didn't go with Pete Buttigieg because he's gay and that'd be too far,' and you're like, 'Oh my God, it's actually reverse affirmative action.' It's like, 'What?'\" Stewart said. KAMALA HARRIS' BOOK, MEDIA TOUR SLAMMED BY LIBERAL CRITICS AS 'EMBARRASSING' AND 'UNHELPFUL' Harris has been facing backlash over the past week after she revealed in her book \"107 Days\" that Buttigieg was too big of a \"risk\" as a gay man. \"We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, ‘Screw it, let’s just do it.’ But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk,\" she wrote. \"And I think Pete also knew that — to our mutual sadness.\" RAHM EMANUEL SAYS HARRIS WAS WRONG TO SKIP BUTTIGIEG AS RUNNING MATE, FAILED TO 'TRUST IN YOUR GUT' Stewart and Martin argued that such inconsistencies — for example, Harris supporting LGBT causes yet passing over Buttigieg due to his sexuality — damaged the Democratic Party's credibility. While speaking about the importance of authenticity in politics, \"The Weekly Show\" host noted that NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has been \"able to identify the crux of the issue and very simply present some ideas that might be able to battle that.\" \"It’s simpler than authenticity, and the messenger and the metrics,\" he added.

After graduating from U.C.L.A., in 2005, he started working as a blogger, and then as a writer for The American Prospect. At the Washington Post, his “Wonkblog” made him one of the first self-branded digital-era journalists. In 2013, he was considered for a gig at MSNBC that ended up going to Chris Hayes—a turn of events that he has called “the best thing that ever happened to me.” After co-founding the digital-media company Vox, Klein migrated, in 2021, to the Times.\nEarlier in his career, Klein was known, despite lousy grades in math, as a coolly analytical voice on health-care policy and other technocratic arguments. Occasionally, he would lash out, as he did, in 2009, at then Senator Joe Lieberman’s opposition to health-care legislation and his willingness “to cause the death of hundreds of thousands of people to settle an old electoral score.” But such moments were anomalous. At the Times, his reputation has deepened, and he now wields a great deal of influence among Democrats in Washington. It made a difference when he insisted, earlier than most, that Joe Biden was too old to run for a second term.\nKlein is the author of “Why We Are Polarized” and the co-author, with Derek Thompson, of the recent best-selling manifesto “Abundance,” which addresses issues such as affordable housing, climate change, and infrastructure. The reformist ideology of “Abundance,” which remains a hotly debated topic in Democratic Party circles, opposes both a progressivism that fears economic growth and a conservatism that is repelled by government intervention.\nAs a speaker and an interviewer, Klein is exceedingly intelligent, fluid, and, if not conflict-averse, exactly, then polite. He does not go for the throat, preferring a style of argument that invites in a wide circle of views. This is not universally appreciated. Lately, Klein has caught some criticism for a piece, titled “Charlie Kirk Was Practicing Politics the Right Way,” which, in the wake of the assassination in Utah, set to the side Kirk’s more disturbing rhetoric and beliefs. In a conversation for The New Yorker Radio Hour, we began our discussion with the Kirk assassination and went on to talk about the Democrats, media, and where Klein sees American politics going. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\nLet’s start with what happened after Charlie Kirk was killed. You pretty immediately published an essay in the Times which, of course, condemned political violence, comparing it to the danger of a contagion. And you praised Kirk for his willingness to debate—you called it “practicing politics the right way.” That phrase resonated everywhere. Since that terrible event, we’ve seen how Trump and some in the MAGA movement have at times planned to use his death in a serious crackdown on the opposition. How do you look back on that column?\nI think I have to separate a couple of things here. My view is that, in the twelve hours or so after somebody is publicly murdered, it is a good time to sit with people in their grief. I believe very deeply that, when you commit an act of political violence like that, it is an act of political violence against everybody who participates in politics. I said in that piece, and I believe, that on that stage that day, Charlie Kirk was practicing politics. He was up there arguing with people. I’ve heard people say, Well, he’s not really debating to find the truth. And, of course not. He was a very, very effective practitioner of politics. He’s trying to persuade people. He’s trying to create content that will work in our attentional sphere. Something that we liberals have to reckon with is that he, and the people like him, had been winning. They had begun to win on college campuses, and there’s a big Gen Z swing toward Donald Trump. They were certainly winning on social media. Kirk’s willingness to go into places where people disagreed with him was very effective. You can disagree—I disagree with him profoundly.\nThe critique of it was that you were for sure engaging with his practice of politics—of meeting people where they are—but maybe underselling what Charlie Kirk represented in terms of his positions: about race, about “Jewish money” funding an “anti-whiteness agenda,” about his views about L.G.B.T.Q. people—about all kinds of things. What is your sense of his particular politics?\nI think this is a weird critique. Genuinely. You know human beings, David. In the moments after a murder or death, do you go to people and tell them exactly what you thought of the person they just lost? Is your relationship to people who you’re in community with—and I do believe myself to be in a political community with people who cared about and loved Charlie Kirk even as much as I’m very much on the other side from them—would you go to people like that when they’ve just watched somebody be killed?\nTa-Nehisi Coates, for example, wrote a piece in Vanity Fair, setting out a collection of statements from Charlie Kirk, that was quite representative. Did you think that was unfair?\nNo. I agree with Ta-Nehisi on virtually every view he has on things that Charlie Kirk had said. As I wrote in my second piece, I have poured virtually every ounce of myself into preventing everything that Kirk poured himself into creating. For more people than I had understood, the sense that we are in any way in community together—the sense that we are still in a place where we are all practicing and doing politics—has already eroded. Something that’s very alive for me is a feeling that we are not that far from national rupture. So many things that we like to say “can’t happen here” have already been happening here.\nAnd who do you blame for that?\nI mean, I blame Donald Trump quite specifically for that. I think that the way he has acted in the aftermath of Kirk’s murder has been an exhibition of virtually everything that is wrong—\nI’m in a hundred-per-cent agreement with you there. I watched a lot of that memorial service and—\nWhat did you think of it?\nI saw two remarkable things. I saw the widow of Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk, get up and do an extraordinary thing. Here is a woman whose world has been shattered, whose family has been shattered, who’s lost the husband she adored, and she forgave the person who killed him. I don’t know that I could ever be capable of that. And then who spoke later? Donald Trump. He got up and he said, “I hate my opponent; I can’t be like that.” And it wasn’t just rhetoric, it wasn’t a tossed-off comment. It was true. And that—that really struck me.\nThere is some part of him, I think, that would thrill to the possibility of an excuse to crack down [on his opponents]. They’re already trying it in many ways.\nThe other thing I saw, to be honest, was a political opportunity. A politics of hatred is a weak politics. A lot of people desire something different. I found myself thinking a lot recently about the speech through which Barack Obama rose to power—the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech in Boston. I think a lot of people now have almost given up on that type of politics.\nBut you remember what Obama said about it? That it was an aspirational speech.\nOf course. Aspiration is very powerful in politics. And—because I am genuinely worried about rupture, but also because I’m genuinely determined to try to be useful in making our politics better and having people whom I trust more holding power—I think we should not engage in oppositional mirroring, where whatever the other side does, we do. You hate me? Oh, well you know what? I hate you.\nDo you see a lot of mirroring on the liberal side?\nOne huge strategic mistake we have made on the liberal side, for at least a decade now, is, yes, oppositional mirroring.\nHow would you illustrate that?\nLet me give you an example. Obama’s a very, very effective politician because he’s very good at containing opposites inside of him. You wrote a biography of him. You know this about him better than just about anybody. He was very good at having a sense that, if you’re going to push the country, you also need to create space in yourself—in your political movement, in your rhetoric—for the disagreement, for the concern, for the pushback. He was this generationally capable political balancer, holding both our liberalism and our illiberalism inside himself. After him, I think, this began to break down. Trump rises and you have, say, the Hillary Clinton “deplorables” speech, which is—\nWhich was a deplorable speech.\nThe worst word in that speech is “irredeemable.” She says that people voting for Trump are “irredeemable.” When you begin to talk like that, it’s a severing of political community.\nWhat happens is Trump then wins, which is taken as truly shocking, and the Democratic Party begins to take on the opposite positions of Trump in many ways. Trump is the most anti-immigrant President of our lifetime—not just in his desire to build a wall but emotionally anti-immigrant. The Democratic Party becomes much more pro-immigrant. If you’re going to build a wall, we’re going to debate legalizing, decriminalizing, illegal border crossing.\nBut that wasn’t true across the board. There were a lot of differing positions on immigration—and not expressed with a similar, much less equivalent, hatred.\nI agree that Donald Trump is unique in the way he radiates hatred. And I think you know this, even as you’re pushing me on this: If you talk to people on the right—and, I’m not talking about Donald Trump or people at the top of politics, I’m talking about the people in my life who ended up voting for Trump—they felt, in these years, profoundly rejected. I do think this politics of “deplorables” was very real.\nI covered the Affordable Care Act very closely. When that passed, Democrats held Senate seats in Arkansas, Louisiana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, and West Virginia. I think competing in these states has become, in many ways, unimaginable to Democrats. They are just written off largely. Pete Buttigieg is considered one of the brightest political lights in the Democratic Party. He might be President, but nobody thinks he could be governor of Indiana, right?\nCertainly people who don’t agree with the things I believe in the world began to feel that the Democratic Party genuinely didn’t like them. And one of my most strongly held views about politics is that the most important question for voters is not whether they like the politician, but whether the politician likes them. If voters are going to trust you with power, the first thing they’re concerned about is not whether they agree with you. The first thing is whether or not they feel you like them, and will take them into consideration.\nBut do you think any of that was centered on Obama himself?\nOh, there’s no doubt.\nWhy? Because of his character?\nBecause he was Black and foreign to people.\nThere you go.\nAnd I’ll ask you this question: Do you think Obama would’ve won in 2016 if he could have run again?\n\nSo there you go. Politics is about power. And I think people have missed this. Politics is not about self-expression—there’s room for that. It’s not just about a dispassionate analysis of ideas—there’s room for that. It’s a lot of what I do, a lot of what you do. But politics is about building coalitions capable of winning power and about making the decisions you need to to be able to do that.\nI said recently, in a podcast with my colleague Ross Douthat, that I feel that there’s been a lot of fatalism among Democrats. They’ve just accepted that there are places where they cannot compete. And I said that I want to see real decisions being made to try to compete in Kansas and Missouri and Ohio and then in red states—meaning, redder than that. I’d like to see us running pro-life Democrats again. When Obamacare passed, about forty House Democrats were pro-life. People got very upset about that. I get why, but I think it’s worth thinking about this.\nHas it been bad for the Republican Party that Susan Collins, who is nominally pro-choice, wins in Maine? Has it been bad for the Republican Party that Donald Trump welcomed R.F.K., Jr., and all of his voters—from Joe Rogan all the way down—into their coalition? No, it has expanded their power. Trump built coalitions when he thought it would serve him. He is, among many other things, a ruthlessly political animal. I think there are things to take seriously in that, which we have begun to demean.\nI hear you. The difficulty is juggling these plates all at once.\n\nRight now, you’re speaking the language of conciliation and broadening the scope and the tent—temperamentally and politically—of the Democratic Party. I hear you on that. At the same time, you have—and I think we agree on this, too—a President who is, in fact, uniquely authoritarian in his instincts and, it would seem, in his policies as well. And to do those things at the same time—to fight that battle at the same time—is hard to do. It seems almost irreconcilable, temperamentally, within the Democratic Party.\nI think some of this reflects the absence right now of a leader in the Democratic Party who can sort of make decisions on behalf of it. But to me these two things are the same. If you are facing Mitt Romney, you have a margin for loss. If you lose, it’s a shame. But it’s Mitt Romney. Nothing that bad is going to happen. If you keep losing to maga, then at least the way I look at the world, terrible things are going to happen—truly terrible things. And the risk of catastrophic things happening—the risk of what we understand to be the American political system cracking into something else—becomes very real.\nBut you’re asking for a certain kind of equanimity within the Democratic Party.\nNo, I’m asking for strategic discipline.\nWhat’s the difference?\nI’m saying that we should take on an approach to politics that we think will expand our coalition such that we are not always within two points of losing to Donald Trump or the people around him. And if that means doing things that are uncomfortable. . . . When people get terrible diseases, they don’t take the medicines because they enjoy the side effects—they do it because it might work.\nWho exemplifies this temperament of leadership, and of the way he or she looks at the world?\nI’m not sure I have the person right now. I mean in some ways I think I am saying we should rediscover the politics of Barack Obama.\nTell me more about that.\nI don’t think it’s an accident that the last two Democrats to win nationally, and serve two terms, had this very open-palmed approach to politics and were very good at balancing these different forces and dynamics in them. That doesn’t mean, by the way, that their Presidencies did not drive many people on the other side crazy. Bill Clinton, in ways that in retrospect look ridiculous, drove the right crazy. I mean, you remember the conspiracy theories about Vince Foster and all the rest of it. And Obama, by virtue of who he is—no matter how conciliatory he was—by virtue of his identity, by virtue of his skin color, by virtue of his name, drove the right nuts.\nAre you happy with how present or not Barack Obama is in the national conversation and debate?\nNo. I think we could use more of his leadership and voice right now. I’ve said this on my show, and I’ll say it on yours: I wish he were more out there. But I think that he’s still playing by the rules, wherein it would be unseemly for a former President to take a very public role. I also think he believes that if he does that he will choke off oxygen for the next generation of Democratic leaders to rise. But I would like to see Barack Obama on “Joe Rogan.”\nAnd I think we both know that he would do it in a second.\nI can’t speak for him, but I think so. I think it would be good for him to be in places talking to people who don’t often hear from us—people who might be persuadable. Not going to Fox News and going on Jesse Watters’s show. But I think having the best communicator in modern liberalism out there trying to describe what is wrong with this moment, in ways that are not like clips from a thing with Steve Scully, would be good. You have to win in the attentional sphere, right now. And there are very few people who can do it as well as he can.\nObama, who was a hero of liberalism at a certain point in time, now takes a lot of criticism from the left, or the left-left, depending on how you see it. I wonder how you look at that phenomenon now.\nI’ve been thinking a ton about this. How does Obama go, in a pretty compressed number of years, from nearly an impossibility—the very act of his election seeming like a pivotal moment in the country to many people—to this by the end of his term? He is still the most popular national-level politician in America today. It’s very easy, I think, to overstate the Obama backlash. He’s doing better than any other figure, which is why I’d like to see him out there more.\nBut I think it reflects a couple of things. The hopes that his campaign aroused in people were not capable of being delivered upon by the prose of actual governing—through Congress, and the filibuster, and all these blockages. He did a lot, but it wasn’t enough. And so there was a letdown. Then he’s followed by Trump, and I think the Obama legacy looks different to people because it seems to have ended not in this arc bending toward justice. Instead, it’s followed by very rapid regression.\nOne of the ways I view politics is that the communication mediums upon which it happens are very determinative of what then becomes powerful and popular and energetic. The move to social media and algorithmic media was really a move toward a style of political communication that is somewhat hostile to the liberal project and the deliberative, open-minded, thoughtful, on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand mode of discourse that Obama is good at. He’s bad at Twitter. You ever read Obama on Twitter? It’s not his thing. Trump is good at Twitter.\nIt actually is a remarkable experiment, what we’re doing here. The idea that a country as big and diverse, with as much political argumentation and division as we have, was actually doing the work of democracy, doing the work of politics—that’s actually amazing. And I think Obama wasn’t able to keep that story going, and nobody kept it going after him. But I do think there is a lot of power in actually reconnecting people at this moment when I think they feel—I certainly feel it—that this could break. We could just break this. Somebody like Trump could just break this.\nDo you feel we’re on the verge of being broken? Do you despair?\nI don’t despair, but I take seriously the possibilities of calamity.\nWhat does broken look like?\nI think broken looks like, among other possible things, state-sponsored political violence at a mass scale. I think broken looks like more violence coming out and the political party in power using that to deploy the National Guard, using that to deploy, what ice might be functionally now, a paramilitary. I think that it looks like Hungary, right? You already see the way Trump is using the power of the state to try to alter where power lies: the redistricting in Texas, the intimidation of network news. We have seen democratic backsliding in other countries and the use of the state to fundamentally change the playing field of elections. Elections still happen, but they’re not really fair. I think you can imagine a lot of ways it breaks.\nBy the way, the country has broken before. We’ve had periods of rupture before. It’s not an unknown thing. The worst set of outcomes are very bad, and I think that the probability set of them has gotten larger, and it’s going to take luck and leadership to keep the worst from happening, and to get us into somewhere better, where we’re not just endlessly on the precipice of this kind of collapse.\nThere’s a lot I disagree with Trump on, but one thing I really find offensive about him, and I would say this about J. D. Vance now, too, is that I don’t think either of them believe in this project anymore. J. D. Vance at one point did. But I think what Trump said is how he feels. He hates his enemies.\nAnd hatred rather than ideology is the animating force?\nI think for Vance, there’s a more kind of scarily ideological structure. I think he’s very influenced by people who believe that America was lost at some point in the past fifty years. They differ on exactly when it was, and you need some kind of counter-revolution to restore it to the heritage Americans who are really supposed to have ownership over this. There’s a profound contempt and anger that radiates from both Trump and Vance. And I think that they both intend—Trump in his intuitive way, Vance in his more systematic way—to instantiate that into policy and power. And things can get really bad when you attempt to do that.\nHow do you defeat that? In other words, we began our conversation with an endorsement of the ability to sit down with people who you disagree with ferociously—not just over tax policy but ferociously on fundamental things. But how is this rupture to be prevented?\nThis is the work of politics. And one thing I believe is that we’ve begun to demean the work of politics. One of the things I am worried about is—I actually think a little bit on both sides, but it’s particularly true in the Democratic Party—that the work of building political coalitions around disagreement has often become seen as something akin to betrayal.\nSo I am interested to see the Democrats run in 2026, and I would like to see, in places where it’s become very hard for Democrats to win, very unusual candidates. I would like to see them trying more things. Graham Platner, in Maine, is an interesting way to try to do that from an economic, populist perspective. But Maine is not a red state, so that’s not what’s going to win you in Texas. You see James Talarico, in Texas—he’s kind of an interesting candidate. Who are the Democrats going to run in Kansas? Who are they going to run in Missouri? Sherrod Brown, in Ohio, is a very strong candidate.\nI think that over a four-, eight-, twelve-year period, we need to repolarize this country in a safer way than we have. Not this sort of system, anti-system polarization. And that means mixing up the parties a little bit again. This sense that you will need to build bridges right now to survive, that maybe are not the ones you most prefer building—I think that’s very real. And I think that requires us to see the work of politics as honorable work, even when it includes a lot of compromise and a lot of working with people who we have very, very deep disagreements with. But you’re trying to build power, and you’re trying to do good things with that power. And that is the point of politics.\nI grew up in Irvine, California. The district I lived in did not elect a Democrat to Congress until Katie Porter, in 2018. My father was a professor at U.C.I., and is now retired.\nHe taught what?\nMathematics, which I’m not good at. I used to joke that I’m good at math for a journalist.\nThat’s not saying much.\nIt’s not. So my dad’s a mathematician. My mother worked with children and was an artist. They’re both, thankfully, alive and healthy. My house was mostly Democratic. But it wasn’t a highly political house. We did not receive The New Yorker or The New Republic. We got the L.A. Times, watched nightly newscasts, and there was some talk radio. It wasn’t a highly political house.\nYou had some political enthusiasms early on. You worked for Howard Dean.\nYes, when I was in college. My older brother worked in environmental law, and used to take me to protests in L.A., where he lived.\nWhat kind of protests?\nFarm workers’ marches. But I primarily got into politics through blogging. I became a blogger back when nobody knew what that was. This is when I was a freshman in college, in 2003. And I just loved writing about politics, reading about politics, thinking about politics, debating it with people.\nWhen I began to read you, in little venues early on, you were the first self-branded journalist that I knew of—when you were doing “Wonkblog,” at the Washington Post.\nSimpler time.\nWell, but you were an innovative person, and had an analytic cast of mind when it came to politics, which a lot of journalists just don’t have. How did that develop, and do you accept the premise?\nSomebody told me recently that they think of my work as a cerebral Trojan horse for emotional ideas. Which I don’t think is wrong, actually.\nWhat are they getting at that you think is true?\nI would say—I don’t think this is my reputation anymore, in the way it was in the “Wonkblog” days—but the idea that I was this cool, detached calculator of a reporter or journalist. . . . I mean, the reason I care about these things is that I feel incredibly emotionally compelled by the stakes of politics—whether or not people get health care, whether or not we go to war, what kinds of people are in power. That these things are shaping our lives, whether we want them to or not, is a central, almost physical reality we all have to face. And understanding them is one of the few ways to try to face it.\nBut, kind of like a Marxist or a certain kind of conservative of a different sort, there is this systemic look at the way things work. When you were twenty-eight, still at the Washington Post, you used to give a talk that was called “Why Washington Is Horrible (in Charts),” with the main point being that we focus way too much on individuals and maybe not enough on Washington as a system. Tell me what that was about, and how much is it carried over to your thinking today?\nWe have this functionally false idea of how our political system works, based on the founder’s intentions, which is that we’re a system of checks and balances. We have three coequal branches that will jealously guard their power and prerogatives from one another. Well, that was the intention of our system. In fact, what we have is two political parties that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution because they were not predicted or anticipated or hoped for. They compete across those branches.\nSo, right now, we have a Republican-controlled Congress coöperating with a Republican-controlled executive branch, and, I would say, coöperating with a Republican-controlled Supreme Court. Unless you have, built into the way you are looking at politics, the influence and fundamental centrality of parties—which our system does not do in any rigorous way—you will not understand either how it works or how it doesn’t work.\nIn the Senate, maybe less so now, it was certainly a mainstay of political reporting to treat everything as, The President should be able to get this done. And, if it’s not getting done, it was, Well, what’s the President doing wrong? But the filibuster was being used constantly. And unless you realized, Oh, it’s actually very hard to get to sixty votes in the Senate, and in this time of polarization it’s hard to get bipartisan coöperation. . . . I think it’s important, I think it is part of our duty—our, on some level, sacred duty—to give people a true account of why things are happening. And that requires understanding the systems in which people operate. Because most of us, for better and for worse, reflect the systems which structure the logics of our lives.\nI want to go back to the question that I raised before, about your influence in the Democratic Party. How do you feel it and not feel it?\nPeople really began seeing me this way around when Biden left the ticket. In early 2024, around the time of the Super Bowl and the Robert Hur [testimony], I did a series of pieces basically saying, It’s going to be catastrophic for this then eighty-one-year-old to run again. The big problem to me in the Party, at that point, was fatalism.\nSo were you getting feedback from the Biden people? Did anyone mail you a dead fish?\nNo, but I got people telling me that they thought I was wrong. People icing me out. I got much more aggressive feedback in public in some ways than I did in private. In private, the feedback I got, let me put it this way, was more measured, but it was more, I think, destructive. It was, Well, we have no choice but to run; there’s nobody but Biden, because otherwise it’ll be Kamala Harris and she’ll lose. That was the quiet whisper response to anybody who thought Biden shouldn’t run.\nFrom Biden’s people?\nFrom that world of people, yes. And I, one, thought Harris would be a better bet. I think she would’ve been a much better bet if Biden had left the ticket much earlier. I also believed we should have had an open convention.\nEven with only a hundred and seven days left on the clock?\nHe could’ve left before that.\nWithout question, and should have.\nBy the time he left, there wasn’t time for it.\nIt was too late.\nIt was too late. He had waited too long. But when I did that series of pieces about Biden being too old to run, I would say that they were not influential at all. Biden gave a good State of the Union, and everybody thought I was an idiot. And that’s just where the situation sat.\nWhat changed the situation was reality. It was Joe Biden getting up in that debate and falling apart. And so I don’t see this as some remarkable campaign of influence I ran. I think I was seeing reality a little bit . . . I was seeing it clearly, but voters had seen this long before I said anything about it. The super-majority of the public had said for a long time that Biden was too old to run again. I helped create a little bit of permission structure for people to admit that when reality interceded and it was no longer something that could be denied.\nDo you ever get Democratic senators, congressmen calling you on the phone asking for counsel or private conversations in which you’re not acting in a kind of journalist-interview atmosphere?\nI have always—and I’m sure you do, too—\nNo, I don’t.\n—had a lot of conversations that are—I would describe them as, like, exchanging thoughts. I don’t believe that you don’t, David. I don’t think that’s true.\nNo, it is true.\nLike, not everything is an interview for publication in a column. You have lunches, you do all that. I do that, too.\nBut it’s not in the spirit of giving counsel. I’m not saying you do it—\nNo, I take that point. I don’t see myself in those conversations as a counsellor.\nBecause, you know, there is a tradition of this—Walter Lippmann giving counsel to this one or that one.\nAnd doing secret diplomatic missions. The lines were blurry back then.\nSo you keep it pretty on the up and up.\n\nWould you ever go into politics?\n\nAbsolutely not? You’re making a Sherman statement.\nI’m making a Sherman statement. I think you have to know what you’re good at doing. I think I’m good at doing this.\nWhat is your sense of your mission as a podcaster, as a writer?\nMy sense of mission is simple: I have values and beliefs about how the world should work and what would make the world better, and I try to persuade people of them, but I also try to explore them in an honest way. I do this because I care about where things are going. I’m not dispassionately observing from the sidelines. I am emotionally, intellectually, spiritually involved.\nBut what I’m doing, and the way I’m doing it, has changed a lot over the years. In ways that I can follow more through intuition than through some framework. The version of me that was writing “Wonkblog,” and telling everybody about health care and aging in one chart, is not what I’m doing on my podcast now. My podcast is a forum in which I’m not primarily trying to be persuasive. Over time I think it has persuasive elements, but it’s mostly other people talking. I have a lot of people on the show whom I disagree with. And I think it acts as a space in which certain kinds of conversations can be had and then can be put into conversation with each other. And that matters.\nIn my column, I’m more prescriptive. What goes into, eventually, the book “Abundance,” comes more from the column, and that’s me trying to understand the world and trying to find ways to confront things in it that I find puzzling or unnerving. I try to take seriously questions that I don’t love. I don’t try to insist the world works the way I want it to work. I try to be honest with myself about the way it is working.\nYou are an important figure at what I think is still, today, the most important news-gathering organization on earth, the New York Times, but it’s also one that everybody has opinions about. And recently Thomas Chatterton Williams wrote a book about the summer of 2020, which was dramatic in a lot of quarters, including the Times. James Bennett fired. Bari Weiss left and created The Free Press. What’s your opinion about Bari Weiss’s increasing influence? It looks like she’s about to be a very important figure at CBS News.\nYeah, it seems like she’s about to take over CBS.\nWhat do you think?\nMy thing about Bari—and I’ve been on her show—I have a lot of admiration for how good she is at what she does. My disagreements with Bari are that I think she’s asymmetric in sympathy and generosity.\nTell me what that means.\nI’ve thought The Free Press’ work on, say, starvation in Gaza has been really bad.\nSpell it out.\nIt’s done this whole thing, like, Well, a lot of the kids who have died and have been reported on, well, they had secondary conditions. And, yes, when you starve a population the people who die first will be the most vulnerable. But that’s not exculpatory. There was overwhelming evidence of how bad things were in Gaza. I felt that they were trying to whitewash it.\nI think Bari, though, is an insane talent spotter. If you look at what she’s built at The Free Press, she’s very, very good at finding people, at pulling them in, at networking with them. She’s sort of an impresario. Bringing in Tyler Cowen to be a columnist was a very good idea for them.\nThe economist.\nI’m somebody who’s edited a site, Vox, right? I know how hard this is to do. And Bari has an incredibly sensitive feel for the political moment. It is not my feel for the moment, and her politics are not mine.\nWhat are her politics? How would you describe them?\nWhat I see her trying to do is something that used to be somewhat more common, which is to self-consciously be what she would define as the center. And I see The Free Press tacking back and forth around that. It was much more sort of pro-Trump, I would say, when he was running and the Democrats were in power. But now that he’s in it’s, like, Oh, no, they’re the vandals. The publication is a little bit, to me, like the old New Republic, doing things they used to do. . . . Actually, it’s funny. When I was a blogger, this was something we all used to complain about all the time. All of these organizations that we felt were using this concept, this amorphous concept of the center as a positioning device—\nThat it was a dodge.\nNo, it wasn’t a dodge—it was navigational. They weren’t dodging. They were just kind of . . . there were a lot of politicians and a lot of players who had felt like their politics were hewing to some idea of the center, as opposed to a very consistent set of views and principles. And, as media has become polarized, many fewer places are doing that. I think Bari saw a market opportunity in that. Is her center what I think is the center? No. But I recognize a lot of editorial skill there.\nSo how do you look at the Washington Post now?\nMy sense, in a way that is quite tragic . . . I’ve not spoken to Jeff Bezos about any of this, I don’t know him—but I don’t think he has found it fun to own the Washington Post. Maybe he did right at the beginning.\nHe did for the first term of Trump.\nHe did for the first term. And then it became a headache, a liability. The staff is always mad at him.\nAnd it’s no fun at all.\nAnd it’s no fun at all. And—\nAnd he seems to want to have a lot of fun.\nAnd I think he wants to have a lot of fun. And I think he’s somewhat punishing the institution, making clear that you can’t do this to him, he’s in charge. And I think that—I mean, I don’t think this, this is just obvious—the turns in leadership since Marty Baron have just been sort of disastrous. They just have not worked. And it’s a shame. I mean, the Post is in a tough position, because their specialty is politics. And what they should be—\n—is the best in politics.\n—is the absolute best political newspaper or reporting organization. But they face so much competition at the national political level—not just the Times but Politico, Axios, The Atlantic—to be the best at politics. The Wall Street Journal, actually, I think has been doing very, very good political work. To be the best at politics is really hard. And I don’t think it would’ve been possible for the Post to do, but I think it would’ve required really focussing on politics. And then Bezos—he doesn’t want to be the best at reporting on politics. He wants to be occupying a certain political space himself. The Post has become a danger and a liability to him in that. And that’s become a danger and a liability to the Post.\nWhat do you see as the most important and interesting media enterprises that are emerging in this new universe?\nI think that the media has developed this barbell shape. You have some behemoth-level players: the New York Times, Condé Nast, the Murdoch operations, some of the networks, and so on. You’ve got a couple really big players, and it’s been hard for them, but there are ways to succeed at that. It has a not winner-take-all but a winner-take-more dynamic. And then it is much easier to be an individual or near-individual proprietor. When I started blogging, you couldn’t monetize that. Now Substack makes it very monetizable. And so you have some interesting publications that have begun there. The Free Press is one of them. But you could also look at things like The Dispatch and The Bulwark. The Argument, edited by Jerusalem Demsas, which is a sort of new liberal publication, is something that I think is exciting and I’m watching closely.\nWhat has been decimated is the middle. And the middle is really important. I don’t just mean local newspapers, like the Baltimore Sun, though I mean that, too. I also mean the middle of magazines. What GQ and Esquire were in the seventies is not what they are today. The L.A. Times, the Boston Globe—when these things stop being what they were, you’re training a lot less talent, you have a lot less diversity in what is being reported, and the local-news need is being very badly underserved. I think magazines are the form of media I love most. You’d be shocked at how many of them I subscribe to.\nWhy is it important for you to be at the Times as opposed to out on your own?\nI believe in journalistic institutions. When I went out and did Vox, I was trying to build an institution, not just go out on my own and capture the most revenue that I could. I think that the mix of the news is exciting, and I’m committed to the news as an industry. If you carve out all the national politics, et cetera, then it’s much harder to also have the foreign reporting, the local reporting, the cultural reporting—all the things that make up the bundle. And those are the things I often care about. And I think I’m just—it goes to the way I look at the world, but also just me—an institutionalist. I like being at an institution. I admire institutions when they’re doing good, and I want them to succeed because I think we need them.\nLet me ask you about an institution that we were talking about earlier: the Democratic Party. You talk a lot to people within the Democratic Party, leaders of the Democratic Party. It looks like a mess at this point. You have some promising people in—\n[Laughs.] What makes you say that, David?\nI just conjured it out of thin air. In New York City, it looks like Zohran Mamdani is going to be the next mayor of New York City. If I read you right, you have ambivalence about Mamdani. Or have you come around in some way?\nI wrote a piece during the mayoral primary where I said that I thought Brad Lander was the best choice. But I think Mamdani is an amazing political talent. I agree with him on many issues. My concerns about Mamdani really just have to do with: can he first get the revenue he needs for a very pricey agenda? He’s talked a bunch about “Abundance” and has done interviews with my co-author, Derek Thompson. Can he actually rebuild the government such that he can achieve the kinds of things he wants to achieve? And what is going to happen when the Trump Administration moves into a confrontational mode with him? Because I think it will, right? They’re going to want to break him: escalate ICE raids, send in the National Guard here, occupy New York City. He’s inexperienced as an executive. New York City is a very hard thing to run at the best of times. He has not run much. But I don’t think of those as terrible demerits to somebody. You could have said some of the same things about Barack Obama on one level. And we’re just going to have to see how it plays out.\nI think it is genuinely strange the way the leadership of the Democratic Party has treated him. At this point, I have not heard an account that makes sense. If they’re trying to keep him at arm’s length, it will not work. He is going to be the mayor of New York as a Democrat. Saying that they’re friendly to him but not endorsing him is not going to save them from being painted by what he does. On the other hand, to all the people who are inspired by him and like him, they look feckless. I’ve said this on other shows: if they don’t want to endorse him, if they think he’d be a bad choice, then they should say that. But this weird ambivalence dance they’re doing is, I just think, much more bizarre.\nWell, the ambivalence, I assume, comes from a kind of fear of his popularity and his talent.\nI don’t think it comes from there.\nWhere do you think that comes from?\nI think they are afraid that he will open up gigantic surfaces that they will have to defend and they will have trouble doing it. You’ve been on my show, we’ve talked about this—I am truly horrified at Israel’s conduct in Gaza at this point. I think it’s a—\n\nI think we’re well past war crimes. I think we’re into something generational. But Mamdani’s promise to, say, direct the New York City police to arrest Benjamin Netanyahu the moment he steps foot in New York City, say, to attend a U.N. meeting. . . . I think Netanyahu would probably love this confrontation.\nAs would Trump.\nAs would Trump. But I can understand why the Democratic Party’s leadership is afraid of what might combust. Israel’s a very hard issue for them. It splits their base very badly. So I can see—if I, like, squint. But I don’t think what the Democrats are afraid of is talent. I think they’re afraid of something that goes off the rails that they’re then trying to defend. But I just don’t think what they’re doing makes sense. One thing I’ve been saying about the big tent of the Democratic Party is: the theory of having a big tent doesn’t just mean moving to the right—it also means accepting the left. And Mamdani is going to be one of the left’s standard bearers.\nIn the last two weeks, there have been stories about A.O.C., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and what the future might hold for her: either running for Senate or even President. When you think about her? Do you see her as a potential President?\nI don’t know. We’d have to see how she performed in a primary—what her agenda was, what her campaign looked like, how she performed under that kind of scrutiny. But I think you have to see her as one of the people who is a serious contender for that role. She would naturally inherit Bernie Sanders’s lane and most of his supporters. He doesn’t have full control over those supporters, of course; some people might’ve liked him who wouldn’t like her. But I think the anti-oligarchy tour they were doing was in certain ways the passing of the torch from him to her. And Bernie has been incredibly powerful in Democratic primaries and came very near winning, in 2016 and 2020. I think that you have to assume that she would just start with a more solid base of support than all but a couple other people. When I’ve seen the early polling—and you should be extraordinarily skeptical of 2025 polling for a 2028 primary, but—\nI’d be skeptical of it even in 2027.\nFair enough. But she is polling behind only Pete Buttigieg and Gavin Newsom. This is in polls where Kamala Harris is not included. And so you’re looking at somebody who starts out with one of the clearest lanes, because so many other candidates are going to be competing in the non-Bernie lane. And so it would be pretty straightforward how you would imagine her winning the primary.\nYou were describing Obama before and his talents, but also his more capacious ideology. Who’s in that lane?\nI don’t know that we know yet. Probably the closest person in the way he thinks about politics is Buttigieg, but whether or not Buttigieg can do what Obama was able to do. . . . Part of what made Obama such an extraordinary force in the Democratic Party was his support among Black voters, which Buttigieg really struggles with.\nAnd Kamala Harris just admitted, in her new book, that the reason she’d didn’t select Pete Buttigieg as her Vice-President was that he’s gay. And that would’ve been, I don’t know—\nReally? She says that in the book?\n—too much identity in one ticket. That was her. . . yes. That she would have gone for Buttigieg.\nHuh. I’ve not read it yet, but that is interesting.\nHow do you mean interesting?\nIt’s just interesting. I’m surprised she said that.\nWe are at the close of our conversation, but I have to ask you a crucial question. You go to Burning Man?\nI’ve been known to go to Burning Man.\nWould I enjoy it?\nNo, you would not.\nYou sleep on the ground, that sort of thing?\nI mean, you could do it in different ways. You could take an R.V., you could go to what’s called a “plug and play” camp. I think it’s an amazing thing for anybody to see once—\nOnce a philosopher, twice a pervert, as they say.\nThat applies probably better to Burning Man than most places.\nNo doubt. So I would hate it?\nI mean, you might have depths and multitudes inside of you that I don’t know. But when I see the musicians you profile—they’re not the ones who play there.\nNo, I hear you. I don’t think they could sleep on the ground, either. In fact, most of them are under the ground. Ezra Klein, thank you so much.\nDavid, I really appreciate it. ♦\nThe New Yorker Radio Hour is a co-production of WNYC Studios and The New Yorker.","summary":"The writer and podcast host on the Charlie Kirk discourse, Barack Obama’s distance from politics, Bari Weiss’s Gaza coverage, and the Democratic Party’s future.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/ezra-klein-argues-for-big-tent-politics","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68d597e7155bfadc8da9d3d5/16:9/w_3840,h_2160,c_limit/RADIO_HOUR_Ezra_Klein_FINAL_09_25_2025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 18:00:00","author":"David Remnick","authors":["David Remnick"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":363777628,"title":"Former White House Official Says Colbert Would Only Book Him If He Denounced Trump","text":"The National Security Advisor during President Donald Trump’s first term was invited on \"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert in 2024, but on one condition: he had to tell the audience not to vote for Trump. \"When my book 'At War With Ourselves' came out, my publicist said, ‘Hey, you know, the Stephen Colbert show said you could come on, but only if you condemn President Trump and tell people not to vote for him,’\" Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster said on the GoodFellows podcast this week. McMaster said he turned down the invitation immediately. \"I don’t know if it was a producer or Colbert himself, but there’s been an orthodoxy that’s taken hold of late-night television. So many of these monologues, honestly, are just diatribes. They’re not funny. Which might explain why the ratings are dropping.\" McMaster is unlikely the only guest to have faced such conditions. A recent NewsBusters study found that since the start of 2025, 99% of late-night guests were \"left-leaning\". Among partisan officials, the tally was 30 Democrats and zero Republicans. Imagine if a conservative host demanded that a liberal guest bash Joe Biden or Kamala Harris before coming on. Media figures like Brian Stelter would demand accountability. Yet McMaster’s story will likely go ignored — just as many outlets ignored news that Google admitted that they received pressure from the Biden administration to censor content. This is all such a rigged carnival. The past week, following Jimmy Kimmel's short-lived suspension, proves that. But ultimately, Colbert and Kimmel have hurt themselves the most by engaging in petty partisan politics. While both decided to wave goodbye to half the country, moderate and right-leaning viewers waved right back. Each has lost nearly half its audience since the pandemic. CBS says Colbert’s show, ending in May 2026, loses around $40 million a year. Kimmel averaged 30% fewer viewers than Colbert and likely loses just as much. No one expects Colbert or Kimmel to echo the late Rush Limbaugh. However, blacklisting conservative guests – unless they’re willing to denounce Trump – is bad business. It’s why, aside from headlines about cancellations or suspensions, Colbert and Kimmel are close to irrelevant. They dug their own graves.","summary":"The National Security Advisor during President Donald Trump’s first term was invited on “The Late Show &quot;with Stephen Colbert in 2024, but on one condition: he had to tell the audience not to vote for Trump.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/former-white-house-official-says-colbert-would-only-book-him-he-denounced-trump","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/09/colbert-late-show-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 17:55:43","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.761},{"id":363774730,"title":"Douglas Schoen: Desperate to pass Prop. 50, Newsom risks enlisting the far-left","text":"After multiple steps to move towards the center, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken a decided lurch to the left, enlisting progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to help him pass Proposition 50, the controversial redistricting measure.\n\nIndeed, Newsom recently shared an ad featuring the star progressive congresswoman, urging Californians to vote for Prop. 50 as a way to “stop” President Donald Trump. There is also a similar Spanish-language ad aimed at California’s large Hispanic population.\n\nTo be sure, AOC has long sought to raise her national profile, but campaigning for a ballot measure 3,000 miles away from her New York district suggests that both sides hope to benefit.\n\nFor Newsom, he clearly believes that in order to win – and position himself as Democrats’ leader ahead of his own 2028 presidential bid – he must court progressives.\n\nAnd for her part, as Axios reported, AOC’s appearance in the middle of a California ballot measure debate comes as her team is preparing a 2028 run for either the White House or the Senate.\n\nWhile California’s deep-blue electorate is probably more receptive to AOC than most other states, Newsom’s strategy of courting the far-left carries significant risks, both for this vote and for his longer term viability in a presidential general election.\n\nMoreover, by nationalizing the fight over Prop. 50, should it not pass, Newsom runs the tremendous risk of turning a local defeat into a national embarrassment. \n\nTo that point, despite AOC’s high favorability among Democrats – two-thirds (65%) have a favorable view of her, per Economist/YouGov – she is a liability for Newsom among Independents.\n\nJust 3-in-10 (31%) of this critical voting bloc have a favorable view of AOC in the same poll, while nationally, she is 6-points underwater (34% favorable vs. 40% unfavorable).\n\nAt the same time, AOC is capable of rallying California’s younger, progressive voters, which Newsom needs if he wants to have any chance of winning the special election. \n\nAnd, having staked his reputation – and leadership role within the Democratic party – on passing the ballot measure, polling data reinforces that Newsom is left with few options.\n\nAccording to an Emerson College survey, among California voters, the slimmest of majorities (50.6%) say they plan to vote for Proposition 50, while 49% plan to either oppose it (34%)

is highest among young, college educated Democrats – the core of the progressive wing.\n\nSimilarly, the UC Berkeley poll shows that three-quarters (76%) of voters who identify as “strongly liberal”

the subject of Gavin Newsom‘s face-offs with and trolling of President Donald Trump, Alyssa Farah Griffin lauded his employment of media, telling Navarro, Joy Behar, and Sara Haines on Friday’s episode of The View that she thinks “he gets where the country is going [and] gets where media is going.”\n\nNavarro chimed in to assert that “some of the left-wing Democratic podcasts are doing much

I don’t take it high, I take it low.”\n\nAfter the clip concluded, Navarro exclaimed, “Cardi B 2028!”\n\nGriffin and Haines both immediately thought of their fellow View panelist Sunny Hostin after hearing Cardi B’s take on Michelle Obama’s mantra.\n\nHaines explained, “Sunny Hostin says ‘to the Earth’s crust’ every time she says ‘if they go low, I’m going lower.'”\n\nWhile Haines said she doesn’t think “everyone’s cut out for that” mentality” because “it’s not just a technique you choose,” Navarro felt differently.\n\n“I’m cut out for that.

What’s happening is no less than a genocide and it’s unacceptable,” she said when asked about Palestine.\n\n“I’m terrified for my children, for all of our children,” the mother of two said about what it means for the future, adding that it makes her “so sad” knowing that the current “disrespect and discourse” in American politics will be “normal” to younger generations. \n\n“I mean, the kids who are voting right now at 18, it’s going to be totally normal to them that politics has no integrity. Politicians lie, there is no empathy,” Lawrence argued. “And everybody needs to remember that when you ignore what’s happening on one side of the world, it won’t be long until it’s on your side as well.”\n\nShe continued: “I wish that there was something I could say, something that I could do to fix this extremely complex and disgraceful situation. It breaks my heart.\n\n“But the reality is, our fear in speaking too much or answering too many of these questions is that my words will just be used to add more fire and rhetoric to something that is in the hands of our elected officials.”\n\nConcluding with a reminder to fellow citizens, she said: “I just want people to stay focused on who is responsible and the things that they can do and when they need to show up and vote, and not let the actors and the artists who are trying to express freedom of art, freedom of speech take the heat for the individuals that are actually responsible.”\n\nLawrence previously revealed she voted for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008.\n\n“My first time voting, I voted for John McCain. I was a little Republican,” the Kentucky-born actor said on a 2020 episode of the Absolutely Not podcast. She clarified that while she was raised in a Republican household, she later shifted her “politics based on the things I learned.”\n\nThough she acknowledged “the fiscal benefits of the Republican policies,” she said that she “could also see the social issues weren’t in line with my views.”\n\nLast year, she endorsed former Vice President Harris due to her stance on reproductive rights. “That’s the most important thing, is to not let somebody into the White House who is going to ban abortion,” she told People magazine.\n\nLawrence is at the Spanish festival for the screening of her new movie, Die My Love. She will also be honored with the prestigious Donostia Award.\n\nDirected by Lynne Ramsay, the thriller-comedy is based on Ariana Harwicz’s 2017 novel of the same name about a new mother (Lawrence) living in the countryside whose life unravels when she develops postpartum psychosis. Robert Pattinson plays Lawrence’s on-screen husband. \n\nWhile Sophie Monks Kaufman acknowledged the difficulty of adapting the Argentinian author’s ambiguous bestseller in her three-star review for The Independent, she concluded that “despite strong work from Robert Pattinson, this Lynne Ramsay psycho-drama never achieves lift-off.”","summary":"Oscar winner says it makes her ‘so sad’ that the current ‘disrespect and discourse’ in American politics ‘will be normal’ to younger generations","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jennifer-lawrence-palestine-israel-politics-b2834405.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/26/13/49/Jennifer-Lawrence.jpeg?crop=4696.5,3131,x151.7,y0&trim=0,152,0,151&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a7KpnpFb-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-26 16:31:23","author":"Inga Parkel","authors":["Inga Parkel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.273},{"id":363755488,"title":"Trump escalates retribution campaign with charges against Comey and threats against liberal groups","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s unprecedented retribution campaign against his perceived political enemies reached new heights as his Justice Department brought criminal charges against a longtime foe and he expanded his efforts to classify certain liberal groups as “domestic terrorist organizations.”\n\nDays after Trump publicly demanded action from his attorney general and tapped his former personal lawyer to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Virginia, former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime target of Trump’s ire, was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony in 2020.\n\nHours earlier Thursday, Trump signed a memorandum directing his Republican administration to target backers of what he dubbed “left-wing terrorism” as he alleged without evidence a vast conspiracy by Democrat-aligned nonprofit groups and activists to finance violent protests.\n\nThe developments marked a dramatic escalation of the president’s extraordinary use of the levers of presidential power to target his political rivals and his efforts to pressure the Justice Department to pursue investigations — and now prosecutions — of those he disdains. It’s an unabashed campaign that began soon after Trump returned to office and one that critics see as an abuse of power that puts every American who dares to criticize the president at risk of retaliation.\n\n“Donald Trump has made clear that he intends to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics,” said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Comey indictment came less than a week after Trump installed a former White House aide and confidant to the role of U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. The president had forced the ouster of his previous hand-selected pick because he was not sufficiently responsive to calls from Trump to bring charges against his longtime targets.\n\n“This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power,” Warner said. “Our system depends on prosecutors making decisions based on evidence and the law, not on the personal grudges of a politician determined to settle scores.”\n\nAn escalation in retribution\n\nThe first former president convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records to hide hush-money payments to conceal an alleged affair — Trump won the White House despite a host of other legal troubles over his alleged retention of classified information after leaving the White House in 2021 and his role in stoking denials of his 2020 electoral defeat that culminated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThursday’s moves were just the latest in a concerted effort by Trump to wield the vast powers of his office in unparalleled ways to punish his enemies since returning to the Oval Office in January. During his campaign, Trump made clear that this was his intention if he returned to office.\n\n“In 2016, I declared: I am your voice,” he said in 2023. “Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”\n\nEarlier this week, he signed an order designating a decentralized movement known as antifa — short for “anti-fascists” — as a domestic terrorist organization, a move testing broad First Amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States.\n\nThe Thursday memo went further, targeting liberal-leaning groups and donors, and “represents a significant abuse of power where the government is either changing the law or bending definitions to try and investigate and punish their political opponents in a way that is really unprecedented,” said Caitlin Legacki of Americans Against Government Censorship, which was founded to fight the Trump administration’s weaponization of the federal government against its political rivals.\n\nAs for Comey, she said, “It reeks of selective prosecution, it reeks of vindictive targeting and calls into question the integrity of many of the charges being brought by the office.”\n\nA widespread pressure campaign\n\nBeyond Comey, Trump has also pressured prosecutors to bring mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a massive civil fraud case against the president. Attorney General Pam Bondi last month named a special prosecutor to investigate mortgage fraud allegations against both James and Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff of California, another top Trump target. Both have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Justice Department has also begun examining mortgage fraud allegations against Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor who has won success in lower courts in challenging Trump’s effort to remove her from her job in a move she says is designed to erode the central bank’s independence. Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow him to oust her.\n\nHe has also stripped Secret Service protection from a slew of former officials, including his 2024 Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, members of former President Joe Biden’s family, and people who have fallen from favor, including his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nTrump has also targeted major institutions, revoking security clearances for attorneys at law firms he disfavors, pulling billions of dollars in federal research funds from elite universities, and securing multimillion-dollar settlements against media organizations in lawsuits that were widely regarded as weak cases.\n\nEarlier this week, he threatened ABC over the network’s decision to allow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel to return to the airwaves.\n\n“I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” Trump crowed.\n\nAnd his administration has fired or reassigned federal employees for their earlier work, including prosecutors who worked on cases against him. The Justice Department also fired Comey’s daughter, Maurene Comey, from her job as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. She has since sued, saying the termination was politically motivated.\n\nTrump celebrates the indictment\n\nTrump, meanwhile, cheered the Comey indictment, saying “JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” had been served, even as Comey has denied wrongdoing and expressed confidence in winning acquittal at trial.\n\nThe indictment was the culmination of a pressure campaign that burst into public view over the weekend when Trump aired his frustrations with Bondi on his social media site and demanded that she move forward with charges against Comey, James and Schiff.\n\n“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” he wrote on Truth Social Saturday. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” He said he would nominate Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer and a White House aide, to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to quicken the pace after the ouster of chief prosecutor Erik Siebert, who resigned under pressure to bring charges against James.\n\nThe charges against Comey came even as prosecutors in the office had written a memo detailing concerns about the pursuit of an indictment and their likelihood of success at trial.\n\nThe former FBI director said in a video Thursday night that he is innocent, but knew that “standing up to Donald Trump” would come with costs.\n\n“My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I am innocent,” Comey said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

But the report also found that McCabe made multiple false or misleading statements,” it added.\nIn July, the FBI launched an investigation into former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey over their roles in the investigation surrounding President Donald Trump and Russia’s alleged collusion.\n\nFollowing the indictment, Senior White House Adviser Peter Navarro told the Founder’s Roundtable on Breitbart Fight Club in an exclusive interview that Comey was “the mastermind or the useful idiot” behind the Russia Collusion Hoax.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Friday, President Trump said Comey lied, adding, “There is no way he can explain his way out of it.”\n\nTrump continued:\n\nHe is a Dirty Cop, and always has been, but he was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge, so he’s off to a very good start.

Be it his height, dating life, or days at NYC campus, people are always talking about him. He has surprised a lot of people lately, mostly because he seems so different from his dad, Donald Trump. He was once dubbed “Mini Donald.” However sometimes, it seems like the fatherly influence in Barron’s life comes from somewhere else.\n\nOne example is Donald Trump’s 2025 inauguration. Barron shook hands with both Former President Joe Biden and Former Vice President Kamala Harris. That left onlookers stunned and even sparked talk that he might have a future in politics.\n\nThere is one thing to note here. Trump refused to shake Biden’s hand before their 2024 presidential debate and only shook Harris’ hand in a later debate. She initiated the gesture. Podcaster Patrick Bet-David has even shared how impressed he was when Barron personally walked him and his guests to their car after a 2024 dinner.\n\nThat kind of thoughtfulness, insiders say, might come from someone else in the family, Barron’s grandfather, Viktor Knavs. “Viktor is extremely close to his grandson, Barron, and you often see them walking around Mar-a-Lago together — or at least you did before Barron went off to New York University,” a source told the Daily Mail in May 2025. Knavs is known to be a very private man. However, according to sources he’s been passing along some life lessons to Barron.\n\nDonald and Barron’s relationship has raised eyebrows before. In an October 2024 appearance on the PBD Podcast, Donald made waves when he called his son “cute” and said Barron had never dated anyone. For all anyone knows, Barron may have dated before, and his father simply didn’t know.\n\nDuring the campaign, Donald often credited Barron with helping him connect with younger voters, and the two seemed close. But after Inauguration Day, Barron stepped out of the spotlight. He didn’t even attend the traditional White House Easter Egg Roll in 2025, despite most of the family showing up.\n\nThen in August 2025 there was a moment that fueled even more talk of distance between them. Speaking to reporters, Donald referred to Barron as Melania’s son. “She’s got a great love of children, she has a wonderful son that she loves probably more than anybody, including me, I hate to say it,” he said (via People). The remark pointed out just how much Barron might prefer the company of his grandfather over his father.","summary":"Barron’s writing his own playbook","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/barron-trumps-behavior-has-people-talking-and-this-person-might-deserve-the-thanks","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Barron-Trumps-College-Life-is-Guarded-by-Secret-Service-Agents.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 14:32:02","author":"Mohar Battacharjee","authors":["Mohar Battacharjee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.193},{"id":363740904,"title":"Trump Escalates Retribution Campaign With Charges Against Comey and Threats Against Liberal Groups","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump’s unprecedented retribution campaign against his perceived political enemies reached new heights as his Justice Department brought criminal charges against a longtime foe and he expanded his efforts to classify certain liberal groups as “domestic terrorist organizations.”\n\nDays after Trump publicly demanded action from his attorney general and tapped his former personal lawyer to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Virginia, former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime target of Trump’s ire, was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony in 2020.\n\nHours earlier Thursday, Trump signed a memorandum directing his Republican administration to target backers of what he dubbed “left-wing terrorism” as he alleged without evidence a vast conspiracy by Democrat-aligned nonprofit groups and activists to finance violent protests.\n\nThe developments marked a dramatic escalation of the president’s extraordinary use of the levers of presidential power to target his political rivals and his efforts to pressure the Justice Department to pursue investigations — and now prosecutions — of those he disdains. It’s an unabashed campaign that began soon after Trump returned to office and one that critics see as an abuse of power that puts every American who dares to criticize the president at risk of retaliation.\n\n“Donald Trump has made clear that he intends to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics,” said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Comey indictment came less than a week after Trump installed a former White House aide and confidant to the role of U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. The president had forced the ouster of his previous hand-selected pick because he was not sufficiently responsive to calls from Trump to bring charges against his longtime targets.\n\n“This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power,” Warner said. “Our system depends on prosecutors making decisions based on evidence and the law, not on the personal grudges of a politician determined to settle scores.”\n\nAn escalation in retribution\n\nThursday’s moves were just the latest in a concerted effort by Trump to wield the vast powers of his office in unparalleled ways to punish his enemies since returning to the Oval Office in January.

I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”\n\nEarlier this week, he signed an order designating a decentralized movement known as antifa — short for “anti-fascists” — as a domestic terrorist organization, a move testing broad First Amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States.\n\nThe Thursday memo went further, targeting liberal-leaning groups and donors, and “represents a significant abuse of power where the government is either changing the law or bending definitions to try and investigative and punish their political opponents in a way that is really unprecedented,” said Caitlin Legacki of Americans Against Government Censorship, which was founded to fight the Trump administration’s weaponization of the federal government against its political rivals.\n\nAs for Comey, she said, “It reeks of selective prospection, it reeks of vindictive targeting and calls into question the integrity of many of the charges being brought by the office.”\n\nA widespread pressure campaign\n\nBeyond Comey, Trump has also pressured prosecutors to bring mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a massive civil fraud case against the president. Attorney General Pam Bondi last month named a special prosecutor to investigate mortgage fraud allegations against both James and Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff of California, another top Trump target. Both have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Justice Department has also begun examining mortgage fraud allegations against Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor who has won success in lower courts in challenging Trump’s effort to remove her from her job in a move she says is designed to erode the central bank’s independence. Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow him to oust her.\n\nHe has also stripped Secret Service protection from a slew of former officials, including his 2024 Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, members of former President Joe Biden’s family, and people who have fallen from favor, including his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nTrump has also targeted major institutions, revoking security clearances for attorneys at law firms he disfavors, pulling billions of dollars in federal research funds from elite universities, and securing multimillion-dollar settlements against media organizations in lawsuits that were widely regarded as weak cases.\n\nEarlier this week, he threatened ABC over the network’s decision to allow late-night host Jimmy Kimmel to return to the airwaves.\n\n“I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” Trump crowed.\n\nAnd his administration has fired or reassigned federal employees for their earlier work, including prosecutors who worked on cases against him. The Justice Department also fired Comey’s daughter, Maurene Comey, from her job as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. She has since sued, saying the termination was politically motivated.\n\nTrump celebrates the indictment\n\nTrump, meanwhile, cheered the Comey indictment, saying “JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” had been served, even as Comey has denied wrongdoing and expressed confidence in winning acquittal at trial.\n\nThe indictment was the culmination of a pressure campaign that burst into public view over the weekend when Trump aired his frustrations with Bondi on his social media site and demanded that she move forward with charges against Comey, James and Schiff.\n\n“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” he wrote on Truth Social Saturday. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” He said he would nominate Lindsey Halligan, his former personal lawyer and a White House aide, to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to quicken the pace after the ouster of chief prosecutor Erik Siebert, who resigned under pressure to bring charges against James.\n\nThe charges against Comey came even as prosecutors in the office had written a memo detailing concerns about the pursuit of an indictment and their likelihood of success at trial.\n\nThe former FBI director said in a video Thursday night that he is innocent, but knew that “standing up to Donald Trump” would come with costs.\n\n“My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I am innocent,” Comey said.\n\nBy JILL COLVIN Associated Press","summary":"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump&#8217;s unprecedented retribution campaign against his perceived political enemies reached new heights as his&#8230; Continue reading Trump Escalates Retribution Campaign With Charges Against Comey and Threats Against Liberal Groups\n\n\nThe post Trump Escalates Retribution Campaign With Charges Against Comey and Threats Against Liberal Groups appeared first on The National Herald.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/trump-escalates-retribution-campaign-with-charges-against-comey-and-threats-against-liberal-groups/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25268752815586-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 14:15:08","author":"Achilleas Kouremenos","authors":["Achilleas Kouremenos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.055},{"id":363719406,"title":"Trump escalates retribution campaign with charges against Comey and threats against liberal groups","text":"President Donald Trump's unprecedented retribution campaign against his perceived political enemies reached new heights as his Justice Department brought criminal charges against a longtime foe and he expanded his efforts to classify certain liberal groups as “domestic terrorist organizations.”\n\nDays after Trump publicly demanded action from his attorney general and tapped his former personal lawyer to serve as the top federal prosecutor in Virginia, former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime target of Trump's ire, was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony in 2020.\n\nHours earlier Thursday, Trump signed a memorandum directing his Republican administration to target backers of what he dubbed “left-wing terrorism\" as he alleged without evidence a vast conspiracy by Democrat-aligned nonprofit groups and activists to finance violent protests.\n\nThe developments marked a dramatic escalation of the president's extraordinary use of the levers of presidential power to target his political rivals and his efforts to pressure the Justice Department to pursue investigations — and now prosecutions — of those he disdains.

As Democrats look for ways to rebuild their fragmented coalition ahead of next year’s crucial midterm elections, they would do well to pay attention to another group that shifted away from the party last year: Asian Americans.\n\nNew precinct-level data from election analysis group VoteHub offers an unprecedented look into how AAPI voters shifted away from the party in 2024. With more data at our disposal than ever before, it’s possible to see the concerning trends that could spell trouble for Democrats—even those in “safely” blue states, like New York and California. It’s unclear if party leaders even realize the seismic shift happening under their feet.\n\nAnd the data is bleak. \n\nNot only did Democrats lose ground with Asian Americans in virtually every metropolitan area in the country, they also lost ground with every Asian ethnic group VoteHub analyzed. The group used modeled data, so the figures below are its best approximations. The data provided to Daily Kos also looks only at head-to-head matchups between Trump and his Democratic opponent, and excludes the results for third-party and independent candidates.\n\nIn a head-to-head matchup against Trump, Harris underperformed former President Joe Biden by 9 percentage points among voters with Chinese ancestry, 7 points among Indians, 4 points among Koreans, and a whopping 10 points among Pakistanis. Harris did best among voters with Japanese ancestry but still lagged Biden’s 2020 performance by 1 point. \n\n“Harris lost fewer Asian voters in places like Seattle and Los Angeles with substantial Japanese populations … but even in Los Angeles, we saw a 9-point shift toward Trump among Asian voters,” said Zachary Donnini, a data scientist who helped compile VoteHub’s map. “Many of those Japanese voters are second- or even third-generation, compared to larger shifts among other Asian groups with a higher number of first-generation immigrants, who swung more to Trump last year.” \n\nThe numbers get worse when you drill down into regions once considered to be Democratic strongholds. In the area comprising New York City, Newark, and Jersey City, Asian American voters’ support for Harris fell nearly 13 points from their support for Biden. \n\nIn the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Harris performed over 8 points worse than Biden among Asian American voters. In the San Francisco area and Washington, D.C., areas, it was about 7 points worse.\n\nTaken together, in the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest number of votes cast by Asian Americans, Harris underperformed Biden by 7 points on average with those voters.\n\n“Trump has done a great job destroying the Obama-era multiracial, working-class coalition,” Donnini said. “What we’re seeing in places like New York and San Francisco and other cities is that working-class Asian American voters are part of that same trend, in some cases much more than other groups.”\n\nThat puts Democrats in a bind. The party’s 2024 message to Asian Americans focused on Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and on Harris’ historic role as the first Asian American nominee for president while ducking controversial issues like crime, immigration, and economic uncertainty. Those were major issues for many Asian American voters, much like they were for the broader electorate.\n\nAs VoteHub’s data makes clear, that sounded to many Asian American voters like Democrats refusing to acknowledge real concerns—with Trump rushing to fill the void. \n\nDemocrats are rapidly moving away from their traditional power base of working-class families, in favor of wealthier, college-educated young people in city centers and suburbs. It isn’t clear their new coalition has the heft necessary to put their candidates over the top in national races, especially as the MAGA movement dismantles the wide coalition that delivered key victories for former President Barack Obama.\n\nIf Republicans can hold or grow their gains among Asian American voters, Democrats may well face an uphill climb to retake the White House in 2028. To win, the party will need to start addressing the kitchen-table issues that Asian American communities have long listed as their top concerns. It will be a long road back.\n\nDemocrats’ multiracial coalition sent the message in 2024 that they are done being taken for granted by politicians who ask for their support. But those politicians can win them back by trying something new: listening to what voters say they want.","summary":"Mainstream media analysis of the 2024 election is dominated by the narrative that President Donald Trump shattered Democrats’ multiracial electoral coalition by pulling Black and Hispanic voters away from the Democratic Party in near-record numbers. \n\n\n\nThat’s partly true, but it doesn’t tell the full story of why Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris fell short last November. As Democrats look for ways to rebuild their fragmented coalition ahead of next year’s crucial midterm elections, they would do well to pay attention to another group that shifted away from the party last year: Asian Americans.\n\n\n\nNew precinct-level data from election analysis group VoteHub offers an unprecedented look into how AAPI voters shifted away from the party in 2024. With more data at our disposal than ever before, it’s possible to see the concerning trends that could spell trouble for Democrats—even those in “safely” blue states, like New York and California.

The former vice president said on the podcast that it was “so magical” to witness her rally attendees supposedly passing babies because it displayed trust of strangers. (RELATED: Kayleigh McEnany Derides Kamala Harris For Blaming Biden White House For Bad Reputation)\n\n“You know, one of my favorite things to see — and it would always happen spontaneously at our rallies … invariably somebody would want me to take a picture or to hug their child,” Harris said. “And someone in the back would hand that baby over through the crowd … pass the baby and then pass the baby back! Pass the baby back. And I don’t know, there was something about that when it would happen. I mean, I could get very emotional about it right now.”\n\n“But you know, I believe that we should always feel that the children of the community are the children of the community. Of all of us … and that we all participate in caring about that child,” she added. “And in caring for that child. And there was just something about that … the parent trusted the stranger that was next to them, who trusted the next person and all of them as though it was their own child. There was something so magical in many ways about that, and about affirming that you can create an environment where people feel safe and feel a sense of communal responsibility and community.”\n\nIn contrast to the rosy framing of children’s experiences at her rallies, a video trended on social media appearing to show a Harris supporter screaming at a child in a stroller in October outside of a Houston rally.\n\nThe video showed a white woman getting into the face of a little blonde girl as she seemingly yelled, “I don’t give a fuck, your dad’s a [bitch?]!” A black woman who stood beside the apparent Harris supporter then yanked her away from the child and seemed to confront her for lashing out at the toddler before a man lifted the child out of the stroller.\n\nHarris has consistently said that the “children of the community are the children of the community” during her public speaking engagements, Fox News reported on Thursday.\n\nPolitical pundits warned during the vice president’s short campaign that her habit of giving word salad speeches could pose a risk to her viability. She ultimately lost all battleground states and the national popular vote to Trump.\n\nSome Democrats are livid with Harris over her memoir, Politico reported on Wednesday.\n\n“In an era where Democrats need all hands on deck in the fight to protect the country and the constitution from the lawlessness of the Trump administration, she had a real opportunity to be a critical voice in the resistance,” Michael Hardaway, a Democratic strategist who served as a senior adviser to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, told the outlet. “This book seems to be unhelpful and divisive in a way that makes it hard for her to be the face of the party as we look to the future.”\n\nMoreover, a Harris aide had to instruct former Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff to write love letters to his wife following a fight on her birthday during the campaign, according to “107 Days.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Mark Ruffalo -- one of the Disney stars who pressured the company to reverse course -- told us: “We’re the home of the brave and the land of the free. But if we want to be free, then we gotta be brave.”\n\nRegular Scheduled Programming\n\nNo one here is naïve; we are aware of the many who are fighting to destroy our country. Some of us expected it: the cheating, the lying, and the chaos. But we are here to read the efforts and the positive results of those (including us and our fellow gnus) who are working so hard to save our country and the planet from those very bad people. We are furious with them for what they are doing and we are letting them know.\n\n💜Although they lie all the time, reality matters. And our goals — based on reality — are more popular.\n\n💙 They want us to be demoralized. The best way to keep up your spirits is to fight.

We DO have power.\n\nNext NO KINGS rally is October 18:\n\nOnly 200 people, but 200 can make a difference\n\nThis is history, but a reminder why it is so important to keep fighting. And a reminder things could be much worse for most of us\n\nRemember that when you feel like it’s too much. More was demanded of previous generations.\n\n💣 Republicans: Party of Crimes, Chaos and Cowardice💣\n\nSome crimes:\n\nTom Homan, border czar, taking a bribe back in October 2024.\n\nGreat work by Ken Dilanian! Carol Leonnig, who moved last month from the Washington Post to MSNB C, also worked on the story.\n\nAs Filipkowski says, release the Homan tapes!\n\nThe following isn’t a crime, but it’s what the Rs would look down on if it were done by anyone but their side: Wisconsin candidate for governor not so good on family values Scott Bauer Associated Press\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Republican manufacturer running for governor in Wisconsin as a conservative supporter of “family values” and President Donald Trump followed numerous sexually explicit accounts online, including a nonbinary pornography performer.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Monday that Bill Berrien, the CEO of Pindel Global Precision and one of two announced 2026 Republican candidates for governor, unfollowed several accounts in recent days after the newspaper asked about the matter.\n\nBerrien, in a statement to The Associated Press, downplayed any concerns about his online activity.\n\n“There are a lot of important issues that are affecting our state and nation,” he said in the statement, “but what is the mainstream media focused on right now? Some stupid articles I read years ago, not the plans I have to reindustrialize our state, turn the economy around, and bring prosperity for all through work.”\n\nNow let’s consider chaos:\n\nFirst, the boundless incompetence:\n\nIn case you were worried about John Bolton\n\nWe’re going to have more chaos with the planned shutdown. The felon wants this, which is not a good thing, but we need to make him and the rest of the GOP own it. I’m mixed on this. Anyway, this is not good news, so enough here.\n\nThe overall support for the felon is a sign of cowardice. Bill Cassidy and many others have always known, for example, that RFK Jr should not be in charge of health — but voted to put him in office. Mike Johnson does whatever the felon tells him (I wonder if this is just the general suck-up or if the felon has something on the Speaker?) The list goes on and on.\n\nEven the felon has proved himself to be a coward, over and over, with TACO.

Because Democrats are finally doing what we’ve asked them to do and it’s important that we tell people about it. They’re throwing down and using the leverage they have to extract major concessions. This is what we’ve been asking for!\n\n And almost no one knows it’s happening.\n\n So. What’s happening, exactly?\n\n It’s pretty simple: the government runs out of funding on September 30 because Republicans have kicked the can down the road repeatedly, and the can rolls to a stop on that date. Congress needs to pass new legislation to keep the government coffers flowing. Republicans, however, can’t do this alone. They need seven Senate Democrats to vote with them to pass any spending package, as, unlike reconciliation bills, regular spending bills are subject to a filibuster.\n\n What Democrats are trying to do is use the leverage they have—leverage that is extremely hard to come by these days—to extract concessions. They are saying, essentially, “we will vote to keep the government funded IF” Republicans:\n\n Restore the trillion dollars they just cut from Medicaid\n\n Permanently extend the ACA premium tax cuts—thereby keeping healthcare premiums for 22 million Americans affordable\n\n Restore funding to Public Broadcasting, which was cut using rescissions after it had been appropriated and\n\n Put guardrails on Trump so he and Russel Vought can’t continue to cut funding that’s already been appropriated at will using “pocket rescissions.” This includes funding for things like the NIH, kids’ cancer research, and public education.\n\n When you put it like this it’s really quite straightforward. Republicans control the House, Senate, and presidency. They run the government. They have shown utter contempt for what Democrats and their voters want, and have been willing to go to extraordinary lengths to get what they want with no input from across the aisle. This is the one and only chance we will have anytime soon to exert some power over them. We can and must use it.\n\nI don’t know that we will win this. The felon and his minions are threatening to fire everyone, but they will do that eventually anyway. I do know that we will not win unless we fight.

Andy Corbley Good News Network\n\nJevon Castrillo’s mother, Cee Cee Lyles, first wrote the letter in March of 2001. Her son had just finished a book end-to-end and Lyles wanted to share the good news with Jevon’s kindergarten teacher, Tammy Thurman.\n\n“Dear Ms. Thurman, Jevon read a book last night that he brought home from the library.

While in the air, Lyles called her husband at home and told him the passengers aboard were going to fight back.\n\nThanks to Lyles and other heroes on the plane, Flight 93 eventually crashed down in an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania—likely saving thousands of lives at potential targets in Washington, DC. ✂️ \n\nThe exchange took place this past September—24 years later.

It sent the truck smashing to the ground before a tree fell atop it, pinning the front seats under its weight.\n\nInside, Wayne and Lindy suffered broken necks, backs, ribs, and arms, but in the rear seats, 9-year-old Branson was unharmed. He got out of the truck and ran a mile down the road in pitch darkness due to a power outage from the winds until he found a house with people inside who could help. ✂️\n\n“The last thing Branson told them was, ‘Mom, dad, please don’t die, I will be back,'” Johnny [Branson’s uncle] recalled. “…He had to become his parent’s superman… That’s exactly what he said.

But people who are smarter and braver than I have seen ways to move ahead.\n\nTheir (the fascists’) plans really are dark, but many of them are also dumb, in the sense that they don’t make sense. So many of them cannot succeed.\n\nHere are some quick hits.\n\n Stay involved. Yeah, that’s tough. I want to look away too, but by taking simple actions you can make a difference. Keep contacting your representatives, both in DC and at home.\n Support causes that will fight. Send money if you can. Also, spread their news with clicks and conversation.\n Slow them down. Oppose and block at every turn.\n Make tRump unpopular. Doing this weakens him. And it should not be that difficult. The GOP made a lot out of Biden is old and eggs cost too much. Well, tRump is older than Biden was at the beginning of his term and tRump has no policies that are going to bring down inflation. And a host of other problems, like he’s a convicted felon.\n Divide the GOP from each other. They are a coalition based on contradictory promises, so there’s plenty to work with.\n Keep telling the truth and showing love.\n Make sure to pace yourselves in this marathon and to practice self-care.\n\nCurrent projects:\n\n We need just 3 seats to take back the House.

The way your information ends up in these spam mills is when losing campaigns unload their email lists to pay off their debts. Brokers then hawk those lists to anyone. That’s why that one donation you made years ago to some long-shot candidate can turn into an endless stream of grift in your inbox. \n\nThis has to end, and you can do your part by making sure that your network of activists and donors knows to look out for these scams—and refuses to fall prey to them.\n\nAnd Timothy Snyder’s On Tyranny Lessons:\n\n(1) Do Not Obey in Advance; (2) Defend Institutions; (3) Beware the One-Party System; (4) Take Responsibility for the Face of the World; (5) Remember Professional Ethics; (6) Be Wary of Paramilitaries; (7) Be Reflective if You Must Own a Gun; (8) Stand Out (this means, speak up, even when others do not); (9) Be Kind to Our Language; (10) Believe in Truth; (11) Investigate; (12) Make Eye Contact and Small Talk; (13) Practice Corporeal Politics; (14) Establish a Private Life; (15) Contribute to Good Causes; (16) Learn from Peers in Other Countries; (17) Listen for Dangerous Words; (18) Be Calm When the Unthinkable Arrives; (19) Be a Patriot; (20) Be as Courageous as You Can.\n\n💙 President Joseph R.

(AP) — A Republican manufacturer running for governor in Wisconsin as a conservative supporter of “family values” and President Donald Trump followed numerous sexually explicit accounts online, including a nonbinary pornography performer.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Monday that Bill Berrien, the CEO of Pindel Global Precision and one of two announced 2026 Republican candidates for governor, unfollowed several accounts in recent days after the newspaper asked about the matter.\n\nBerrien, in a statement to The Associated Press, downplayed any concerns about his online activity.\n\n“There are a lot of important issues that are affecting our state and nation,” he said in the statement, “but what is the mainstream media focused on right now? Some stupid articles I read years ago, not the plans I have to reindustrialize our state, turn the economy around, and bring prosperity for all through work.”\n\nNow let’s consider chaos:\n\nFirst, the boundless incompetence:\n\nIn case you were worried about John Bolton\n\nWe’re going to have more chaos with the planned shutdown. The felon wants this, which is not a good thing, but we need to make him and the rest of the GOP own it. I’m mixed on this. Anyway, this is not good news, so enough here.\n\nThe overall support for the felon is a sign of cowardice.

Thurman even sent along a class photo featuring 6-year-old Jevon.\n\n“As a mom, I know you need to see those words from your mom,” Thurman told Jevon in the video below by WPTV in West Palm Beach… “She was a wonderful woman and you were a wonderful student.”\n\n📎Odds & Ends📎\n\nBaya and Rebecca are the only two females in this area of the Denver Zoo.

It sent the truck smashing to the ground before a tree fell atop it, pinning the front seats under its weight.\n\nInside, Wayne and Lindy suffered broken necks, backs, ribs, and arms, but in the rear seats, 9-year-old Branson was unharmed. He got out of the truck and ran a mile down the road in pitch darkness due to a power outage from the winds until he found a house with people inside who could help. ✂️\n\n“The last thing Branson told them was, ‘Mom, dad, please don’t die, I will be back,'” Johnny [Branson’s uncle] recalled. “…He had to become his parent’s superman… That’s exactly what he said. He said, ‘I have to save my parents.'”\n\n🐦 I do a lot of other writing. Newest offerings: Messing with the Myths — two books so far in this series.

This is a former model and high society darling who was once the toast of the Met Gala and New York Fashion Week’s front row, after all. \n\nSo, what did she wear to meet the royals, the Prime Minister, and the United Nations? \n\nFor her recent trip to the UN, where escalators broke and Trump decried “sinister” forces at play, Melania was all business in a white Dolce & Gabbana suit with a tan shirt by Maxmara. \n\nWhile in New York for the General Assembly, the First Lady hosted a reception at Lotte New York Palace, where she was joined by spouses of heads of state and government, including Queen Rania of Jordan. \n\nIt was a considerably more composed look than her first UN visit, where she wore a pink Delpozo dress with statement sleeves, paired with hot pink Manolo Blahnik stilettos. \n\nIt’s all part of Melania’s more serious makeover, according to longtime stylist, Hervé Pierre. “She likes tailored suits and sharp lines. She will not start wearing ruffles and floral prints just because she is starting a new chapter,” he told HELLO.\n\nUpon arriving at Windsor Castle, greeted by the Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla, Melania chose to top her look with a wide-brimmed hat — a favourite accessory of the FLOTUS. This time a purple iteration was chosen, helping to conceal her emotions, and was paired with a classic Dior skirt suit. \n\nWhile it’s tradition to wear a homegrown label when visiting a country on state duties, Melania has form in flouting the rules and choosing French designers, plus she’s long been a Dior devotee.\n\nHowever, she did touch down with Donald in a Burberry trench on her first night in the capital, so she had already done her diplomatic duty.\n\nLater, the pair attended a state banquet dinner where Melania ditched both hats and macs, and wore a strapless column dress by Carolina Herrera. \n\nThe FLOTUS’s buttercup-yellow dress with a powder pink belt cinching it at the waist definitely stood out amongst the modest royal blue and gold confections worn by her fellow guests. Putting one's shoulders on show is quite the statement at an event like this.\n\nThe choice of designer is no surprise given that Hervé Pierre is the former creative director at Carolina Herrera. He began working with her upon her first entry to the White House, after designing her inauguration gown in 2016, and later helping her with her looks, in what became his first styling job. \n\nBecause top luxury houses have historically refused to dress her, a great deal of what she wears is purchased. Pierre’s services do not come cheap, either. Having continued to help Melania Trump after leaving the White House, it was revealed he was paid over $100,000 from Donald Trump's Political action committee in six months alone.\n\nLater on, Melania’s choice of look for a guided tour of the Queen Mary's Dolls' House and the Royal Library at Windsor Castle by Queen Camilla UK was a tan leather two-piece suit by Louis Vuitton. \n\nAnd she continued showing a penchant for camel coloured tailoring when she met the PM, Keir Starmer, and wife Victoria Starmer at Chequers, Buckinghamshire. \n\nMelania paired a suede safari-style jacket by Ralph Lauren with cream cigarette pants and nude heels. It was the same jacket she wore earlier in the day at Frogmore Gardens at Windsor Castle with the Princess of Wales, when they met with members of the Scouts' Squirrels program. \n\nNow, let’s remind ourselves of Melania Trump’s most impactful outfits from the past.\n\nOn inauguration day in January, as her husband was sworn in as 47th president, Melania was first spotted in a sophisticated navy blue coat by Adam Lippes, a New York based designer, as well as matching boater-style hat with a white ribbon by Eric Javits, who is also from the US, as she arrived at a service at St. John's Church. \n\nIt was a step change for Melania to wear so many US designs, as fashion brands have historically not been enthusiastic to dress the Slovenian-American, which her stylist Hervé Pierre has labelled as “snobbish”.\n\nShe then returned to form with her outfit at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where she opted for a Dior overcoat and Dolce & Gabbana suit. \n\nThe following day, she wore a black, buttoned trench-cum-cape with black boots and leather gloves to attend a wreath laying by Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nShe later changed into a black sequin Carolina Herrera skirt, Dolce & Gabbana shirt as well as a statement, black-tie style Saint Laurent cape for a candlelight dinner at the National Building Museum later that night.\n\nWhile to celebrate the presidential election win, as her husband Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in November, she opted for a double-breasted grey, wool skirt Dior suit which extended just over the knee. What was she trying to say? Unlike some of the bold hues she has become known for, this time a touch of sophistication (and a willingness to slip, presentably, into the background) was preferred. \n\nMuch like the late Queen Elizabeth II, Trump well understands the impact one bold, bright colour can achieve — certainly when sartorially speaking to thousands. A standout was a pre-Brat, Brat green pleated dress she wore for her husband’s Republican Party nomination acceptance speech in August 2020. \n\nThe Valentino spring 2020 pleated-crepe dress did get her in a pickle online: it was the same colour as a green-screen, which made her an easy target for a meme onslaught. It followed a host of other retina-damagingly bright looks.\n\nThere are two memorable terrors: a Zara coat which read “I really don’t care, do u?” shocked the world as FLOTUS made her way to visit facilities that house and care for children taken from their parents at the US-Mexico border. Another bad, though slightly less alarming, moment came with an unfortunate flesh shade pair of leather trousers. \n\nAll salute. Trump leans into army-style khaki two-pieces; famously for her 2020 speech, where she wore full Alexander McQueen.\n\nNever one to shy from a little sparkle, Trump is known to go full glitz when the dress code is black tie. Capes and all.\n\nLouboutins in the White House gardens? A little dirt has never been a concern for Melania.","summary":"The FLOTUS has been back in British minds following her recent trips to the UK and UN.

Even though the former vice president cops to plenty of mistakes in her brief, surprise run as the Democratic nominee in 2024, she is being lambasted for pointing out the many ways that then-President Joe Biden failed her. The Democratic consultant class is rushing to denounce her as “divisive,” “embarrassing” and “a sore loser.”\n\nBut while doing their usual bit of shaping opinions under the guise of “optics,” most are avoiding a painful truth: Harris is right. Biden did set her up to fail. For all her flaws as a candidate — including being overly cautious, which made it all too easy for Biden’s team to manipulate her — she probably would have beat Donald Trump if she hadn’t inherited a situation made unmanageable by her former boss, who put his own ego before the good of the country.\n\nThe details of how Biden, unwilling to accept that he had aged out of the job, sabotaged his successor are hard to refute. Even without knowing a single behind-the-scenes detail, anyone can see that Harris is right when she writes it was “recklessness” for Biden to run for a second term, despite clearly being too old to handle even the most basic campaigning. By dragging out his decision to drop out of the race for weeks after humiliating himself in a debate with Trump, Biden robbed Harris of even more time to make her case to the American people.\n\nBut the book adds even more disturbing details. Mere hours before her own debate with Trump, Biden called her and demanded to know if she’d been bad-mouthing him to donors. Former First Lady Jill Biden treated Harris poorly, haranguing her about loyalty. Biden’s team regarded Harris with suspicion, both before and after she replaced him as the nominee. They apparently couldn’t get past Harris’ attack on Biden for his opposition to busing during the first debate of the 2020 Democratic primary season. In “107 Days,” she describes Biden’s team as having a “zero-sum” outlook: “if she’s shining, he’s dimmed.”\n\nAll Harris’ flaws have been carefully detailed for years, but I would challenge anyone to perform well in such impossible circumstances. But even as she was being undermined by an egotistical boss at every turn, the former vice president did something remarkable that shouldn’t be forgotten. In the summer of 2024, polls showed that Trump would beat Biden in a landslide. By November, Harris had clawed her way back to a near-draw, leading in most surveys and losing the popular vote by only 1.5 percentage points — and even less in swing states. Everyone who now treats her loss as inevitable should reconsider. It’s easy to see how, if she’d entered the race with more internal support and more time — and without an unpopular boss resentfully undercutting her, who gave her more room to run against him — she probably would have won.\n\nThis dynamic, where a talented female leader inherits a collapsing situation, is so common in the business world that experts have a name for it: The glass cliff. The phrase is a play on the “glass ceiling,” an older metaphor that describes how structural sexism keeps women from reaching the highest levels of leadership. In glass cliff scenarios, however, women do get to the top — but only after male leaders have screwed things up so badly that the situation may be unsalvageable. As Jordyn Holman of the New York Times described it in 2024, it’s “a phenomenon in which a company in crisis appoints a woman to turn things around, often setting them up for failure.”\n\n“It was clear from the start that this seemed to be a case of The Glass Cliff waiting to happen,” Sophie Williams, the author of “The Glass Cliff: Why Women in Power are Undermined — And How to Fight Back,” told Salon. “The party was in a moment of trouble, and they were turning to not only a woman, but a woman of global majority, to clean up the mess.” (“Global majority” is a term more commonly used in the United Kingdom, where Williams is from, to describe people with African, Asian or indigenous backgrounds.) She added that “the Glass Cliff disproportionately impacts women who aren’t white.”\n\nIn the business world, this usually plays out when a company hits a financial crisis, and male leaders are removed and replaced with women — and often women of color. Stephanie Pope recently became the CEO of Boeing after its high-profile disasters with 737 planes. Mary Barra was named the CEO at General Motors in 2014, after a government bailout. In 2012, Marissa Mayer took over a struggling Yahoo. Both Under Armor and Bed Bath & Beyond took on female CEOs when the companies faced economic collapse. At the height of the #MeToo movement, when male leaders across industries were being ousted for sexual abuse, nearly half of the people who replaced them were women. In politics, Theresa May was appointed the second female prime minister of the United Kingdom in 2016 after David Cameron resigned due to losing the Brexit referendum. When she failed to deliver Brexit in 2019, the Conservative Party turned to former Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who delivered a Brexit deal but made a shambles of nearly everything he touched. In 2022, the Tories turned again to a woman: Liz Truss, who won a leadership election but only lasted six weeks in office.\n\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Sign up for her free newsletter, Standing Room Only, now also on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nWilliams laid out a number of reasons institutions turn to female leaders in times of crisis. The ugliest is plain old scapegoating. If the male leadership messed things up beyond all repair, they often find it’s easier to pass it off to a woman right before the final collapse, so they can blame her instead of themselves. Biden did this aggressively to Harris, even going on TV after her loss and insisting, preposterously, that he would have won. There’s also an expectation, Williams explained, that women have more soft skills, like empathy and morale-building, which people hope will save them in a crisis. We saw this play out with the “Momala” meme, when pundits and influencers openly hoped that Harris was maternal enough to unite a party that had been torn apart by Biden’s mismanagement.\n\nPerhaps the most sympathetic reason Williams gave for the glass cliff phenomenon is that sometimes an institution wants to signal they’re shaking things up by promoting someone who isn’t a cookie-cutter white guy. The high point of Harris’ campaign — when her announcement was aligned with Charli XCX’s’ “Brat” album and spawned viral “Kamala is Brat” memes — channeled this urge. The former vice president seemed so different from Biden, and it gave people hope. Her campaign only started to sputter after it seemed she couldn’t escape his vortex.\n\nNone of this is meant to provoke pity for Harris, an ambitious woman who can handle herself just fine. But it’s self-defeating for Democrats to dismiss her story as sour grapes. Too many people are already drawing the wrong conclusions from Harris’ loss, which is that a woman can’t win a general election and Democrats should only nominate more old white men. Remember: It was an old white man who failed the party so badly that Democrats were barely able, at the last possible minute, to mount a credible campaign against Trump, a failed president loathed by many Americans.\n\nA woman can win. Harris certainly did much better than Biden was ever going to do in 2024. As the “Brat” meme suggests, there’s even grassroots enthusiasm for female candidates, especially if people feel like they’re offering something different than tired 20th century hangovers like Biden.\n\nBut women can’t win if they’re set up to fail. Harris certainly could have made better choices, especially if she’d been more willing to reject the demands of people who created the Democratic Party’s crisis in the first place. Political parties, though, like companies, can’t survive simply on the gumption of the person at the top. Everyone will do better if the next female candidate comes in with the support and resources she needs to win, rather than simply being told to fix a hopeless situation on her own.","summary":"Glass cliff theory shows how women only get power after men screwed everything up","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/09/26/kamala-harris-is-right-biden-set-her-up-to-fail/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Kamala-Harris-2182629592-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 10:45:01","author":"Amanda Marcotte","authors":["Amanda Marcotte"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":363637680,"title":"Other voices: Buttigieg to Dems: Identity politics aren’t the way","text":"Former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg dropped a bombshell on Democrats last week, one lost in the chaotic news cycle following Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\n\nHe was responding to a passage in former Vice President Kamala Harris’ book, “107 Days,” in which she said Buttigieg was her first choice for a running mate and “would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man.”\n\n“My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories,” Buttigieg said before a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Monroe County Democratic Party headquarters in Indiana, according to Politico.\n\nConservatives have been decrying identity politics for years, and liberals have been just as vigorously espousing them as key to winning races.\n\nButtigieg cited former President Barack Obama winning the state in 2008 and his own two terms as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, as evidence of his approach.\n\n“You just have to go to voters with what you think you can do for them,” he said. “Politics is about the results we can get for people and not about these other things.”\n\nThat’s radical thinking in Democratic circles, many of whom blamed Harris’ loss to Donald Trump on anything but her policies.\n\nObama said he was speaking to Black men in particular when he suggested some “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.” Others pointed the misogyny finger at Latino men.\n\nPundits went all in on sexism and racism tipping the scale in Trump’s favor after last November’s election.\n\nThe problem is, identity politics don’t matter as much to voters as they do to campaigns.\n\nA Pew Research Center poll released last year asked Americans how important it is that a woman be elected president in their lifetime, and found that only 18% of U.S. adults said this is extremely or very important to them. Some 64% said it is not too important or not at all so, or that the president’s gender doesn’t matter.\n\nDemocrats missed the memo.\n\n“But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let’s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk,” Harris wrote of rejecting Buttigieg.\n\nThe real risk was believing voters would check the box for Harris because of who she was, not what she was promoting, which was essentially four more years of the very Biden policies the electorate was rejecting.\n\nAll this is more than just a thorough look in the rear-view. Both Harris and Buttigieg are scoping out presidential bids in 2028. Buttigieg has proven an effective communicator, a big plus for the party.\n\nCommunication has never been Harris’ strong suit.\n\nThis is more than just a cautionary tale for Democrats who want to win races.

'He fought through his cold as he is fighting for the American people,'\" a sheet of paper containing favorable talking points after then-President Joe Biden's poor performance on the debate stage, according to Harris' latest memoir, \"107 Days.\" Biden's poor debate performance against Trump in June 2024 served as the death knell to the campaign that already was coping with mounting public concern that Biden's mental acuity had cratered and he was unable to serve a second term. Despite the abject failure of a debate performance, Biden's campaign wanted Harris to deliver favorable assessments of the debate to the American people, according to her book. \"Are you kidding me?\" she said ran through her mind as she read the sheet of paper declaring Biden the winner of the night. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS WHAT BIDEN TOLD HER JUST BEFORE CRUCIAL DEBATE WITH TRUMP THAT LEFT HER 'ANGRY' She threw the paper back on the table before fielding a call from Biden's team outlining she was expected to say more of the same as the talking points when joining media interviews. \"No. Don’t feed me bulls--t. Everyone saw what they saw,\" Harris continued in the book of what she thought during the call. The then-vice president said the disastrous debate was littered with Biden missing opportunities to attack Trump, stumbling over his words and losing his train of thought. KAMALA HARRIS HAD PROFANE MESSAGE FOR GOVERNORS UNEASY ABOUT SUPPORTING BIDEN \"Trump, meanwhile, was using his words like a weapon, but shooting before he aimed, spouting lies, unburdened by the truth,\" she wrote. \"Biden, striving for accuracy, often stopped midsentence to correct himself, which left him sounding hesitant and garbled. I knew the important policy points he was struggling to convey, and I knew he knew them. He is a master of this material, but that was not coming across at all.\" The Biden campaign suffered a devastating gut punch when Biden delivered a bizarre line on Medicare. \"And then, at the end of a string of convoluted sentences in which he twice confused millions and billions, Joe lost his train of thought entirely, looked disoriented, and blurted out, ‘We finally beat Medicare,'\" Harris wrote in her scathing critique of the debate. \"Trump’s reply: ‘Well, he’s right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death,’\" Harris continued. FLASHBACK: THE DEBATE NIGHT AGAINST TRUMP THAT THREW BIDEN'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN INTO A FREE FALL The former vice president described that campaign staffers were tracking reactions to the debate online, with the vast majority describing Biden's performance as \"disaster,\" \"train wreck\" and \"embarrassment,\" she wrote. Harris' husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, faced his own outrage over Biden's debate performance when left-wing Hollywood director Rob Reiner \"screamed\" at him during a watch party that democracy was about to be squandered over Biden's performance. \"Doug, at a watch party with Hollywood donors, was getting an earful. Rob Reiner had screamed at him: 'We’re going to lose our f---ing democracy and it’s your fault!'\" Harris wrote. As Harris prepared to join CNN in a post-debate interview that was all but guaranteed to focus on Biden's disastrous performance, she reflected on a joke about a cheating husband, she wrote. ONE YEAR LATER: HOW JOE BIDEN'S DISASTROUS DEBATE PERFORMANCE FORCED HIS MEDIA ALLIES TO TURN ON HIM \"I couldn’t help but think of the Richard Pryor joke where his wife catches him in bed with another woman. ‘You gonna believe me or your lyin’ eyes?’ he says,\" Harris wrote. Harris said she would not tell voters \"that their eyes had lied,\" and instead pivoted her talking points to \"Trump’s numerous lies.\" \"Listen, people can debate on style points, but ultimately this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance,\" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper in the post-debate interview. \"Donald Trump lied over and over and over again, as he is wont to do. He would not disavow what happened on January 6. He would not give a clear answer on whether he would stand by the election results this November.

Another reportedly is Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, with rightwing bona fides well-known through their control of Fox News.\n\nThe former US labor secretary Robert Reich described the situation plainly, writing this week on the platform formerly known as Twitter: “The richest man on earth owns X. The second richest man on earth is about to be a major owner of TikTok. The third richest man owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The fourth richest man owns the Washington Post.”\n\nHe was talking, of course, about Musk, Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.\n\nWe’ve already seen some of what happens when billionaires control the media – and remain committed to getting even richer and more powerful.\n\nBezos has dramatically turned the Washington Post opinion section to the right, as he curries favor with Trump. The Amazon co-founder killed a draft endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall, and later installed an opinion editor who has driven out some of the Post’s most esteemed journalists.\n\nAnother newspaper-owning billionaire, Patrick Soon-Shiong, has changed the tenor of the opinion offerings at his newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, as he too cozies up to Trump.\n\nIt’s not just rich individuals controlling major media companies. Even local newspapers are largely – and increasingly – owned by big chains, rather than the local families who once had a stake in the communities their papers served.\n\nIt’s a story of media consolidation, power and money.\n\nABC News is controlled by Disney, hence the recent decisions to settle a winnable defamation suit brought by Trump and to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after his on-air remarks after the murder of far-right provocateur Charlie Kirk.\n\nWith TikTok, one of the biggest questions is control of the all-important algorithm, which determines what consumers experience when they use the platform.\n\nThe deal is not done, and it has lots of moving parts.\n\nNo executive order by Trump can complete it, since the likely plan would spin off a US version of the platform from TikTok’s China-based version, owned by ByteDance. Chinese officials would still need to agree.\n\nBut the pieces are in place.\n\n“It’s incredibly troubling how quickly media moguls are capturing the information space at a time when there’s a crackdown on speech more broadly,” Emma Briant of Notre Dame University told the Washington Post. As she sees it, they are “grabbing and seeking to control more and more of the infrastructure through which political debate happens”.\n\nOr, increasingly, through which political debate doesn’t happen. While self-censorship is hard to measure, such ownership moves can encourage decision-makers inside these influential companies to pull their punches instead of reporting without fear or favor.\n\nI have serious doubts about whether TikTok’s brief videos, intended for viral sharing, are an ideal way to get news across to the public. The format doesn’t bring tremendous nuance or context, qualities already in short supply.\n\nBut TikTok is wildly popular and influential, and – in this era of ever shorter attention spans – on the rise. It matters.\n\nThe White House has claimed that the new uber-rich American investors in TikTok are patriots who love America.\n\nBut we also know what else they love.

On January 20th, his first day back in office, Donald Trump issued an executive order titled “Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship.” It accused the Biden Administration of chilling speech it disagreed with and announced that\n\nIt is the policy of the United States to:\n(a) secure the right of the American people to engage in constitutionally protected speech;\n(b) ensure that no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages in or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen;\n(c) ensure that no taxpayer resources are used to engage in or facilitate any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen;\n(d) identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.\n\nThe President and his Administration then proceeded to ban the Associated Press from certain press events because it did not refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, sanction law firms that represented clients whose political views the Administration regards as unfriendly, arrest and seek to deport immigrants legally in the United States for opinions they expressed in speech or in print, defund universities for alleged antisemitic speech and leftist bias, sue the Wall Street Journal for libel, extort sixteen million dollars from the corporate owner of CBS because of the way a “60 Minutes” interview was edited, set about dismantling the Voice of America for being “anti-Trump” and “radical,” coerce businesses and private colleges and universities to purge the word “diversity” from their websites, and order the National Endowment for the Arts to reject grant applications for projects that “promote gender ideology.”\nAfter threats from the head of the Federal Communications Commission, a late-night television personality had his show suspended because of some (rather confusing) thing he said about Trump’s political movement. Other media outlets were advised to get in line. Trump has proposed that licenses be withdrawn from companies that air content critical of him. The Administration has opened Justice Department investigations into and yanked security details from people whose political views it dislikes. It has also warned that it may revoke the visas of and deport any foreign nationals who joke about the death of Charlie Kirk. West Point cancelled an award ceremony for Tom Hanks, after having already winnowed its library of potentially offensive books.\nThe President is suing the Times, which he calls “one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country,” for libel. (In the initial iteration of the case, the judge threw out the eighty-five-page-long court filing as “decidedly improper and impermissible.”) A top complaint in his lawsuit is that the paper ran its “deranged endorsement” of Kamala Harris on the front page. Apparently, this is tortious behavior. At press conferences, Trump makes noises about investigating reporters whose questions he doesn’t like. (Who’s the snowflake now?)\nThis is not social shunning. This is not speaking from the bully pulpit. Apart from the libel suits, which the President can add teeth to by threatening regulatory sanctions or by slow-walking mergers and other business deals that require government approval, this is the persecution of people and organizations based on point of view. Much of this is exactly what the Supreme Court has said the First Amendment prohibits the federal government from doing. The Administration is not even pretending to follow the law, let alone its own proclamations about free speech. It’s getting results, so why should it?\nCompared with all this, a bunch of college students shouting down the conservative political scientist Charles Murray—an incident at Middlebury College now immortalized through endless retelling—is small potatoes. Somehow, though, in the war of words, college students tend to get the blame. “Charlie Kirk was assassinated while speaking on a college campus,” the president of Barnard College, Laura Ann Rosenbury, wrote in a recent Times opinion piece. “This is a grim moment for higher education, for our country and for freedom of speech. Violence is never a legitimate means of disagreeing with a speaker on a college campus.”\nWhat is she talking about? Neither Kirk nor his alleged shooter was a student. The incident says nothing about tolerance for speakers on college campuses, and it is irresponsible for a college president to suggest that it does. Rosenbury notes disapprovingly that there was a petition to rescind Kirk’s invitation. A petition is classic First Amendment-protected expression. Surely the president of Barnard is not suggesting that students are inciting violence when they sign a petition. She is effectively throwing a bone to the White House, which can claim that Kirk was the victim of academic cancel culture.\nAs many people have rightly remarked, the response to Kirk’s murder is emblematic of the current hypocrisy. Kirk is being celebrated as a champion of free speech who was willing to debate anyone anywhere and who was killed by someone who could not tolerate his views. At the same time, Kirk’s admirers are campaigning to get people who make negative comments about those views—which are, after all, highly controversial and designedly so—fired from their jobs. And many have been. The Attorney General initially suggested that Kirk’s detractors could be prosecuted for hate speech (which happens to be constitutionally protected). Evidently, saying racist things is not hate speech, but calling someone out for saying racist things is.\nWithin the self-censoring limits of the genre, Eisgruber has sensible things to say, maybe too sensible. His main practical point is that, as he puts it, “speech must be both uncensored and regulated.” This seems to mean that we should be in favor of what are called “time, place, and manner” restrictions on campus speech—no chanting in the library, no bullhorns in the quad, and so on. Fair enough. There are all kinds of things you cannot lawfully do in public spaces. The problems arise when you try to draw the line of permissibility, and Eisgruber doesn’t help us much here. His own reactions to speech controversies at Princeton, as he relates them, seem to have been largely seat-of-the-pants. And, so far, reasonably successful.\nEisgruber also believes that speech should conform to norms of civility. “It is possible to believe in free speech and insist that people ought to address one another civilly and politely,” he writes. Again, nice to say. But the right to free speech is intended to protect what the Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., called “opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death.” In the free-speech marketplace, “fuck you” is legal tender. But private universities can constrain speech in ways public universities cannot, and, if Princeton wants to impose civility constraints on its students, it may. No one is being forced to go there.\nThe same is true of the workplace. There is what we might call a free-speech norm in the United States, such that we are sensitive to the suggestion that someone is being penalized—not getting a promotion, say—for things they have said or beliefs they espouse. Most Americans would not want to give up this norm. But it is unenforceable. You have a right to say what you like, but you do not have a right to host a late-night talk show. A lot of campus speech regulation is an effort not to violate this norm, but this is not because students need a “safe space.” It’s because maintaining an ethos of free speech is central to the educational mission. You can’t run Princeton like Disney.\nIn general, Eisgruber thinks that “free speech is more robust on college campuses than in other sectors of our polarized society” and that “when it comes to getting free speech right, colleges and America’s young people deserve higher marks than they get.” A lot of what look like acts of censorship from the outside, he argues, are actually attempts to negotiate a level playing field.\nThere may be some whistling past the graveyard here. Many surveys show that college students are fearful of saying something that will alienate them from their peers or invite the disapproval of their instructors. And faculty worry that teaching certain subject matter and texts might offend students and, if students complain, lead to administrative sanctions. The faculty experience has been that administrations often side with the complainers. If this is so, it is because, until recently, the complainers have had agencies on their side that enforce federal anti-discrimination law (Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Title IX, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, plus, for public schools, the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment). Universities did not want to sanction the professors, but they did want the complaints to go away.\nYou could say, as Eisgruber does, that campus speech anxieties reflect the polarization in our society as a whole, but the freedom to say what you think is not the essence of most jobs, and it is the essence of liberal education. Without the ability to speak freely, teachers are not educating and students are not learning.\nEisgruber discusses some of the well-known campus disputes, many of them venerable chestnuts in the free-speech wars, like the picketing of Charles Murray, which happened eight years ago, and the blowup over Halloween costumes at Yale, which happened when Barack Obama was President and we were still living on the Big Rock Candy Mountain. All the same, it is hard to fight off the sense that Eisgruber is mainly interested in defending Princeton. He is doing, much less recklessly, what Barnard’s president was doing with her opinion piece: he is preëmptively defending his institution against government attack.\nThat’s fine. That’s his job. But you would never know, reading his book, that there was a pro-Palestinian encampment on the Princeton campus in the spring of 2024. You would never know that there were sit-ins and that students were arrested. There is virtually no mention of Trump in the book, apart from a vague reference to “multiple Trump administration executive orders that targeted higher education” and a remark that Trump has not done a lot for civility norms. This is despite the fact, also not mentioned, that last April the Administration suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants to Princeton.\nEisgruber spoke out quite assertively at the time in defense of academic freedom, but he has said little publicly since. That Harvard is in court and subject to multiple phony “investigations” as the government tries to bully it into submission goes unmentioned in his book, too. Yet he does see fit to critique Harvard’s institutional-voice policy, which limits public pronouncements by the university to issues affecting higher education, that being the one subject academics are competent to opine on. He prefers an approach unconstrained by such “mechanical formulae.” Again, fine as long as it works.\nYou also would not know from the book that in 2020 hundreds of Princeton graduate students, staff, and faculty—including professors from thirty-four of Princeton’s thirty-six departments—sent the university administration a four-thousand-word petition demanding that it address systemic racism by, among many other things, rewarding departments that have hired underrepresented minority professors and denying new appointments to departments that have not, and granting extra pay and sabbatical time to professors who are members of underrepresented minority groups.\nThe petitioners further demanded that the administration\n\nconstitute a committee composed entirely of faculty that would oversee the investigation and discipline of racist behaviors, incidents, research, and publication on the part of faculty, following a protocol for grievance and appeal to be spelled out in Rules and Procedures of the Faculty. Guidelines on what counts as racist behavior, incidents, research, and publication will be authored by a faculty committee for incorporation into the same set of rules and procedures.\n\nThis could be read, and by many people was read, as a chilling assault on the principle of academic freedom, which courts have interpreted as a component of the First Amendment protection of free speech.\nEisgruber’s elision of this episode—there is an oblique reference to “widespread student and faculty interest in seeing the university do more to address the effects of racism on the university community and America”—is understandable. The petition was widely circulated in the academic world, and it was not received with enthusiasm. The idea of a faculty committee empowered to vet scholarly publications for racial bias has, ineluctably, a Star Chamber vibe.\nThe omission is particularly unfortunate because it bears directly on the main point Eisgruber wants to make, which is that free speech and equality are not rival ideals but, in fact, belong together. His key text is the Supreme Court’s opinion in the 1964 case New York Times v. Sullivan. That is where the Court raised the bar in libel suits by public figures, ruling that, absent “actual malice,” meaning willful or reckless disregard for the truth, you can publish anything you want about someone the Court recognizes as a public figure—a category that has expanded over the years.\nEisgruber, who is a scholar of constitutional law, believes that Sullivan is the cornerstone of American free-speech law. And it is significant, he argues, that it was a civil-rights case. It involved an advertisement in the Times soliciting donations to Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s defense fund that contained some factual inaccuracies. Those were the basis for the lawsuit, which was filed by an Alabama official. In ruling for the Times, the Court was in solidarity with the civil-rights movement.\nBut, of course, the authors of the 2020 Princeton petition were also trying to strike a blow for racial equality. For them, a highly permissive interpretation of free-speech law gives cover to racists, and a permissive interpretation of the principle of academic freedom allows for the perpetuation of exclusionary scholarship.\nWhen we see “a dangerous idea” in the subtitle, we naturally assume that Dabhoiwala means dangerously good, in the sense of dangerous to bullies and tyrants. But this is not what he means. He means that free speech is a bad idea. Eisgruber thinks that the maximalist character of American free-speech law is the best thing about it, but Dabhoiwala thinks it’s the worst.\nWhen we think of the history of free-speech rights, we tend to think of the Anglo-American legal tradition. A virtue of Dabhoiwala’s book is that it is transnational, and there are discussions of free-speech traditions less familiar to American readers. The first free-speech law, for example, was enacted in Sweden, in 1766.\nThe point Dabhoiwala wants to make is that the Anglo-American concept is not universal. On the contrary, he says, “America is now the only country in the world where even local ordinances against ‘hate speech’ are treated as presumptively unconstitutional.” First Amendment jurisprudence is absolutist and libertarian. Other nations have speech rights, but they are qualified. Hate speech can be prosecuted in the United Kingdom.\nFor a historian, Dabhoiwala is rather judgy. He calls free speech “a kind of secular religion, with its own shifting dogmas and hagiography,” an “inherently unstable fiction,” and “a contrived, invented concept.” Of course, all our concepts are invented. They are tools for dealing with the world, which happens to include a lot of other human beings, many of whom, sadly, don’t agree with us.\n“The creation and interpretation of rules about ‘free speech,’ ” he says, “is a perennially mutable and politicized process: freedom is never equally distributed.” And he shows that, ever since the idea of free-speech rights arose in eighteenth-century Europe, the concept has been, as he puts it, racialized and gendered. Freedom of expression, like, to a large extent, the franchise, was understood to be a right enjoyed by white men. Even John Stuart Mill, the model nineteenth-century liberal and a feminist, did not think that Indians in British India were ready for free speech. In other words, free-speech rights—like all rights, really—reflect, and therefore can be enlisted to perpetuate, existing power relations.\nBut we don’t think the right to vote is suspect because the franchise was once restricted. Those restrictions may be shocking to twenty-first-century sensibilities, but aren’t they what we should expect? In a patriarchal and highly class- and race-stratified society like Mill’s England, it is not surprising to find legal rights reproducing those inequities.\nWe are in a different place today, and one of the things that make us feel we are is the expansion of First Amendment freedoms throughout the twentieth century, beginning in 1919 with the dissents of Justices Holmes and Louis Brandeis, and then in Court rulings in the nineteen-fifties and sixties that protected not only political speech but artistic expression. Yet Dabhoiwala thinks that the trend is all in the wrong direction. He says that, since the sixties, “American free-speech jurisprudence has gradually abandoned any conception of the common good, beyond its abstract obeisance to ‘free debate’ as the highest ideal.”\nThe right way to determine what speech should be tolerated, he says, is to give up the “dubious distinction” between words and actions. “Their supposedly different potency,” he maintains, “is just a convenient myth.” We should regulate speech in the same way we regulate behavior. It is “perfectly reasonable to oppose utterances that you believe to be seriously harmful,” Dabhoiwala says, “and to argue that these shouldn’t qualify as ‘free speech.’ ”\nIf the Administration’s actions are so blatantly unlawful, why does everyone seem to be caving? Some of it is just cost-benefit analysis. Paramount, which owned CBS, wanted to merge with Skydance Media, a transaction that required government approval. The company calculated that it was not worth jeopardizing the deal over a news program, which is a tiny piece of its empire. Jimmy Kimmel’s show was suspended after Nexstar, which owns some thirty ABC affiliate stations, put pressure on Disney, which owns ABC. Nexstar intends to buy a competitor, Tegna, which owns thirteen ABC affiliates, and the transaction needs F.C.C. approval. (The following week, after a “thoughtful conversation” with Kimmel, ABC reinstated the show, but Nexstar and Sinclair said that their affiliates would not air it.)\nGovernment agencies can be challenged in court, and some of those challenges have succeeded at the appellate level. But the buck has generally stopped at the Supreme Court. For some whom the government now casts as enemies in the free-speech wars, that’s a worry. Universities that shut down or rename their diversity offices are not merely trying to appease the President. They anticipate that the Court will back government agencies that interpret “diversity” as an alibi for impermissible racial classification, in violation of the equal-protection clause and Title VI. Professors who complain that their schools are “caving” when they drop the term “diversity” should know this. But university presidents can’t tell them the reason they are renaming diversity offices, because they would basically be telling the Court that they’re cheating and are just racially classifying students under a different rubric. So there is a lot of crosstalk.\nIn the case of the attacks on the First Amendment, one big concern (unmentioned by Eisgruber) is the future of Sullivan. Members of the Court, specifically Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have indicated an interest in overturning that holding, thereby reinstating a lower bar for libel suits by public figures by removing the “actual malice” requirement. There is little reason to assume that, given the right occasion, this Court will not overrule Sullivan, handing Trump another weapon in his war against free speech. Of course, if the law were to change, it might not be a total win for him. After all, no one is more reckless with the truth than Trump. He could be sued almost every time he opens his mouth. ♦","summary":"Doxing, deplatforming, defunding, persecuting, firing, and sometimes killing—all are part of an escalating war over words.

If the channel hoped to survive, the official said, it must end its investigations into corruption in Putin’s entourage, abandon its unflinching coverage of the war in Chechnya, and more readily coördinate its editorial policy with the Kremlin.\nA final demand pertained to one of the more popular shows on NTV: “Kukly,” or “Puppets,” which featured caricatured puppet versions of various members of the country’s political and business élite. In one episode, which had aired a few months earlier, Putin’s puppet appeared in the role of Little Zaches, a character from an E. T. A. Hoffmann fairy tale, an allegorical satire of how readily people can be fooled by superficial charmers. Putin was portrayed as an unsightly troll, who, by an act of magic—a spell cast by the puppet version of Boris Berezovsky, the magnate who helped engineer his rise to the Presidency—comes to appear beautiful and virtuous, the subject of great adulation and deference.\nPutin, NTV journalists and editors learned, was incensed not just by the mocking tone and the implication that his popularity was based on P.R. hocus-pocus but also by the fact that his puppet was, like the character in the original Hoffmann story, short and rather ugly. “He took this as a personal attack, an anthropomorphic insult,” Viktor Shenderovich, one of “Kukly” ’s chief screenwriters, told me. The puppet’s short stature was a metaphor, Shenderovich said. “But where Putin got his education”—the late-Soviet-era K.G.B.—“they don’t believe in metaphors.” The official told the channel that the “first person,” meaning Putin, should disappear from “Kukly.”\nShenderovich nominally complied. The next episode of “Kukly” featured Putin as God—only not in puppet form but as a burning bush and a storm cloud. (An updated version of the Ten Commandments made an appearance: “Thou shalt not steal, unless He permits it.”) In any case, NTV’s fate was set. Before long, a media holding company of the Russian state energy giant Gazprom took a majority stake in the channel, ending its independence and giving the Kremlin decisive influence over its editorial policy.\nMany at the channel, including Shenderovich, left; those who stayed quickly learned the new rules. “My greatest sorrow was that so many of my colleagues effectively helped Putin become who he did,” Shenderovich told me. “At first, Putin wasn’t strong enough to defeat everyone. He was far from omnipotent. But, by bending to him, they participated in creating what, over time, became his aura of unchecked power.” (Shenderovich left Russia in 2022, after a libel probe was opened against him at the request of a close Putin associate.)\nThe takeover of NTV also set an important precedent. Many more individuals and institutions would be suborned and co-opted. With one of the country’s most influential media outlets brought to heel, Shenderovich told me, “everything else became possible.”\nI spent a decade living in Moscow, during which time independent journalists went from being intimidated and marginalized to being essentially outlawed. I wanted to ask the central players in the drama at NTV—who, at the time of their channel’s crisis, looked to the United States as a model of free expression and democratic values—what they made of the ongoing standoff between Donald Trump and the American media. Shenderovich noted that, for the health of a polity, its norms—what’s considered morally permissible—can often matter more than the laws that formally govern it. And those norms can change quickly, with much of society managing to adapt to a prolonged state of unfreedom. “People tend to accept new rules imposed from above quite readily,” Shenderovich said. “Unfortunately, it turns out the U.S. is no exception.”\nIn July, CBS announced that it was cancelling Stephen Colbert’s late-night program, which the network said was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.” On September 17th, ABC suspended the late-night show hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, because of comments Kimmel had made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder. Both Colbert and Kimmel have been frequent critics of Trump. And both of their networks had previously paid millions of dollars to settle lawsuits brought by the President. ABC paid fifteen million dollars to settle a Trump defamation suit stemming from comments made on air by George Stephanopoulos; Paramount Global, which owned CBS, paid sixteen million to settle a suit over a “60 Minutes” interview with then Vice-President Kamala Harris which Trump had claimed was unfair to him. In April, the executive producer of “60 Minutes” resigned, writing in a memo to staff that CBS’s corporate owners had undermined the program’s editorial independence: “It has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it.”\nFive days after suspending Kimmel’s program, ABC announced that it would return the following night. “This show is not important,” Kimmel said in his first opening monologue back on air. “What’s important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.” But the matter remained unresolved. Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group, which together control more than twenty per cent of ABC’s affiliated stations across the country, have vowed to keep blocking Kimmel’s program.\nIn the case of NTV, the Kremlin went to great lengths to present the affair as a “dispute between business entities,” as the terminology went. Trump, for his part, has been open about settling political scores. In the wake of Kimmel’s suspension, he said of television networks that air negative coverage of him, “They’ll take a great story and they’ll make it bad,” adding, “I think that’s really illegal.” There was little subtlety in his threats. “I would think maybe their license should be taken away,” he said. That’s the shift in norms that seems most worrying to Shenderovich. “This used to be the kind of thing in the U.S. that was indecent, even taboo,” he said. “Now this is permissible. Decent. And there’s no small number of people calling for more.”\nParkhomenko brought up the case of the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan foreign-policy think tank funded by Congress, where he was previously a senior adviser, working on projects related to press freedom in Russia. In March, Trump issued an executive order effectively dismantling the organization; officials working for the Department of Government Efficiency showed up to enforce it. The director resigned. “It looked like they gave up in the span of a single day,” Parkhomenko said. “They didn’t even try to defend their right to exist. They stood up, cried, and left. It was terrible to see.”\nEvgeny Kiselev, NTV’s executive director at the peak of its influence, told me that at the time of the “Kukly” affair, he and his colleagues made a number of assumptions about Russian society’s newly-acquired taste for free speech, and the efficiency with which the state could carry out an attack on it. “It’s rather simple,” he said. “We miscalculated.”\nKiselev recalled a trip to New York in the early two-thousands. After the Kremlin seized control of NTV, he had moved to a smaller channel with a more modest reach, which the authorities had nonetheless moved to shut down. He met with producers from “60 Minutes” to pitch them on a piece about the pressures facing independent media outlets in Putin-era Russia. “They thought for a long time and then said, ‘No, it’s not for us,’ ” Kiselev told me. The American producers explained, “This won’t interest our audience. It won’t make sense to them.” He laughed at the irony.\nIn the case of Kimmel, it appeared as if public outcry—from Republican and Democratic politicians, actors, directors, other late-night hosts, and even regular viewers—had forced corporate managers to reconsider. “Thank God,” Kiselev said. “This is the difference between Russia and America: Public opinion remains a force to be reckoned with.” ♦","summary":"What it was like to live through the takeover of one of Russia’s most influential television stations—and what the experience suggests about the state of free expression in the U.S. today.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/is-trumps-attack-on-the-media-following-putins-playbook","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68d42f8f4c6cf8d62bc26889/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/Yaffa_NTV_GettyImages-666080.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 10:00:00","author":"Joshua Yaffa","authors":["Joshua Yaffa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.019}]}
