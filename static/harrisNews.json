Jasmine Crockett, a progressive firebrand who currently represents Texas' 30th congressional district, launched a bid for the U.S. Senate on Monday -- setting up a contested primary against a rising Democratic star and jolting a political scene already scrambled by the Lone Star state's recent redrawing of its congressional map.\n\nCrockett, speaking at an event on Monday in Dallas, emphasized being confident in being able to win a statewide race in Texas as a Democrat and wanting to take on President Donald Trump as a U.S. Senator. \n\n\"There's a responsibility that lies with all of us, especially in this moment. There are a lot of people that said, 'You got to stay in the house. We need our voice. We need you there,'\" Crockett told the crowd. \n\n\"I understand, but what we need is for me to have a bigger voice. What we need is not only a voice, but we need to make sure that we are going to stop all the hell that is raining down on all of our people,\" Crockett said.\n\nCrockett did not mention her primary opponent, state Rep. James Talarico, by name. The state representative rose to national acclaim for his embrace of Christianity with Democratic politics and was outspoken this past summer when Democratic state legislators in Texas left the state to try to prevent a vote on the new congressional map.\n\nTalarico said he \"welcomes\" Crockett into the race. \n\n\"We're building a movement in Texas ... Our movement is rooted in unity over division -- so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race,\" Talarico said in a statement on Monday.\n\nWhile talking about the uphill battle to win statewide on Monday, Crockett referenced a need for unity and that her run was focused on Texans, seemingly trying to preempt claims she was splitting the Democratic vote or going for her Senate run for the sake of her own ambition. \n\n\"Many people have asked, and all of us wonder, can we win this race in November? I'm here to say, yes, we can. I'm also here to say it's not if we can, but if we will, if we will get out and knock the doors ... will we come together as one? This isn't about me or them. It's about you and us,\" she said.\n\n\"This is not about ambition. It's not about my ambition. It's about yours, your hopes and your dreams, and a government that has your back,\" Crockett said.\n\nBut Crockett did not shy away from naming one of her possible general election opponents -- incumbent Republican Sen. John Cornyn, with whom she used to have a good relationship. Crockett framed Cornyn as \"business as usual\" and said that she is done standing by while watching him accept actions done by the administration, she said, that hurt Americans.\n\nCrockett and Cornyn have collaborated on legislation in the past, but during her remarks, Crockett criticized him for supporting Trump and framed him as \"business as usual\", saying that she is done standing by while watching him accept actions done by the administration, she said, that hurt Americans.\n\nCornyn, asked during an appearance on \"America Reports\" on Fox News on Tuesday to respond to some of Crockett’s comments about him, said that he thinks Crockett won’t be able to get more than the 42% of the vote that Vice President Kamala Harris got in the 2024 presidential race. \n\nShe had harsh words for President Donald Trump, telling supporters, \"I'm done watching the American dream on life support while Trump tries to pull the plug. The gloves have been off, and now I'm jumping into the ring.\" \n\nAnother area she hit Trump on was his push to have Texas redraw its congressional map mid-decade to favor the GOP, which Republicans delivered on this past summer. Analysts say Republicans may be able to flip three to five seats in the new map.\n\nCrockett told supporters that the mid-decade redistricting in Texas that Trump had promoted drew her out of her home district, but was not enough to stop her. \n\n\"I'm here to tell you, Donald Trump, you won't get rid of me that easily. I'm not going away. I'm not giving up. I still believe in this country. I still believe that we are in the land of opportunity,\" she said. \n\nCrockett made her announcement on the last day to file for the 2026 primaries -- which have been jolted by the redistricting. Current Democratic members of Texas' congressional delegation had been making decisions over whether and where to run ahead of Monday's deadline.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, for instance, said Friday he will retire at the end of the 119th Congress; some other members are running in new districts.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, who had been running for Senate, wrote Monday that what was expected to be \"a bruising Senate Democratic primary\" would divide the party ahead of the general election. He said he was now launching a bid for the newly redrawn 33rd congressional district instead -- drawing the ire of incumbent U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson, who is also running there.\n\nJohnson wrote in a statement Monday, without naming Allred, \"This new district deserves representation that has been present in the tough moments, including throughout the redistricting fight, instead of parachuting back when another campaign doesn't work out.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans running for the Senate seat pounced on reports midday Monday that Crockett had filed to run as proof that the Democrats will not be able to field a candidate who can win statewide. \n\nThe GOP faces an acrimonious primary itself, as incumbent Sen. John Cornyn -- supported by the party establishment -- faces primary challenges from state Attorney General Ken Paxton, and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt. Cornyn, Paxton and Hunt have each alleged that they are the best choice for Texas and the strongest supporter of Trump in the race. \n\n\"AOC has a new ally in Congress. She found one from Texas. Jasmine Crockett stands with this squad,\" the campaign team for Cornyn wrote in a post on X on Monday. \n\nPaxton, meanwhile, used Crockett's entry as a chance to hit back at Cornyn, writing on X, \"I'm sure John Cornyn is deeply upset his 'dance partner' Crazy Crockett is running, but that won't stop him from trying to force the national GOP to light $100 million on fire to save his failing campaign. He's willing to risk the Senate Majority to protect his fragile ego.\"\n\nHunt wrote on X on Tuesday, \"Welcome to the show, Jasmine Crockett. The next Senator from Texas must be able to stand on their record, their resume, and their accomplishments. I'm ready to have that debate every single day.\"\n\nABC News' John Parkinson and Brittany Shepherd contributed to this report.","summary":"Rep.

Higgins, a former Miami-Dade County commissioner, earned 59% of the vote to 41% for Republican Emilio González, a businessman and former city manager who had been endorsed by President Donald Trump. González conceded Tuesday night, his campaign confirmed. While the Miami mayoral race is technically nonpartisan, the Republican-affiliated candidate has won every election since 2008, and an independent candidate won before then, locking Democrats out of the office since their last win in 1997. But while Miami-Dade has moved dramatically toward Republicans in the last few elections, former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly carried the city itself last year. Both candidates centered their campaigns on breaking from the previous mayoral administrations in Miami and addressing voters’ economic concerns, while pitching different solutions, but the race became nationalized in the final weeks. And it hinged on familiar themes that will play a big role in deciding the 2026 elections: affordability, Trump’s weakened political standing and how the president’s controversial deportation agenda is playing in a city with a significant Hispanic population. Higgins leaned on her role on the county commission to frame herself as focused on quality of life issues like affordable housing, infrastructure and streamlining city processes in a way she said would help save the city, and residents, money. “There are many approaches to affordability that local governments have in their own hands even though we aren’t in control of tariffs — which by the way is creating a huge affordability crisis,” she told NBC News the day before the election, in a reference to Trump’s broad tariff policy. She was also deeply critical of Trump — and González by proxy, given the president’s endorsement — over his deportation agenda, telling NBC News that Hispanic and Haitian voters have been telling her they are “afraid of their government.” Despite Higgins’ messaging, González didn’t run as a Trump acolyte. Instead, he argued he was the candidate focused on local issues like fighting overdevelopment, and he aligned himself with GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis’ plan to end homestead property taxes to ease the cost of living. González deflected criticism of the president’s immigration policies by arguing that’s a national issue over which he has no say. The race received increased national attention in the final weeks, particularly after Democrats made gains, but still lost, in a Tennessee special election for a vacant congressional district earlier this month. The Democratic National Committee took an active interest in the mayoral race, sending organizational support to boost Higgins, and prominent Democrats with potential aspirations for higher office — Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel — sent their support too. Republicans zeroed in on the race as well, hoping to hold the seat and push back on a string of GOP candidates underperforming their 2024 marks in special House elections, the recent gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, and in other downballot races.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrat-wins-miamis-mayoral-race-first-time-almost-30-years-rcna248168","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251209-Eileen-Higgins-rs-e8546a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 01:14:33","author":"Ben Kamisar","authors":["Ben Kamisar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":386648804,"title":"Democrats Flip Miami Mayor&#039;s Office for First Time in Nearly 30 Years","text":"Miami has a new mayor, with former County Commissioner Eileen Higgins, a Democrat, beating Republican Emilio González, a former city manager endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe run-off election result upsets the status quo in the South Florida city, which had not elected a Democratic mayor in nearly three decades.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nFlorida has largely swung red in recent decades, but Miami has been seen as bluer, being home to many immigrant communities. That has changed in the past few years, with President Donald Trump seeing gains among those communities in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTuesday’s result could be seen as a warning sign for Trump going into the 2026 midterms.\n\nA sign points to a polling station setup on election day on December 09, 2025, in Miami, Florida.\n\nEileen Higgins Elected Mayor of Miami\n\nHiggins won the race Tuesday night, according to the Associated Press, after the two candidates beat 11 others on election day on November 4.\n\nIn the November 4 race, Higgins secured 36 percent of the vote, and González, who came in second, won 19 percent.\n\nDNC Chair Ken Martin in a released statement to Newsweek on Tuesday: “Mayor-elect Eileen Higgins’ win is a testament to what Democrats can accomplish when we organize and compete everywhere, including in Miami, where Democrats have now flipped a seat that was in Republicans’ hands for nearly 30 years. While her opponent was ready to rubber-stamp Donald Trump’s inflationary agenda, Higgins remained laser-focused on lowering costs and improving the lives of Miami families. Tonight’s result is yet another warning sign to Republicans that voters are fed up with their out-of-touch agenda that is raising costs for working families across the country.”\n\nWhat Did the Polls Show? \n\nAhead of Tuesday’s vote, betting platform Polymarket had Higgins, who campaigned on providing affordable housing, with a 94 percent chance of winning the election while González, who worked as a director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) under former President George W. Bush, had a 6 percent chance.\n\nAn APL Consulting poll of 307 voters found that Higgins had 34 percent of the vote and Gonzalez had 31 percent. This poll, conducted between November 21 and 24 on behalf of Mission Miami, a political committee backing Gonzalez’s campaign, had a margin of error of +/- 5.9 percentage points.\n\nAccording to an MDW Communications poll of 307 likely voters, 49.84 percent said they would vote for Higgins while 23.78 percent planned to vote for González. However, this poll was conducted between October 14 and 18, before the November 4 election. It was also commissioned by Higgins’ political committee. The margin of error was 6 percentage points.\n\nHow the Race Could Impact the 2026 Midterms\n\nAs with any election between general and midterm elections, both parties will be taking note of the result in Miami and adjusting plans accordingly.\n\nWith the midterms looming, Republicans will be looking to continue the momentum seen in 2024 and maintain a hold on both chambers in Congress, while Democrats will be looking for any signs they could upset that majority.\n\nMiami will likely remain a hotly contested area, with the city having been won by former Vice President Kamala Harris by one point in 2024, while Miami-Dade County flipped red for Trump.\n\nAs the second-largest city in Florida, and one which is extremely diverse, the party’s likely cannot write off the mayoral race as they might in other parts of the country, especially with Trump’s endorsement of Gonzalez.\n\nThis is a breaking news story that will be updated.","summary":"Higgins won the race Tuesday night, after the two candidates beat 11 others on election day on November 4.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/miami-mayor-election-results-eileen-higgins-emilio-gonzalez-11182942","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2250973044.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:51:31","author":"Dan Gooding","authors":["Dan Gooding"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.05},{"id":386651934,"title":"Josh Shapiro stands by claim  Kamala Harris tried to ‘cover her a–‘ with criticism of PA gov in book excerpt","text":"Gov.

That’s complete and utter bulls—. I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies.”\n\nElsewhere, Shapiro told the outlet that Harris was “trying to sell books and cover her a–.” He amended his response, adding, “I shouldn’t say ‘cover her a–.’ I think that’s not appropriate.”\n\n“She’s trying to sell books. Period.”\n\nThe governor repeated to MS NOW that what Harris’ book was getting at was untrue.\n\n“I think what was relayed to me by that author that the vice president had written about me just simply wasn’t true. And you know, I think the vice president and I had very and continue to have very candid conversations. And I think the way in which it was articulated to me what was said was certainly not accurate,” he said.\n\nSanders-Townsend followed up, asking Shapiro if he was correcting the record for the sake of an upcoming presidential run. The governor denied that notion.\n\n“No, Simone, I was asked for my reaction to a statement that he said the vice president said that simply wasn’t true, and I was pointing that out,” he said.\n\n“Look, here’s the thing: I’ve got respect for the former vice president and I think we do everyone a disservice when we focus on looking backwards instead of looking forwards in terms of what we’re dealing with every day with the Trump administration making people’s lives more difficult,” he added.\n\nShapiro is widely seen as a possible 2028 Democratic presidential candidate given his status as the governor of a major swing state.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Harris’ team for comment.","summary":"Shapiro said Harris had written 'bulls---' about him in her election memoir.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/09/media/josh-shapiro-stands-by-claim-kamala-harris-tried-to-cover-her-a-with-criticism-of-pa-gov-in-book-excerpt/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/2024-theme-night-3-fight-117058699.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Z0R4AIjl-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-10 00:41:25","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":386651006,"title":"Inside Scoop newsletter: Trump's economic report card","text":"The president is on the road trying to convince voters the economy is A+++++, so we are talking to NBC senior White House correspondent Garrett Haake for the Here’s the Scoop podcast.

FIRST THINGS FIRST It’s unclear how much extra credit you need to get this sort of grade, but Donald Trump says his economy gets an “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.” Do Americans agree? For 63% of registered voters, the answer is no, which is a reason why the president is hitting the ground in Pennsylvania, rallying supporters on the cost of living. Yesterday, Politico’s Dasha Burns asked Trump about a supporter who said he hasn’t done enough to lower costs, specifically “groceries, utility, insurance, and the basic cost of running” a small business. Trump said prices have come down substantially during his 11 months in office, citing energy, gas and rollbacks on some tariffs. He is also touting other negotiations he’s overseen, including the tariffs, which he said will bring in trillions, and allowing some American-made AI chips to be sold in China. It may be years, however, before the fruits of these negotiations turn into jobs in the U.S. and a more affordable cost of living. It’s worked before: The prospect of building a strong economy that would benefit working people has been a huge part of Trump’s campaign, going back to his first White House win. The message speaks directly to people struggling with job insecurity, inflation, high housing costs, rising health care and necessary child care. He won in 2024 largely because enough people believed he was better equipped than Kamala Harris to drive the economy. Fast-forward a year, though, and Trump is talking about affordability as a false narrative pushed by Democrats. But nearly two-thirds of respondents to an NBC News survey in October said they believed Trump was failing to bring down costs and supercharge the economy as promised; a more recent Gallup poll echoes this. Why it matters: Congressional Republicans are worried that Trump is not doing enough to clearly and decisively address people’s concerns with affordability. In 2024, Democrats “failed to really hammer the economy and it cost them the election,” Rep. Tony Gonzalez, a Texas Republican, told my colleagues. “If we as Republicans fail to do the same, it wouldn’t surprise me if we had a similar turnout.” When it comes to kitchen table economics, though, high earners will keep earning more — there may even be some trillionaires on the horizon. Lower earners have stayed stagnant for years. Their paychecks aren’t rising, while prices are. A survey of 1,065 professionals from January showed financial stress is reaching astronomical levels for American workers, as 73% say their salaries don’t cover their living costs. In October, a Goldman Sachs analysis said 40% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck with no discernible savings. Tons of cash is being funneled into artificial intelligence, which is making some people richer while also creating anxiety for workers, especially younger ones. Yet the president, 11 months into his term, calls the issue of affordability a reflection of “Biden’s economy.” INSIDE SCOOP Women of the GOP, including some of the highest-profile members of the party, say they are growing increasingly tired of their leaders marginalizing them. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia sent shock waves when she announced she would resign to Congress over her frustrations with party leaders and the president. South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace penned an essay in The New York Times yesterday about women in the party being cast aside by male leaders for decades. For more on this growing call from within the House, I turned to Capitol Hill correspondent Mel Zanona. BTW… 🎒 Dozens of men who participated in a Pentecostal scouting organization called the Royal Rangers as children told NBC News that they were abused by some of their adult leaders. Reporters Mike Hixenbaugh and Elizabeth Chuck revealed that the program, with the mission of raising boys into godly men, drew at least 29 Royal Rangers leaders who were accused of sexually abusing boys in their care over the past half century, according to a review of lawsuits, police reports and news clips.

In their post, they compared US President Trump to the Kansas City Chiefs, with clips of Travis Kelce, and a caption 'Washed'.\n\nThe video showed moments of Trump looking tired and stumbling with the Chiefs' recent 20-10 loss to the Houston Texas, missing their Super Bowl chance. It featured the last-second drop of the pass by Kelce, who is engaged to Democrat and Kamala Harris endorser, Taylor Swift.\n\nInternet Claps Back at Democrats\n\nInternet users were quick to respond to Democrats. One of the main points of irony raised by critics was that Kelce's fiancée, pop star Taylor Swift, is a prominent supporter of the Democratic Party. During the 2024 presidential election, Swift publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Swift subsequently faced criticism from Trump himself, a sexually offensive remark from Elon Musk, and death threats from far-right groups.\n\nUsers argued that the comparison was flawed, noting that the Chiefs have been one of the most successful teams in the NFL since Tom Brady's era. At the same time, the video mocked Kelce, who is engaged to 'the biggest celebrity endorser for the Democratic Party ever'.\n\n'The Democrats are so dumb', said another user. Several users also criticized the joke itself, wondering who it was made for and why the Democrats were so incapable of producing a simple and clear joke. 'You all seriously don't get how this works'.\n\nThe video quickly gained traction and quickly became a viral clip, tallying more than 1.6 million views in under half a day.\n\nMAGAs in Chiefs\n\nHowever, some commenters saw nothing wrong with the comparison, noting that many members of the Chiefs' team — including quarterback Patrick Mahomes and kicker Harrison Butker — as well as the Hunt family owners, are Trump supporters.\n\nMahomes' wife, Brittany, has not hesitated to support Trump, even though she is friends with Swift. Many speculated that she may have been swayed toward the Democratic Party after Trump's attack on Swift, which reportedly left her 'deeply bothered'.\n\nKelce previously said it would be an 'honour' to have Trump watch Super Bowl 2025, but later clarified that he was referring to Trump in his capacity as US president. Kelce has not publicly endorsed Harris, though he has liked posts about her candidacy.\n\nTravis Kelce's 'Democratic Values'\n\nKelce has not publicly endorsed any candidate in previous US elections, unlike Swift, who encouraged fans to vote for Biden-Harris in 2020 and Harris-Walz in 2024.\n\nHowever, much of his past behaviour and publicly expressed support appears largely aligned with progressive or liberal ideals. He has backed the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, appeared in social-justice promotional material, and participated in activities of organisations that go against conservative norms.\n\nAs a staunch Democrat, Swift's position has led many to assume that Kelce's views or affiliations might be similar. His sister-in-law, Kylie Kelce, is also a vocal liberal and has invited Michelle Obama onto her podcast.\n\nKelce has previously commented on controversial political issues by emphasising respect for institutions rather than offering his personal opinions.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"Democrats face backlash after a viral video comparing Trump to the Kansas City Chiefs and Travis Kelce, despite Kelce's fiancée Taylor Swift being a prominent Democrat.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/democrats-slammed-calling-pro-vax-travis-kelce-washed-comparing-him-trump-after-super-bowl-miss-3792234","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4636489/president-trump-attends-state-department-kennedy-center.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 22:34:11","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":386625828,"title":"It’s the ‘A+++++’ economy, stupid. Trump embarks on the same don’t-believe-your-lying-eyes trap that doomed Biden","text":"Prices are high, Americans are feeling the pain around the kitchen table and in their empty pockets — and President Donald Trump is hitting the road to convince skeptical voters that the U.S. economy is “A+++++”, as he told Politico.\n\nIf this all sounds familiar, well, that’s because it is nearly the same game plan, executed to extreme imperfection, by the man Trump now constantly reviles as “maybe the worst ever” at his job, Joe Biden, in the year leading up to his abrupt withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race. (And then again, by former Vice President Kamala Harris as she took the baton and mounted what would become a losing campaign for the presidency.)\n\nNow, more than a year after voters returned Trump to the White House despite his multiple criminal indictments and the shambolic ending of his first term — including that riot at the U.S. Capitol in a doomed attempt to stop certification of his 2020 election loss — Trump is hitting the road to convince voters weary from high prices and economic anxiety that things aren’t nearly as bad as they think they are.\n\nThe president is embarking on what White House aides are calling a multi-month series of rallies and public appearances intended to boost his and his party’s flagging political fortunes ahead of midterm elections in which they could lose control of one or both chambers of Congress.\n\nStarting with an appearance in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night, his first major domestic event after months of overseas trips filled with glad-handing of wealthy foreign monarchs and other leaders, Trump will double down on economic policies that most voters say haven’t done much of anything to address the concerns that led them to pull the lever for him 13 months ago.\n\nAccording to a talking points memorandum sent out to surrogates by the Republican National Committee and first reported by NOTUS, Trump and his compatriots are looking to deflect blame for current economic conditions by arguing that the administration is “repairing the mess” left by Biden and Harris nearly 11 months ago and “fighting every day to bring down prices and reverse the damage that Joe Biden and the Democrats did to the economy.”\n\nTrump previewed this message during an event to unveil a $12 billion farmer bailout package on Monday, telling reporters that Democrats “caused the affordability problem and we are the ones that are fixing it,” seemingly back away from statements he’d made days earlier when he dismissed affordability concerns as a “hoax” and a “con-job.”\n\nUnfortunately for the president, Americans seem primed to give his party the same treatment they gave Biden, Harris and the Democrats in last year’s election.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, only 36 percent of voters approve of his performance as president, giving him the lowest rating of his second term. A Politico poll released this week showed 46 percent of respondents saying the cost of living in America is worse than they can remember at any point, including 37 percent of voters who pulled levers for Trump last year.\n\nNearly half of respondents also said they blame Trump — not Biden or Harris — for the economy’s current condition.\n\nBut at the same time, Trump continues to tout his own record, such as it is. In an interview with Politico this week, he told correspondent Dasha Burns that he gives himself an “A-plus-plus-plus-plus” when she asked him to grade his own record on the economy thus far.\n\nFor veterans of the Biden White House and the Biden, later Harris, presidential campaign, Trump’s pivot to the economy looks eerily familiar, and they don’t think Trump will have any more luck than Biden or Harris did in trying to convince voters that everything is fine.\n\nOne former official who spent three years in the White House before shifting over to the campaign told The Independent that seeing Trump hit the road to tout the economy is instilling them with a profound sense of deja vu because he and his administration are trying to fight feelings with raw economic indicators that don’t necessarily do much to sway anxious voters.\n\nInvoking Maya Angelou’s observation that people “might forget your name” but will “always remember how you made them feel,” the ex-official said Trump was falling into the same trap that Biden did — but with worse numbers to boast about.\n\n“You can tell people as much as you want that the economy is great and the economy is doing all the right things. But if people don't feel that way, it's really hard to make them change their mind,” the official said.\n\n“If they think these kinds of road shows and statements are enough on their own, and just telling people the economy is good, that is not enough.”\n\nAnother former Biden adviser who also worked on the Harris campaign pointed to Trump’s tariff policies as a driver of high prices and suggested that his obsession with import taxes and his oft-repeated false claim that they are paid by foreign countries is making an impact on Americans, because they no longer believe it. \n\n“Trump had a chance to let prices come down naturally by doing nothing and taking credit for the result we left him on the road to getting. But instead he decided to pour gasoline on them in the form of tariffs for no good reason except because he could,” they said.\n\n“At this point, he’s the arsonist cosplaying as a firefighter. People see through that.”\n\nFormer Biden White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told The Independent that Trump’s decision to start touting his economic record now at a time when health care costs are about to skyrocket from the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies shows he’s not reading the room at all.\n\n“Democrats and the Biden-Harris Administration warned Trump against making the biggest health care cuts in history so billionaires could have tax breaks; just like they warned against the tariffs that are a record-level tax hike on working people,” Bates said. “Maybe Donald Trump can't remember prices were lower last year. I wondered about that when he started building himself an assisted living ballroom.” \n\nHe added that the contrast between Biden’s and Harris’ doomed effort to sell their record and what Trump is doing now is the former president and vice president acknowledged there was more to do because they knew people were still hurting, while Trump is dismissing affordability concerns entirely.\n\n“Trump is attacking his own supporters when they raise his broken promise to lower prices ‘immediately,’ then going back to his corrupt payoffs and ballroom planning,” he said. \n\nA third ex-Biden aide, who like the others asked for anonymity because his current employer would not let him speak publicly about the current administration, responded to a query from The Independent with a cryptic phrase often used by his former boss when asked about Trump’s effort to boost voters’ impression of his economy.\n\n“Lots of luck in your senior year,” he said.","summary":"The president’s tour to boost voter impressions of their own dire economic conditions starts Tuesday night in Pennsylvania.

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Miami has had Republican mayors for decades, but the office is up for grabs tonight By Ben Kamisar Voters in Miami are choosing their next mayor today as Democrats make their latest push to flip a Republican-held office. The city hasn’t had a Democratic mayor since the late 1990s, and dramatic shifts among Hispanic voters, particularly in South Florida, have melted away Democrats’ edge in recent elections. But Kamala Harris narrowly carried the city of Miami in the 2024 presidential race while losing Miami-Dade County. That means a Democratic flip is well within reach for former County Commissioner Eileen Higgins, who is running against Republican Emilio T. González, a businessman and former city manager endorsed by President Donald Trump. Both candidates have pitched themselves as clean breaks from past city politics and promise to address affordability issues, which looms especially large in South Florida, as it has done across the country. While the candidates’ solutions to those problems may be local, the race has been swept up into a national fight, as both parties jockey for political momentum ahead of next year’s midterm elections. In Miami, that means a technically nonpartisan election with clear partisan trappings. Higgins and González advanced to a runoff after a blanket primary in November after no candidate won at least 50% of the vote. Higgins finished atop the 13-candidate field with 36% of the vote to González’s 19%, and the top two Democratic candidates combined for a majority of the vote. Democrats come into today’s election energized by their relative overperformance in high-profile elections this year. That’s why the national party is jumping in to lend a hand, alongside a parade of Democratic politicians from across the country, including Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. But Republicans are fighting to keep their grip on the mayorship, which they’ve held since 2009 (an independent was mayor from 2001 to 2009). In addition to Trump, prominent Florida Republicans like Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. María Elvira Salazar have sought to boost González. Read more from Ben before polls close at 7 p.m. ET → After making inroads in 2024, Trump’s standing has slipped with young voters Analysis by Steve Kornacki President Donald Trump’s standing has ebbed over the course of 2025 with all voters — including a group that he made significant strides with last year. The new Yale Youth Poll finds that about two-thirds of voters under 35 years old now disapprove of Trump’s job performance. Young voters have long been a Democratic-friendly group, but in the 2024 election they shifted to the right, with 42% of those under 30 backing Trump, according to an average of the exit polls and several major post-election studies. Kamala Harris won 56% of these voters. That 14-point gap was down from the 26-point advantage that Joe Biden enjoyed over Trump in 2020 among those under 30. The new Yale data suggests that those gains have been largely wiped out this year. The poll also measured the generic congressional ballot for 2026. The deficits that Republicans face with these under-35 subgroups — between 15 and 20 points — are not massive. But the problem for the GOP is that its generic ballot support is running almost perfectly parallel to Trump’s approval rating. That could present a ceiling for Republicans as the voters who are currently undecided make up their minds. While these new numbers represent a clear drop for Trump and his party, the silver lining for the GOP is that its standing with young voters is still better than it was during Trump’s first term. In the 2018 midterms, Republicans were crushed among voters under 30 by 49 points, 72% to 23%. That election produced a blue wave, with Democrats flipping 40 House seats and winning back the chamber. At least for now, Trump and the GOP aren’t in that territory with young voters. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner.

What the court wound up hearing a lot about from the lawyers before it, however, was how it has screwed up campaign finance law over the past 20 years.\n\nIn NRSC v. FEC, the chief political arm of Senate Republicans together with Vice President JD Vance sued to overturn what’s known as the coordinated party spending limit enacted in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974, one of the remaining restrictions on money in politics. That limit, which was designed to protect against corruption, prevented donors from working around limits on how much they could give to a political candidate by instead donating to the political party (with the effect the party would then donate to the candidate). \n\nThe case could not only lead to the elimination of yet another key pillar of the modern campaign finance regulatory system, but also set the stage for its total destruction. Piece by piece, the court’s conservative majority has dismantled the regime regulating money in politics, and taking down the coordinating spending limits could, as was revealed during arguments, ultimately lead to the elimination of the base limits for parties and candidates.\n\nThe court may well choose to not go down that path. It was unclear which way the conservative justices leaned during arguments as only Justice Samuel Alito appeared wholly on the NRSC’s side while Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett asked just one question between the two of them. But if it does decide not to, it appeared most likely that it would do so by adopting the argument that the case was moot because Vance is not currently a candidate for any office and faces no threat of harm from the coordinated spending limits right now.\n\nVance ― who brought the case during his 2022 Ohio Senate campaign ― and the NRSC argued that this limit was an infringement on core First Amendment speech rights and flew in the face of recent Supreme Court decisions on campaign finance. In particular, NRSC lawyer Noel Francisco argued the court had previously ruled that contributions routed through a party to support a given candidate cannot give rise to corruption in its 2014 decision in McCutcheon v. FEC. Additionally, the creation of super PACs, created in the wake of the court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, has made concerns about conduit corruption less worrying — because a super PAC is a much better option, Francisco argued.\n\n“A would-be briber would be better off giving a massive contribution to a candidate’s favorite super PAC,” Francisco argued.\n\nBut this just raised a whole lot more questions about how the court’s other recent campaign finance jurisprudence ― written entirely by the conservative justices ― created this mess in the first place, and how further decisions, as in this case, could continue to make things worse. And the court got an earful about it.\n\n“[You’re] suggesting to me that every time we interfere with the congressional design, we make matters worse,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said to Francisco. “You’re telling us that Citizens United and McCutcheon ended up, yes, in amplifying the voice of corporations, but diminishing another voice, that of the party. Now, you want to tinker some more and try to raise the voice of one party. Our tinkering causes more harm than it does good.”\n\nIn McCutcheon, the conservative court majority eliminated limits on the total amount a single donor could give to all candidates and parties in one election cycle. These aggregate limits were, much like the limits center to Tuesday’s case, designed to prevent circumvention of the base limits. Opponents argued that by eliminating the aggregate limits, donors would allow circumvention of limits through parties, which could then establish joint fundraising committees linking every state party with the national party — and then reroute donations made to the state party contributions back to the national party, to be redistributed as the national party or its donors pleased.\n\nThe majority decision in McCutcheon disagreed and argued that there was “no reason to believe” in what Justice Samuel Alito called “wild hypotheticals,” during oral arguments in the case. \n\nBut that’s exactly what happened. In 2024, both President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris operated joint fundraising committees that raised contributions around $1 million from individual donors that included money for state parties. The state parties then rerouted those donations back to the national committees, who then sent it on to state parties in the swing states.\n\nThis was precisely the circumvention hypothetical that the court in McCutcheon dismissed. When it did so, the majority claimed that the party coordination limits, the very limits now before the court in the NRSC case, provided a defense against the potential corrupting influence of knocking down the aggregate limits.\n\n“The court specifically pointed to this limit as part of the status quo that would prevent this kind of circumvention,” Justice Elena Kagan said on Tuesday.\n\n“Once we take off this coordinated expenditure limit, then what’s left?” Sotomayor added. “What’s left is nothing.”\n\nFrancisco attempted to deflect these arguments by claiming that attempting to bribe a candidate by using the parties as a conduit is complicated by the fact that parties may choose to not spend their money in coordination with a chosen candidate, and that it is hard for the candidate to know who gave the money and for what purpose. But Kagan slapped this down.\n\n“You are assuming a lot there about people’s, honestly, dumbness,” Kagan said. “I mean, everybody knows where the money is coming from when it’s done this way.”\n\nOne of Francisco’s key points was that there is no evidence that contributions routed through political parties in support of a particular candidate have led to quid pro quo corruption or its appearance. This time Sotomayor slapped this down.\n\nShe noted that the entire campaign finance legal structure was created after the dairy industry gave millions of dollars in contributions to the RNC to support President Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign in exchange for favorable actions by the president. More recently, billionaire Elon Musk gave a maximum contribution to Trump’s 2024 joint fundraising committee, and spent $250 million through a super PAC to support his election and received a plum White House job.\n\nAlthough there has been no accusation of a specific this-for-that agreement between Musk and the president, Sotomayor noted the optics were not good. “You mean to suggest that the most major donor to the current president, got a very lucrative job immediately upon election from the new administration, does not give the appearance of quid pro quo?” Sotomayor asked.\n\n“I have a hard time thinking that his salary that he drew from the federal government was an effective quid pro quo bribery, which may be why nobody has even remotely suggested that,” Francisco said.\n\n“Maybe not the salary, but certainly the lucrative government contracts might be,” Sotomayor added. Francisco did not respond.\n\nWhat this helped reveal was how unintended consequences of these Supreme Court decisions are not actually all that unintended — and in fact the court builds its deregulatory campaign finance jurisprudence through the downstream effects that flow from its decisions. \n\nThe court-appointed lawyer defending the limits, Roman Martinez, made sure to explain to the justices how each time they tinker with campaign finance law, they are setting up the next case to knock down another limit, even when they viewed that limit as essential for the case before them at the time.\n\n“They’re setting up bait and switch 2.0,” Martinez said. “Bait and switch 1.0 was McCutcheon. They came in and said in McCutcheon, ‘Hey, we need to get rid of these aggregate limits.’ Why? ‘Because we’ve got all these other protections. Look, coordinated expenditures are limited too.’ And then you said, ‘OK, well fine, we’ll do that,’ and you put it in your opinion that coordinated expenditures were going to protect us. Now they’re coming back and saying, ‘Ha, just kidding, actually the coordinated expenditure expenditure provision is unlawful as well.’”\n\nThe same goes for the court’s decision in Citizens United that enabled corporations, unions and nonprofits to spend unlimited sums on independent expenditures. If parties are now at a disadvantage to the groups created after Citizens United, that’s the court’s fault for tinkering with campaign finance law in Citizens United. Now, they are asked to tinker again to supposedly help the parties.\n\nThat isn’t the only unintended consequence of Citizens United that Francisco relied on to make his case for knocking down the coordinated spending limits. By claiming that a “briber” would be better served donating to a candidate’s preferred super PAC, Francisco undermined the central claim made by then-Justice Anthony Kennedy to justify Citizens United that “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” But now this corruption, made possible by Citizens United, is deployed as a reason to again tinker with campaign finance law.\n\nThe next step for gutting campaign finance law was hinted at throughout the arguments. \n\nFirst, Chief Justice John Roberts suggested, not incorrectly, that the distinction between a party contributing to a candidate and a party coordinating spending with a candidate was a “kind of a fiction.” Then Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained very clearly how he expects the Republican Party to use a decision striking down coordinated spending limits to then challenge the base party or candidate limits.\n\n“Do you think those limits are constitutional? I assume you think they’re not constitutional,” Kavanaugh said to Francisco. “In a future case, [which is] kind of how this march has proceeded, that you would argue those limits on parties are not constitutional so as to get to my first point to equalize the strength of political parties and outside groups. … I’m not sure five years from now, three years from now you know how that will look.”\n\nFrancisco demurred, only saying that he was “willing to assume for the sake of argument here that [the base limits are] constitutional.”\n\n“You’re not going to want that cited back to you in a couple of years,” Kavanaugh replied.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson followed up after Kavanaugh asked the same questions to deputy solicitor general Sarah Harris, who was arguing against the limits on behalf of the FEC, which switched sides in the case after Trump took office. Jackson posited a different consequence that could follow from the logic the court was being asked to adopt.\n\n“If the theory is [that] the donor is trying to bribe through conduit,” Jackson asked, wouldn’t that raise the question of how parties are different than super PACs, and whether, if the court rules that conduit contributions cannot corrupt, than why wouldn’t the court later rule that super PACs be allowed to coordinate with candidates.\n\n“This is like the camel’s nose under the tent,” Martinez said. “If you agree with them in this case, you’re going to get petition after petition coming to you for this provision and that provision, and overrule this precedent and that precedent. You’re going to be deluged with petitions. The dominoes are going to fall, and you’re going to have to reconstruct campaign finance law from the ground up. I have a better solution for you. Don’t go down this path.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-nrsc-fec_n_693881e3e4b0447a52b8c879?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6938822e1900003aad7f3b17.jpeg?cache=c4oQBPf91s&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 22:03:10","author":"Paul Blumenthal","authors":["Paul Blumenthal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.083},{"id":386631720,"title":"The Supreme Court Gets An Earful About How It Screwed Up Campaign Finance Law","text":"The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard arguments in its latest campaign finance case with a challenge to existing limits on how much a political party can spend in coordination with a candidate.

And the court got an earful about it.\n\n“[You’re] suggesting to me that every time we interfere with the congressional design, we make matters worse,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said to Francisco. “You’re telling us that Citizens United and McCutcheon ended up, yes, in amplifying the voice of corporations, but diminishing another voice, that of the party. Now, you want to tinker some more and try to raise the voice of one party. Our tinkering causes more harm than it does good.”\n\nIn McCutcheon, the conservative court majority eliminated limits on the total amount a single donor could give to all candidates and parties in one election cycle. These aggregate limits were, much like the limits center to Tuesday’s case, designed to prevent circumvention of the base limits. Opponents argued that by eliminating the aggregate limits, donors would allow circumvention of limits through parties, which could then establish joint fundraising committees linking every state party with the national party — and then reroute donations made to the state party contributions back to the national party, to be redistributed as the national party or its donors pleased.\n\nThe majority decision in McCutcheon disagreed and argued that there was “no reason to believe” in what Justice Samuel Alito called “wild hypotheticals,” during oral arguments in the case. \n\nBut that’s exactly what happened. In 2024, both President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris operated joint fundraising committees that raised contributions around $1 million from individual donors that included money for state parties. The state parties then rerouted those donations back to the national committees, who then sent it on to state parties in the swing states.\n\nThis was precisely the circumvention hypothetical that the court in McCutcheon dismissed. When it did so, the majority claimed that the party coordination limits, the very limits now before the court in the NRSC case, provided a defense against the potential corrupting influence of knocking down the aggregate limits.\n\n“The court specifically pointed to this limit as part of the status quo that would prevent this kind of circumvention,” Justice Elena Kagan said on Tuesday.\n\n“Once we take off this coordinated expenditure limit, then what’s left?” Sotomayor added. “What’s left is nothing.”\n\nFrancisco attempted to deflect these arguments by claiming that attempting to bribe a candidate by using the parties as a conduit is complicated by the fact that parties may choose to not spend their money in coordination with a chosen candidate, and that it is hard for the candidate to know who gave the money and for what purpose. But Kagan slapped this down.\n\n“You are assuming a lot there about people’s, honestly, dumbness,” Kagan said. “I mean, everybody knows where the money is coming from when it’s done this way.”\n\nOne of Francisco’s key points was that there is no evidence that contributions routed through political parties in support of a particular candidate have led to quid pro quo corruption or its appearance. This time Sotomayor slapped this down.\n\nShe noted that the entire campaign finance legal structure was created after the dairy industry gave millions of dollars in contributions to the RNC to support President Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign in exchange for favorable actions by the president. More recently, billionaire Elon Musk gave a maximum contribution to Trump’s 2024 joint fundraising committee, and spent $250 million through a super PAC to support his election and received a plum White House job.\n\nAlthough there has been no accusation of a specific this-for-that agreement between Musk and the president, Sotomayor noted the optics were not good. “You mean to suggest that the most major donor to the current president, got a very lucrative job immediately upon election from the new administration, does not give the appearance of quid pro quo?” Sotomayor asked.\n\n“I have a hard time thinking that his salary that he drew from the federal government was an effective quid pro quo bribery, which may be why nobody has even remotely suggested that,” Francisco said.\n\n“Maybe not the salary, but certainly the lucrative government contracts might be,” Sotomayor added. Francisco did not respond.\n\nWhat this helped reveal was how unintended consequences of these Supreme Court decisions are not actually all that unintended — and in fact the court builds its deregulatory campaign finance jurisprudence through the downstream effects that flow from its decisions. \n\nThe court-appointed lawyer defending the limits, Roman Martinez, made sure to explain to the justices how each time they tinker with campaign finance law, they are setting up the next case to knock down another limit, even when they viewed that limit as essential for the case before them at the time.\n\n“They’re setting up bait and switch 2.0,” Martinez said. “Bait and switch 1.0 was McCutcheon. They came in and said in McCutcheon, ‘Hey, we need to get rid of these aggregate limits.’ Why? ‘Because we’ve got all these other protections. Look, coordinated expenditures are limited too.’ And then you said, ‘OK, well fine, we’ll do that,’ and you put it in your opinion that coordinated expenditures were going to protect us. Now they’re coming back and saying, ‘Ha, just kidding, actually the coordinated expenditure expenditure provision is unlawful as well.’”\n\nThe same goes for the court’s decision in Citizens United that enabled corporations, unions and nonprofits to spend unlimited sums on independent expenditures. If parties are now at a disadvantage to the groups created after Citizens United, that’s the court’s fault for tinkering with campaign finance law in Citizens United. Now, they are asked to tinker again to supposedly help the parties.\n\nThat isn’t the only unintended consequence of Citizens United that Francisco relied on to make his case for knocking down the coordinated spending limits. By claiming that a “briber” would be better served donating to a candidate’s preferred super PAC, Francisco undermined the central claim made by then-Justice Anthony Kennedy to justify Citizens United that “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” But now this corruption, made possible by Citizens United, is deployed as a reason to again tinker with campaign finance law.\n\nThe next step for gutting campaign finance law was hinted at throughout the arguments. \n\nFirst, Chief Justice John Roberts suggested, not incorrectly, that the distinction between a party contributing to a candidate and a party coordinating spending with a candidate was a “kind of a fiction.” Then Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained very clearly how he expects the Republican Party to use a decision striking down coordinated spending limits to then challenge the base party or candidate limits.\n\n“Do you think those limits are constitutional? I assume you think they’re not constitutional,” Kavanaugh said to Francisco. “In a future case, [which is] kind of how this march has proceeded, that you would argue those limits on parties are not constitutional so as to get to my first point to equalize the strength of political parties and outside groups. … I’m not sure five years from now, three years from now you know how that will look.”\n\nFrancisco demurred, only saying that he was “willing to assume for the sake of argument here that [the base limits are] constitutional.”\n\n“You’re not going to want that cited back to you in a couple of years,” Kavanaugh replied.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson followed up after Kavanaugh asked the same questions to deputy solicitor general Sarah Harris, who was arguing against the limits on behalf of the FEC, which switched sides in the case after Trump took office. Jackson posited a different consequence that could follow from the logic the court was being asked to adopt.\n\n“If the theory is [that] the donor is trying to bribe through conduit,” Jackson asked, wouldn’t that raise the question of how parties are different than super PACs, and whether, if the court rules that conduit contributions cannot corrupt, than why wouldn’t the court later rule that super PACs be allowed to coordinate with candidates.\n\n“This is like the camel’s nose under the tent,” Martinez said. “If you agree with them in this case, you’re going to get petition after petition coming to you for this provision and that provision, and overrule this precedent and that precedent. You’re going to be deluged with petitions. The dominoes are going to fall, and you’re going to have to reconstruct campaign finance law from the ground up. I have a better solution for you. Don’t go down this path.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-nrsc-fec_n_693881e3e4b0447a52b8c879?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6938822e1900003aad7f3b17.jpeg?cache=c4oQBPf91s&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 22:03:10","author":"Paul Blumenthal","authors":["Paul Blumenthal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.083},{"id":386627348,"title":"Secret Backstabbing in Newsom–Harris Feud Hits New Level","text":"Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom are bringing their private feud into the public eye.\n\nThe two California Democrats—who were sworn in on the same day two decades ago—have always shown a united front since their early days in San Francisco politics under the same mentor, Golden State superstar Willie Brown. \n\nOn Thursday, The New York Times reported that the 2024 presidential candidate clammed up when asked whether she signed off on a “President Newsom.” \n\n“He has to make that decision if he wants to [run] first,” Harris, 61, said.\n\nIn a passive-aggressive play, Newsom has coaxed several Harris alumni into his camp, including her former chief of staff, consulting firm, and campaign manager, the Times reported.\n\nHarris aired some of the additional dirty laundry in her memoir, 107 Days, chronicling her short-lived 2024 campaign.

But their cause has been championed by President Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail last year to acknowledge the Lumbee as a tribal nation.\n\nThe issue of federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe has been batted around Congress for more than thirty years. But the political opportunity it represented in the last election could be what pushed it over the finish line, said Kevin Washburn, former assistant secretary of Indian Affairs at the Interior Department and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. \n\n“It comes up every four years because North Carolina is a battleground state and the Lumbee represent tens of thousands of people,” Washburn said. \n\nThe Lumbee Tribe has nearly 60,000 members, and both Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris promised the Lumbee federal recognition during the 2024 campaign. Trump won North Carolina by more than 3 points. Shortly after taking office, Trump issued an executive order directing the Interior Department to create a plan for federal recognition for the Lumbee. \n\nIt’s the first time either the White House or the candidates for president have been so engaged in a federal recognition case, Washburn said. \n\nInterior’s plan was sent to the White House in April. The administration has denied requests for its release but has said it advised the Lumbee to continue trying to gain federal recognition through Congress. \n\nThe Lumbee were recognized by Congress in 1956, but that legislation denied them access to the same federal resources as tribal nations. As a result, their application for recognition was denied for consideration in the 1980s, and the Lumbee Tribe has tried to get Congress to acknowledge them in the decades since. The Office of Federal Acknowledgement is the federal agency that vets applications, although dozens of tribes have also gained recognition through legislation.\n\n“Only Congress can for all time and for all purposes resolve this uncertainty,” Lumbee Tribal Chairman John Lowery testified last month before the Senate Committee for Indian Affairs. “It is long past time to rectify the injustice it has inflicted on our tribe and our people.”\n\nBut others, including several tribal leaders, argue that the Lumbee’s historic claims have shifted many times over the last century and that they have never been able to prove they descend from a tribal nation. \n\n“A national defense bill is not the appropriate place to consider federal recognition, particularly for a group that has not met the historical and legal standards required of sovereign tribal nations,” said Michelle Hicks, chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. \n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act is usually a bipartisan bill that lays out the nation’s defense policies. But this year the vote has taken on a new political dynamic as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces mounting scrutiny over military strikes on boats off Venezuela’s coast.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/lumbee-tribe-federal-recognition-north-carolina-02f830be3228c7ee4a21deecf040451d","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/0960d49/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3500x2333+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fcf%2Fa3%2F94b17099d35cf7364a6457e2c390%2Ff4157793ce2241d3a0d4374975156c8a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 21:45:38","author":"Graham Lee Brewer","authors":["Graham Lee Brewer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":386627146,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: Dem-appointed education officials face new scrutiny as fraud scandal widens","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.

Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a member of the Armed Services Committee and a key advocate of the IVF provision. “Well, he proved he’s a deadbeat dad by not only failing to make IVF free for anyone, but standing by as Speaker Johnson undermined one of his key campaign promises and stripped coverage from service members behind closed doors that both the House and Senate approved.”\n\n“Shame on them,” Duckworth added.\n\nAs MS NOW first reported last week, Johnson was working to keep the IVF language — which would have expanded TRICARE, the insurance plan for service members and their families, to cover IVF services for all enrollees — out of the compromise bill. (Currently, TRICARE only covers fertility services for military members whose infertility was caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.”)\n\nThe co-chairs of the Congressional Reproductive Freedom Caucus — Reps. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. — said in a statement that, “Nothing could be truer to our American values than giving those who fight for our freedom the freedom to build their families on their terms.”\n\n“If IVF is truly a priority for this Republican President, he and the House Speaker must both answer for this glaring omission,” they said.\n\nRep. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., another member of the Armed Services Committee, placed the onus at the feet of congressional leaders who crafted the final version of the annual defense policy bill.\n\n“It’s frustrating and angering that the will of both houses has essentially been negated on that point and a number of others by a conference committee that seems unresponsive to the will of the majority,” Blumenthal told MS NOW.\n\nBut it’s not just Democrats who are frustrated that the IVF language was cut from the final bill. A wide range of GOP lawmakers said leaders were wrong to cut that provision.\n\n“I regret that. I wish they had put it in there,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said. “I support IVF. I think the American people support IVF. For the life of me, I don’t know why they didn’t include it in there. I think they made a mistake by not including it in there.”\n\nWhen asked about leaders cutting the IVF provision, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said it was “not the way that I would do it.” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said it was “unfortunate” the language wasn’t included. And Rep. Mike Lawler of New York — one of three House Republicans representing districts Vice President Kamala Harris won in 2024 — told MS NOW that he was “disappointed” the IVF provision didn’t survive in the final bill.\n\n“It’s something I campaigned on, and President Trump did as well, and I appreciate the work he’s already done to push this issue forward,” Lawler said. “We owe it to our service members and their families to follow through on that commitment.”\n\nThe bipartisan frustrations broke out on Sunday after congressional leaders unveiled the 3,086-page annual defense policy bill. The sprawling legislation authorizes $890 billion for the Pentagon, National Nuclear Security Administration and related agencies, and includes a 4% pay raise for enlisted service members.\n\nBut notably missing from the bill was the language that would mandate TRICARE, the insurance policy for service members and their families, to cover IVF. \n\nDuckworth told MS NOW last week that Johnson was “single-handedly working behind closed doors — and against the President’s promise — to rip this provision away from our heroes and their families.” In the past, Johnson has expressed support for IVF, but has expressed concerns about the disposal of unused embryos.\n\nA spokeswoman for the speaker told MS NOW last week that Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill “have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF.”\n\n“The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” the spokeswoman said.\n\nAsked about the exclusion of the provision on Monday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the IVF language “was one of the many issues at the end that were — there was a disagreement about, and ultimately didn’t land.”\n\n“It’s not the only thing. There were other provisions that didn't make it in either,” Thune said. “So those will all, I'm sure, fight another day and we'll litigate it over again.”\n\nAdvocates for military families also said they were disappointed by the outcome.\n\n“Failing to include this provision is failing our military,” Julie Eshelman, founder and president of the Building Military Families Network, told MS NOW. \n\n“This was something that both houses of Congress passed, and we know was something that was very much wanted from military families, and for it to come out at the last minute is mystifying and frustrating and really does a disservice for military families who were counting on this coverage,” said Eileen Huck, director of government relations at the National Military Family Association. \n\nEllen Gustafson, founder of Military Family Building Coalition, who said she and her husband spend thousands of dollars on IVF since they didn’t have coverage under TRICARE, said she hoped Trump would take further action to expand access to IVF as promised. \n\nIn October, Trump announced both a cost-cutting deal for a critical IVF drug and a voluntary fertility benefit employers could offer. The proposals, however, fall short of a promise he made frequently on the campaign trail: to make IVF free by forcing the government or insurance companies to pay for it. \n\n“The president put out an executive order, and quite frankly they didn’t follow his lead on that,” Gustafson said of congressional Republicans. “This is something where we’re going to need his further leadership in order to make this happen during his presidency.” \n\nSpokespeople for the White House did not respond to MS NOW’s repeated requests for comment. \n\nA spokesperson for the Pentagon declined to comment. “As a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing legislation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nDespite the bipartisan frustrations, the NDAA is still expected to sail through Congress, as it’s done for more than six decades. A handful of lawmakers told MS NOW that despite their qualms with the IVF provision, they will vote in favor of the bill.\n\n“I’m going to keep pressing to get IVF expansion done, and I’m also going to make sure our military has the resources it needs to keep Americans safe,” Lawler said.\n\nRep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he would support the bill despite his disappointment that the IVF provision was left on the cutting room floor.\n\n“I am disappointed these items were excluded from the final text,” Smith said in a statement, “and will keep working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advocate for them going forward.”\n\nKevin Frey contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/lawmakers-cutting-ivf-coverage-ndaa-pentagon-policy-bill","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765312222/251209-mike-johnson-es/251209-mike-johnson-es.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 20:49:49","author":"Julianne McShane,Mychael Schnell","authors":["Julianne McShane","Mychael Schnell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.55},{"id":386644614,"title":"Democratic Leaders’ Cowardice Helped Pave Way for Trump. Can the Party Change?","text":"The most important resistance to the Trump regime this year has come from grassroots activism. While millions have rallied and continually demanded strong opposition to fascistic policies, congressional Democrats have lagged far behind. Nowhere has the gap been more evident than in the Senate, where Chuck Schumer remains the minority leader despite his obvious failures to meet the historic moment.\n\nDemocratic members of the Senate have continued with a tradition of deferring to leadership that is ineffectual against extreme right-wing Republicans. Signs of a possible departure seemed to come late last month, when eight Democratic senators formed a “Fight Club” with the avowed purpose of pushing Schumer to find a spine. But even now, not a single senator has called for Schumer to step aside. This is all part of a longstanding pattern that made President Trump possible in the first place.\n\nTen years after Donald Trump first ran for president, he stands at the helm of a country that — like the Titanic — is swiftly sinking into authoritarian chaos, despite various veneers of normality. How did this happen?\n\nNo factors were more pivotal in this sequence than the outlooks and actions of the Democratic Party leadership. Scrutinizing them now is vital not only to have clarity about the past but also to move toward a clear focus on ways to prevent further catastrophe.\n\nHere’s a summary of actual history many corporate Democrats pretend didn’t happen:\n\n2016: Hillary Clinton offers more of the status quo. Her allies in the Democratic Party pull out all the stops so she can win the party’s presidential nomination. With a big assist from the Democratic National Committee, she prevails over the strong primary challenge from Bernie Sanders — but her campaign trail goes downhill from there. After rallying behind Sanders’s genuine progressive populism, many young people don’t trust the pseudo-populism of Clinton’s campaign. She has earned a millennial problem, and it prevents her from becoming president.\n\n2017: Democratic Party leaders can hardly blame themselves or their nominee for the virtually unbelievable circumstance of the Trump presidency. A critical focus on Clinton’s coziness with Wall Street won’t do. Neither will critiquing her thinly veiled contempt for the progressive wing of the party. But blaming Trump’s victory on Russia becomes an obsessive theme.\n\n2018: The Democratic leadership is mapping out a battle plan for the midterm elections in November. At the same time, a key priority is to thwart the inside threat posed by progressive forces. Establishment Democrats are keeping a watchful eye and political guns trained on Bernie Sanders.\n\n2019: Democrats take control of the House, and a large cast of political characters is off and running for the party’s presidential nomination. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren are at the left edge, while more than a dozen others jostle for media attention. For elites determined to retain undemocratic power, seeing either Sanders or Warren in the Oval Office would be the worst possible outcome.\n\n2020: Early in the year, the economic populism of the Sanders campaign continues to catch fire, while many forces team up to function as fire extinguishers. The Democratic Party establishment acts to smother the grassroots blaze. After Joe Biden’s fifth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary puts his campaign on life-support, rescue comes eighteen days later from South Carolina, where Biden wins a landslide primary victory — and then several corporate-friendly contenders quickly drop out of the race and effusively endorse him. When Biden clinches the nomination, progressives largely close ranks behind him to defeat Trump. Biden squeaks through.\n\n2021: President Biden’s first year includes backing and signing legislation with real benefits for tens of millions of Americans. But his resolve dissipates. Before the end of the year, he abandons Build Back Better legislation that would have been transformational. Notably, Biden withdraws all U.S. troops from Afghanistan in late summer — but overall he opts to fuel militarism, with ever-higher Pentagon spending instead of devoting adequate resources to meet human needs and protect nature. The president goes full speed ahead with “modernization” plans for nuclear weapons that already have a pre-overrun price tag of $1.7 trillion.\n\n2022: Biden relapses into his customary “moderate” political mode, while his capacity to speak coherently weakens. Party discipline, internalized by Democrats in Congress, precludes independent-minded leadership as they begin to proclaim that Biden should run for re-election. Conformity of groupthink and fear of retribution from the White House keep people quiet.\n\n2023: A real-life Shakespearean tragedy unfolds as Biden throws down a gauntlet to run for re-election even while his mental frailty becomes more evident. Enablers ignore the party’s base, with polls continuing to show that most Democrats don’t want him to be the next nominee (including 94 percent of Democrats under 30). A common canard — pushed by Biden’s coterie of sycophants — contends that because he defeated Trump once, he’s the best person to do it again; the claim ignores the fact that Trump 2020 represented an unpopular status quo, and Biden 2024 would represent an even more unpopular status quo, as “right track / wrong track” polling makes crystal clear. Soon after Hamas attacks Israel on October 7 and the Israeli military starts its siege of Gaza, Biden begins to further alienate many of his party’s usual voters by massively boosting U.S. military aid as the slaughter of Palestinian civilians escalates.\n\n2024: Among top Democrats, denial about Biden’s evident cognitive infirmity grows along with the infirmity itself. Even after Biden’s disastrous debate performance in late June, the political reflex of dissembling prevents him from bowing out for another 28 days. That leaves 107 days for the newly installed nominee Kamala Harris to pick up the pieces before Election Day. At first it seems that she might find ways to depart from coming across as Biden’s yes-woman, but there is no such departure. Nothing epitomizes the Harris campaign’s moral collapse more than her insistence on echoing the Biden line about Gaza while the U.S. continues to arm Israel’s military as it methodically kills Palestinian civilians. In the process, Harris chooses to ignore both human decency and polls showing that far more voters would be likely to cast their ballots for her if she were to come out against sending more armaments to Israel. Electoral disaster ensues.\n\nMeanwhile, last month, two events showed the huge contradiction between the potential for true progressive change and the dire reality of feckless Democratic Party leaders. When democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won New York City’s mayoral election after running as a Democrat, he said: “If there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump; it’s how we stop the next one.”\n\nA week later, eight members of the Senate’s Democratic caucus surrendered to Trump, betraying efforts to defend Obamacare and a health care status quo that still leaves tens of millions uninsured or underinsured. The capitulation meant that the nation’s health care crisis will get even worse.\n\nCraven and conformist Democratic Party leadership — coloring inside corporate lines while enmeshed with rich backers — hardly offers a plausible way to defeat the Trump forces, much less advance a humane political agenda. Saving the country from autocracy requires recognizing and overcoming the chokehold that Democratic leaders have on the party.\n\nReal history tells us how we got here — and offers crucial guidance for how to prevent more calamities.","summary":"Saving the US from autocracy means recognizing and overcoming the chokehold that Democratic leaders have on the party.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/democratic-leaders-cowardice-helped-pave-way-for-trump-can-the-party-change/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2170635666-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 20:34:57","author":"Norman Solomon","authors":["Norman Solomon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":386615856,"title":"‘I am a historic figure’: Kamala Harris flaunts while looking ahead to 2028","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she doesn’t “feel burdened” about her political standing as the Democratic Party debates its direction ahead of 2028.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times released Tuesday, Harris noted that she is now free from what she characterized as the “transactional” result of campaigning, including asking Americans for their vote. Her recent efforts have instead been focused on promoting “107 Days,” her memoir detailing her eleventh-hour entrance and defeat to President Donald Trump in the 2024 race.\n\n“I understand the focus on ’28 and all that,” Harris told the outlet. \n\n“But there will be a marble bust of me in Congress,” she continued, appearing to reference the Senate’s collection honoring past vice presidents. “I am a historic figure like any vice president of the United States ever was.”\n\nWhile previously describing her current mentality as “f--- it,” Harris said she is living out her “freedom tour.”\n\n“This sounds really corny,” Harris said in comments before one of the final stops of her book tour last month. “But we have to stand for the people. And I know that that sounds corny. I know that. But I mean it. I mean it.” \n\nShe pointed to how “thousands and thousands” of people are “coming to hear my voice” on stops throughout her book tour, which spanned over a dozen cities and two countries — noting that “every place we’ve gone has been sold out.”\n\nHarris has generated headlines in recent months over the unexpected revelations in her book after it hit shelves in September. Throughout the more than 300-page memoir, she takes swipes at former President Joe Biden and prominent Democratic lawmakers, including former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, both of whom she considered as candidates for vice president before ultimately choosing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nWhile maintaining that she is “loyal” to Biden, Harris acknowledged that she “perhaps” should have told her former boss to reconsider running for reelection last year amid “all those months of growing panic.”\n\n“It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,” Harris wrote. “Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness.” \n\nThe former vice president went on to say she is “not going to talk about my conversations with him” when pressed by The New York Times.\n\nAt one point in the book, Harris also explained that Buttigieg was her first choice as a vice presidential contender, calling him as “an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man.” \n\n“But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man,” Harris wrote. “Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let’s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.\"\n\nThe former Biden official said he was “surprised” to learn about the snub in an interview with POLITICO in September.\n\n“My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories,” Buttigieg said.\n\nNow, Shapiro is firing back at Harris over her insistence that “he would want to be in the room for every decision.” \n\n“That’s complete and utter bulls---,” Shapiro told The Atlantic earlier this month.\n\n“I can tell you that her accounts are just blatant lies,” he added, later accusing her of “trying to sell books and cover her a--.”\n\nShapiro stood by his words during an interview on MS NOW’s “The Weeknight” on Monday.\n\nStill, as questions swirl about her political future, Harris threw cold water on discussing whether she was ready to run for president again.\n\n“It’s three years from now,” Harris said with emphasis. “I mean, honestly.”","summary":"She still doesn't wanter to answer whether she will run for president again.","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/12/i-am-a-historic-figure-kamala-harris-flaunts-while-looking-ahead-to-2028.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/7JX5PBHXFBAZPK3NXVZ7SMY4TQ.jpg?auth=c7c6a218dba6609a49908b557fe839b051659a8ca19aa86874750bb22aae78af&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 20:20:08","author":"Rachel Cohen","authors":["Rachel Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.12},{"id":386628470,"title":"Kamala Harris: ‘There Will Be a Marble Bust of Me In Congress… I Am a Historic Figure’","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is looking forward to a marble bust of herself being put on display in the U.S. Capitol, brushing off concerns about 2028 to instead focus on her “historic figure” status, in an interview with the New York Times. \n\nSpeaking with the publication’s Shane Goldmacher, the 61-year-old failed presidential candidate was unwilling to talk about whether or not she is considering another attempt at the White House. \n\n“It’s three years from nooooow,” Harris pleaded in an interview with the Times conducted last month in Nashville, Tennessee. “I mean, honestly.”\n\nShe added, “I understand the focus on ’28 and all that.

Josh Shapiro defended his criticism of former Vice President Kamala Harris after he said the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee spread “blatant lies” about him in her new memoir about her campaign. \n\nIn a recent profile for The Atlantic, Shapiro called Harris’ recollection of their meetings, when he was in contention to become her running mate, “complete and utter bullshit.”\n\nDuring Monday’s interview, co-host Symone Sanders Townsend told Shapiro they would have to address “some of the elephants in the room.” She said the “political streets were on fire for a little bit” over the magazine piece, noting that the section about Harris was “raising some eyebrows.”\n\n“What were you trying to signal in that moment, sir?” the MS NOW host asked.\n\n“There’s no parsing,” Shapiro responded. “Look, I stand by what I said.”\n\nHe added that he had an issue with how the profile’s author, Tim Alberta, described his emotions during the questioning over Harris. Alberta wrote that Shapiro “moved between outrage and exasperation,” which the governor said wasn’t accurate.\n\n“But the words are mine, and I stand by them,” he said.\n\nShapiro also said that he did not believe Alberta accurately described the excerpts from Harris’ memoir, “107 Days,” and that he and the former vice president “had, and continue to have, very candid conversations.”\n\nSanders Townsend then pressed Shapiro, asking him whether he felt it “was important to correct the record” ahead of a possible presidential run in 2028, where he could face off against Harris in the Democratic primaries.\n\nShapiro said that was not his intention. “I was asked for my reaction to a statement that he said the vice president said that simply wasn’t true,” he said, adding that he thought it was “important to note that was before the book actually came out, and it was represented to me through that author.”\n\nThe Pennsylvania Democrat said the focus on his comments about Harris serves as a distraction from the actions of President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\n“Here’s the thing, I’ve got respect for the former vice president, and I think we do everyone a disservice when we focus on looking backwards instead of looking forwards in terms of what we’re dealing with every day with the Trump administration making people’s lives more difficult,” he said.\n\n“I’m choosing to fight the battles today against the Trump administration and look forward in ways that hopefully can lift people up, make people’s lives better.

Not even a crushing defeat in the 2024 presidential election—which featured a defeat in the popular vote, a squashing in the electoral vote, and a clean sweep loss of the seven swing states—is going to dampen her spirits.\n\nThe New York Times gave the former vice president a glowing tribute by way of an interview in which Harris is only increasing speculation of another run at the White House by declaring she \"isn't ready to be written off\" just yet.\n\nMore on that in a minute. What is truly remarkable here is that despite the aforementioned embarrassing loss (even as she usurped Joe Biden without so much as a single primary vote backing her, and a fully-armed media apparatus serving as an arm of the DNC to take down President Trump), Kamala has an incredibly inflated sense of self-worth on the historical and political scenes.\n\n\"Her place in history is already secure, and she knows it,\" the Times writes.\n\nThat becomes quite clear through Kamala's own words, in which she notes that while everybody is wondering what she'll do in 2028, she already recognizes herself as a \"historic figure.\"\n\n“I understand the focus on ’28 and all that,” she told the Times. “But there will be a marble bust of me in Congress.

Desperate for her to re-enter the fight. Hoping beyond hope to catch a glimpse or to hear just one tidbit of wisdom from her.\n\n“Thousands of people are coming to hear my voice. Thousands and thousands,” she bragged. “Every place we’ve gone has been sold out.”\n\nBut it's more than just what Harris sees on the book tour. It's more than just knowing she will be immortalized as a marble bust. The Times reports on several indicators that she is gearing up for another White House run.\n\nBehind the scenes, Ms. Harris has been re-engaging.Her team has formed a political action committee called Fight for the People, and she has reached a deal with the Democratic National Committee to pay roughly $7 million for her email list, two people briefed on the arrangement said. A first payment has been made. She plans to ramp up her political activity in 2026.\n\nAnd, according to the report, the former Veep has reached out to extremist Democrat politicians such as New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, and moderates alike. She's trying to reassert herself as the party's leader.\n\nPerhaps the most significant indicator yet of a planned run is Kamala's insistence that her loss to Trump in the previous contest was due to a lack of time to run her campaign. An argument she makes in the very title of her book, \"107 Days.\"\n\nWhen asked what she would tell herself on day one of her soft coup over Biden, the response was, \"Get more days.\"\n\nThe assumption is that voter turnout was down for Kamala because she didn't have enough time to make her case to the American people. That theory, of course, that she would have won if only there were a better turnout, has been debunked by David Shor, a Democrat data scientist and political consultant renowned for analyzing political polls.\n\n\"For a long time, Democrats have said, and it’s been true, that if everyone votes, we win, and that higher turnout is good for Democrats. But this is the first cycle where that definitively became the opposite,\" Shor said. \"If everyone had voted, Trump would have won the popular vote by nearly five points.\"\n\nThat's what she believes. The American people rejected her because they didn't see her enough.\n\nHarris and her perpetual word salads and cringey cackles weren't inspiring anyone—especially younger voters. And if polls are to be believed now, that hasn't changed much.\n\nThe Yale Youth Poll, just released, shows that in a hypothetical 2028 presidential primary, Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14) is beating Harris by double digits across the board among voters aged 18 to 35. Overall, California Gov.

Jasmine Crockett (TX-30) just announced her run for the Democratic Senate nomination in Texas. \n\nNow, I'm not going to assume that she's going to tank big time. As we saw with the New York City mayoral race, there appears to be no low that Democrats won't vote for. But this is Texas. \n\nCrockett first has to face Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, and that in itself may be tough. Talarico has already been off to the races, demonizing Elon Musk and saying trillionaires should be taxed out of existence. Either choice isn't likely to play all that well in Texas. \n\nREAD MORE: New: Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett Officially Launches U.S. Senate Bid\n\nTX Dem’s Take on Taxing Elon Musk Shows Just How Radical They’ve Become\n\nAs we also noted, her announcement video wasn't focused on the things she would do for Texas; it was focused on herself, with President Donald Trump's words calling her \"low IQ.\" \n\nSo what in that video is going to convince people to vote for her in a state that went to Trump in 2024 by almost 14 points? She's taking the same tack as Kamala Harris, \"Trump bad, vote for me.\" And how did that work out?\n\nIt got worse at her announcement event, with a rap performance by Cameron McCloud. It was bizarrely bad, including the line, \"I can't wrap my head around someone who votes Republican,\" and then trying to drop an Epstein smear. \n\nI'm sure insulting Republicans in a Republican state with a bad rap is going to go over well. Did he forget the words in the middle of that? \n\nCrockett's demonstrating that she's just not serious when she does things like this. And, of course, reminding everyone that she tried to smear Republicans for receiving donations from \"a Jeffrey Epstein\" — just not the disgraced sex offender financier — simply showed her to have no credibility at all. \n\nREAD MORE: New: Zeldin Levels Crockett After She Digs Epstein Hole Even Deeper\n\nTHE ESSEX FILES: Democrats' Senate Shuffle in Texas Signals Deeper Troubles\n\nTo top that off, Crockett then told CNN host Laura Coates that she didn't need to convince all Republicans/Trump supporters to flip.\n\n\"Our goal is to definitely talk to people. No, we don't, we don't need to. Our goal is to make sure that we can engage people that historically have not been talked to, because there's so many people that get ignored, specifically in the state of Texas. Listen, the state of Texas is 61% people of color. We have a lot of good folks that we can talk to,\" the lawmaker said.\n\nWell, that's a tactic, appearing to blow off Trump voters in Texas. Maybe that explains why she doesn't care about insulting them. That should go over well, as she searches for the folks she thinks don't normally turn out to vote.

As his National Security Strategy makes clear, the United States wants to help Europe recover its strength and civilizational vitality, and is unwilling to enable its suicide. \n\nWhatever you think of the National Security Strategy and/or Trump's well-deserved criticism of European leaders, POLITICO quite rightly points out that Trump is the most influential person on European matters today. \n\n🚨Just in: Politico has named President Trump as “The most powerful person in Europe.” pic.twitter.com/YbkmqpZybZ— The Calvin Coolidge Project (@TheCalvinCooli1) December 9, 2025\n\nAs well he should be. Europe depends utterly on the United States, despite having a deep well of talent and a population one-third higher than that of the United States. It is weak, self-destructive, culturally and economically sclerotic, and is a superpower in only one thing: stifling regulation. \n\nThis distinction is important to all of us at the publication, but in a 45-minute interview at the White House Monday, the man being recognized this year—President Donald Trump—made clear that it scarcely matters to him.He told interviewer Dasha Burns, our White House bureau chief, that he agreed to sit with a publication he sometimes regards skeptically because our news judgment overlapped with his self-conception: The most important European policymaker for the first time in a decade is not a European and, increasingly, doesn’t even much like the place anymore.Too much immigration, too much crime, too much aimless talk, too much weakness. These derogations were hardly one-offs. They came in a steady stream of criticism, insults, and warnings he portrayed as constructive advice designed to help “decaying” Europe forestall a fatal decline.\n\nSeems about right to me. Europe is a museum that is filling up with vandals who are intent on, quite literally, raping and pillaging their way through the continent. \n\nNo doubt liberals will call such language incendiary, but the fact is that by any measure, migrants from Islamic countries are committing sexual crimes at rates that often exceed 10x those of native-born Europeans, and their welfare systems are groaning under the weight of migrants who have no interest nor incentive to contribute. \n\nWhen they tell you who they are, believe them. pic.twitter.com/iNBsVBNG4Y— Defiant L’s (@DefiantLs) November 21, 2025\n\nThe migrants make no secret of their intent to replace Europeans and European culture with their own. They literally take to the streets to declare it, while European leaders cower and jail their own citizens for complaining about it. \n\nPresident Trump has boldly declared that if Europe continues down this path, the continent can count us out. \n\nTrump is the most powerful person in Europe because Europe cannot succeed without us, either economically or militarily. Europe does not have the means to defend itself, and couldn't even mobilize without US logistics support. The British Navy is hollow, Germany cannot get its fighter aircraft into the air, and when France and the UK considered a peacekeeping force of 10,000 troops COMBINED they concluded they couldn't muster the men or materiel to deploy it. \n\nThe US provides about 100,000 troops stationed in Europe, and these countries are more than happy to host them because they would be defenseless without them. The US has 75% of the world's tanker aircraft, and no European country has a single strategic bomber. They have only days worth of weapons should they need them, and German troops have trained with broomsticks. \n\nAnd they want to set NATO policy? Regulate US companies as their own economies shrink? Set immigration policies as their own populations begin to revolt against an invasion from the Middle East?\n\nEuropeans are upset that Trump is giving them tough love. So be it. They are behaving like spoiled Gen Z influencers who want affirmation of their self-delusions, and destroying their continent in order to virtue signal. \n\nPresident Donald Trump denounced Europe as a “decaying” group of nations led by “weak” people in an interview with POLITICO, belittling the traditional U.S. allies for failing to control migration and end the Russia-Ukraine war, and signaling that he would endorse European political candidates aligned with his own vision for the continent.The broadside attack against European political leadership represents the president’s most virulent denunciation to date of these Western democracies, threatening a decisive rupture with countries like France and Germany that already have deeply strained relations with the Trump administration.“I think they’re weak,” Trump said of Europe’s political leaders. “But I also think that they want to be so politically correct.”“I think they don’t know what to do,” he added. “Europe doesn’t know what to do.”\n\nAnd, like spoiled chidlren, they are screaming that they hate their parents and are thinking of running away. Only they will have to wait until they can get a job, afford an apartment and a car, and finish their college educations. Until then, they will live off their parents while complaining that they are mean. \n\nA German and French \"decisive break\" with the United States? I suppose they could, but like a runaway child who is addicted to heroin and unable to make a living, they would wind up on the streets begging for alms. They know that, so they will bitch, and their advocates in the transnational elite will instead try to wait Trump out. \n\nIn recent days, European capitals have shuddered with dismay at the release of Trump’s new National Security Strategy, a highly provocative manifesto that cast the Trump administration in opposition to the mainstream European political establishment and vowed to “cultivate resistance” to the European status quo on immigration and other politically volatile issues.In the interview, Trump amplified that worldview, describing cities like London and Paris as creaking under the burden of migration from the Middle East and Africa. Without a change in border policy, Trump said, some European states “will not be viable countries any longer.”Using highly incendiary language, Trump singled out London’s left-wing mayor, Sadiq Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants and the city’s first Muslim mayor, as a “disaster” and blamed his election on immigration: “He gets elected because so many people have come in. They vote for him now.”The president of the European Council, António Costa, on Monday rebuked the Trump administration for the national security document and urged the White House to respect Europe’s sovereignty and right to self-government.“Allies do not threaten to interfere in the democratic life or the domestic political choices of these allies,” Costa said. “They respect them.”\n\nWhat a joke. These countries tried to censor Trump from speaking on X, threatening a 6% fine on Elon Musk's businesses' worldwide revenue for allowing Trump to be interviewed by Elon Musk. The Labour government sent 100 campaign workers to help Kamala Harris, and almost all these countries expressed contempt for Trump during the campaign. \n\nNot to mention that the United States isn't just an \"ally,\" but the patron of these European countries, which are incapable of standing on their own. They want our money, but not our influence. \n\nTrump is absolutely right to say \"No.\" If Europe wants no interference from the US, they should quit demanding we pay for their defense, and hence their failing welfare states. \n\nIf Trump weren't right in his analysis, he wouldn't be the most influential person in Europe. If these were viable countries, they wouldn't be dependent on us. \n\nEurope's populations and opposition politicians, who are now more popular than the ruling parties, are in agreement with Trump, even if they wish he were more diplomatic in saying what he does. Nigel Farage is far more popular than any other British politician, AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and the Nordic countries are following his advice if not applauding his words. \n\nTrump is committing the ultimate sin, which is telling the truth. If Europe doesn't like him being the most influential man on their continent, then they should man up and get their houses in order. They can only reject him if they can stand on their own. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

And he was right.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister, referred to Trump as \"daddy\" during the alliance's annual summit in June.\n\n'Hey Daddy:' White House seizes on Mark Rutte’s NATO comment with Trump, posts Usher song on social\n\nBut Trump's own administration has also called him as \"daddy\" in recent months, raising questions about the origins of the president's nickname.\n\n'Daddy's home'\n\nAt the NATO summit in June, Trump said that both Iran and Israel had been fighting \"so long and so hard that they don't know what the (expletive) they're doing,\" a profanity-laced statement that garnered international press attention.\n\nRutte later told Reuters that he used the term \"daddy\" to describe how some allies view the United States, rather than about Trump specifically.\n\n\"In Europe, I hear sometimes countries saying, 'Hey, Mark, will the U.S. stay with us?' And I said that sounds a little bit like a small child asking his daddy, 'Hey, are you still staying with the family?'\" Rutte said.\n\nDonald Trump's colorful week, from Marjorie to Mamdani, ends with new look\n\nThe White House then produced a now-deleted sizzle reel of Trump's visit to The Hague set to the song \"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\" by Usher. The song is frequently used on social media, especially the video platform TikTok, often as the background of sexually suggestive videos of men.\n\nTrump, asked by a reporter if he sees his NATO allies as his \"children,\" said that \"I think (Rutte) likes me. If he doesn't, I'll let you know. I'll come back and I'll hit him hard, OK? He did it very affectionately, 'Daddy, you're my Daddy.'\"\n\nThe \"dad\" label also derives from before Trump was reelected president. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, now a conservative podcasting star, spoke to a crowd at a Trump rally one week before last year's election using a metaphor that framed Trump as an upset father about to come home to give a \"vigorous spanking\" to his disobedient daughter.\n\n'Daddy's home' (again)\n\nThese included calling Democratic leadership a \"hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter,\" or even a toddler who is allowed to \"smear the contents of his diapers on the wall of your living room.\"\n\n\"When Dad gets home, you know what he says? 'You've been a bad girl, you've been a bad little girl, and you're getting a vigorous spanking right now,\" Carlson said during the odd remarks. \"I'm not going to lie. This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this. You’re getting a vigorous spanking because you’ve been a bad girl.\"\n\nTucker Carlson says Trump will give country 'spanking' if elected in November\n\nCarlson then suggested that if former Vice President Kamala Harris was to win the Nov. 5 contest, they should not accept the results. \"At the end of all of that, when they tell you they’ve won, no!\" Carlson said. \"You can look them straight in the face and say 'I'm sorry, Dad's home, and he’s p-----.'\"\n\nNow, nearly one year into his second term, Trump is president again, and families across the country will soon open presents on Christmas morning. Team Trump is back to using the term \"daddy.\"\n\nThe White House posted an illustration Dec. 3 on social media featuring the president with his thumbs up, a Santa Claus stocking cap on his head, in front of a snowy White House scene. \"Daddy's Home,\" the artwork said.

We want to make it more affordable. We want to make New York safer, and we want to make people in New York happy again,\" Blakeman said in an appearance on \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday morning, announcing his campaign.\n\nBlakeman was first elected as Nassau County Executive in 2021 after previously serving on the Hempstead Town Council and as a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nHe received some attention in recent years for signing a county law in 2024 banning using masks to hide one's identity, and a separate one that banned transgender people from participating in women's sports at places owned by the county.\n\nAny Republican candidate could face a steep challenge winning statewide in New York, which voted for Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris for president in 2024 by around 13 percentage points - although that marked a rightward shift from 2020, when then-Vice President Joe Biden won the state by around 20 percentage points.\n\nBlakeman, asked on Fox News if a Republican in New York has a chance to become governor, pointed to his success in winning in a county where Democrats outnumber Republicans as a sign of his appeal among \"crossover\" Democrats and among different groups. According to data from the New York State Board of Elections, Nassau County had around 70,000 more active registered Democratic voters than Republican voters as of Nov. 1.\n\nHis entrance into the race comes around a month after Stefanik, a close ally of Trump, announced her own run for governor and collected several endorsements, including from local county Republican groups and the chairman of the New York Republican Party. \n\nThe winner of the Republican primary could end up taking on incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is running for reelection and has made combatting Trump a major focus in recent months. Hochul faces her current lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado, in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. \n\nBernadette Breslin﻿, a spokesperson for Elise Stefanik's campaign, called Blakeman \"an early Christmas present\" for Hochul and said Blakeman is getting in the way of \"Republicans' best chance to win.\"\n\n\"Elise is the strongest candidate against Kathy Hochul by a long shot. Elise has outrun President Trump on the ballot by more than any Republican in New York State including Bruce,\" Breslin wrote. \"Elise has led the most effective attacks on the Worst Governor in America Kathy Hochul as Bruce Blakeman has worked overtime to torpedo fellow Republicans.\"\n\nTrump has a strong relationship with Stefanik but has not made an endorsement in the governor's race.\n\nAsked if he'd make an endorsement on Monday as reports about Blakeman's bid circulated, he told reporters, \"I'll think about it. But he's great. And she's great. They're both great people. We have a lot of great people in the Republican Party.\"\n\nBlakeman, asked about Trump's comments, downplayed any equivocation -- saying the president does not need to endorse for now -- while praising the president for his work on the economy.\n\n\"Well, I don't think the president has to make a decision now -- let's see how it plays out,\" he said.\n\n\"But let me tell you something, he's done more for America in the last 11 months than any president in my lifetime. He's done a great job with the economy.

Harris alleged in her book that Shapiro had asked her staff lots of questions, including \"how he might arrange to get Pennsylvania artists’ work on loan from the Smithsonian.\" She also accused him of wanting to be involved in every decision and said she reminded him, \"a vice president is not a co-president.\" When asked about it by The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta, Shapiro said, \"She wrote that in her book?

Elise Stefanik.\n\nBruce Blakeman, who has cast himself as a bulwark against the liberal policies of urban Democrats, criticized Gov. Kathy Hochul as a “failure\" in an appearance on Fox News.\n\n“I’m running for office to make people more prosperous, to make them safer and to make New Yorkers happy again,\" said Blakeman, a Nassau County executive.\n\nBlakeman’s candidacy kicks off what is expected to be a heated Republican contest against Stefanik, a conservative from northern New York who President Donald Trump picked to be his U.N. ambassador, only to withdraw the nomination over concerns that the slim GOP majority couldn't afford to lose any more House seats.\n\nTrump has — so far — avoided taking sides, telling reporters this week “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.\"\n\nStefanik's campaign assailed Blakeman as a weak candidate who has a record of “supporting corrupt Far Left Democrats.” \n\nIts statement called him “an early Christmas present to Kathy Hochul as he works to blow Republicans’ best chance to win.”\n\nDemocrats enjoy a strong voter registration advantage in New York, but next year’s race for governor is expected to be one of the nation’s most watched contests. Hochul, a moderate Democrat, is facing a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.\n\nRegistered Democrats also outnumber Republicans in Nassau County, where 1.4 million people live just east of New York City. But county voters narrowly favored Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.\n\nAs the county executive, Blakeman has pushed through a policy that bans transgender athletes from using county sports facilities, created a volunteer law enforcement unit that his critics have labeled a militia and directed county detectives to work alongside federal authorities in Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nNassau’s first Jewish county executive, he also signed a local ban on wearing face masks in public except for health or religious reasons, a measure that critics complain is aimed at cracking down on pro-Palestine demonstrations.\n\nBlakeman cruised to victory in his election to a second term in November. Previously, he served in the Hempstead Town Council and held an appointed post as the commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nBut bigger elective offices have eluded him. Hochul's campaign issued a statement saying Blakeman “has lost just about every race he’s touched — county legislator, comptroller, Congress, even U.S. Senate. There’s a reason: just like Donald Trump, he takes money out of New Yorkers’ pockets and squeezes working families at every turn.”\n\nBoth Blakeman and Stefanik now frame themselves as candidates who could appeal to moderate Democrats as well as Republicans, even though both have adopted the brash political rhetoric of Trump, who remains unpopular in New York.\n\nThey've also drawn contrasts between themselves and Zohran Mamdani, while simultaneously adopting some of the New York City mayor-elect's messaging around affordability as a campaign issue.\n\nFormer Gov. George Pataki was the state’s last Republican governor, leaving office about two decades ago.","summary":"As a county executive, he pushed through a policy that bans transgender athletes from using county sports facilities","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bruce-blakeman-governor-race-elise-stefanik-new-york-b2881192.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/09/17/05/AP25342826736361.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 17:56:41","author":"Anthony Izaguirre","authors":["Anthony Izaguirre"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.218},{"id":386590440,"title":"Kamala Harris declares herself a 'historic' figure: 'There will be a marble bust of me'","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris declared herself to be a \"historic figure\" on Tuesday and touted that there will be a marble bust of her constructed in Congress.

They are stuck in the past with outdated assumptions about the electorate and as a result continue to operate from an old playbook.\n\nA feature article in last week’s Washington Post— “Ones to Watch as the 2026 Midterm Races Kick Into Gear”— provides the best evidence of just how out of touch the analysts are. The piece featured six races Post writers deemed worth watching next year.\n\nOne of the highlighted races was Arab American Dr. Abdul El-Sayed’s bid for the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat from Michigan. After describing El-Sayed’s “unapologetic progressivism”— that is, he supports Medicare-for-all and raising taxes on billionaires, and has been endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders— the author delivers this blow:\n\n“His views on foreign policy are perhaps his most controversial. He has called Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide and favors cutting off military aid to the Jewish state.”\n\nWhat indicts the author as “out of touch” with today’s political realities is the assertion that accusing Israel of genocide or calling for cutting military aid to Israel are controversial policy proposals. This might have been true a few years back, but Israel’s war on Palestinians has taken a toll, both on that state’s favorable ratings with US voters and on the policies these voters want their government to take to rein in Israeli behaviors.  This is especially true among Democrats— the voters El-Sayed will need to win in next year’s primary contest.\n\nA wide range of polls have established just how extensive the changes in attitudes are. The most recent and comprehensive of these polls of US public opinion was conducted by The Economist in August 2025. Here’s some of what they found:\n\n43 percent of voters favor decreasing military aid to Israel, with only 13 percent wanting to see an increase in such aid. Among Democrats the decrease/increase ratio is 58 percent to 4 percent. Among Independents, it’s the almost the same.\n\nIs Israel committing genocide? Among all voters, 44 percent say “yes” and 28 percent say “no.” Among Democrats the ratio is 68 percent “yes” and just 8 percent “no.” And among Independents it’s 45 percent to 19 percent.\nAs we get closer to the 2026 midterm elections, we can expect more candidates to publicly distance themselves from Israeli policies. We can also expect that pro-Israel groups will panic and up the ante by pouring tens of millions into defeating candidates who are critical of Israel. My sense is that this may backfire because in 2026 what will be controversial are Israeli policies and pro-Israel campaign contributions, not the opposite. The sooner the analysts, consultants, and media figure that out, the better our politics will be.\n\nOther polls show voters affirming that they are more likely to support candidates who advance such positions and less likely to vote for those who defend Israeli policies and want to maintain current levels of military aid to Israel.\n\nThe obvious conclusion one can draw from this data is that candidates who take positions like those supported by El-Sayed are not at all controversial. In fact, they are a part of the new American mainstream.\n\nAs if to provide further evidence of this shift, with less than a year before the midterm elections, it’s striking to note that more than two dozen congressional candidates have already declared their intent to reject PAC contributions from pro-Israel groups. This includes three sitting members of Congress, all of whom have previously been strong supporters of Israel and have, in previous elections, been the recipients of millions of dollars from pro-Israel sources, including PACs and dark money independent expenditures. One of these members of Congress recently spoke at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in which she termed Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide and announced her support for cutting US military arms to Israel.\n\nWhile these changes in attitudes toward Israel have been brewing for several years now, they were dramatically accelerated by Israel’s two-year-long assault on Palestinians in Gaza. While it was true that the horrors accompanying Hamas’ 2 October 2023 attack generated an initial flush of support for Israel, as the toll of Palestinian civilian casualties grew and the extent of Israel’s gratuitous mass devastation of Gaza became clear, support for Israel collapsed.\n\nThis was clearly in evidence in the 2024 presidential contest. Post-election analyses showed that Vice President Kamala Harris lost the backing of a wide range of Democratic and Independent voters because she refused to make a decisive break with President Biden’s support for Israel. Instead of listening to her own instincts and being more critical of Israeli practices and more vocal in support of Palestinian rights, she listened to the establishment political consultants who cautioned against “rocking the boat” on this “sensitive issue.”\n\nThe consultants, campaign operatives, and media analysts didn’t get the changes that were afoot then, and they still don’t get it now. They are caught in a time warp that views the US politics of the Middle East as if the last two years of Israel’s genocidal war hadn’t occurred. But they did happen and they have been transformative.\n\nIt used to be said that criticism of Israel was akin to touching the “third rail” in American politics—avoid it or get burned. In a way, it still is but in reverse. Support for Israel was once the issue sine qua non for candidates for Congress. Polls now show that voters are less likely to vote for candidates who refuse to criticize Israel or who take money from pro-Israel PACs.\n\nAs we get closer to the 2026 midterm elections, we can expect more candidates to publicly distance themselves from Israeli policies. We can also expect that pro-Israel groups will panic and up the ante by pouring tens of millions into defeating candidates who are critical of Israel. My sense is that this may backfire because in 2026 what will be controversial are Israeli policies and pro-Israel campaign contributions, not the opposite. The sooner the analysts, consultants, and media figure that out, the better our politics will be.","summary":"WASHINGTON WATCH US voters’ attitudes towards the Israeli Palestinian conflict have changed, but media commentators and political consultants haven’t figured that out.

Elise Stefanik.\n\nBlakeman, who has cast himself as a bulwark against the liberal policies of urban Democrats, criticized Gov. Kathy Hochul as a “failure\" in an appearance on the Fox News “Fox and Friends” show.\n\n“I’m running for office to make people more prosperous, to make them safer and to make New Yorkers happy again,\" said Blakeman, the Nassau County executive.\n\nBlakeman’s candidacy kicks off what is expected to be a heated Republican contest against Stefanik, a conservative from northern New York who President Donald Trump picked to be his U.N. ambassador, only to withdraw the nomination over concerns that the slim GOP majority couldn't afford to lose any more House seats.\n\nTrump has — so far — avoided taking sides, telling reporters this week “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.\"\n\nStefanik's campaign assailed Blakeman as a weak candidate who has a record of “supporting corrupt Far Left Democrats.” Its statement called him “an early Christmas present to Kathy Hochul as he works to blow Republicans’ best chance to win.”\n\nDemocrats enjoy a strong voter registration advantage in New York, but next year’s race for governor is expected to be one of the nation’s most watched contests. Hochul, a moderate Democrat, is facing a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.\n\nRegistered Democrats also outnumber Republicans in Nassau County, where 1.4 million people live just east of New York City. But county voters narrowly favored Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.\n\nAs the county executive, Blakeman has pushed through a policy that bans transgender athletes from using county sports facilities, created a volunteer law enforcement unit that his critics have labeled a militia and directed county detectives to work alongside federal authorities in Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nNassau’s first Jewish county executive, he also signed a local ban on wearing face masks in public except for health or religious reasons, a measure that critics complain is aimed at cracking down on pro-Palestine demonstrations.\n\nBlakeman cruised to victory in his election to a second term in November. Previously, he served in the Hempstead Town Council and held an appointed post as the commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\nBut bigger elective offices have eluded him. Hochul's campaign issued a statement saying Blakeman “has lost just about every race he’s touched — county legislator, comptroller, Congress, even U.S. Senate. There’s a reason: just like Donald Trump, he takes money out of New Yorkers’ pockets and squeezes working families at every turn.”\n\nBoth Blakeman and Stefanik now frame themselves as candidates who could appeal to moderate Democrats as well as Republicans, even though both have adopted the brash political rhetoric of Trump, who remains unpopular in New York.\n\nThey've also drawn contrasts between themselves and Zohran Mamdani, while simultaneously adopting some of the New York City mayor-elect's messaging around affordability as a campaign issue.\n\nFormer Gov. George Pataki was the state’s last Republican governor, leaving office about two decades ago.\n\nAnthony Izaguirre And Philip Marcelo, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/world-news/long-islands-bruce-blakeman-is-running-for-governor-will-challenge-stefanik-in-republican-primary-11598377","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/12/5104198634ccb16495970d60ec210e8800e1479c02dbfcd74738068dbb71e0a1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 16:51:57","author":"Anthony Izaguirre And","authors":["Anthony Izaguirre And"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.232}]}
