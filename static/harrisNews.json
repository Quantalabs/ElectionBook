Pakman said, \"the Democratic Party doesn’t really seem to get new media and independent media,\" noting that they continue to favor traditional approaches like Sunday shows and overly sanitized interviews. \"One of the things that we learned during the 2024 election was that the Democratic Party doesn’t really seem to get new media and independent media, and they continue to do the kind of stale thing of the Sunday shows that very few people watch, and buttoned up interviews — trying to be as least-controversial as possible, occasionally dropping in a swear word or whatever, to try to be a little more provocative and relatable. And it’s all pretty disingenuous,\" he said on \"David Pakman Show.\" YOUTUBE STAR WARNS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF NEW MEDIA POSES TO PRESS LEGITIMACY He expressed optimism that following the 2024 defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris, the party would embrace podcasts and digital platforms—but said he was ultimately disappointed. Pakman shared a telling incident involving an unnamed Democratic politician he once had a relationship with. When he invited them onto his show, their team referred him to a generic \"info@\" email address—something he described as a \"black hole\" that signals disinterest. He warned that such dismissiveness could drive independent media supporters toward challengers. \"Shuffling me off to an ‘Info at email,’ which goes into a black hole, it’s just where all of the crap goes — I know we will never, ever, ever hear [back],\" he said. \"And this is the fundamental problem. That sort of way of dealing with independent media is how all of us will end up going, ‘Screw this elected official. Let’s endorse the challenger. Let’s fundraise for the challenger.’ This is exactly the problem that we are talking about.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Highlighting exceptions, Pakman praised California Governor Gavin Newsom, saying, \"he gets it,\" attributing this to the efforts of Newsom and his staff, who understand how to generate public interest and inspire engagement. \"There are exceptions. I mean, most recently we had Gavin Newsom on. I think he gets it. And part of it is Gavin Newsom himself,\" he said. \"Part of it is his staff, which really gets it and understands how you generate interest and inspire people.\" Pakman warned that unless Democrats adapt to the current media environment, they will face a difficult path heading into the 2026 midterms.

Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the covid-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.\n\nInitially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.\n\nBut after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.\n\nIn blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.\n\nThe divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.\n\nIn an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”\n\nThe money in question wasn’t spent solely on covid-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.\n\nRelated | Slashed federal funding cancels vaccine clinics amid measles surge\n\n“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nThe Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.\n\nAfter its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.\n\nColorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn't sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.\n\nIn Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.\n\n“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.\n\nAt one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.\n\nMarsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.\n\n“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they're cared for, that they're worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they're not treated that way.”\n\nSasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.\n\nRadabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.\n\nAston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nFederal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.\n\nThe Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.\n\nShe also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.\n\n“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”\n\nColumbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.\n\nColumbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.\n\nAs of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.\n\nJoe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.\n\n“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.”\n\nKen Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.\n\nSome of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.\n\nBrent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.\n\nThe association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.\n\n“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.\n\nMethodology\n\nKFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.\n\nOur primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.\n\nTo classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.\n\nThis analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.","summary":"By Henry Larweh and Rachana Pradhan and Rae Ellen Bichell for KFF Health News\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis.

I’ve continued to speak up and I will continue to speak up,” he said before adding, “There are so many other ways that we can invest on our cities and provide resources to our communities that will be more edifying for our communities than having a bunch of cops in the streets.”\n\nOne has to wonder if Legend and his fellow leftists had all sorts of ways to “invest” to make communities safer, why was that never done forcing Trump to act to protect the citizens.\n\n@mrtommymcfly “The troops in DC, I have some things to say about that.” EGOT winner John Legend is on tour celebrating 20 years of his “Get Lifted” album, and he had a lot to say about the role that art can play in the current moment in D.C. The EGOT winner is no stranger to politics and Washington, and he shared his personal approach to advocacy and thoughts on National Guard soldiers being deployed to D.C. @NBC4 Washington ♬ original sound – MrTommyMcFly\n\nRegardless, Legend thinks that Trump is bringing “dark times” despite the fact that the president has put a halt to murders, car thefts, and robberies in the District of Columbia. Indeed, Trump has shown that black lives matter to him.\n\n“President Trump is sending us down a really dark authoritarian path with a lot of the things that he’s doing, and we’re going to look back on this time as one of the dark times in American history,” the singer exclaimed.\n\n“I think it’s on all of us, great artists that I look up to like Stevie Wonder, like Marvin Gaye, like Aretha Franklin, like Nina Simone, like Harry Belafonte, they all use their platforms to try to make the world better.

So, I’m going to continue to do that,” he piously concluded.\n\nLegend constantly urges other artists to use their fame to push far left-wing politics. During that past presidential election, for instance, he was thrilled when pop sensation Taylor Swift endorsed losing Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nBut not everyone has been appreciative of Legend’s political pronunciations. Last September, residents of Springfield, Ohio, blasted Legend for his desire to continue pushing Haitian immigrants on their community.

That’s the question that Trump haters have been asking as they’ve suddenly turned to armchair medical analysis – their latest great hope.\n\nIt all kicked off with some recent shots of the back of Trump’s hands covered in poorly blended women’s makeup, ostensibly covering some bruising. Social media has been rife with amateur sleuths manipulating the contrast on the images in an attempt to determine whether there are any signs of intravenous puncture that could perhaps be indicative of a serious medical condition – like heart failure. As supporting evidence, they also cite recent shots of his swollen ankles – or “cankles” – debating whether they’re expanding and contracting like an accordion, and if so, what that means for the number of days that he has left, both in power and in life.\n\nTikTok in particular has given rise to a whole new category of content called “hopecore,” with Trump haters citing medical or medical-adjacent experience in publishing content opining about how Trump’s days are numbered – although there’s usually much debate over exactly how many.\n\nThat uncertainty is a source of great frustration for commenters seeking certainty in nailing down the exact amount of time that they have to put up with him. Some even keep spreadsheets, charts, and countdown clocks like they’re managing fantasy football teams, except instead of touchdowns they’re tracking anatomical anomalies.\n\nThe White House has openly commented on Trump’s “chronic venous insufficiency,” which would explain the bruising and swelling. But even before that, back in June, his appearance at a UFC fighting event led to much zooming in on the crotch area of this 79-year-old man, with some speculating that he was wearing a catheter. Others argued that it was just something in his pocket. Some internet detectives even claimed it was a subtle Olympic-level flex that defies both anatomy and comprehension.\n\nWhy is this even a thing, though? I guess gossip and speculation makes politics accessible for those who prefer the entry bar to be at floor-level. Policy and issues are complex and require work, particularly when the objective is to eject someone from power. It’s much more fun to just place all hope in fate to do the heavy lifting for you. And to cheer it along on a daily basis with your like-minded tribe. Add a hashtag, a TikTok filter, and suddenly it’s an entire movement. One that doesn’t even require you to get off the couch to make you feel like you’re part of something big – like a child tugging an escalator handrail convinced they’re moving everyone to the top.\n\nGuess they’re now putting all their hope on the Grim Reaper to take Trump out. Assassins failed to do it with actual bullets. Impeachment didn’t stick. Not even his disqualification through the courts came through for them. The Grim Reaper is now effectively their candidate of choice, and they seem more psyched about him than they ever did about Kamala Harris or Joe Biden.\n\nGo figure that there’s a glaring overlap between these people and those who also glom onto every health-related tidbit about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Over the years, it’s been reported in Western publications that he’s suffered from strokes, Parkinson’s, “terminal” pancreatic cancer (over a decade ago), thyroid cancer, and leprosy. Again, basically a fantasy football roster of health crises, all projected onto one man.\n\nIt’s hardly a coincidence that many of those conjuring up death fantasies also happen to be proponents of regime change, including former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, former CIA officer Ralph Goff, Danish intelligence sources, Kremlin critic Valery Solovei, or former Ukrainian intelligence chief Kirill Budanov. All waiting for Mother Nature to spring into action like she’s on USAID payroll.\n\nWhen Putin and Trump were together in Alaska recently for Ukraine peace talks, it was a double whammy field day for the death pool watchers. They glommed onto Trump’s somewhat non-linear walk down the tarmac’s red carpet to greet Putin as “proof” of his ongoing decline. Then their radar went off again when Putin shifted his weight from one leg to the other while chatting with Trump. Evidence that he was about to collapse, surely! If not immediately, then imminently!\n\nIt’s a classic case of anxiety displacement. Instead of grappling with why a political leader has power or support, they funnel their unease into scrutinizing movements, coughs, or missed steps. The result is a culture of obsessive speculation where nothing is sacred – not posture, not hands, not ankles, and certainly not the crotch region.\n\nBut the more interesting question is why exactly do they feel the need to take refuge in this kind of nonsense? It represents a super low-effort power grab. Fate does the heavy lifting and clears the way for their preferred alternative over which they feel they have more control. There seems to be a lot of projection going on, though – the mistaken belief that what comes after would be more aligned with their interests. Or that the eradication of a particular leader through natural biological processes would somehow shift the tectonic plates of the political landscape. History shows that this is hardly ever the case. Just ask all the folks in Che Guevara or Martin Luther King t-shirts.\n\nTrumpism won’t end with Trump. Nor will the growing appetite for institutional reform of Washington. So then what’s the plan? To start all over again with a J.D. Vance death watch? At this point, someone should probably invent an app to track ankle swelling and gait analytics in real time. Because if you’re too lazy or inept to win, you can at least obsess over your opponent’s every micro-movement.","summary":"Assassins failed to take the Orange Man out. Impeachment didn’t stick.

Në fakt, ndihem shumë mirënjohës që bëra zgjedhjen që bëra përpara se gjërat të përkeqësoheshin edhe më shumë. U largova nga Egjipti për t’i shpëtuar persekutimit politik… Arsyeja pse u largova nga SHBA-ja është sepse fillova të njoh të njëjtat modele që po formoheshin rreth meje. Dhe që kur u largova, gjërat vetëm sa kanë shkuar për keq”, tha Abdelrahman ElGendy.\n\nNga Rusia në Turqi dhe nga Hungaria në El Salvador, aktivistët, vëzhguesit dhe shkencëtarët politikë kanë vëzhguar konsolidimin e shpejtë të pushtetit nga administrata Trump, ndërsa ajo ka ndjekur një model të njohur të shpërndarjes autokratike.\n\nUashingtoni ka gjetur një kauzë të përbashkët me disa nga regjimet më të ashpra autoritare në botë, siç janë Rusia dhe El Salvadori. Këtë javë, SHBA-të deportuan gati 50 rusë, përfshirë disa që ndoshta kërkuan azil politik në Shtetet e Bashkuara. Qindra emigrantë dhe madje edhe qytetarë janë deportuar në burgjet në El Salvador.\n\nDinamika e administratës Trump, ku fituesi i merr të gjitha, e cila ka pretenduar një mandat historik pavarësisht se ka fituar midis shumicës më të hollë në një brez, e ka bërë këtë një moment veçanërisht të tensionuar. Së bashku me marrjen e kontrollit federal të forcave policore, rreziku tjetër i përmendur zakonisht është përpjekja republikane për manipulimin e zgjedhjeve në Teksas dhe kundërsulmi që rezulton në Kaliforni, si dhe përpjekjet e tjera për të ulur pjesëmarrjen e votuesve përpara zgjedhjeve të mesmandatit të vitit 2026 dhe zgjedhjeve presidenciale të vitit 2028.\n\nDisa aktivistë këmbëngulin se nuk është tepër vonë për t’u kthyer pas. Stacey Abrams, ish-kandidatja për guvernator të Xhorxhias, dhe Kim Lane Scheppele, profesoreshë e sociologjisë dhe çështjeve ndërkombëtare në Universitetin e Princetonit, shkruan këtë javë se “Ne Mund ta Ndalojmë Ngritjen e Autokracisë Amerikane”.\n\nDuke përmendur Hungarinë dhe Venezuelën si shembuj, ata shkruan se “nuk mund të na mashtrojnë duke besuar se kjo është si çdo gjë që kemi parë më parë dhe për këtë arsye mund të zgjidhet thjesht duke pritur zgjedhjet e mesit të mandatit. Antidoti ndaj autokracisë amerikane të Trump është të kuptuarit e ashpërsisë së kërcënimit në fjalë”.\n\nPor të tjerë e shohin trendin drejt autoritarizmit thjesht si një përshpejtim të drejtimit të politikës amerikane edhe para Trumpit.\n\n“Kjo supozon se Shtetet e Bashkuara ishin një demokraci e shëndetshme funksionale që dështoi… dhe kjo nuk është e vërtetë sipas mendimit tim”, tha ElGendy.","summary":"Njerëzit që kanë përjetuar llojin e autoritarizmit që SHBA-të kanë përdorur për dënimet jashtë vendit, nxjerrin në pah shenja shqetësuese… Kur bëhet fjalë për ngritjen e autokracisë në Amerikë, prononcimi i famshëm i gjyqtarit Potter Stewart mbi pornografinë mund të jetë veçanërisht i përshtatshëm për momentin: “E njoh kur e shoh”.

Leo 1.0 had slammed Trump for cozying up to white supremacists, blamed him for a surge in violent attacks on Jews and donated to Democrats. Leo 2.0? He attacked “DEI nonsense,” compared Black Lives Matter to ISIS and declared the 2020 election was “stolen from President Trump and America!”\n\nIn January, Terrell was rewarded for his loyalty when President-elect Trump, praising him as a “highly respected civil rights attorney and political analyst” with an “incredibly successful career,” named him senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department. Terrell assumed his marquee role a month later: as head of the multiagency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n\nAs a Black, Christian former Democrat with little previous engagement with Jewish causes, Terrell, now 70, seemed an improbable pick to lead the effort to “root out anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses,” as the task force announcement put it. But his zealous conversion and penchant for media bombast made him a perfect bullhorn for the task force’s actual mission: to strong-arm colleges into stripping away any vestige of “wokeness” in their hiring, admissions, classes and research.\n\nIn service of that goal, the government has abandoned due process in favor of media warfare, preemptive declarations of guilt and freezes on billions in critical federal funding.\n\nTerrell has become an invaluable player in this extraordinary pressure campaign. Before most of the task force’s investigations had even launched, he publicly promised “massive lawsuits” against “Jew-hating” universities, including Harvard, the University of California, Los Angeles and dozens of others.\n\nSo far, the campaign has been effective. To preserve hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants and contracts, Columbia and Brown have struck deals with the administration that cost them $220 million and $50 million, respectively, and go far beyond pledging tougher action to combat antisemitism. Columbia agreed to open academic programs and admissions decisions to outside monitoring. Brown pledged to ban transgender women from single-sex spaces and women’s sports. Harvard has sued the administration to try to unfreeze $2.6 billion in federal research funds, but it’s also trying to negotiate a settlement. Meanwhile, colleges nationwide are eliminating any remaining vestiges of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and shuttering multicultural centers lest the government come after them.\n\nAmid the upheaval Trump’s task force has helped to sow, the history, motivations and behavior of its blustery leader have gone largely unexamined. ProPublica and The Chronicle of Higher Education interviewed dozens of people whose paths have intersected with Terrell’s and reviewed thousands of pages of court documents and financial records related to his career and life.\n\nThe portrait that emerged is dramatically at odds with Trump’s description of a “highly respected” and “incredibly successful” attorney. Peers in civil rights law said they always considered Terrell a minor player. Documents reveal a distinctly mixed legal track record, marred by malpractice suits, client disputes and mishandling a criminal case so badly that a federal appeals court lambasted his work as “woeful.”\n\nUntil his MAGA conversion, Terrell was beset by a litany of financial troubles, including nearly $400,000 in unpaid federal taxes, a personal bankruptcy filing and a trail of court judgments and liens brought by small businesses that worked for his law firm.\n\nCurrent and former lawyers at the Justice Department say Terrell is less engaged with assessing cases or negotiating settlements than he is with scaring universities into submission. They say he’s voiced open disdain for what he calls “lawyer talk,” berating career staff who try to follow proper procedures for investigating civil rights complaints.\n\nDespite his appetite for media attention, Terrell has volunteered little about himself. Friends and neighbors recall him walking a dog and bicycling and his fondness for golf. In the “about the author” section for a self-published book, he wrote: “In his spare time, Mr. Terrell likes to work. His hobbies are work and working.”\n\nTerrell declined an interview request for this story and did not respond to written questions. In a brief phone conversation with a reporter, he explained, “I don’t do interviews with my life.” Told some details of our reporting, he added, “I’m not going to comment on anything,” and, finally, “I’m going to hang up respectfully.”\n\nIt is unclear whether Terrell’s previous troubles turned up in administration vetting for his current job. Officials at the Justice Department and White House did not respond to questions about Terrell’s role or his background.\n\nJewish activists are divided on Terrell’s approach, with some lauding it for rooting out anti-Jewish sentiment that emerged on campuses during pro-Palestinian protests and others bemoaning how he’s weaponized antisemitism.\n\nKenneth Marcus, an Education Department official in the first Trump administration who has spent years agitating for stronger federal action against campus antisemitism, is a fan. “What the president has gotten in Terrell,” Marcus said, “is someone with unique skills in delivering public messaging.”\n\nThat messaging is camouflage, according to Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, a national network of Jewish groups. “No one should be under any illusion that this is about keeping Jewish students or faculty safe,” she said. “Gutting cancer and Alzheimer’s research does nothing to keep them safe.”\n\nTerrell grew up in Carson, in south Los Angeles County, the fourth of seven siblings. Law was his second career, following a decade as a history and economics teacher in the Los Angeles public schools. He graduated from UCLA School of Law in 1990 and opened his own civil rights firm in Beverly Hills.\n\nAlmost immediately, Terrell began making a name for himself as a media personality with a decidedly progressive voice, becoming better known for his TV and radio commentary than for his courtroom achievements.\n\nStarting in 1991, after the police beating of a Black man, Rodney King, Terrell became a regular on local and national TV and radio condemning police brutality and racial injustice. Three years later, he snagged his breakthrough commentating gig: as a friend and supporter of O.J. Simpson. Terrell’s role as a Simpson trial analyst produced a green-room friendship with Larry Elder, a conservative Black radio host in Los Angeles, who helped Terrell land his own talk show. “I thought he was smart, feisty, opinionated and entertaining,” Elder recalled. “I thought he would be good radio, despite my disagreement with virtually everything he stood for at the time.”\n\nTerrell became a prized guest on Fox News. He spoke fast and loud, uttered every view with absolute certainty and was quick to interrupt, shout and attack, accusing one guest of tailoring his views “to make a name for himself” and another of trying to “hustle people to make money.” Pressed during one “Hannity” interview to say on air whether Simpson was guilty of murder, Terrell ripped off his ear piece and stormed out of the studio.\n\nProminent Los Angeles lawyers said he was never a big player in the city’s civil rights community. Carl Douglas, part of the Simpson defense team, said “Leo was always a talker,” not “a baller.” Connie Rice, former western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Terrell “was never at the table for the big cases that made impact. He loved holding press conferences.”\n\nTerrell represented a Black teenager who’d been expelled from a Los Angeles high school for punching a white referee during a football game after the referee allegedly had directed racial epithets at him. He took up the cause of a mentally ill, homeless Black woman who’d been fatally shot by LA police after she wielded a 12-inch screwdriver at officers wanting to question whether she’d stolen a shopping cart. (No criminal charges were brought against the officers, but Terrell won a $975,000 settlement for her family.)\n\nNow scornful of “woke” practices and bias claims, Terrell once represented himself in a race-discrimination case against a parking company after a garage attendant refused to honor his free-parking validation from a shopping mall and told him he owed $10. A supervisor let Terrell leave without paying, but he still sued, saying he was singled out for being Black and demanding damages for “humiliation, mental anguish and severe emotional distress.” The suit was later settled for a confidential amount. Reached three decades later, an attorney for the parking company called Terrell’s lawsuit “absurd — the worst discrimination case I’ve ever seen.”\n\nTerrell always had side gigs: he self-published a book on workplace rights; he offered business consultations, corporate training seminars and mediations; he had a 900 number that charged $5 for the first minute and $2 for each additional minute for legal consultations.\n\nIn 2001, he ran unsuccessfully first for Congress, then two years later for Los Angeles City Council. He routinely promoted himself as “an NAACP attorney,” though the group said he’d never been employed there.\n\nWilliam Bloch, a veteran Los Angeles lawyer who brought two malpractice cases against Terrell, said Terrell acted as “the carnival barker” to attract business, then failed to do the necessary legal work. In one sex-discrimination case, according to the resulting malpractice suit brought by Bloch, Terrell accepted a settlement from the city of Beverly Hills for “a pittance” despite explicit instructions from his client, a female police officer, to zealously pursue her claim. Bloch persuaded an appeals court to undo the settlement. After the officer received a $100,000 award, plus money for attorney fees and costs, she dropped the case against Terrell. In the second matter, a jail employee for the city of Beverly Hills said she paid $6,000 to retain Terrell in 2009 after he “boasted of huge verdicts and settlements,” only to have him accept a $1,000 settlement from the city without her permission. According to her claim, Terrell conducted “little or no discovery, including taking no depositions.” The case was settled for a confidential amount, with no acknowledgement by Terrell of wrongdoing.\n\nIn court filings, Terrell denied any negligence or responsibility for harm to his clients, insisting they had approved all of his actions and saying lawyers are “not a guarantor of the results of any professional services.”\n\n“He’s a discredit to the legal profession,” Bloch said.\n\nA low point in Terrell’s legal career began in October 2009, when he was retained by the parents of Emond Logan, a 48-year-old California truck driver alleged to have transported more than a ton of cocaine to western Michigan as part of a multistate drug conspiracy.\n\nTerrell rarely took on criminal cases, but he’d played Little League baseball with Logan, whose family approached him after hearing his radio show. Terrell demanded a $100,000 retainer. To pay it, Logan’s father sold much of his stock from more than 30 years at Pacific Bell Telephone and borrowed money from his daughter.\n\nLogan faced overwhelming evidence: a leader of the drug gang had testified against him, and the arresting agents had seized five cars (including a Maserati), three Rolex watches and a $125,000 diamond ring, items well beyond his truck-driving income. His court-appointed lawyer had negotiated a plea agreement capping Logan’s prison time at 10 years.\n\nStill, Terrell urged Logan to blow up his “bullshit” deal, according to transcripts of their recorded jailhouse calls and Logan’s later testimony. Logan followed Terrell’s advice, despite prosecution warnings that such relatively generous terms would be off the table. Terrell arranged for Logan’s pretrial release on bond. Four months later, Logan was back in custody after a government informant taped him threatening to kill his federal prosecutor. Terrell then urged him to accept a new plea offer, with no cap, and Logan was sentenced to 35 years in prison.\n\nTerrell “didn’t do what he was supposed to do for the money,” Eugene Logan, Emond’s 93-year-old father, said in a telephone interview. “He told us he could get him off. If he’d taken the plea, he’d be out by now.”\n\nTwo courts denied Emond Logan’s attempts to get his sentence overturned based on Terrell’s counsel, but they excoriated Terrell’s lawyering. U.S. District Judge Paul Maloney wrote in a 2017 decision that Terrell had provided “abysmal advice.” A year later, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decried Terrell’s “woeful representation” and said his overall conduct reflected “poorly on the profession.”\n\nTerrell’s troubled legal practice left him with a worsening tangle of financial problems. Between 2004 and 2015, the IRS filed 11 liens against him for nearly $400,000 in unpaid taxes dating back to 1997. In October 2010, Terrell filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, reporting $736,938 in liabilities, $304,650 in assets and monthly income of just $4,000. Because he stopped appearing for required meetings, his bankruptcy case was dismissed and none of his obligations were legally erased. During this period, Terrell took out six new mortgage loans against his three-bedroom West LA condominium. The property was sold at foreclosure in 2013.\n\nLorita Seaton was one of Terrell’s many unpaid creditors. She’d loaned him $40,000 in 2008 after he said he needed it to help cover his costs for a pending discrimination suit against Costco. In exchange, Terrell had signed a promissory note committing to pay her $60,000 by year-end. By February 2009, court records show, Terrell had won $422,000 at trial for his client and an additional $510,818 in legal fees and costs. Yet Seaton said she never got a penny.\n\n“He had the audacity to tell me ‘there’s nothing you can do about it,’” she said in an interview. “I want to go stand on the mountain and just holler about this asshole.”\n\nBetween 2006 and 2014, more than a dozen small vendors for Terrell’s law firm went to court seeking to collect more than $170,000 in unpaid bills. A&B Reporting complained that it had prepared more than 30 deposition transcripts for Terrell, billing him more than $40,000 that remained unpaid. According to the company’s 2011 lawsuit, Terrell finally sent a $5,000 check — which bounced.\n\nIn February 2014, as his private financial straits worsened, Terrell formally updated his law office address: from the Beverly Hills tower where he’d worked for more than two decades to a “suite” on Santa Monica Boulevard, which was actually a mailbox at a UPS store. He has filed just a single case in federal court since that year, according to PACER, a public database of court filings and dockets.\n\nTerrell’s financial troubles factored into years of legal warfare among his siblings over their mother’s care and modest estate. In a court filing, Terrell’s younger brother Zachary accused him of borrowing repeatedly from their mother to save his “flailing” law practice and keep his home. Terrell acknowledged accepting a $30,000 gift from his mother after he’d done free legal work for her. The estate case finally ended in late 2021, but Terrell received little because he had already borrowed against his expected inheritance. (Deborah Terrell-Trimble was the only Terrell sibling to respond to our calls and emails for comment, but she declined to answer questions about her brother or the case, saying the family was “trying to heal.”)\n\nTerrell eventually paid off or settled some of his debts, but there’s no record of him paying the IRS or many of his other creditors, whose legal claims typically expire after 10 years in California unless they’re renewed.\n\nAccording to publicly filed liens, he still owed the IRS $92,000 at the beginning of 2024. Yet on the financial disclosure he filed for his Justice Department job, which covered that period, he listed his liabilities as “none.”\n\nNeither Terrell nor the Department of Justice responded to requests for comment about this omission.\n\nAmid the financial pressures at home and at work, Terrell underwent a startling political transformation. In 2019 Fox interviews, he had called Trump “a racial divider” and said he sent out “dog whistles” like “no president on this planet in our country’s history.” Less than a year later, he went all in for Trump. Fox News hired him as a paid contributor soon thereafter, at an annual salary of $250,000.\n\nIn interviews on Fox and other conservative outlets, Terrell offered two reasons for his ideological makeover. The first was the growing influence of the Black Lives Matter movement, which he complained had “hijacked” the Democratic Party, citing far-left calls to “defund the police.” He also objected to Joe Biden’s comment during an interview with a Black radio host that “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black,” calling it “offensive and insulting to every African American because we don’t vote as one group.”\n\nOver the next four years, Terrell displayed the fervor of the converted. Biden was an “idiot”; Kamala Harris (whose name he repeatedly mispronounced) was only chosen as his running mate “because she’s a woman and because of her race.” Democrats were members of the “anti-Israel” and “pro-Hamas party.” Far-right agitator Laura Loomer was “a journalist,” while NBC’s Kristen Welker was “a DEI hire.” In 2023, Terrell made a pilgrimage to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, where he posed poolside, making a thumbs-up gesture. Shortly before starting his Justice Department gig, Terrell made sure he was leaving no culture-war stone unturned. “I hate anti-Semitism! I hate attacks on Catholic Families! I hate attacks on parents expressing their First Amendment Rights at School Board Meetings! I hate Sanctuary Cities! I hate DEI! I hate Critical Race Theory!” he declared on X.\n\n“I love this guy,” Trump gushed, introducing “Leo 2.0” in February at a White House commemoration of Black History Month. “He was a radical Democrat, he became a radical Republican.” Terrell returned the love, telling the audience: “We are in the presence of the greatest president of all time!”\n\nWhat motivated him? Larry Elder, who was on air with Terrell as he announced his conversion and coined the nickname “Leo 2.0,” declined to speculate: “I really don’t care about why Leo did his 180. I’m just glad he finally did!”\n\nJuan Williams, the Fox News senior political analyst, however, called the change in Terrell’s views “performative.” He said Terrell saw an opportunity to cast himself as “coming out of the liberal matrix, and ‘now I’ve seen the light.’ He understood the value in that universe.”\n\nIf it is a performance, it’s one Terrell has continued at the Justice Department, where the effect of his pugnacious style and footloose approach to the law has alarmed career staff accustomed to following strict rules regarding regulatory due process.\n\n“That’s lawyer talk!” Terrell regularly thundered to Justice Department lawyers. “I don’t want to hear any lawyer talk!”\n\nIn the days after his Jan. 23 appointment, several said, Terrell emphatically rejected efforts by agency veterans to explain the legally required steps to bring civil rights complaints against universities.\n\n“Leo did not want to hear our views about how to investigate, how to find a violation, how to proceed in these cases,” said a Justice Department veteran who heard Terrell’s comments. “No ‘lawyer talk’ at the Justice Department! It was just incredibly bizarre.” The attorney was one of 10 current and former lawyers with the agency’s Civil Rights Division interviewed for this story, most of whom asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.\n\nAt another meeting early in his tenure, Terrell told career Justice Department attorneys he thought they were out to thwart his agenda, according to two attendees. “He immediately came in and openly told us that he did not trust any of us or believe anything we said,” one recalled.\n\nThe Justice Department antisemitism task force, which includes officials from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education and the General Services Administration, was announced on Feb. 3. It immediately announced antisemitism investigations of four medical schools regarding “offensive” pro-Palestinian “symbols and messaging” displayed by students during their 2024 commencement ceremonies. Then, over the next five weeks, the task force and Trump administration announced plans to investigate 10 universities; the “immediate” cancellation of hundreds of millions in federal funding for Columbia; an investigation of the entire University of California System; and “potential enforcement actions” against 60 colleges in 24 states.\n\nIt’s not clear whether Terrell had a hand in choosing the task force’s targets, but he took the lead in making the government’s case against them publicly.\n\nRelated | Here’s the terrible new way Trump plans to illegally harass universities\n\n“We are suing every one of these universities guilty of antisemitism,” Terrell told Fox News host Mark Levin on March 9. “We’re going to bankrupt these universities. We are going to take away every single federal dollar.” Antisemitism, shouted Terrell, waving his arms, “is rampant across the country!” Hate-crime charges, he vowed, would be brought against “these people who hate Jews.” Terrell blamed campus antisemitism on the MAGA movement’s usual suspects: “the Democrat Party” and “blue cities [that] have turned their back on Jewish Americans.”\n\n“The academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left,” he declared, “has been hijacked by the Marxists!”\n\nFour days later, the task force announced plans to meet with leaders of four cities “rocked” by campus antisemitism (New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago) to determine whether federal intervention was warranted.\n\nCareer civil rights officials, many of whom had served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, were horrified. The Justice Department didn’t publicly announce who it was investigating or planned to sue. It didn’t reach findings before it had found cause in a completed investigation that typically takes months or even years. And investigating Democratic leaders in “blue cities” in the name of fighting campus antisemitism was far outside the department’s charge.\n\n“The process is turned upside down,” said Ejaz Baluch, a senior trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division who left in May and is now a lecturer at Columbia Law School. “We were given a conclusion and told to find supporting evidence to justify it. It’s basically civil rights enforcement as a political tool. These things don’t actually solve antisemitism. It’s about silencing political dissent they disagree with.” Former civil rights deputy chief Jen Swedish, who worked at the Justice Department for 15 years, called the actions “cover for attacking higher ed.”\n\nBack in early February, a division-wide posting seeking attorneys to help staff the antisemitism task force had drawn just three volunteers. Harmeet Dhillon, Trump’s appointee as assistant attorney general for civil rights (and one of his former personal lawyers), later told a Federalist Society conference that this revealed the career staff’s lack of concern about antisemitism.\n\nCurrent and former division attorneys interviewed by ProPublica and The Chronicle said the lawyers had misgivings about the administration’s tactics and were reluctant to work with Terrell, who already had a reputation for berating staffers. One said he’d repeatedly yelled at her.\n\nA memorable episode came in March, when Terrell loudly berated a revered 82-year-old civil rights attorney, Franz Marshall, over the failure to quickly terminate federal oversight in a Louisiana school desegregation case, a goal of Republican state officials.\n\nRelated | Yes, Trump's trying to make America segregated again\n\nMarshall, who had represented the government in hundreds of desegregation cases over five decades, tried to explain that closing the case required a motion by the school district to lift the order, which the Justice Department could support or oppose, and review by a federal judge.\n\n“Who told you that you had to do it this way?” Terrell interrupted. “I want you to name names!”\n\n“This is the process,” Marshall assured him. “I’ve been doing this for a long time.”\n\n“Well, maybe you’ve been doing it for too long!” Terrell snapped. The tirade, which lasted nearly an hour, was audible to dozens of attorneys waiting outside the conference room for an upcoming meeting.\n\nMarshall (who could not be reached for comment) resigned a short time later, joining a wholesale exodus from resignations, firings and reassignments that has totaled about 70% of the Civil Rights Division’s 365 attorneys since January. The Louisiana consent decree was lifted on April 29.\n\nIn late April, Terrell had convened a meeting with some of the remaining lawyers to address concerns about working with him. “That crazy guy you see on TV is not here,” he insisted, according to one attendee. “The guy before you is a civil rights attorney. There’s an urban myth that I scream and yell. I’ve never yelled in my life.”\n\nThere’s little evidence Terrell has been directly involved in negotiations with campuses under investigation; instead, those appear to have been increasingly steered by the White House. Terrell has voiced distrust of any bargaining, preferring to “lay the hammer on them with lawsuits,” as he told Justice Department lawyers in an April meeting. In mid-July, when word leaked that the Trump administration was about to announce an agreement with Columbia to restore its funding, Terrell questioned whether it was tough enough.\n\n“I will not ‘SELLOUT’ Jewish Americans,” he posted on X. “NO DEALS!”\n\nSix days later, the administration announced a $221 million settlement with Columbia, setting the stage for a string of similar deals with other colleges.\n\nRelated | Columbia caves to Trump, setting dangerous precedent for higher ed\n\nThe extremism of Terrell’s messaging also doesn’t bother Dov Hikind, a former New York state Democratic assemblyman representing Brooklyn and the founder of Americans Against Antisemitism. “If Leo Terrell and others are speaking tough, I don’t lose any sleep over that.”\n\nBut the administration’s approach alarms other Jewish groups and erstwhile academic allies in the fight against campus antisemitism. The task force is “using legitimate fears of antisemitism in ways that are both dangerous and wrong,” said Amy Spitalnick, of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. When Terrell proclaimed on Fox News that the task force would “bankrupt” targeted universities, “they were saying the quiet part out loud,” she added.\n\nWhether Terrell is good for Jews or bad for Jews, his conversion has certainly been good for him. Leo 2.0 now has 2.5 million followers on his personal X account, and his speaking fee runs between $50,000 and $100,000; his government salary is $167,603. Terrell has attained “a rock star persona” in the Trump administration, said Kenneth Marcus, the former Education Department official and antisemitism activist. “People are very much drawn to him in a way that’s disproportionate to his rank in the federal government.”\n\nThere’s no sign administration officials, including Terrell, will let up in their campaign against higher education. Since late July, even as negotiations with Harvard dragged on and Brown’s settlement was announced, the administration froze $108 million in funding from Duke University’s medical system, citing “systemic racial discrimination” in hiring and admissions. It also halted more than $584 million from UCLA as punishment for tolerating a “hostile environment” for Jews and demanded $1 billion to restore the flow of government money. Duke has not publicly responded to the discrimination complaints. The University of California’s president, James B.

Or will the exposure of this effort further divide the Democrat activist class?\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund forms a key arm of the Left’s dark money network, bankrolling many of the activist groups that staffed and advised the Biden administration and supporting ballot initiatives across the states. The for-profit company Arabella Advisors manages Sixteen Thirty Fund as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, alongside other nonprofits like New Venture Fund, Windward Fund, and North Fund. These nonprofits then prop up fiscally-sponsored projects, allowing donors to support the projects without disclosing which projects they fund.\n\nTaylor Lorenz, a left-wing journalist not usually known for turning on her own side, wrote a lengthy Wired exposé about Chorus, which Lorenz identified as a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\nA Sixteen Thirty Fund spokesperson confirmed to The Daily Signal that Chorus is a fiscally-sponsored project of Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\n“Sixteen Thirty Fund (STF) became a fiscal sponsor of Chorus in April 2025,” the spokesperson said. “Fiscal sponsorship is a very common model for nonprofit work. In our case, it allows us to provide a shared operational home to new, progressive nonprofit projects like Chorus. This model enables these projects to focus on their programmatic goals while STF provides administrative services such as compliance and human resources.”\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund’s Chorus\n\nStuart Perelmuter, the former communications director for Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., founded Chorus in November. Perelmuter had previously launched Good Influence, a for-profit influencer marketing agency aimed at helping content creators connect with left-leaning causes. Perelmuter co-founded Chorus with Democratic influencer Brian Tyler Cohen, who has more than 4.6 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nChorus reportedly claims that its initial creator cohort has a collective audience of more than 40 million followers with more than 100 million weekly viewers. \n\nThe nonprofit reportedly offered dozens of Democrat political influencers $8,000 per month to join Chorus’ program—but the money comes with extensive strings attached.\n\nAccording to Wired, Chorus contracts prohibit content creators from using any program funds to make content that supports or opposes any political candidate or campaign without express authorization from Chorus in advance and in writing.\n\nThe contracts reportedly forbid influencers from disclosing their partnership—a standard practice—stipulating that they will “not publicize” the Chorus funding without Chorus’ consent.\n\nThe contracts also reportedly give Chorus the ability to force creators to remove or correct content based solely on the group’s discretion if the content was made at an event organized by Chorus.\n\nAccording to a fundraising deck Wired acquired, Chorus aims to “build new infrastructure to fund independent progressive voices online at scale.” The creators are expected to attend regular advocacy trainings and daily messaging check-ins. \n\nDemocratic content creator Keith Edwards has described the program’s structure as “predatory.”\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund’s Response\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund defended Chorus’ work in a statement to The Daily Signal.\n\n“Chorus is doing crucial work to spread a pro-democracy message to Americans,” the spokesperson said. “Creators working with Chorus have always been encouraged to talk about their involvement in the program.”\n\n“Chorus creators are not paid to support or oppose candidates, but they are free to do so on their own time,” the spokesperson added.\n\nBrian Tyler Cohen’s Response\n\nCohen also responded to Lorenz’s claims in a video posted on X. He described Chorus as “a scholarship program to teach creators how to grow their accounts, foster engagement, launch their own shows, and become profitable on their own.”\n\n“It’s an incubator program to build the pro-democracy ecosystem,” he added.\n\n“Chorus does not pay creators for content, does not tell them what to say, does not control who they talk to or work with, and there is absolutely nothing in the contract that could even be reasonably interpreted to say that they do,” Cohen said. “There are zero restrictions on their content.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the program has “a standard confidentiality clause in the contract to protect the privacy of the creators,” yet he insisted that during the workshop, Chorus clearly told creators that they could talk publicly about the program.\n\nEven if Lorenz’s claims are baseless, Chorus represents an attempt by the donor class to organize social media influencers toward the Left’s goals. \n\nWhat This Means for the Left\n\nAfter the woke activist class dominated the Biden administration and turned off the country, leading to Democrat Kamala Harris’ defeat in November, moderate-leaning Democrats have launched futile efforts to distance themselves from the toxic Marxist brand of gender ideology, climate alarmism, racial division, and technocratic government.\n\nThe consulting group Third Way has published a list of words Democrats should avoid—all terms related to the ideology of the activist Left.\n\nArabella Advisors, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, and the network of foundations set up by Hungarian American billionaire George Soros (and now run by his son, Alex) help to bankroll the woke activist groups pushing this ideology. The Biden administration propelled these nonprofits into positions of influence in the government, and it seemed to endorse every woke cause imaginable.\n\nMany influencers agree with parts of this ideology, but as individuals, they prefer to pick and choose, crafting their own takes that gain them attention and views. Some of them may moderate toward Third Way, but I suspect most of them largely walk in lockstep on these issues.\n\nThey bristle, however, at the idea of one massive dark money network bringing them together and calling the shots. This looks, to them, like institutional capture—and they value their freedom.\n\nI can’t believe I’m saying this, but I am grateful to Taylor Lorenz for exposing this move, and I hope many left-wing influencers notice it for what it is.\n\nFor far too long, the Left has acted as though the only “dark money” activism is on the Right—with the likes of Charles Koch and Leonard Leo. In reality, the Left’s dark money network is larger, partially because the Left represents the party of America’s woke elites.\n\nIf more left-leaning influencers wake up to the dark money on the Left and realize this attempt to coopt their voices, they won’t start supporting Trump. But they might think twice about the institutional structure that upholds the woke ideology—and if that helps them question whether the world is ending because of climate change or whether a man can become a woman just by saying so, I’ll consider that a win.","summary":"One of the most influential left-wing dark money organizations stands accused of trying to buy social media influencers, aiming to unify the Left as Democrats...

Even through nearly 10 years at the helm of Chapman University, he kept a whiteboard in his office crowded with equations.\n\nStaying curious, he said, is what makes him feel most alive.\n\n“I’m always wondering why stuff happens the way it happens. And the only way to answer the question is through research,” Struppa said. “You’re never bored. Never bored. There is never the same problem twice.”\n\nOn a recent morning inside the university’s presidential suite — now occupied by President-elect Matt Parlow — the Italian-born mathematician, whose last day as president is Sept. 1, let his eyes twinkle and his arms wave as he tried to explain why he’s taken up learning Arabic.\n\n“My attraction for math is also due to the shape of the symbols, the way the symbols come together. I cannot explain this very well, but I think that there is some archetypical value of mathematics,” he said. “I’m interested in Arabic mathematics … and that’s why I’m studying Arabic, because a lot of this happens there. And so I’m very curious to see in their work, if one can find some answers.”\n\nStruppa’s curiosity has always doubled as a compass, shaping his tenure in ways big and small, whether guiding Chapman through a once-in-a-century pandemic or pushing the university toward becoming a more research-driven institution.\n\n“Everything he did evolved around that idea,” Jim Doti, Chapman’s president for 25 years before Struppa stepped in in 2016, said. “How can we move Chapman in that direction?”\n\nA mathematician in the president’s chair\n\nStruppa’s academic specialty is Fourier analysis, a field of mathematics that studies breaking complex signals or functions into simpler waves, like sines and cosines, to understand their underlying patterns. By his own admission, it’s “very hard,” but the difficulty is part of the beauty. For him, symbols and equations carry something almost dreamlike, “a glimpse into this universe” that kept him writing and teaching even as he ran a university.\n\nHe never quite left the research world behind.\n\n“I still write two or three papers a year. I just finished a book this week,” he said.\n\nStruppa, 70, concedes that choosing administration three decades ago came with tradeoffs.\n\n“Yes, I do have some regrets. I mean, not huge, because life has treated me well and I kept my mathematics going. But could I have done much more if I’d stayed? Yes, I think so,” he said.\n\nAndrew Jordan, hired in 2021 to co-direct the Institute for Quantum Studies but who has known Struppa for a decade, said the outgoing university leader is “a remarkable guy in that he not only does the president gig, but teaches classes and he does research, too, which I think is amazing.”\n\nUnder Struppa’s tenure, the university shed its image as a regional school, establishing itself as a nationally recognized research institution.\n\nNew buildings rose across campus, and Struppa shepherded the creation of major academic hubs from the Institute for Quantum Studies to the Dale E. and Sarah Ann Fowler School of Engineering, the Schmid College of Science and Technology to the School of Pharmacy in Irvine. Along the way, Chapman also saw steady gains in national rankings, both for the university as a whole and for several of its professional schools.\n\n“All of those are directly Daniele’s vision,” said Justin Dressel, a co-program director of physics at Schmid College. “It’s hard to overstate just how much that’s radically transformed Chapman University’s trajectory.”\n\nStruppa has also recruited world-class faculty, including Vernon L. Smith, a Nobel laureate in economics, and Yakir Aharonov, a National Medal of Science honoree in physics. Aharonov serves as the director of the Institute for Quantum Studies.\n\n“It’s easy to think if you don’t know the ins and outs of the school, well, these professors just came from out of nowhere and suddenly they’re at Chapman. But I can tell you that they all came to Chapman in large part because of Daniele,” said Parker Kennedy, a Chapman trustee. “I’ve talked to some of the professors, not just at the institute, but throughout the campus. And I say, ‘How the heck did you end up at Chapman?’ Because they’re from all over the country and the world. And invariably they say, ‘Oh, I bumped into Daniele at a conference and I got to know him. And here I am.’”\n\nDressel, who came to Chapman in 2015 from the University of Rochester, said Struppa “understands what matters and has managed to emphasize that and also have frank discussions with other academics about what they need.”\n\nIf anything, Struppa found a strange symmetry between his two roles. Running a university required the same instincts as solving a theorem: define the problem, test the possibilities and accept that progress only comes through struggle.\n\nAnd that’s why Struppa said he’s pushed so hard for Chapman to have a strong research program.\n\nOne key reason, he said, is that “when you are a researcher, you learn every day, and that keeps you humble.”\n\nThat experience, he said, helps him be more understanding and patient with students as they wrestle with challenging material.\n\n“When a student doesn’t know how to multiply polynomials, they’re struggling in the same way in which I struggle when I try to understand the quantum physics problem,” he said. “So that to me is maybe the No. 1 most important reason why we need to have researchers in the classroom. They are kept humble and they understand challenge and difficulty and effort.”\n\nThat humility and approachability, Chapman junior Taylor Eskew said, extend far beyond the classroom.\n\nEskew, the Schmid College senator, said she first connected with Struppa at a scholarship dinner at Citrus City Grille in Old Towne Orange.\n\n“It was obvious how rooted he is in the community. Everyone seemed to know him and love him, and that sense of approachability has always stood out to me,” she said.\n\nFor Eskew, the opportunities Struppa fostered have been transformative. Originally drawn to Chapman for swimming and astrophysics, she said the “entire trajectory of my life” changed when she discovered the university’s quantum studies initiatives.\n\n“Quantum is not something that is seen in undergraduate work, like at all. It’s really mainly just a graduate-level study. And so I think it’s really unique that we are given that opportunity to be able to study that,” she said.\n\nDoti said Struppa’s continued teaching gave him unique insight into the university’s academic life.\n\n“One thing Daniele has been able to do that I wasn’t during the time I was president is he’s continued to teach,” he said. “I think that experience is necessary to give a president the insight to know what’s most important. What are the ingredients? What are the factors that lead to an exciting and dynamic experience in the classroom? What raises it to being something special? And you have to teach to see that.”\n\nDecisions from the president’s chair\n\nAnd then there was the time Struppa had to create an engaging and dynamic classroom experience, even when students couldn’t be physically present.\n\n“We closed the university the day before spring break. That’s when the governor told California we need to go into lockdown,” he recalled. “I sent a message to the faculty saying, ‘The university is closing, but the classes continue.’ We had one week to move to an online system. That’s a huge demand.”\n\nStruppa said he still remembers the eerie quiet of campus in the spring of 2020. The classrooms were empty and bottles of hand sanitizer stood guard at every threshold.\n\nChapman weathered the pandemic without layoffs, furloughs or cuts to salaries and benefits, Struppa said.\n\n“I wouldn’t say that it was as if nothing had happened, because that’s not true, but certainly we didn’t miss a beat. So I’m very proud,” he said.\n\n“Often people ask me, and I say this is the time when I was really able to show leadership,” he added. “Most of the time, you just do what you’ve got to do. But that time, it was really more complex.”\n\nBut his leadership has been questioned at times. Support from conservative billionaire Charles Koch’s foundation for what became Chapman’s Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy drew heavy criticism in 2018, with some faculty accusing the university of importing politics into the classroom.\n\nStruppa still defends the decision as one of his proudest.\n\n“It was a beautiful idea,” he said of the Smith Institute’s flagship program, an undergraduate minor in “humanomics” that blends literature, history, philosophy and economics. “I was very proud that I stood up to the pressure because that’s when you see whether a president should be a president or go home and do something else.\n\n“This was an issue of academic freedom,” he said, “you had colleagues who had an intellectual vision and they find a way to support it and just because the support comes from an entity that you may disagree with, there should not be an obstacle.”\n\nKennedy said where Struppa showed special leadership was his consistency in dealing with students and faculty, particularly in the area of free expression.\n\n“He really believes in free speech. So he’s predictable,” Kennedy said.\n\nSome faculty said Chapman was too slow to sever ties with John Eastman, the law professor who was indicted for his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Eastman had already stirred campus outrage with previous stances, including his argument that Vice President Kamala Harris was ineligible for office because her parents weren’t U.S. citizens.\n\nStruppa pushed back hard on the narrative that Chapman was condoning Eastman’s actions. Eastman announced he was leaving the university on Jan. 13, a week after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“It’s interesting that people think we moved slowly,” he said. “It is an indication for me that those who claim we were too slow are just in bad faith.\n\n“I’ll be very clear about this: A university that acts in five days or six is remarkable,” he said of the process required.\n\n“So it wasn’t pleasant, but the university and John separated from each other,” he added, “and I’m happy the way this happened.”\n\nMore recently, pro-Palestine students set up a campus encampment to push for the university to divest from Israel. Again, Struppa says he chose to protect free speech, even as he denied their demands.\n\n“There is no way a democratic society can advance unless we allow people to say stuff that really bothers us. Free speech is designed exactly to protect the speech that you find hideous,” he said. “My refusal to criticize openly John Eastman is paralleled by my refusal to clamp down on the encampments. Because free speech is more important. It’s more important than what I think about John’s statement. It’s more important than what I think about the statement of our students.”\n\nThe encampment ended without arrests or violence, a point Struppa counts as another success.\n\nStruppa has also been pressed on Chapman’s struggles with diversity, especially for Black students and in the last school year for structural changes to its DEI office. In 2021, he publicly said that the university had “a problem we need to address” with how it was supporting Black students and Black students’ lower graduation rate. Three years later, he emphasizes Chapman’s gains with Latino enrollment, and frames Black student numbers as partly a matter of geography and “pipeline.”\n\n“Well, I think that we are growing significantly in our number of Hispanic students, and that is a very natural reflection of where we are. So I think that we’re becoming more representative of the community where we live,” he said. “We don’t have that many Black people living in Orange County. So the numbers that are low, if you look at them in an abstract way, are actually not too surprising.”\n\nHe argues the university has created a welcoming environment, but acknowledges, “it’s a challenge, but part of the challenge is the pipeline … and the location.”\n\nParlow noted Chapman’s founding commitment to access.\n\n“We were founded on the inauguration day of Abraham Lincoln. And the point of our founders was access. Access to education for groups who otherwise couldn’t go to higher ed because of restrictions that were placed on people based on race and gender,” he said. “Those have always been our values of a place of access and so even before we had an office of DEI, this was our mission. It was our mission while we had it, and then now that we no longer have it, it continues to still be part of our mission and what we do.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIf there’s a personal through-line for Struppa, it’s the pull of questions that still bug him.\n\nHe lights up describing a current problem in quantum physics about functions that “oscillate much faster than what we think they should do” and how that relates to analytic functions.\n\nIt’s the kind of puzzle he’s eager to return to.\n\n“The question we’ve been pursuing for the last five or six years is to figure out what is the exact relationship between these two properties. And we’ve written four or five papers, but we don’t have yet the final answer. And I suspect it’s going to take a few more years to do that,” he said.\n\nHe and his wife, Dr. Lisa Sparks, the Foster and Mary McGaw Endowed Professor in Behavioral Sciences, are also turning their attention back to the mountains. Both avid climbers, Struppa proposed to Sparks on Cotopaxi, an active volcano in South America.\n\n“We’re going to do as much as we can of that, as much as our physical body will allow us to do,” Sparks said. “Now we’re going to have a more flexible schedule to do those things that really are part of who we are.”\n\nStruppa hopes to return to Cho Oyu — at 26,864 feet, it’s the world’s sixth-highest peak on the Nepal-Tibet border just west of Everest — once his knee is healed. Sparks said she hopes they can tackle the Camino de Santiago in Spain and spend more time in Italy and Colorado, indulging in hiking, climbing, skiing and the kind of nature that grounds them.\n\nWill he miss the presidency?\n\n“I don’t think so,” Struppa said matter-of-factly.","summary":"Daniele Struppa will be returning to the classroom and research, though he never really left it during his decade leading the university.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/31/chapman-universitys-mathematician-president-hands-over-the-reins/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OCR-L-STRUPPA-0830-11-PB.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 14:27:49","author":"Hanna Kang","authors":["Hanna Kang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.253},{"id":356107838,"title":"The Democrats Display Their Flaws in Minneapolis","text":"More than 400 elected Democrat Party officials from all 50 states and seven territories huddled in Minneapolis this week before the horrible mass shooting at nearby Annunciation Catholic Church. The proceedings demonstrated a party in the wilderness, and the Democrats in the national media mostly steered clear.\n\nFor starters, losing vice-presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was on his usual bender that Kamala Harris “would have been a fantastic president,” and that if she had won, “we would wake up to an adult with compassion and dignity and leadership doing the work, not a manchild crying about whatever is wrong with him. May his fat ankles find something today. Petty as hell.”\n\nSomeone is feeling petty. It defines the words “sore loser.” This drew raucous applause.\n\n“Think about how easy it would be to be a damn Republican,” Walz added. “Oh, what should I wear today? This stupid frickin’ red hat. What should I say today? I don’t know, just make sure it’s cruel. Who do we listen to? That guy. Oh, the felon in the White House, yeah, listen to him and that’ll be fine.”\n\nThere was plenty of notable quotes at the confab, and Greg Price captured some on Twitter. Insha Rahman of the Vera Institute of Justice said Democrats shouldn’t play on Trump’s issues: “Don’t take the bait, talking about migrant crimes or carjackings or the things that actually don’t matter to many Americans.”\n\nFamilies who lost loved ones in migrant crimes beg to differ.\n\nLindy Sowmick, who is of the Saginaw Ojibwe Nation and is the treasurer of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, made a “land acknowledgment,” lecturing that the land of Minneapolis was stewarded by the “Dakota people” for centuries before colonization: “This land was not claimed or traded. It’s part of a history of broken treaties and promises—and in many ways, we still live in a system built to suppress indigenous peoples’ cultural and spiritual history.”\n\nThe bad news of the meeting was their failure to agree on a policy on Gaza, since the “progressive” faction wanted a dramatically anti-Israel resolution, while Democratic National Committee leader Ken Martin had a more measured statement. But Martin withdrew his policy statement, which looks like a surrender to the far Left.\n\nSome measures were adopted, like the DEI resolution, which called for “Affirming the American Values of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.”\n\nThe author of the resolution, DNC member Bill Owen of Tennessee, a former state senator, brought religion into it: “To my Republican friends and fellow citizens who profess to be active Christians, I remind them that DEI is the very foundation of the Christian church. I get a little emotional on this, but Jesus loves little children, all the children of the world. Red and yellow, black and white.”\n\nThat’s borrowing from the 1970 Ray Stevens song “Everything Is Beautiful.” The sentiment rings true: Jesus loves all the children. We are equals in God’s eyes. The problem is that “DEI” doesn’t actually match these concepts. It’s more in line with that didactic “white colonizers are still oppressing the Indians” argument, where every white person needs to confess their “privilege” for the original sin of being Caucasian.\n\nThis meeting did not sound like a party that’s figured out why it lost the White House to Trump, or why its cash on hand is about one-fifth of what Republicans have. A few reporters might acknowledge these problems, but overall, the media elites would prefer to keep that chatter low while they stick to obsessing over problems for Mr. “Stupid Frickin’ Red Hat.”","summary":"More than 400 elected Democrat Party officials from all 50 states and seven territories huddled in Minneapolis this week before the horrible mass shooting at...

Pinkerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.164},{"id":356101532,"title":"Troops in the streets: The police-state dark side of democracy","text":"Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, along with other military or paramilitary forces, to “police” the streets of Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and very likely other American cities can be called many things. It’s ominous, and clearly meant to be. It’s dangerous to the future of democracy — assuming, for the moment, that’s still what we have in this country. It’s also clumsy, farcical and potentially self-destructive; I would argue that those qualities complement the menace, rather than undercutting or contradicting it.\n\nBut here’s what it’s not: It’s not unprecedented, or even all that unusual. According to the pseudo-moral discourse of “norms” and “guardrails” in which so much of American journalism remains imprisoned, we don’t do troops in the streets in the world’s leading democracy, because then we wouldn’t be the world’s leading democracy, would we? Except, of course, in rare and exceptional circumstances governed by strict rules — which sounds convincing unless you bother to look closely, which is when you discover that the exceptional circumstances have happened pretty often for all kinds of reasons, and the rules are so hazy and indistinct as not to be rules at all.\n\nIt’s more accurate to say that there’s a weak political taboo around sending troops into the streets — a taboo almost more honored in the breach than the observance — and that presidents or governors need to embrace or concoct a purportedly compelling reason for violating that taboo. Sometimes that reason strikes most people as plausible, as in the wake of a hurricane, an earthquake or a major wildfire. But not always. Trump is far from the first president to use the National Guard to demonstrate federal supremacy over state and local governments, which is something of a sore point in U.S. history, as you may recall.\n\nNone of which is to say that there aren’t distinctive and troubling qualities to Trump’s ramped-up use of military force in American cities. It’s just that those troubling qualities are inherently subjective. As is so often the case, Trump, molded by the sharper minds in his inner circle, has perceived the flaws and weak spots in our crumbling 18th-century constitutional order and exploited them ruthlessly. What troubles so many non-MAGA citizens (an actual majority, if we believe recent polls) is not the fact that the president is sending in the troops, but exactly who that president is and why he’s doing it.\n\nThis is neither an original observation nor an encouraging one, but the second Trump presidency represents the fulfillment, or near-fulfillment, of a tendency toward ever-increasing executive power that extends back at least as far as Franklin D. Roosevelt, and arguably all the way to Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. This may be too much historical shorthand, but one could argue that the extraordinary extensions of presidential powers that Lincoln used to crush the Confederacy marked the beginning of a process that brought us all the way here, to the brink of a neo-Confederate authoritarian idiocracy. If that’s even 10 percent true, it has to rank as one of the cruelest historical ironies imaginable.\n\nWhat’s distinctive about Trump’s domestic use of the military, of course, is that the excuse for it is transparently absurd: The alleged disorder the Guard has been dispatched to suppress is either invented or imaginary. In L.A., the crisis was entirely the result of the federal government’s overtly racist and willfully indiscriminate police-state actions, in seeking to detain and deport undocumented immigrants by the thousands (along with whoever else got swept up). There is no crime wave in D.C., as has been extensively documented, but the existence of any crime whatsoever — especially if committed by a Black person — was all that was necessary.\n\nBut if we understand Trump’s troop deployments as political theater aimed at his base — and intended both to crush protest movements and divide the political opposition — well, there’s nothing new about that at all. As it happens, I got my first lesson about this as a small child, when then-Gov. Ronald Reagan sent the California National Guard into the streets of Berkeley in May 1969.\n\nOK, that’s not quite true: My memories of those weeks are fragmentary and unreliable, and I lived two miles away from the conflict zone, on a bucolic suburban street of Arts & Crafts houses and enormous plane trees. (A few blocks up the hill from Kamala Harris!) Most of what I actually know about the People’s Park protests I learned after the fact. I told people for years that Berkeley had been under martial law, which wasn’t technically true. To be fair, it kind of felt like it at the time.\n\nEven at 56 years distance, these events — which originated in a seemingly minor land-use dispute between community activists and the University of California — seem strangely contemporary. Reagan had been elected on a pre-MAGA wave of right-wing outrage, promising to crush the pre-woke student protests of the late ‘60s, and seized on the People’s Park protests as a golden opportunity for street theater and good TV. He sent in 2,700 National Guard troops, a force many times larger than was conceivably necessary, and they spent the next two weeks breaking up even small and peaceful demonstrations with tear gas, batons, rubber bullets and (occasionally or allegedly) buckshot.\n\nI must interject here that Maj. Gen. Glenn Ames, commander of the California National Guard, claimed, in a monologue worthy of “Dr. Strangelove” or perhaps “The Odyssey,” that Berkeley degenerates had tried to poison or contaminate his all-American troops: “LSD had been injected into fudge, oranges and apple juice which they received from young hippie-type females.” I think we all needed that.\n\nGrowing up in Berkeley involved believing that we were special people in a special place, a notion also enforced (if mostly in a negative sense) by the rest of the world. So the National Guard thing seemed special too. It definitely wasn’t, except for the minor but intriguing point that in Berkeley almost everyone involved was white. Consider these examples, which are by no means encyclopedic.\n\nDraft Riots, New York City, 1863\n\nYou can definitely go further back into American history than this, given that the official history of the National Guard is much longer than that of the U.S. military, and begins with the militia established by British authorities in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636. But there’s no doubt that the “draft riots” of July 1863, an unstable and ugly combination of class conflict and race war, marked a decisive turning point in the use of federal power to quell urban disorder — and offered a pre-echo of many subsequent events, up to and including Jan. 6.\n\nAt the obvious risk of oversimplifying this complicated and dreadful event, what began as a legitimate protest against a harsh conscription law that targeted working-class men — many of them impoverished immigrants from Ireland with no stake in the Civil War — rapidly degraded into an outright pogrom against Black New Yorkers and their homes and businesses, along with government buildings and institutions. Perhaps as many as 1,200 people were killed (no one knows for sure) and thousands more Black residents were burned out of their homes and forced to leave the city.\n\nThe mayor and the governor dithered for several days before requesting federal intervention (I don’t know; does anything about that sound familiar?), but finally a force of 4,000 regular Army troops, less than two weeks after fighting at Gettysburg, arrived to stop the violence. Historical scholarship on the draft riots is intensive and disputatious; my only concluding point is that they seem to contain all the most painful and contradictory lessons of our nation’s history in compressed form.\n\nPublic school integration, Little Rock, Arkansas, 1957\n\nArguably we should pause to consider the use of federal troops in the South during Reconstruction, which was thematically connected both to the draft riots and to this event. For economy’s sake, let’s skip forward nearly a century to the early years of the civil rights movement and another signal use of federal power. President Dwight Eisenhower — a Republican, in case you hadn’t noticed — sent the National Guard to Arkansas’ capital city to enforce the terms of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education that made racial segregation in public schools illegal.\n\nShall we talk about painful historical irony a bit more? This showdown mesmerized the nation and struck many people, in America and around the world, as the beginning of a reckoning with the legacy of slavery that might lead, on some distant day, to a society of genuine racial equality. Well, OK, and it also began the process that turned the white South hardcore Republican — and now we have reached the dystopian-narrative plot point where the possible reversal of the Brown decision no longer seems inconceivable. Nope, I never thought I would find myself writing those words either.\n\nCivic uprising aka “race riots,” Detroit and Newark, 1967\n\nIt’s unfair to link the events in these two cities too much. They had disparate and quite different causes, and in the hazy historical imagination they blend together into the “long hot summer” and also into the epoch-shaping following year, when insurrections or riots broke out in numerous cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nBut even amid the near-constant social chaos of the late ‘60s, Detroit and Newark stand out for a number of important reasons. In both instances, the inciting incident involved alleged or apparent racist violence perpetrated by white cops in increasingly Black cities. (Neither city became majority Black, however, until after the uprising and/or rioting, when white flight intensified.) The level of outrage and the amount of property destruction was admittedly remarkable, and reflected years of built-up anger.\n\nIf anything, the level of state violence in response was even more disproportionate. In Detroit, after Republican Gov. George Romney and President Lyndon Johnson had gotten over their personal and political animosity, they sent in 8,000 National Guard troops and nearly 5,000 regular Army soldiers, all of which arguably made the violence worse. (The Guard shot and killed at least nine unarmed people under, at best, dubious circumstances.)\n\nRather than offer a potted history of the similar-but-different 1967 violence in Newark, I refer you to Salon contributor Bob Hennelly, who can tell this story better better than almost anyone. Oh, but wait: The truly important part here, I suspect, is that white people, in Michigan and New Jersey and pretty much everywhere else, were terrified out of their wits. The reputations of those two cities were permanently poisoned, and the contagious notion that American cities in general were full of angry Black people eager to commit mayhem spread throughout the Caucasian body politic. As difficult as this may be to imagine, Donald Trump was a 20-year-old college student at the time.\n\nKent State, Ohio, 1970\n\nThis perhaps overly-famous event, like the weeks of protest in Berkeley I don’t exactly remember, didn’t have anything to do with race, at least not explicitly. Leading student radical Tom Hayden made a somewhat cogent case, both then and later, that the antiwar movement on American campuses became adjacent to or allied with racial justice movements in the cities, which fueled establishment paranoia and led to exaggerated military response. That sure-enough happened at a normally placid state school in Ohio in May 1970, when a posse of poorly trained and obviously freaked National Guard troops opened fire on a nonviolent demonstration, killing four students and wounding nine others.\n\nLook, I’m not saying Kent State was inconsequential: All lives, in fact, do matter! But in a list full of embedded historical ironies, it’s noteworthy that the deaths of four college kids, as memorialized in a doleful pop-rock ballad, had a generational impact out of scale with a bunch of more dramatic or more violent events. For our current purposes, it’s worth adding that a not-inconsequential percentage of the public looked at what happened in that Kent State field and were like, lol yes!\n\nRodney King “riots,” Los Angeles, 1992\n\nHere we reach another history-changing event that quite a few of today’s readers can actually remember, which arrived as a massive shock to the American system at the tail end of the supposedly peaceful and prosperous Reagan-Bush I years. After LAPD officers were acquitted on all criminal charges for the vicious beating of Rodney King, an unarmed Black man, much of the metropolitan area erupted in what remains the largest single civil disturbance in American history.\n\nIt was another tale of two narratives, set against a social landscape in which violent crime was much more pervasive than it is today. (I know, almost nobody believes this, and you might not either: It’s true!) For many Black people, this was evidence that 25 years after the “long hot summer” very little had changed in terms of police racism and economic segregation. For a lot of white folks, it was more OMG the cities are chaotic, violent and disastrous and we need to lock ‘em all up.\n\nThere’s no way to sugarcoat the scale of destruction, which extended over more than 30 square miles. Almost no one would claim that sending in the National Guard was unnecessary in this case; it ultimately took 10,000 Guard troops and about 600 U.S. Marines to restore an uneasy peace. Los Angeles and its troubled police department were permanently changed by this trauma, and I would argue that on a national scale we are still living in its aftermath, which included Bill Clinton and neoliberalism and mass incarceration and … wow, somebody stop me before this gets really depressing.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only by Amanda Marcotte, also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nOne reason why so many people refuse to believe today’s crime statistics, I suspect, is the enduring suspicion that what happened in ‘92 is waiting to happen again. We could call that bad conscience, but why be judgmental? Oh yeah, and in 1992 Donald Trump was a playboy tycoon in his mid-40s, at the peak of his tabloid celebrity. The King riots, and the Central Park Five case, would shape his understanding of social reality from that moment onward.\n\nBlack Lives Matter protests, numerous cities, 2020\n\nSpeaking of bad conscience, all of that happened five years ago this summer, after the killing of George Floyd. Seems like yesterday and also like a bygone era, right? The National Guard was called out in lots of places and did very little to reduce the tension, but despite the blatant longings of the guy in the White House, also didn’t make things worse. I think this history is too recent to unpack in any coherent way, but I think the Black Lives Matter summer both led to the election of Joe Biden later that year and to, y’know, what happened after that. Does that make sense?\n\nU.S. Capitol, Jan. 6, 2021\n\nSpeaking of not making sense: I don’t really want to dwell on this one, do you? The National Guard got there eventually. Almost everyone who was arrested or convicted got away with it, and a lot of them never got caught in the first place. Do you want me to try to convince you that this event, and its still-unresolved meaning for you and me and our so-called republic, have nothing to do with race? Tell that to Laura Loomer.","summary":"Trump isn't the first president to send troops into American cities as political theater: But there's a difference","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/08/31/troops-in-the-streets-the-police-state-dark-side-of-democracy/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/National-Guard-in-DC-2231532795-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 10:30:09","author":"Andrew O'hehir","authors":["Andrew O'hehir"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.14},{"id":356207840,"title":"MAGA Hypocrisy Exposed!

Now her tweet for Trump is not receiving the support that she expected.\n\nThe netizens called her out on her hypocrisy. One of the users wrote that MAGA is some of the worst and stupid people. Another one added that they only have double standards; otherwise, they won’t even have any standards.\n\nTo the hundreds of thousands of woke left who posted that they hoped the Trump dead rumor was true.

Only one user commented to support her, saying, “Exactly! They covered Joe’s dementia up. Smh.” On the other hand, people started adding screenshots of her Biden conspiracy theory tweets in the comments.\n\nThat is a brutal way to slam someone with proof. Moreover, one user pointed out that the video she shared is old and was shared two months ago. Commentators also called MAGA evil and unimaginable with their lies and theories.\n\nEarlier in 2024, Lauren Boebert was asking for Biden to step in front of the camera to give proof of life.

Who are you to tell someone what someone should or shouldn't have?'\nHe balked at 'the audacity' and slammed his fans' unsolicited opinions: 'That's not your place. God decides what we deserve.'\nIn response to his post, fans flooded his comments section with messages voicing concern, calling out his 'hypocrisy' and urging him to 'take a social media break.'\nElsewhere, Justin was also accused by fans of 'acting single' and appeared distant, with little social media posts featuring Hailey, with the couple previously looking tense in pap shots from earlier this year. \n'Baby, I ain't walking away / You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you, I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,' he sings in the chorus of the track Daisies.\nHowever, it appears the couple are now back on track following their rocky patch, with sources revealing how they used a recent family holiday to reconnect. \nEarlier this month it was clear the couple had been making considerable efforts into their relationship by making time for each other. \nJustin had shared a collection of pictures of him and Hailey as they enjoyed a loved-up date night outdoors. The couple - who married in 2018 - cozied up to each other on quilts and pillows set on a crop of lush green grass.\nThe images were soundtracked by Otis Redding's 1965 tune That's How Strong My Love Is. \nJustin BieberHailey BaldwinIdaho\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHailey Bieber stuns in a sexy black top as she leaves West Hollywood date night with husband Justin after the couple overcame their marital woes\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictoria Beckham basks in the sun in a swimsuit while hubby David dives into a thrilling new read as they relax on their yacht in Capri\n\nIconic 1980s band member dies as friends pay heartbreaking tribute to the drummer\n\nThe awful truth about Bruce Willis' dementia.

Harris.\"\n\nA senior advisor to Harris also confirmed the news to NBC, saying: \"The vice president is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety.\"\n\nHarris is currently due to go on a tour across the US for her 107 Days memoir, which will be released in September, exploring her presidential campaign last year.\n\nBecause of the threat to her safety, an update has been announced which will allow her to continue that protection.\n\nAs of now, the former VP will receive protection from the California Highway Patrol.\n\nThe LA Times reported that authorities came forward to confirm the deal, claiming it came about after a conversation between California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nNot only does Harris lose physical security but also threat intelligence to detect plans for attacks.\n\nMayor Karen Bass has since slammed Trump's decision, as per the Daily Mail: “This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more.\n\n“This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles.”\n\nAs for her future plans, Harris previously spoke with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and shared that she plans to take a break from politics.\n\n\"At this time, I will continue serving and leading outside of elected office,\" Harris had announced earlier this year.\n\n\"I’m eager to reconnect with the American people, support Democratic candidates nationwide who are committed to bold leadership, and share more about my next steps in the months to come,\" she added.\n\nColbert then pointed out that Harris beat every other candidate in early polling and also asked why she decided not to run for governor of California.\n\nHe said: \"Why are you sitting this out?

Or was it in the commonplace nature of a raid outside an elementary school in Mt Pleasant in Washington DC, where police staked out a school with a large Spanish-speaking population in what became just another immigration raid in America.\n\nSome activists and observers have sounded the alarm: authoritarianism of the kind that Americans are used to condemning abroad has become increasingly normal in the United States.\n\nDon Moynihan, a political scientist and professor at the University of Michigan, wrote this week that “today, America is a competitive authoritarian system, with a rapidly increasing emphasis on the authoritarian part.”\n\nThe checklist to consolidate power, he wrote, includes efforts to control the government bureaucracy, the military, internal security, the legal system, civil society, higher education, the media and elections. The pursuit of those aims had been “systematic”, he wrote.\n\nAbdelrahman ElGendy has watched this process with a feeling of grim recognition. ElGendy spent six years in prison in his native Egypt on political charges, but fled to the US in order to work on a memoir he is set to release next year.\n\nIn April, however, he packed his things and left the US following the detention of the Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil. ElGendy’s lawyers warned him that he could face a similar fate after his personal details were posted on a website used to target opponents of Israel’s war in Gaza.\n\nSince then, he has watched from abroad as the situation has worsened.\n\n“I haven’t second-guessed leaving the US. In fact I feel very grateful that I made the choice that I did before things got even worse,” he said. “I left Egypt to escape political persecution … The reason I left the US is because I started to recognize those same patterns forming around me. And since leaving it’s only gone downhill.”\n\nWhen Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) began carrying out large-scale raids and he was identified online as a potential target, he said he found himself once again waiting to be taken away at any moment.\n\n“I don’t think political incarceration is the most important characteristic of authoritarianism, it’s more the constant threat of it that matters most,” he said. “What really sustains authoritarianism is that quiet knowledge that the prison door is always within reach … that shadow is what shapes behavior.”\n\nFrom Russia to Turkey, and Hungary to El Salvador, activists, observers and political scientists have watched the quick consolidation of power by the Trump administration as it has followed a familiar pattern of autocratic rollout.\n\nWashington has found common cause with some of the world’s harshest authoritarian regimes such Russia and El Salvador. This week, the US deported nearly 50 Russians, according to activists, including some who probably requested political asylum in the United States. Hundreds of migrants and even citizens have been deported to prisons in El Salvador.\n\n“Sometimes I almost feel it’s like ‘I told you so,’” said Noah Bullock, the chief executive of Cristosal, a leading human rights group in El Salvador which was forced to leave the country last month after 25 years of documenting abuses of power.\n\n“With the Ice crackdown and the creation of this massive law enforcement agency that only obeys the president – there are no good historical references where that works out well.”\n\n“One of the things that I see happening that hits me really close is when these security or police forces begin to look at the whole population as enemies,” he added, comparing it to El Salvador where they had been “trained to see the population as a threat”.\n\nThe winner-take-all dynamics of the Trump administration, which has claimed a historic mandate despite winning among the thinnest majorities in a generation, have made this a particularly fraught moment. Along with the federal takeover of police forces, the other commonly cited danger is the Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas and resulting fightback in California, as well as other efforts to diminish voter turnout ahead of the 2026 midterm and 2028 presidential elections.\n\nSome activists insist it is not too late to turn back. Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, and Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University, wrote this week that “We Can Stop the Rise of American Autocracy”.\n\nCiting Hungary and Venezuela as examples, they wrote that “we cannot be lulled into believing that this is like anything we’ve seen before and can therefore be solved by simply waiting for the midterm elections. The antidote to Trump’s American breed of autocracy is understanding the severity of the threat at hand.”\n\nBut others see the trend toward authoritarianism as merely an acceleration of the direction of US politics even before Trump.\n\n“That assumes that the United States was a functioning healthy democracy that slipped … and that’s just not the case in my opinion,” said ElGendy.\n\n“When a democracy is designed with this capacity for authoritarianism you’re never more than one election away from its reappearance. That’s not an accident, that’s a design flaw.”","summary":"People who have experienced the kind of authoritarianism the US used to condemn abroad highlight worrying signs\n\nWhen it comes to the rise of autocracy in America, Justice Potter Stewart’s famous pronouncement on pornography might be particularly appropriate at the moment: “I know it when I see it.”\n\nThe cult of personality was apparent as Donald Trump’s cabinet convened on Wednesday in a marathon session that could have embarrassed even a seasoned strongman, providing for three hours and 17 minutes of fawning television coverage.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/trump-american-autocracy-authoritarianism","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b770842355f4c0201fe4a1237e6a58fa7683b9/0_0_5624_4500/master/5624.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 09:00:26","author":"Andrew Roth","authors":["Andrew Roth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":356021738,"title":"Editorial: Secret’s out —Biden rang up yet another taxpayer tab","text":"Joe Biden takes care of his own. Too bad American taxpayers aren’t included in that circle.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is, and Biden quietly extended her Secret Service detail after they left office, according to reports. Traditionally, ex-VPs get six months of protection after they clock out, but Biden quietly extended Harris’s coverage for a year.\n\nPresident Trump revoked it.\n\n“You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” a letter, obtained by CNN, read.\n\nIt remains unclear why Harris’s detail was extended by Biden, but sources told CNN her candidacy, race and gender could have been a factor.\n\nThis is, of course, fresh fodder for the endless Democrats vs. Republicans feud, but one thing to keep in mind is that Secret Service protection comes out of taxpayers’ wallets.\n\nThe FY ’25 budget for the Secret Service is $3.2 billion, or three years of emergency shelter costs for immigrants in Massachusetts dollars. Paying for a Secret Service detail doesn’t come out of petty cash.\n\nAnd yet Biden was yet again willing to spend our money and signed the paperwork on the QT.\n\nOf course, Hunter Biden is part of the mix. Usually, the Secret Service protects the sitting president, vice president and their families during their term in office, and protection is extended to all former presidents and their spouses, as well as their children until they turn 16.\n\nBiden wasn’t just on a pardon spree at the end of his tenure. He signed an executive order extending the detail to his family, including Hunter Biden and Ashley Biden.\n\nHunter hasn’t seen 16 in nearly 40 years, but the Big Guy came through.\n\nAs the New York Post reported, Hunter was spotted walking around South Africa in mid-March with an extensive security detail, raising questions about government resources going to assist travel by a private citizen.\n\nThe round-the-clock Secret Service protection was on the job for Hunter’s luxury vacation.\n\nHow much money did taxpayers splash out so Hunter could keep up the delusion that he’s important?\n\nTrump put the kibosh on the Biden kids’ Secret Service protection.\n\nTo be fair, President Trump extended Secret Service protection to his four adult children for six months after he left office in 2021. Democrats slammed the move, complaining loudly about the estimated cost of $1.7 million.\n\nIt’s a bad move. So why repeat it?\n\nThis was a chance for Biden to take the high road, to toe the fiscal line and display financial prudence. Of course, if he had done that, he wouldn’t be Joe Biden.\n\nHe has long treated the taxpayer as an ATM for progressive agendas, such as expecting us to foot the bill for college loans taken out by students who realized too late that paying them back is expensive.\n\nHopefully, when Trump leaves office, he won’t resurrect the protection extensions. He’s doing a lot for taxpayers, and should keep that momentum going until he hands back the keys.","summary":"Joe Biden takes care of his own.

Not really! Party leaders still have to contend with the problem of how to reintegrate Wike into the party or effectively manage the maverick politician, if I may call it that! How will the party cure him of what many party faithful see as his anti-party activities? Will he still remain in the Bola Ahmed Tinubu/APC administration or will he be expected to quit?”\n\nAfter a prolonged internecine intra-party warfare, internal wranglings and repeated failed attempts, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party last Monday eventually successfully held its 102nd National Executive Committee meeting at Gusau, capital of Zamfara State where momentous decisions were taken by the party. That it was able to meet – and with the meeting well attended – was victory on its own. That it was able to take far-reaching decisions without the meeting scattering was another victory. The nature and significance of the decisions taken will surprise many, not in the least PDP leaders themselves. Few people would believe that the PDP leaders could look one another in the eye and tell the home truth. Credit for this must be attributed, wait for it, to Nyesom Wike, the former two-term governor of Rivers state on PDP’s platform but now the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory in an All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\n\nWike: Stabbed in the back by Tambuwal?\n\nWhy did I give the credit to Wike? Since May 2022 when the PDP presidential ticket was snatched from his hands as a result of the conspiracy of PDP politicians of Northern extraction, Wike has been the malevolent firewood in PDP’s fire that has not allowed the party’s kitchen any peace, order or direction. Wike was believed to be coasting home to victory at the PDP presidential primary of May 2022 before the 11th-hour decision of the then Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State to step down for former Vice-President and perennial Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, right at the PDP convention ground on convention night. That decision tilted the scale in favour of Atiku. Wike’s pain and frustration is better imagined than felt. Apart from the fact that he had run what everyone knew was the most expensive and most exerting campaign of all the PDP presidential aspirants, the angle from which his defeat came was unexpected. It was like Brutus’s unkindest cut thrust into the inner recesses of Julius Caesar’s heart.\n\nIn the 2018/19 presidential election cycle, Wike and the then Gov. Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti state had left no stone unturned to ensure that Tambuwal won the PDP presidential ticket against Atiku. They even took the convention to Wike’s turf in Port-Harcourt but they still failed and Atiku won. Therefore, the least that anyone had expected in 2022/23 was that Tambuwal would file out in Wike’s corner, but ethnic and religious inclinations seemingly trumped that expectation. In politics, especially the Nigerian model, one good turn may not always deserve another.\n\nWike was wounded, but like a wounded lion, he laid in wait. If he cannot be president, maybe he can be the second-in-command. Having come a respectable second in the PDP presidential primaries in question, he expected he would be picked as Atiku’s running mate. Some reports said he was indeed initially offered the running mate slot by Atiku, until some forces intervened to scuttle it. A committee set up by the party to also search for a credible running mate was also said to have zeroed in on Wike but in the end, Wike was passed over for his Delta State counterpart, Ifeanyi Okowa. The allegations tied around Wike’s neck to hang him was that his administration demolished a mosque in his state – which was basically untrue – and also that he would be a too powerful VP for the liking of those who had already started seeing and positioning themselves as power being the throne in an Atiku presidency. After two losses in a row, an embittered Wike was gifted a costly mistake by the winning side: The Atiku side, having won the presidential ticket, also wanted to keep the chairmanship of the party!\n\nEnter the G5 PDP governors\n\nRecall that the same PDP party hierarchy had been responsible for throwing its zoning formula out of the window. With Muhammadu Buhari, a Fulani/Muslim/Northerner spending two unbroken terms of four years each, it was deemed equitable, just, and fair that the presidency be allowed to move to the South. The southern governors, blind to party affiliation, met and demanded the rotation of the presidency to the South. This zoning formula is also enshrined in PDP’s constitution. The same PDP constitution also stipulates the equitable spread of national offices in such a way that the Presidential flagbearer of the party and its national chairman at any point in time must rotate between the North and South. Dr. Iyiorcha Ayu was the PDP chairman at the time and he was accused of being complicit in throwing overboard the PDP zoning formula that allowed Atiku the opportunity to contest and snatch the flag from his Southern competitors. Wike and like-minds insisted that Ayu must step down for a chairman from the South to emerge but Ayu stalled, supported by the Atiku camp, which insisted that Ayu must remain in office until after the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nEnter the self-styled “Integrity Group” of five PDP governors, otherwise called the G5, made up of Wike (Rivers state); Seyi Makinde (Oyo state), Samuel Ortom (Benue state); Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia state); and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu state). The G5 voiced opposition to, one, the presidential flag of their party not being allowed to rotate to the South, and, two, both the presidential flagbearer and party chairman being cornered by the same North. What started as a joke or mere grievances that would soon petter out became, gradually, a wildfire in harmattan haze. To cut the long story short, in the February 2023 presidential election, the five PDP governors ditched their party’s presidential candidate and split their votes between the candidates of the APC and Labour Party. Three to four years after, peace has not returned to PDP, efforts after efforts to broker peace having floundered on the altar of personality clashes as well as the insistence of Wike that on rotational presidency he stands!\n\nAtiku’s exit from PDP: Blessing in disguise?\n\nWith last Monday’s PDP NEC meeting seemingly resolving the rotational presidency issue, it appears peace may be returning to the once vibrant “largest party in Africa”. The credit for this must, however, go to unusual quarters – Atiku’s exit from the PDP. With Atiku gone, who is left to rival Wike in the PDP? What should the PDP still be fighting Wike over? And on whose behalf? The whole PDP crisis had revolved around Atiku’s ambition and now that he has carried his wahala elsewhere, the PDP leaders must have heaved a sigh of relief. Now, they have only Wike to contend with. They started on a good note in Gusau by acceding to virtually all of Wike’s demands. The 2027 presidential ticket of the party has been zoned to the South. The chairmanship has been retained in the North. The two most important party offices – the chairman and secretary – have been retained in the hands of presumed Wike loyalists. With Wike also having said he has no presidential ambition of his own in 2027, none of the PDP presidential aspirants should cast suspicious glances in his direction. \n\nDoes it then mean that the PDP is out of the woods? Not really! Party leaders still have to contend with the problem of how to reintegrate Wike into the party or effectively manage the maverick politician, if I may call it that! How will the party cure him of what many party faithful see as his anti-party activities? Will he still remain in the Bola Ahmed Tinubu/APC administration or will he be expected to quit? What if he refuses to quit, just like some Yoruba Afenifere leaders who refused to quit the Abacha government during the epic struggle for the revalidation of the June 12, 1993 presidential election won by MKO Abiola but which was annulled by the military dictatorship of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida? Will Wike be allowed to remain in PDP while continuing to support the re-election of President Tinubu? If an attempt is made to punish Wike for alleged anti-party activities, will peace endure in the party?\n\nWhither Wike?\n\nThis leads us to the question of whether or not Wike has done anything wrong by supporting President Tinubu’s election as well as accepting to serve in his government. We have a precedent in Chief Bola Ige of the Alliance for Democracy agreeing to serve in the PDP government of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, first as the Power minister and later as the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation. Reports say the problem started when he decided to leave the government and return to strengthen his own party, AD, for the next election. He was assassinated shortly afterwards right in his own bedroom and till date, no clues have emerged as to who dunnit! Tell Wike to beware of the Ides of Bola Ige!\n\nI listened to an interview of the PDP Senate Minority Leader, Abba Moro, by Seun Okinbaloye and his insight on the issue of anti-party activities was quite refreshing. During the last presidential election in the United States, many Republican leaders openly campaigned against their own party candidate, Donald Trump, while canvassing votes for and pledging support for Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate. Yet, there has been no deluge of anti-party allegations against those who broke rank and tradition, despite that many of them did so in the open.\n\nAnother point raised by Moro, which I find germane, is this: Why is the cry for punishment directed only at Wike? Why not also at his other four “accomplices”, if you pardon my effrontery? Wike might have led the G5, but he was not alone in it; he might also have been the most outspoken or intransigent of the five but none of the other four has renounced the principles that they fought for, that is, respect for the rotation of offices as enshrined in the PDP constitution. Indeed, any of them angling to contest for the PDP presidential flag in 2026/27 will be a beneficiary of that struggle. Therefore, should Wike alone be punished while the others go scot free? And like Moro said – and I expect him to know because of his vantage position – there were many other PDP leaders who also in their own ways kicked against the PDP choice of presidential candidate in 2023. Will you also be punished? Many of such are even in PDP NEC as well as the Board of Trustees as we speak!\n\nOkowa, who was Atiku’s running mate in the 2023 presidential election, regretted his action as he defected to the APC, saying that the singular action of the PDP gifting its presidential ticket to a Northerner cost the party the election. Southern voters, he said, were resolute in their determination to reject a Northerner-to-Northerner handing over of presidential power in 2023. Moro added that, for PDP, this is a time to rebuild and a time for reconciliation. I agree with him. PDP is not strong enough at the moment to wield any big stick. If it does, it will only be driving more of its members into APC’s waiting embrace!\n\nIs there a vacancy in the Presidential villa in 2027?\n\nAs I draw the curtains, may I ask of what value is the zoning of the PDP presidential ticket to the South in 2027, seeing that, from all indications, it does appear that it is unlikely the party would have regrouped and re-energised sufficiently enough to give a vibrant challenge to APC in the 2027 presidential election? Once more, a politically articulate North may have handed their Southern counterparts nothing but pyrrhic victory.\n\nPRINTER’S DEVIL: The ubiquitous PRINTER’S DEVIL, as we call it in this profession, reared its ugly head on this page last week.

Gavin Newsom (D) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D).\n\nThe CHP declined to provide further information when reached by The Hill. \n\n“Respectfully, the California Highway Patrol does not comment on security arrangements,” stated CHP office of media relations spokesperson Lt. Matt Gutierrez. Newsom’s office, which would need to approve the protection, was not immediately available for comment by The Hill. Newsom’s office chose not to provide more comments to The Times.\n\nHarris’s security was rescinded through a letter titled “Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security” dated Thursday. Her protection is set to conclude on Sept. 1, according to CNN.\n\n“You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” states the letter, a copy of which was acquired by CNN.\n\nHarris’s security detail extended for six months after the conclusion of the Biden administration, as is typical for vice presidents; however, former President Biden extended this deadline for an additional year before exiting office, according to CNN. Presidents are granted lifetime Secret Service protection.\n\nBass denounced Trump’s decision to revoke Harris’s Secret Service protection in a statement to The Hill, saying she will work with Newsom to ensure Harris’s safety.\n\n“This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more,” Bass said. “This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe California Highway Patrol (CHP) has proposed providing security for former Vice&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Report: California Highway Patrol to Provide Security for Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/report-california-highway-patrol-to-provide-security-for-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/California-Highway-Patrol-to-protect-Kamala-Harris-Report.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 01:33:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.492},{"id":355950622,"title":"Kemi Badenoch calls for North Sea oil boom: Tory leader vows to end 'impossible' Net Zero drive and focus on maximum extraction of Britain's fossil fuels","text":"Kemi Badenoch has vowed to extract as much oil and gas as possible from the North Sea if she is elected.\n\nThe Conservative Party will make 'maximising extraction' the goal, in a move away from Net Zero pledges.\n\nMrs Badenoch is set to give a speech in Aberdeen, which will draw comparison to Donald Trump's 'drill baby drill' moment.\n\nShe will announce that the Tories plan to completely overhaul the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), which oversees the issuing of licences. \n\nThe party plans to replace its current 12-page mandate with a simple order to extract the maximum possible amount of fossil fuels.\n\nThey will remove the word 'transition' from the NSTA, which was added by Boris Johnson in 2022 to signpost the phasing out of fossil fuels. \n\nMrs Badenoch said Britain 'cannot afford not to be doing everything to get hydrocarbons out the ground' to boost growth, The Sunday Telegraph reported.\n\nShe said: 'We are in the absurd situation where our country is leaving vital resources untapped while neighbours such as Norway extract them from the same seabed.\n\n'Britain has already decarbonised more than every other major economy since 1990, yet we face some of the highest energy prices in the developed world. \n\n'This is not sustainable and it cannot continue. That is why I am calling time on this unilateral act of economic disarmament and Labour's impossible ideology of net zero by 2050.\n\n'So, a future Conservative government will scrap all mandates for the North Sea beyond maximising extraction.\n\n'It is time that common sense, economic growth and our national interest came first, and only the Conservatives will deliver that.\n\n'We are going to get all our oil and gas out of the North Sea.'\n\nThe NSTA currently places an obligation on the oil and gas industry to assist Ed Miliband hitting his net zero targets.\n\nThis includes forcing the companies to promote carbon capture and storage, despite its huge costs.\n\nThe industry body for the oil and gas producers, Offshore Energy UK, previously warned that 1,000 jobs could be lost every month until 2030.\n\nMr Miliband has continuously argued that replacing fossil fuel production with clean energy will bring down household bills.\n\nHowever as costs continue to rise, he is under increasing pressure to prove that strategy will work.\n\nTory grandees previously warned that copying Donald Trump's 'atni-green agenda' could hamper the party's electoral recovery.\n\nIn November, a trio of former Cabinet ministers urged the new party leader to distance it from the president-elect's 'drill, baby, drill', warning that while it may have worked in the US it will 'alienate' a majority of British voters.\n\nSir Robert Buckland, Sir Simon Clarke and Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who between them span the ideological width of the Conservative Party, spoke out ahead of Trump taking office for the second time in January.\n\nSir Simon, who was a rightwing Cabinet minister under both Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, said: 'President Trump has won a historic victory, responding to voters' concerns on issues ranging from illegal immigration to the state of the economy.\n\n'But the President's anti-green agenda would alienate the majority of British voters.\n\n'We should of course make sure we decarbonise in the most cost effective way, and campaign to replace Ed Miliband's hair-shirted statism - which has already sadly set in motion great and unnecessary harm - with market solutions.\n\n'But overt climate scepticism would make us a protest party, would ignore the major national security concerns inherent in leaving the UK dependent on foreign oil and gas and would not help to bring the Conservatives back to power.\n\n'So we must learn the right lessons from the American election, and listen to the British public first and foremost.'\n\nMr Buckland, the former Justice and Wales Secretary who backed Kamala Harris at the election, said: 'Trump's anti-green agenda is the last thing our party needs.\n\n'The majority of people in every constituency in the country want climate action. They may question the best approach, but the goal must remain the same.\n\nIf we adopt ''drill, baby, drill'' when it comes to the environment, we will never rebuild trust with the party and only show ourselves as out of touch.\n\n'Not only is fracking incredibly difficult in such a densely populated country, but our North Sea reserves are running low. If we want energy independence, our salvation lies with renewables and nuclear.'\n\nMs Trevelyan, the former transport secretary, added: 'Under successive Conservative governments, we have led the world in the Net Zero journey. Under a Trump administration, the Conservatives should seek to work hand in hand with Republicans to champion free-market, climate policies that grow the economy today and leave a better world for our children tomorrow.\n\n'We have paved a route Trump and conservatives in America can follow.","summary":"The Conservative Party will make 'maximising extraction' the goal, in a move away from Net Zero pledges to end new fossil fuel extraction.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15050933/Kemi-Badenoch-North-Sea-oil-Net-Zero.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/31/01/101699589-0-image-m-38_1756598798946.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 00:13:46","author":"Editor,Tom Lawrence","authors":["Editor","Tom Lawrence"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":356095288,"title":"Baywatch bombshell appears frail in first sighting since revealing mastectomy amid cancer battle","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nReal Estate\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 31st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternet sleuths reveal millionaire CEO is 'jerk' tennis fan who snatched US Open star's hat away from child\n\nAiling department store stuns Wall Street with back-to-basics U-turn and stock skyrockets 20%\n\nDisturbing unsolved mystery of backpacker pals who vanished hours into volcano hike... before rescuers found sinister pictures on their phones and remains scattered around jungle\n\nThe awful truth about Bruce Willis' dementia.

She won a second term in 2020 by 6 percentage points.\n\nErnst's office did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nHer decision to not seek a third term was first reported by CBS News.\n\nErnst's decision could prompt a fierce Senate race -- though at least one candidate is already eyeing Ernst's spot.\n\nRep. Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa) is planning to announce a run for the soon-to-be-open Senate seat, according to the same senior GOP source.\n\nErnst has served as Iowa's junior senator since 2015. In her time in the Senate she served in leadership positions, including as the chair of the Senate Republican Policy Committee and vice conference chair.\n\nErnst was a focus of major attention during the protracted discussion over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation. She ultimately cast a vote for him despite her record as a military sexual assault prevention advocate. Hegseth denied the sexual assault allegations and was never charged.\n\nShe also chairs the Senate DOGE caucus and has been outspoken in favor of making cuts to the federal government's budget.\n\nShe garnered attention during a town hall in late May when, in an attempt to defend cuts to Medicaid to a crowd of agitated constituents, she responded \"Well, we are all going to die.\"\n\nSeveral Democrats have announced plans to run for the Senate in 2026, including Des Moines School Board chair Jackie Norris, state Rep.

The Democratic Party has struggled to regain its footing after a stunning loss in the 2024 election, but party leaders have so far ignored advice to avoid the cultural leftism that pushed many 2024 voters towards President Donald Trump.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion “are American values. This is what America was built on,” declared delegate Bill Owen, a Democrat from Tennessee. “And to my Republican friends and fellow citizens … who profess to be active Christians, I remind them that DEI is the very foundation of the Christian church. I get a little emotional on this, but: ‘Jesus loves little children, all the children of the world, red and yellow, black and white.’”\n\nLet Owen’s hot take stand as a warning against founding a worldview on a children’s song or treating the lyrics as an irrefutable mic drop. On issues that matter, it’s far safer to consult the original source itself—which, given the multitude of accurate English Bible translations available at reasonable prices, is not terribly difficult to do.\n\nAccording to the Bible, the kingdom of heaven will have diversity, in the form of “a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages” (Revelation 7:9). But the equity (or justice) of this kingdom actually results in exclusion of the unregenerate. “And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. … And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:12, 15). Of course, the diversity of God’s kingdom is not an end in itself; it exists to showcase God’s wisdom and glory (Ephesians 3:10).\n\nAll of this is quite irrelevant to any discussion of political DEI, since God’s people constitute a spiritual entity, not a political one. A key attribute of the kingdom of God is that it is “not of this world” (John 18:36) and operates according to different principles.\n\n(Finally, the fundamental problem most Americans have with DEI in a political context is not the ideals themselves, but the left-wing practices that masquerade under the banner of DEI, but which actually subvert the ideals.)\n\nNevertheless, it was this controversial expression of political DEI that the DNC Resolutions Committee saw fit to approve unanimously.\n\nThis unanimous approval is significant in comparison to other issues on which Democrats could not agree. Far more ink has been spilled over the Democratic drama on Israel, where the Resolutions Committee considered two dueling resolutions and advanced neither. The more radical resolution called for an arms embargo against Israel amid their war in Gaza, while the other endorsed a two-state solution and an immediate ceasefire. “Neither of these resolutions ended up passing,” observed Family Research Council Action Director Matt Carpenter on “Washington Watch.” “They ended up saying, basically, ‘Let’s talk about this some more.’”\n\nWhile an arms embargo on Israel may have gone beyond the pale for the old-school Democrats, the DEI resolution showed that “they continue to find points of unity that … the American people reject,” summarized Family Research Council Senior Fellow Jody Hice.\n\n“The 2024 election was absolutely a referendum on that agenda,” Carpenter concurred. “The Biden administration took every opportunity they could to push that DEI agenda in every nook and cranny they could of the federal government into American society. And it was rejected at the ballot box.”\n\nIn the final weeks of the 2024 presidential campaign, Republicans spent millions of dollars on an ad roasting Trump’s opponent, “Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you.”\n\n“It’s frankly astonishing that the party would double down on that,” continued Carpenter. “Once you’ve been rebuked at the ballot box, it’s time to go back to the drawing board.”\n\nRemarkably, unanimous approval for the DEI resolution came even after a “center-Left” group (or at least a group that passes for moderate in the current Democratic Party) issued a memo last Friday to “All Who Wish to Stop Donald Trump and MAGA” that begged Democrats, for the sake of their own political fortunes, to stop using language that alienates normal people.\n\nWhat followed was a list of 45 terms, including the most offensive, alienating, or off-putting recently coined (or repurposed) by the Left:\n\n“Privilege …\n\n“Triggering\n\n“Microaggression …\n\n“Safe space\n\n“Body shaming …\n\n“Subverting norms\n\n“Systems of oppression …\n\n“The unhoused\n\n“Food insecurity\n\n“Housing insecurity\n\n“Person who immigrated …\n\n“Birthing person/inseminated person\n\n“Pregnant people\n\n“Chest feeding\n\n“Deadnaming\n\n“Heteronormative\n\n“Patriarchy\n\n“LGBTQIA+ …\n\n“Intersectionality …\n\n“Incarcerated people\n\n“Involuntary confinement”\n\n“For a party that spends billions of dollars trying to find the perfect language to connect to voters, Democrats and their allies use an awful lot of words and phrases no ordinary person would ever dream of saying,” the report pleaded. “The intent of this language is to include, broaden, empathize, accept, and embrace. The effect of this language is to sound like the extreme, divisive, elitist, and obfuscatory, enforcers of wokeness.”\n\nNot every term on the list deserves to be there (e.g., “dialoguing … postmodernism … heuristic”). Some terms even someone with a professional duty to understand and interpret the latest progressive propaganda, like yours truly, has likely never heard (e.g. “progressive stack … minoritized communities … carceration”).\n\nBut, as a whole, let us give credit where credit is due: the creators of this list at least had the self-awareness and listening skills to interpret how these terms sound to ordinary people. They classified the terms into six categories, based on how normal people interpret them. “These words say ‘I’m more empathetic than you, and you are callous to hurting other’s feelings,’” they described one category. “These say ‘your views on traditional genders and gender roles are at best quaint.,” said another.\n\n“It’s good advice, but a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has already galloped off to the glue factory,” scoffed National Review’s Jeffrey Blehar. “Kamala Harris used nearly every single one of these terms during a misbegotten political career that climaxed in a failed presidential campaign that bonded her party to this particular variety of noxious progressivism.”\n\nAs far as actual policies go, it’s hard to distinguish a “Third Way”-style politician from a standard progressive, especially on policies like abortion. Their rejection of left-wing verbal clutter simply reveals a desire not to sound quite as radical, based solely on political expediency. They object not to the Democratic Party’s leftward drift, but to rocking the boat in a way that startles longtime partisans into jumping ship.\n\nThe fundamental problem with this approach is that it is difficult to lull passengers back to sleep once they have been startled awake by the raging storm around them. The left-wing policies gaining purchase in the Democratic Party only make sense to those who have imbibed the left-wing worldview that created them.\n\n“The Democrats can drop this sort of language from their messaging as much as they wish, but until they drop the spirit of this rhetoric from their political objectives, they will remain just as culturally alienated from the mainstream as they are now,” Blehar concluded. “Or, to quote an online friend: Normal people don’t need to be told to act normal.”\n\n“The Democratic Party is certainly in a tough spot,” agreed Carpenter. “Recent polling showed they’re at just 24% approval rating among registered voters, with a 56% disapproval rating.” Additionally, he noted, the Democratic Party has ousted leaders only months after electing them, stockpiled $14 million in cash to Republicans’ $84 million, and lost 2.1 million voters, while Republicans have gained 2.4 million.\n\nDemocrats know their party is in trouble, but they seem divided over the best course to chart. DNC Chairman Ken Martin articulated one alternative on Tuesday, when he complained that he was “sick and tired of this Democratic Party bringing a pencil to a knife fight. We cannot be the only party that plays by the rules anymore.”\n\nThis complaint suffers from the conceit that Democrats play by the rules, a questionable proposition after their last administration arrested peaceful pro-life protestors; planted informants in churches; defied the Supreme Court; colluded with medical organizations, school boards, and social media platforms; and waged the most extensive lawfare campaign ever conducted against a former president. (In fact, perhaps such recent, toxic misbehavior accounts for part of the Democratic Party’s current misfortunes.)\n\nWhile Democrats struggle to find consensus on the path forward, they know where they stand now: solidly behind the toxic identity politics encapsulated in the label “DEI.” As far as these values are considered, Democrat leadership has convinced itself to ignore the warning signs and power full steam ahead.\n\nOriginally published by The Washington Stand.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The move, first reported August 29, comes just days before Harris launches a 15-city book tour for 107 Days, her account of the 2024 campaign.For Harris, the first Black woman to serve as vice president, the loss of federal protection creates a dangerous gap. Private security firms, even when staffed by ex-Secret Service agents, simply can’t match the intelligence sharing, manpower, or legal authority of the real thing, experts warn, reported US Today.“Whether it’s crowd control, motorcades, or defending against cyber and chemical threats, you’re just not going to get it from the private sector,” AT Smith, former deputy director of the Secret Service, was quoted as saying.The decision puts Harris in the same category as John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Robert O’Brien, and Dr Anthony Fauci, all of whom saw their taxpayer-funded security abruptly canceled under Trump, even as some faced active threats from hostile governments.The law only guarantees six months of Secret Service coverage for former vice presidents. But Joe Biden quietly extended Harris’ detail for a year after leaving office, a courtesy Trump has now revoked.The legality is murky. DHS has final say, and officials are supposed to review classified threat assessments before pulling protection. It’s unclear if that happened here.California allies, including Gov Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, are already weighing how to keep Harris safe. And Democrats in Washington see Trump’s order as yet another weaponization of presidential power.“Another dangerous reminder that there’s no agenda more important to Donald Trump than retribution,” said Rep. Adam Schiff. “He feeds conspiracy theories to his followers. Makes their targets more vulnerable.

It was at one point ‘Robert Paul Westman.'”\n\n“But since she identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification [and] was underage, it’s now Robin Westman,” he respectfully continued, as applying the “proper” pronouns here apparently are more important than the crime or the victims.\n\n“It appears, based on our reporting, that he had ties, or that the assailant had ties to the school, both because she or they went there or because the mother went there,” Kayyem later carefully noted while nearly needing a chiropractor on set from all the politically correct twisting. “That now tells me that’s why they knew … what the school looked like.”\n\nThis is CNN.\n\nBut here’s the thing about this biological male: He wrote before the shooting that he regretted being transgender.\n\n“I only keep [the long hair] because it is pretty much my last shred of being trans. I am tired of being trans, I wish I never brain-washed myself,” he said in a handwritten note before the shooting.\n\n“I can’t cut my hair now, as it would be an embarrassing defeat, and it might be a concerning change of character that could get me reported. It just always gets in my way. I will probably chop it on the day of the attack,” he added.\n\nIt was later reported that this sick individual used a photo of Jesus Christ for target practice.\n\nIf we had actual journalism anymore, ABC/CBS/NBC/CNN, the New York Times, Washington Post, and Minnesota Star Tribune would do deep dives into just how many transgender individuals under the age of 20 regret making such a monumental decision without fully understanding the possible mental consequences of an irreversible, life-changing decision.\n\nInstead, all of the aforementioned networks and publications referred to Westman as “she” or “her,” while their opinion sides all bemoaned so-called “right-wing media” for even broaching the fact that Westman was transgender and clearly mentally ill as a result of a gender transition. Both factors are entirely relevant, and to broach them isn’t being transphobic; it’s an honest attempt to analyze what led to this horrific tragedy.\n\nAnd for what it’s worth, Westman’s mother, who fully supported her 19-year-old son to transition, is not cooperating with authorities to the point that she recently hired a criminal defense attorney. Why is that?\n\nAs for the Trump White House, it reportedly has ordered the NIH to study “regret” and “detransition” among children who have transitioned, according to an internal memo leaked to NPR back in April.\n\n“This is very important to the President and the Secretary,” the memo says. “They would like us to have funding announcements within the next six months to get this moving.”\n\nMeanwhile, former CNN reporter Oliver Darcy showed once again that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree in his Media Matters-inspired newsletter while scolding some outlets for correctly labeling the shooter as transgender.\n\n“AGAIN: TRANS SHOOTS UP MINNEAPOLIS CATHOLIC SCHOOL.” That was the banner splashed across Breitbart’s homepage Wednesday evening, a reflection of the anti-trans narrative flowing through right-wing media after a shooter opened fire on Catholic school children during mass,” Darcy begins in comments first flagged by the Media Research Center. \n\n“Much of the coverage was fixated on the shooter’s gender identity, casting trans people as inherently dangerous. Indeed, the goal seemed to be to take the suspect’s heinous actions and weaponize them into an indictment of an entire community.”\n\nThe question ultimately is this: Should those who are transgender be eligible to purchase firearms? Because if someone is so unwilling to accept themselves for who they are (in this case, a young man) to the point they believe changing genders will cure their ills, should that be considered a mental disorder? And if so, does that therefore disqualify them from owning potentially deadly weapons?\n\nIn this case, Kash Patel’s FBI is classifying this as an anti-Catholic hate crime.\n\nPatel said Westman left “multiple anti-Catholic, anti-religious references” written on guns and in notes, according to FBI investigators.\n\n“Subject expressed hatred and violence toward Jewish people, writing Israel must fall, ‘Free Palestine,’ and using explicit language related to the Holocaust,” Patel added in a post on X, while also sharing that Westman also had called for President Donald Trump to be killed.\n\nSpeaking of the president, let’s explore the worst of the worst when it comes to coverage of this shooting. Not surprisingly, it comes from ABC News, a division run by Kamala Harris’s BFF Dana Walden.\n\nCorrespondent Adam Katersky appeared on the network shortly after the shooting to lamely attempt to connect the shooter with President Donald Trump in the most blatant example of the bias of omission seen in some time.\n\nKatersky: “23-year-old Robin Westman was able to leave what police called a video manifesto that they’re now going through to try and establish motive. There are also photos of the weapons, and they include all sorts of writings: the names of past mass shooters, criticism of Israel, and the name of President Trump written on the guns.”\n\nWow. So Katersky is essentially saying that Westman was such a fan of Trump that he inscribed his name on his weapon the same way the United States military sometimes does on bombs before they’re dropped on an enemy? What a development!\n\nExcept, of course, Katersky is knowingly leaving out a very key part of the story that Westman had literally inscribed “Kill Donald Trump” on his rifle. \n\nHe decided not to mention that Westman also declared —\n\n“Israel must fall.” \n\n“Burn Israel.” \n\n“Six million [Jews] wasn’t enough.”\n\nThankfully, we live in a world of social media that does not allow this gutter journalism to go unchecked.\n\n“The name of President Trump written on the guns” without mentioning that the message was “k*ll Donald Trump,” wrote popular radio host and podcaster Vince Cogianese on X. \n\n“WTF is wrong with these people!???” wrote Donald Trump Jr. to his 15 million followers on X. \n\n“So irresponsible. An obvious lie,” said Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham to her large following on X. \n\nOf course, Katersky was not reprimanded, nor has he apologized for the obvious omission. Without accountability, the Katerskys of the world will continue to push false or misleading narratives with no consequences, which is why trust in legacy media continues its descent into irrelevance.\n\nChildren praying in their pews were shot at in Minneapolis. Two were killed, and seventeen injured or wounded are expected to survive. Thank God. \n\nThe New York Times also beclowned itself with the following headline:\n\n“Minneapolis Suspect Knew Her Target, but Motive Is a Mystery.”\n\n“Her” target. Uh-huh. Motive is a mystery? Anti-Catholic hate driven to the point of taking out kids as young as eight years old while praying? Enough of this already.\n\nW. JAMES ANTLE: THE UGLY POLITICAL DIVIDE OVER THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS\n\nBut legacy media decided to try to exploit yet another atrocious tragedy to separate the country between good and bad.\n\nThe irony is that the bad part includes the very entity that is journalism, which is supposed to be here to inform and not divide us as Americans.","summary":"It was a tragedy that struck the hearts of Americans across the country: Young children, praying in pews, became the victims of a mass shooting in Minneapolis.

The great taking, where the federal government takes a stake in private companies, has commenced.\n\nIntel, the once mighty but now beleaguered Silicon Valley giant, agreed to sell the federal government 10% of its shares last week, marking the most significant state intervention in private business since the Great Recession and the largest ever orchestrated by a Republican administration outside times of crisis. At the White House Monday, Trump told RealClearPolitics that Intel was just the start.\n\n“I hope I’m going to have many more cases like it,” the president said. Addressing his critics, he added, “You do have stupid people say, ‘Oh, that’s a shame.’ It’s not a shame. It’s called business.”\n\nAnd the new kind of federal business has been booming.\n\nBefore his Intel agreement, Trump closed two deals with Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices that allow those chipmakers to sell advanced AI tech to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue generated from U.S. exports. Earlier in the summer, he blessed a deal allowing Japan’s Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel in exchange for a “golden share” granting the federal government vast authority over the corporation. His administration also entered a less noticed 10-year agreement with MP Materials, a U.S. corporation developing rare earth, in exchange for the purchase of $400 million in the company.\n\nAsked if he was engaging in the kind of behavior he had warned against on the campaign trail, Trump pointed to what had been Republican heterodoxy until recently: tariffs.\n\nHis favorite economic tool, said the president, had lowered trade deficits, made the Treasury flush with cash, and even helped him negotiate an end to wars the world over. “So that’s not normal either,” he concluded. “But you know what? Other countries did it to us, and now we’re doing it to other countries.”\n\nTrump himself now directs the new industrial policy of the United States. In the last eight months, the Oval Office has been transformed into a trading floor of sorts, with American CEOs and foreign leaders alike seeking audiences with the president to negotiate directly. He has reordered not just the U.S. economy, but also longstanding GOP orthodoxy in the process.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom pounced on the irony of a Republican president meddling in the markets. In a mocking social media post, complete with a picture of Trump next to the flag of the Soviet Union, the Democrat wrote, “ALL HAIL CHAIRMAN TRUMP! WITH HIS GLORIOUS 10% PURCHASE OF INTEL, THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF AMERICA ENTERS A BOLD NEW ERA OF GOVERNMENT-RUN BUSINESS.”\n\nAn unintended consequence of the new industrial policy: a role reversal on Capitol Hill. Democrats now accuse Republicans of harboring socialist tendencies.\n\n“After ridiculously accusing numerous Democrats of being ‘communists,’ Trump has sought to bully, manage, or even seize government ownership stakes in leading American companies,” said Virginia Rep. Don Beyer, ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee. Combined with his tariff regime and his effort to fire members of the Federal Reserve, Beyer told RCP, “all of this adds up to a command economy that incentivizes corruption and graft, hurts growth, costs American jobs, and raises prices.”\n\nCondemnation from the left hasn’t been universal. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, said that he was “glad” Trump had taken a stake in Intel. If private corporations take grant money from the federal government, he said in a statement, then taxpayers “have a right to a reasonable return.”\n\nNot long ago, it would have been unimaginable for a Republican president to nationalize private industry. Fears of “socialized medicine” and state expansion fueled the Tea Party during the Obama administration, ushering in Republican congressional majorities on the explicit vow to adhere to limited government principles. Conservatives never lived up to those promises, but the echoes of that populist movement can still be heard from the current White House that condemns their opponents as “Marxists.”\n\nBut most Republicans have been muted in their criticism of the takeovers for fear of angering Trump.\n\n“If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn’t the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?” asked Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who called the move a “terrible idea.” His colleague, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who announced he would retire at the end of his term, said the move “starts feeling like a semi state-owned enterprise à la CCCP.”\n\nThe deals have forced a time for choosing. “If I was speaking to the president, I’d encourage him: It’s time to think twice,” former Vice President Mike Pence told Bloomberg earlier this summer. Reacting to the “golden share” in U.S. Steel acquired by the federal government, he added, “State-owned enterprise is not the American way. Free enterprise is the American way.”\n\nThe administration does not appear to be listening. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC this week that senior Pentagon officials are exploring whether to acquire equity stakes in major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\n“Come on, let’s take care of the American taxpayer,” Lutnick later told Fox News. “That is not socialism. I will tell you what that is. That’s the best businessman in the United States of America in the Oval Office doing fair things for us.”\n\nTo the delight of more libertarian-minded conservatives, Trump immediately began cutting bureaucracy and red tape upon returning to office. But the president does not appear interested in limited government for constitutional reasons. Instead, much like the chairman of a corporate board, he has focused on efficiency. Where the free market cannot heal the “American Carnage” that Trump referenced in his first inaugural address, his administration has shown a willingness to try direct federal investment.\n\n“Trump has broken open a lot of political, rhetorical and intellectual space. The idea that you can’t have a muscular economic policy as a Republican is well and truly dead,” said Chris Griswold, policy director of American Compass, the premier think tank of the New Right. The old guard of free market absolutists remains in the party, but they’ve been reduced to a small cadre, and the conversation has shifted.\n\n“The debate isn’t so much ‘big government’ versus ‘small government’ anymore,” Griswold continued. “It’s about who will solve the urgent problems we face and how.” Rather than the ad-hoc approach Trump currently favors, he called for the development of “standing capacity” so the federal government can invest in certain industries, such as battery production and chip fabrication, that have been overlooked by private capital and lost to foreign competition.\n\n“An openness to more muscular economic policy does not signal that we’re all socialist now,” Griswold continued. “Doing this well is in the Hamiltonian tradition of protecting and investing in American industry as a prerequisite to national thriving, strength and economic resilience. That’s not new at all. It’s the American system.”\n\nNotably, though, Alexander Hamilton advocated for protective tariffs and subsidies to foster economic growth, not state ownership of private enterprises. More recently, leaders of the New Right, like former Sen. Marco Rubio, advocated for a common-good conservativism where government directed the free market to desired outcomes through a series of incentives, not outright ownership.\n\nTrump, however, has accelerated the debate. The argument generally breaks down along two lines on the right. There are those who see in government the ability to ease some of the destabilization brought on by increased globalization and technological advancements of the free market. Others still believe that any cure administered by the federal government would likely end up being worse than the ailment.\n\n“This is not really playing out as an intellectual debate. The camps are not really talking with each other with the intention of changing hearts and minds,” said Paul Winfree, CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation, who served as deputy director of the domestic policy council during Trump’s first term. “It’s full of rhetoric and ahistorical statements rather than a coherent methodology and close inspection.”\n\nThere has been little public backlash to Trump’s acquisitions, no Tea Party demonstrations about the size and scope of government. Other than a few editorials by the business-friendly Wall Street Journal editorial board, the protest has been muted.\n\n“That makes me wonder about the long-run viability of the historical alliance that has been the backbone of the conservative movement,” said Winfree. “In other words, I don’t really know if the movement exists anymore or not.”","summary":"'If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn’t the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/08/command-economy-under-chairman-trump-u-s-takes/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/donald-trump-coronavirus-bankers-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-30 17:22:02","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.097},{"id":355901490,"title":"DNC's summer showdown: Infighting exposes cracks in Democrats' unity narrative against GOP agenda","text":"MINNEAPOLIS, MN - Democrats came ready to fight as they huddled this week at the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) annual summer meeting. But despite repeated talk that the party is unified as it aims to exit the political wilderness following last year's election setbacks, Democrats fought among themselves multiple times during the three-day confab, which was held in Minnesota's largest city. As Democrats hunger for a more forceful response to counter President Donald Trump's sweeping and controversial agenda, DNC Chair Ken Martin targeted the president, arguing Trump's acting as \"a dictator-in-chief\" and that his second administration is \"fascism dressed in a red tie.\" Martin, pointing to pushback by Democrats against moves this summer by Trump and Republicans to create more right-leaning U.S. House seats in states across the country through rare mid-decade congressional redistricting ahead of next year's midterm elections, said that he's \"sick and tired of this Democratic Party bringing a pencil to a knife fight.\" TRUMP, DEMOCRATS, MULL HOLDING PRESIDENTIAL-STYLE CONVENTIONS AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS \"We cannot be the only party that plays by the rules anymore,\" he urged. And DNC Vice Chair Malcolm Kenyatta, in a Fox News Digital interview on the sidelines of the meeting, urged that Democrats \"have to engage in a level of fight, not power for power's sake, but we have to fight hard because we understand what's at stake for working people and working families.\" DNC CHAIR DEMANDS DEMOCRATS ‘STOP BRINGING A PENCIL TO A KNIFE FIGHT' And echoing Martin, he said, \"We've been playing checkers. They're playing Grand Theft Auto,\" as he referred to the long-running and popular action-adventure video game series that revolves around shooting, driving, and stealing cars. Amid talk that the party remains divided over a slew of policy and political issues, leaders preached unity. \"We do not have the luxury to fight amongst ourselves while that thing sits in the White House,\" 2024 Democratic Party vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz emphasized, as he referred to Trump. And Martin highlighted that \"in this big tent party of ours, we are unified towards one single goal: to stop Donald Trump and put this country back on track.\" At several smaller panel discussions during the confab, a leader from the donor portal for Democrats known as ActBlue shared what was described as a fight song to energize party members. The song and the lyrics, which were reported by Semafor, were mocked by conservatives on social media. While unity was a top theme in Minneapolis, divisions did flare during the summer meeting. There was plenty of disagreement as the DNC's Resolutions Committee considered two dueling resolutions on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The panel voted down a symbolic resolution calling for an arms embargo and suspension of U.S. military aid to Israel, which has long been the top American ally in the Middle East. A separate resolution introduced and supported by Martin that called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as well as unrestricted access to humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza, was unanimously passed by the panel. But the defeat of the second, more forceful resolution, which was introduced by 26-year-old Allison Minnerly, a new DNC member from Florida, sparked opposition among some members on the panel. DEMOCRATS DIVIDED: TENSIONS FLARE OVER WAR IN GAZA \"It’s not enough,\" Sophia Danenberg, a DNC committee member from Washington D.C., said as she pointed to Martin's resolution. \"People want to hear a louder, stronger, statement.\" Danenberg emphasized, \"I do fear that we're losing our future as the Democratic Party by not being courageous on this issue.\" Minutes later, following a private conversation between Martin and Minnerly, the DNC chair asked the committee to \"withdraw my resolution so we can move united today and have the conversation.\" \"We need to keep working through this. We have to find a path forward as a party, and we have to stay unified,\" the chair added. Martin's move, which was embraced by the committee, may buy a little bit of time, but the party remains divided on the issue. Joe Salas, a DNC committee member from California and a Muslim American, told Fox News after the defeat of Minnerly's resolution, that \"I think there is a disconnect between the people on the committee and the average lock-stock-and-barrel voters who identify with the Democratic Party.\" The showdown over the resolutions came as the Democratic Party's once nearly unshakable support for Israel has fractured amid the bloodshed. And concerns over the growing death toll among Palestinians by many in the party's progressive base have soared this spring and summer, amid what many describe as a famine in Gaza. Recent polling indicates support for Israel's continued military actions in Gaza is plummeting among Democrats. Democrats are aiming to rebound after last year's elections when the party lost control of the White House and the Senate. Democrats also fell short in their bid to win back the House majority and Republicans made gains with voters who make up key parts of the Democratic Party's base. But the situation has only deteriorated for the Democrats in the 10 months since last year's election setbacks, according to key metrics. The Democrats' brand is deeply unpopular, especially with younger voters, as the party's poll numbers continue to drop to all-time lows in national surveys. The DNC continues to face a massive fundraising deficit at the hands of the rival Republican National Committee (RNC), as well as concerns over lagging party registration. But Martin was optimistic. While he acknowledged \"that our cash on hand seems to be low by comparison to the Republicans,\" he touted at Wednesday morning's Executive Committee meeting that \"we have raised $70 million so far this year, which is a record.\" And Martin pointed to a special election victory Tuesday night in red state Iowa, where the Democrats flipped a GOP-held state Senate seat. \"This is now 40 key elections this year that we've won or overperformed in,\" Martin touted. \"I want you to think about that for a second. Democrats, there's wind at our back. We have overperformed in every single election that's been on the ballot since Donald Trump was inaugurated.\" After a rough stretch after winning election as DNC chair in February, Martin appears to have steadied himself this summer, and there was plenty of praise for the new chair during the meeting, which on Wednesday was adjourned early after the deadly church shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis just a few miles from the DNC meeting.

After Trump ended the protection in a memorandum on Thursday, California officials scrambled to add new security for Harris,” the report said.\n\nThere’s been no confirmation yet from Democrat Gov.

Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass held discussions Thursday about Harris’s situation, according to the outlet.\n\nTrump revoked an order signed in January by then-President Joe Biden to extend Harris’s security detail until January 2026. Under normal circumstances, Harris would have lost her protection six months after the end of her term.\n\nThe president issued a memorandum Thursday to the Secret Service, informing officials that they were “hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum” concerning Harris.\n\nNewsom would need to sign off on the new arrangement with the California Highway Patrol, although his office would not confirm the plans.\n\n“Our office does not comment on security arrangements,” Newsom’s spokesperson Izzy Gordon told the LA Times. “The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses.”\n\nBass hit out at the Trump administration over revoking Harris’s protection in what she called “another act of revenge.”\n\n“This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” the mayor said in a statement to the Times.\n\nHarris has largely kept a low profile since she was defeated by Trump in last year’s presidential election. Last month she ruled out a run for California governor after months of speculation she could seek to return to elected office. \n\nThe former vice president is set to release a memoir in the fall about her 107-day campaign for president after Biden dropped out of the race, and she is about to embark on a book tour.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has used his authority over the Secret Service to punish perceived political adversaries by removing previously authorized protective details, even in cases where there have been documented threats to the people in question.\n\nIn his first days back in the White House, the president ordered the agency to stop protecting his first-term national security adviser, John Bolton, and his former Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo.\n\nBoth men have been on a list of officials targeted for assassination by Iran in retaliation for the Trump-ordered drone stroke on Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps leader Qassem Soleimani during the president’s first term.\n\nBut Trump nonetheless ordered their protective details to be withdrawn.\n\nIn March, he ordered an end to protection for former president Biden’s adult children, including his son Hunter Biden, at the urging of conspiracy theorist and far-right influencer Laura Loomer.\n\nAdditional reporting from Andrew Feinberg","summary":"California officials have reportedly put a plan in place to provide Harris with dignitary protection","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/california-highway-patrol-to-protect-harris-after-trump-pulls-secret-service-detail-report-b2817106.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/11/21/22/GettyImages-2182597864.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YJvbXWRL-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-30 16:48:43","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":356095286,"title":"Katie Holmes keeps low profile in figure-hugging dress and sunglasses as she enjoys day out at the US Open in New York","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nReal Estate\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 31st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternet sleuths reveal millionaire CEO is 'jerk' tennis fan who snatched US Open star's hat away from child\n\nAiling department store stuns Wall Street with back-to-basics U-turn and stock skyrockets 20%\n\nDisturbing unsolved mystery of backpacker pals who vanished hours into volcano hike... before rescuers found sinister pictures on their phones and remains scattered around jungle\n\nThe awful truth about Bruce Willis' dementia.

Everything may grind to a halt if they don't hold on to those two chambers.”\n\nRepublican strategist Lance Trover admitted Trump is trying to rig the midterms through gerrymandering to hold the House.\n\n“I don't think the White House is hiding behind why they want Texas to do what they're doing.

JD is a real person with a real life. The people attacking him need to get one of their own,' Charlie Kirk, Founder and CEO of Turning Point USA told the Daily Mail.\n\nVance is also unique in that he is the father of three young children, the first vice president since former Vice President Al Gore to travel with children. \n\nThe vice president chooses to bring his family with him on long foreign trips, which typically include an extraordinary number of meetings and a busy schedule. \n\nIn February, Vance traveled to Paris and Munich for a summit on Artificial Intelligence and the Munich Security Conference.\n\nThat travel included two prominent speeches and meetings with eight different world leaders, including French President Emanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Prime Minister Modi of India.\n\nBut the job still has it's perks. \n\nIn between meetings with world leaders and diplomatic niceties, the vice president's team has scheduled special activities for the family.\n\nWhile he was off the clock, Vance and his family visited Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. He and his wife Usha made a more solemn visit to the Dachau concentration camp memorial in Germany.\n\nA diplomatic trip to India warranted a visit to the Taj Mahal, as Prime Minster Narendra Modi lavished attention on the family, as Usha Vance and the children were celebrated for their Indian heritage.\n\nThat activity, Vance's allies insist, is part of the job but also a sign that he is a good dad. \n\n'It's insane that the Democrat Party is attacking Vice President Vance for making time for his wife and kids. He's the most effective Vice President in modern history, and he's an attentive dad, and he deserves credit for both,' Terry Schilling, President of pro-family American Principles Project told the Daily Mail. \n\nDespite the best-laid plans by staff, sometimes the demands of the job require Vance to miss time with the family. \n\nWhile in Rome, Vance did not join his wife and children to visit the Colosseum, even as tourists were outraged that it was closed for a portion of the day. \n\nHe did, however, join the family for a private tour of the Sistine Chapel and attended Good Friday services at St. Peter's Basilica and Mass at the historic Saint Paul Outside The Walls Basilica. \n\nThe decision to take in cultural sites are usually encouraged by the leaders of their host countries, as the vice president's advance team coordinate extra activities surrounding their visit. \n\nFor example, when Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband visited Paris, she stopped by a cookware shop when she was in Paris in between Meetings with Macron and also stopped to tour a biomedical research institute, as a way to pay tribute to her mother who worked in a medical lab. \n\nEvery foreign trip typically includes a visit from the vice president to a military base to meet the troops. \n\nVance served beers to the troops in appreciation of their service, for example, during an April refueling stop at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. He has visited several military bases since. \n\nDetails of Vance's trip to the United Kingdom leaked early, as the vice president and his family spent several days in the Cotswolds as well as a time at a country estate in Scotland.\n\nThe eye-popping cost of the $10,000-a-week home in the Cotswolds and the $28,000-a-week home in Scotland sparked headlines, but the vice president fronted some of the costs.\n\n'The Vance family pays for their own accommodations when on personal travel,' a source familiar with the vice president's travel arrangements told the Daily Mail.\n\nWhile the president was setting up diplomatic efforts to end the Russian war in Ukraine, Vance spent time meeting with Lammy, as well as Ukrainian, and European officials. \n\nVance was also on the phone with the White House for conversations related to Trump's historic summit with European leaders to discuss the end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe vice president's fundraising duties also made demands on his time. Despite being overseas, he attended an event in the UK for American ex-pats, raising $4 million for the RNC.\n\nAs the RNC finance chairman, Vance has a busy domestic fundraising schedule.\n\nA three-hour trip to Jackson Hole, Wyoming raised $2 million for the RNC, before the vice president left for another fundraiser for Big Sky, Montana. A fundraising trip to Nantucket raised $3 million.\n\nVance also visited Atlanta, Georgia, and Las Vegas, Nevada, and Nashville, Tennessee for fundraisers as well as San Diego, New York City, and Silicon Valley.\n\nVance's wife Usha sometimes travels with him on fundraising trips, as she was spotted boarding a yacht with the vice president in Nantucket.\n\nThe vice president's half-day trip to Rupurt Murdoch's ranch in Montana in June, reportedly included a brief hike with Usha before Air Force Two made its way back to Washington, DC the same evening. \n\nDespite his much publicized international trips, the vice president has also spent a great deal of time traveling domestically, as part of his efforts to promote the administrations signature bill, in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin. \n\nThe Vance family also mixed business and fun for their Independence Day holiday, as they visited Mt. Rushmore for fireworks commemorating the U.S.'s 249th birthday and went for a hike with the family. The trip also included a meeting between Vance and South Dakota Governor Larry Rhoden.\n\nA side trip to North Dakota for Independence Day also included a speech to promote the president's signature legislation and a family visit to the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.\n\nThe vice president's other domestic trips included visit to a hurricane disaster area in Damascus, Virginia, a trip to East Palestine, Ohio to check in on cleanup from the train wreck, a trip to the border in Texas, and manufacturing centers in Michigan and South Carolina.\n\nVance might be surprised that Democrats claimed his day-long trip to Greenland with Usha in March was considered a vacation, as they traveled to a remote Space Force base for a speech and a visit with some of the troops before boarding the plane for home.\n\nAt this point, the official Vance family vacations include a weekend ski trip to Vermont in March and a trip to Disneyland in California which fell on a Saturday. \n\n'Sorry to all the people who were at Disneyland for the longer lines, but we had a very good time,' Vance said afterward. \n\nVance's so-called 'vacation' in Ohio was the vice president choosing to go canoeing with his family on a Saturday, just minutes away from his home in Cincinnati. \n\nIt was how the vice president wanted to celebrate his birthday, but it ended up making headlines.\n\nWhat used to be a simple trip down the river turned out to be a fiasco, as Secret Service coordinated with local officials to temporarily raise the water levels in river to prevent security boats from getting grounded.\n\nFor the vice president, it was all part of the public circus that follows him wherever he and his family goes — very different from his life as a U.S. senator. \n\nVance does not pretend, however, that he and the family do not enjoy the perks that come with the job, hinting that one day, he and his family may end up in more tropical locations.\n\n'Hopefully, we can find some excuse as vice president of the United States to go to Hawaii,' Vance said in a podcast interview with Katie Miller. 'Kamala Harris went to Hawaii, so we should be able to find some excuse to go to Hawaii.","summary":"Republicans and allies of Vice President JD Vance have singled out Democrats for ridicule after they accused him of spending too much of his time in office on vacation.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15040405/jd-vance-swanky-summer-vacations-democrats.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/30/15/101609053-0-image-a-31_1756565668424.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-30 14:54:43","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.018},{"id":355993454,"title":"'Watch our backs': Trump official claims an astrologer stalked him and threatened his wife","text":"Despite his history of making extreme statements and promoting wild conspiracy theories, far-right Anthony J.
