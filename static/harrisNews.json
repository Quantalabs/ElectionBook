ABC has reportedly begun to scrutinize \"The View\" as one of the most prominent shows on television known for far-left rhetoric. The Daily Beast reported about an apparent rift between the hosts of the show and the top brass at the company, going all the way up to Disney CEO Bob Iger, concerning a desire for the hosts to cool off the politics. O’Donnell, one of Trump’s most outspoken critics, wrote in a on TikTok, \"You know what I just read today? ABC is ‘reviewing the liberal bias’ on The View. The VIEW. The show with five women speaking the own opinions - That's the threat now. They say they're not canceling it— they're just ‘reviewing the bias.’ Which is code for - we're gonna cancel it we're just trying to soften you up first.\" 'THE VIEW' HOST SUNNY HOSTIN WARNS COLBERT CANCELLATION COULD LEAD TO THE 'DISMANTLING OF OUR CONSTITUTION' \"Apparently, the truth is dangerous now,\" she continued. \"They say they want ‘balance.’ But what they mean is silence. Silence anything that doesn't praise the orange messiah and his golden escalator of lies.\" \"This isn't about bias - This is about obedience. This is about removing any program that doesn't align with Trumpism — soft fascism in full lashes with commercial breaks,\" she said, before appearing to paraphrase a famous poem about the Holocaust, \"First they came for the journalists Then the educators Then the librarians Now, it's Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg. It would be funny if it weren't so terrifying.\" \"We are in a dictatorship with good lighting,\" O’Donnell added. \"I used to think the First Amendment meant something. I used to think you couldn't just erase a voice because it made you uncomfortable.\" O’Donnell went on to conclude that rather than getting quieter, women should \"speak louder\" and \"take up space.\" \"We stand together and say what is true, even when it shakes the walls. Because the most dangerous sound in the world is a woman who knows what she's talking about— and refuses to stop,\" she wrote. Fox News Digital reached out to \"The View\" and ABC for comment.

It’s no surprise that ‘The View’s ratings hit an all-time low last year.

Trump’s parroting of their brand of hate has reportedly increased interest and recruitment in the group.\n\nAryan Freedom Network describes itself as a “white racialist” group and has called for white people to “take back our land.”\n\nThe unity between the Trump-led MAGA movement and previously ostracized white supremacist groups has occurred alongside a rise in white supremacist violence. In 2020, 13% of extremist demonstrations and violent acts involved white nationalists, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project, as reported by Reuters. That has grown every year since, and by 2024, almost 80% of those events involved white supremacists.\n\nIn the future, it will be more difficult to obtain data on white supremacist violence because the Trump administration has cut or scaled back federal programs collecting such data and countering such domestic terrorism. Naturally, that is a boon to the movement.\n\nIt probably isn’t a coincidence that the most visible instance of political violence with white supremacist overtones was the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. That insurrection was led by pro-Trump forces and initiated by Trump as a way to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. At the beginning of his second term, Trump pardoned many of the offenders, thereby sanctioning their violent acts.\n\nEchoing the white supremacist movement, Trump has repeatedly sought to erase gains made during the historic Civil Rights movement. His administration has purged acknowledgement of milestone accomplishments by Black, Latino, and LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nAs part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s attack on government agencies, racists loyal to Trump benefactor Elon Musk were installed and supported in the administration. Most notably, as part of Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been deployed to engage in street-level thuggery to harass, manhandle, and abuse migrant populations and the communities that support them.\n\nIn one of the more open endorsements of the type of white supremacy that groups like Aryan Freedom Network espouse, Trump has gone about restoring statues and military base names meant to honor pro-slavery Confederates.\n\nThe administration’s allies are on a neo-Nazi kick as well. Musk has allowed pro-Nazi content to flourish and thrive on his social media site, X, formerly Twitter. Musk has expressed support for Nazi-affiliated parties around the world, including the extremist Alternative for Germany party.\n\nOn Fox News, host Greg Gutfeld recently argued that conservatives should tell each other “What up, my Nazi? Hey, what up, my Nazi?” to mock Americans’ sensitivities to racism. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, one of the biggest Trump backers in media, posted a meme on Wednesday that argued “We Are ALL Hitler” after Musk and Trump were criticized for making Nazi-style salutes.\n\nThe affiliation between Trump and the neo-Nazi right was a topic of concern raised by then-Vice President Kamala Harris during her presidential campaign last year.\n\n“I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people,” Harris said last September.\n\nNow the tragedy has come to pass.","summary":"Neo-Nazi groups are praising President Donald Trump for bringing their bigoted ideas and rhetoric into the mainstream of American politics.

Her suit was the most militant lawfare I encountered during my year of investigative research for the book.\n\nAs I noted earlier this week:\n\nLetitia “Tish” James is a partisan Democrat who ran and won her race for New York Attorney General specifically to try to destroy Trump. She is one of the most open and public practitioners of lawfare featured in the book. She once told a group of New York Democrats that “I look forward to going into the office of the Attorney General every day, suing [Trump], and then going home.” She uses the law to advance political goals, and she doesn’t hide that fact. Despite rising crime in New York during her tenure as state AG, she seems entirely fixated on getting Trump.\n\nHere are eight clear examples that prove James had no intention of ever affording President Trump equal protection under the law.\n\n1. Targeted Prosecution\n\n“We’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass. He’s going to know my name personally.” That’s what James said when assuming office, on video. She didn’t take long to make good on that promise. “We will use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family as well,” she stated a month after the election. This is the definition of a witch hunt.\n\nIn fact, James barely even paid lip service to addressing the rising criminality in New York so that she could stay narrowly focused on Trump (and hosting drag story hour read-a-thons).\n\n“The number one issue in this country is defeating Donald Trump. Nothing else matters,” James said.\n\nThat’s saying the quiet part out loud.\n\n2. She Prosecuted a Victimless (Non-)Crime\n\nThe crux of James’s suit against the Trumps was that they undervalued properties to gain better rates on loans, insurance policies, and tax rates. Who was the victim here of the evil Trump Organization? Apparently, it was corporations, specifically multibillion-dollar financial institutions that loaned money to the Trump family.\n\nSo, what did these corporations say when they filed complaints about Trump? Ah! But there were no complaints. The supposedly victimized banks and lenders liked working with the Trump Organization, so far as I can tell. It was James who brought the case on behalf of financial institutions that never claimed for a moment to be harmed.\n\nThe only harm in a business transaction is financial harm, and representatives of these institutions got onto the witness stand and under oath said they were not harmed and did not suffer.\n\nThis was literally unprecedented. It was the first time in state history that someone was accused of fraud even though no one believed that they had been harmed.\n\n3. Blatantly Undervaluing Mar-a-Lago to Justify Abuse\n\nMuch of the case hinged on the valuation of Trump’s legendary Mar- a-Lago property in Florida. The resort and club, which is a National Historic Landmark and has been Trump’s primary residence since 2019, was assessed a value in the range of $18 million to $28 million between 2011 and 2021. The court insisted these weren’t his figures, but the valuation of a basic Palm Beach assessment. The appraiser’s office is tasked with assessing property value for taxation purpose. Trump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million, according to the suit, which the judge declared was “an overvaluation of at least 2,300%, compared to the assessor’s appraisal.” Trump, on the other hand, testified that he believed the property is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\nOne-acre properties in the area routinely hit the real estate market in the $40 million price range, and two-acre homes in the area often are priced between $150 million and $200 million. Mar-a-Lago isn’t merely a unique historic landmark; it is 17 acres of beachfront property. Despite the sheer magnitude and the historical significance of the location, James and company advanced the opinion it was worth only a fraction of properties a tenth its size.\n\nThe court’s valuation of Mar-a-Lago was perhaps 1/50th its actual worth. This is “criminal” in the figurative sense, perhaps the literal sense too.\n\n4. Illicit White House Visits\n\nPublicly available records show that Tish James visited the Biden White House several times during the investigation and trial. First, on April 8, 2022, for a celebration of Ketanji Brown Jackson; then on July 18, 2022, to meet with Kamala Harris along with other attorneys general; and then on August 31, 2023, for an event honoring black women. It is possible but unknown at this time if she discussed Trump’s trial during these visits.\n\nI spoke to President Trump about these visits, and he is of the belief that she was coordinating with the Biden White House about the case.\n\nThis ought to be a major focus of the DOJ’s investigation.\n\n5. A Criminal Trial in Civil Court\n\nOne of the dead giveaways that Tish James was not even attempting to play fair was that she carried out the case as if it were taking place in a criminal court and the Trump family were crooks—despite the fact that the case was filed in civil court.\n\nThere are several distinctions between civil and criminal law, but the most relevant here is that most criminal cases are prosecuted by officials who represent a state, country, or some other jurisdiction. Civil cases are typically brought by an aggrieved party who believes that they are the victim of some wrongdoing. In this instance, the chief law enforcement officer for New York brought a civil case, not a criminal one, against Trump.\n\nShe did that because there was no criminal wrongdoing alleged.\n\nThe banks regarded Trump as a “whale,” an ideal business partner. He made every payment on time. He paid every dollar owed. The financial institutions made every nickel they expected to make from their dealings with him. Trump told me he even had a tendency to pay back loans early, even if he incurred penalties, ensuring that banks were happy with their relationship.\n\nYet Tish James took the position that Trump had conned them. The tenor of the suit suggested that he was an evildoer and needed to be punished.\n\n6. Creating a New Crime to Get Trump\n\nTish James was essentially creating a law out of whole cloth. She relied on New York Executive Law §63(12), which gives the authority broad power to investigate and prosecute civil fraud against consumers. It was typically used to go after con men who swindled sweet little grannies out of their savings, not real estate developers who sign agreements with sophisticated banks — banks who then told the court that they received every dime they were due on time and that they would do business with Trump again.\n\n“They tried me on a statute like it was consumer fraud, like I stole a refrigerator,” Trump told me in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe law was applied uniquely—and more harshly—than ever before.\n\n7. Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\nTrump was initially assessed a $464 million fine for this victimless (non-)crime. This is not just confiscatory, it’s appallingly excessive.\n\nThe New York Supreme Court Appellate Division—the intermediate court in New York— reduced his bond to $175 million. As of March 2025 (when I last interviewed President Trump), they still had his money.\n\nTrump ought to pursue the appeal all the way to our nation’s top court. At a minimum, I expect the Supreme Court to rule that penalizing him half a billion dollars for a victimless violation violates the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause. “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted,” the amendment reads. Notice how the language does not specify whether the excessive fine is related to a criminal or a civil matter, so Trump’s attorneys can certainly use this argument.\n\nNo other president in U.S. history could have survived this type of penalty. It is the definition of cruel and unusual.\n\n8. Election Interference\n\nThe fact that this case was allowed to go on is outrageous. The fact that it took place during the middle of a presidential election is a national disgrace.\n\nThis New York attorney general has always sought to destroy Trump and is clearly abusing her power to do so. (The judge in this juryless case does not seem to be operating on a rational plane. More on that in my book.)\n\nAs I concluded in Breaking the Law:\n\nThe most powerful law enforcement officer in a massively powerful state used her power to target and attempt to character-assassinate one of the state’s most successful residents on naked political grounds. It wasn’t merely excessive; this was a low moment for our country.\nJustice must be served, and Trump must win his appeal.\nThen Tish James ought to be prosecuted for conspiracy against rights.\n\nI’m heartened to learn that the DOJ intends to hold James accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nThe investigations should then extend far beyond James and Jack Smith. Only then can we begin to dismantle the lawfare superstructure.\n\nAs Tish James is fond of saying herself, “[N]o one is above the law.”\n\nThis article was adapted from portions of Breaking the Law.\n\nBreaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, which has been hailed by President Trump as a “must read” book, is available in hardcover, eReader format, and as an audiobook read by the author himself.\n\nAlex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, and the host of “The Alex Marlow Show” podcast produced weekdays by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

It is collapsing right in front of you.”\n\nAbrams brought up the subject by playing a clip of Carville on his show in February, where he declared that the Trump administration was “collapsing” and would be falling apart within 30 days.\n\nAbrams asked the strategist Thursday if he still stood by the prediction. \n\nCarville replied, saying he was “a pretty smart guy in February.”\n\nHe defended the months-old prediction, stating, “You look at what’s happening, and you look at the current stuff that’s coming in – the public has revulsions against this.”\n\nHe pointed to Democratic candidates leading in upcoming elections, like the governor’s race in Virginia, saying that proves Trump’s demise is underway.\n\n“Do you know how much we’re going to win by in Virginia?” he asked. \n\n“Do you have any idea?”\n\n“No, I don’t,” Abrams responded. \n\n“It’s gonna be a lot,” Carville declared. \n\n“It’s not going to be close.”\n\nA recent Virginia Commonwealth Poll from July has Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears at 37% and Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger at 49%. \n\nStill, Abrams wasn’t convinced. \n\n“But you said that you thought that this administration was in the midst of a collapse.”\n\n“I think it is. Yes, I do,” Carville shot back.\n\n“And you think you were right?” Abrams asked. \n\nCarville didn’t back down, stating, “Yes. I think there are — they’re somewhere about 37% or 40% approval. Their economic numbers are terrible, are just terrible. And I think we’re running away with every election we’ve had. We’re going to run away with Virginia. We’re going to win New Jersey. We’re starting to recruit every candidate that we want.”\n\nAbrams continued pushing, mentioning polling showing that Trump isn’t exactly in the midst of collapsing.\n\n“I pulled up the recent approval polling from The New York Times and Real Clear Politics, and the aggregation puts Trump’s approval between 44 and 45.8, with 53 and 51.4 disapproval, as of August the 6th. That’s not a collapse. That’s basically a little bit above where he was.”\n\nCarville dismissed the numbers, saying the polling for upcoming elections “in no way reflect that.” \n\n“I don’t want to get into saying this poll, that poll, this aggregate poll; but I look at like the UMass Amherst poll, I look at Gallup, I look at people like that. I see something completely different. I’m very, very, very confident that this administration is going to be widely rejected in the elections coming up; and they’re gonna be particularly widely rejected in the elections in 2026,” he said.\n\nOne of Carville’s more recent predictions didn’t go so well. \n\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, the political veteran was so convinced that Kamala Harris would win, he wrote a column for the New York Times titled, “Three Reasons I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Win.”\n\nCarville’s column slammed Trump as a “repeat electoral loser” and claimed “This time will be no different,” while heaping praise on the Democratic nominee.","summary":"Democratic strategist James Carville claims he was right in predicting that the Trump administration would collapse within 30 days of President Donald Trump’s second term.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/08/media/james-carville-doubles-down-for-predicting-trump-admin-collapse-says-its-happening-now/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/109372306.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7JUYqxS7-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-08 21:35:42","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":349444898,"title":"Republican Lawmakers Speaking Out Against Redistricting Battle","text":"As the redistricting arms race heats up, a handful of Republican lawmakers have been critical of the Texas GOP's effort to redraw its state's congressional boundaries.Why It MattersTexas, with the support of President Donald Trump, kicked off the redistricting battle with a map that would place five Democrats in districts he won by double digits in last year's election. That effort is on pause as Democratic legislators left the state to deny a quorum for a vote. But other states, led by Democrats and Republicans, could follow suit.What To KnowSome Republicans have criticized states like California and New York mulling redraws but have not commented on Texas. But at least three Republican members of Congress have voiced opposition to Texas' redistricting efforts while also criticizing Democratic states' efforts to redraw their maps.Representative Kevin Kiley, CaliforniaKiley has introduced a bill that would prohibit any state from engaging in mid-decade redistricting.During an interview with WBUR, Boston's NPR affiliate, on Friday, Kiley voiced opposition to the Texas efforts.\"I don't think gerrymandering is a good thing. I think it's a problem wherever it occurs, whether it's in a Republican state or a Democrat state, and I especially think it's bad when it's happening in an unscheduled way, as we're seeing right now,\" Kiley said.When asked about whether it is appropriate for Texas Democrats to be pressured to return—whether by threats to remove the lawmakers who left the state from office or have the FBI locate them—Kiley said people watching the redistricting battle are thinking, \"This is nuts.\"\"This is not the way that the process is supposed to work,\" he said. \"This is not the way politics and representative government is supposed to work, and I think the whole spectacle just underscores the need to have a return to sanity here.\"If California redraws its map, Kiley's district could be redrawn to take in more Democratic areas. Trump carried the district by about four points last year, though Kiley won reelection by about 11 points.Representative Mike Lawler, New YorkLawler is another Republican whose district could be at risk of becoming more Democratic if New York redraws its map. He already represents a district won by former Vice President Kamala Harris last November and is a top target for Democrats as they try to reclaim a House majority.He has introduced a bill to end partisan gerrymandering nationwide as well as mid-decade redistricting.He told CNN this week that he believes what Texas is doing is \"wrong.\"\"The problem is that across the country, gerrymandering has been happening after each successive census, and it's created less competitive districts,\" he said. \"There's very little room in terms of trying to pick up seats.\"Representative Blake Moore, UtahMoore has also spoken out against the redistricting efforts by Texas.\"I do not agree with state efforts to redistrict mid-decade. It undermines established norms and gives blue states a glaring green light to do the same,\" he told local news station KSL. \"Partisan gerrymandering is clearly done by both sides, but to allow this wildfire to spread mid-decade is a step too far.\"When reached by Newsweek, a Moore spokesperson referred to that statement.Newsweek also reached out to Kiley's and Lawler's offices for comment via email.Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, shared a meme about the redistricting battle, comparing Texas Democrats leaving the state to Republicans leaving Washington to avoid a vote on legislation to compel the release of the Epstein files.What People Are SayingHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told Fox News: \"California has a problem. They've got to amend the state Constitution, as I understand the law out there, to do it. We have to fight for every inch of ground in the country. We are in an era of very small margins, as you said, because of gerrymandering and redistricting. But they have to follow the law. I'm convinced the red states will, and we will probably have a few more seats out of that, of course, and that's good news for me.\"New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said during a press conference on Monday: \"If Republicans are willing to rewrite these rules to give themselves an advantage, then they're leaving us no choice; we must do the same. There's a phrase, 'You have to fight fire with fire.' That is a true statement of how we're feeling right now. And as I've said, another overused but applicable phrase, 'All is fair in love and war'— that's why I'm exploring with our leaders every option to redraw our state congressional lines as soon as possible.\"What Happens NextOn Friday, Republicans in Texas were again denied a quorum to pass their redistricting effort. GOP leaders in the state have been considering expulsion of members who left the state, and the FBI could locate the lawmakers. How other states' redistricting efforts play out remains to be seen.","summary":"Some GOP lawmakers have criticized the mid-decade effort by Texas Republicans to redraw the state's congressional boundaries.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-lawmakers-speaking-out-redistricting-battle-2111089","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699466/rep-kevin-kiley-redistricting.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e8e0a1b39573ad2d7ed3f4fe788fdcad","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 21:24:39","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":349446198,"title":"Three years after Mar-a-Lago raid, a powerful Trump looks to settle scores","text":"“This is a stark reminder of a dark time in our country’s history when political enemies of President Trump disgustingly weaponized the justice system to go after him,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said as the anniversary arrived. “The American people saw right through the lies and President Trump was completely vindicated as he overwhelmingly won the 2024 election in historic fashion.”\n\nThe Aug. 8, 2022, raid of Mar-a-Lago was one of many events that Trump described as lawfare in between his first and second terms, including the prosecution of hundreds of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot participants, numerous court cases in multiple states against Trump himself, and even a conviction on 34 felony counts in New York.\n\nWhile some of those later events, in particular Trump’s first indictment in Manhattan in April 2023, were credited with fueling his comeback over GOP rivals such as Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), the raid came before he announced he was running again.\n\nRepublican strategist Dave Carney said that Trump was going to be a force to be reckoned with, no matter what, in the 2024 election cycle, but the raid jump-started his incredible comeback.\n\n“It was a catalyst for the validation of the entire argument that Trump had been making up to that point about criminalization, politicization, and lawfare,” Carney said. “It just proved how desperate [President Joe] Biden’s team was.”\n\nTrump had already returned some records to the National Archives in January of 2022, after the agency identified records from his first term that were not in its possession.\n\nBut the raid came unannounced, while Trump was in another state, leading to outrage among the then-former president and his supporters.\n\n“These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump said in a statement that night, claiming agents even “broke into [his] safe.”\n\n“Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before,” Trump continued. “After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024.”\n\nRequests for comment sent to the FBI and Justice Department were not returned. \n\nThree months after the raid, Trump announced his third run for president at the same Mar-a-Lago mansion where the FBI executed its search warrant. Initially, there was some doubt about Trump’s viability against younger upstarts, but he quickly showed his strength and was boosted by the continuation of various court cases against him.\n\n“The decline of America is being forced upon us by Biden and the radical left lunatics running our government right into the ground,” Trump said the night he announced his third run. “This decline is not a fate we must accept.”\n\nAccording to the FBI’s search warrant, agents were directed to seize from the resort “any government and/or Presidential Records created between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021,” as well as “any evidence of the knowing alteration, destruction, or concealment of any government and/or Presidential Records, or of any documents with classification markings.”\n\nAmong the items that the FBI reportedly obtained were Trump’s executive grant of clemency for Roger Stone, information pertaining to the “President of France,” two binders of photos, a handwritten note, and other documents marked confidential, secret, or top secret.\n\nBiden’s staff insisted that he was not aware of the raid and “not briefed” beforehand, but that didn’t stop Trump from attacking him over the issue, especially when classified documents were later foundat Biden’s own Delaware home.\n\n“[The raid] was a hugely gigantic political blunder by the Democrats,” Carney said.\n\nTrump later sued the Justice Department for $100 million in damages in August of 2024, arguing that the search was an “intrusion upon seclusion, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.”\n\nIn the end, the raid was not enough to keep Trump from re-entering the White House, while Biden was forced to drop out of his own reelection bid in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter retaking office, Trump had all of the documents flown back to Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 28, 2025, the same day as his famous blowup with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. \n\nThe boxes were loaded onto Air Force One that evening in full view of reporters ahead of a flight from Washington to Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump spent the weekend playing golf.\n\nDuring the flight, Counselor to the President Alina Habba told reporters that the search was never justified and that items were taken from Barron Trump’s closet and from first lady Melania Trump’s closet.\n\n“It is truly an honor and full circle to be on this trip,” Habba said. “The boxes are going back, and frankly, this was a hoax, as we knew. … They went into drawers they shouldn’t have. They made a mockery of our justice system, and this is a perfect example.”\n\nHabba said the raid looked like something from a “third world country,” adding that, “In America, you do not get to go to somebody’s home, raid their children’s, their wife’s, their personal belongings… we don’t operate that way in this country.”\n\nNow, with Kash Patel installed as FBI director, many agents involved in the raid have been let go as Trump reworks the federal bureaucracy to fit his vision. \n\nThe Mar-a-Lago raid also led to the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who led the investigation into the Trump classified documents case and into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. But Smith himself is now under investigation, with the tables of power now turned against him and Trump ready to bring what he sees as accountability to the people who engaged in lawfare between his presidential terms. \n\nOther examples of that phenomenon include the Biden autopen investigation, a grand jury investigation to weigh “Russiagate” conspiracy charges against former Obama administration officials, and even subpoenas for Bill and Hillary Clinton as part of an investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIronically, Trump’s own court victories could now help shield Clinton and Obama, as the Supreme Court ruled that presidents enjoy some immunity from prosecution related to their official acts, a fact now weighing in favor of Trump’s Democratic predecessors. \n\nIn any case, the Mar-a-Lago boxes are back in Florida, and Trump now says that they will eventually be displayed in his presidential library. And while it appears that Trump will have the last laugh in the matter, that doesn’t mean that Trump and his team will ever let it go lightly.\n\nTrump to appoint adviser Stephen Miran as Fed governor\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said that the raiders themselves were trying to cover up evidence of their own wrongdoing.\n\n“The Mar-a-Lago raid was a perpetuation and continuation of this same conspiracy,” Miller said. “They went and searched in hopes of trying to recover the documents that would implicate their own criminal conduct. The entire raid was a perpetuation of this same criminal scheme.”","summary":"Three years ago, the FBI raided former President Donald Trump&#8216;s Mar-a-Lago home, taking away 26 boxes that officials said included documents with classified markings.

New poll finds crowded field","text":"A new poll finds Democratic former congresswoman Katie Porter leads a crowded field in the 2026 California governor’s race, after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced last month she would not launch a bid for the state’s highest office.\n\nBut with Harris taking herself out of the race, and possibly eyeing another presidential campaign, a significant segment of likely voters remains undecided when it comes to who should replace Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nPorter, a favorite among progressives who represented Orange County in the U.S. House of Representatives until this year, leads with 18% of voters, up from 12% in April, according to the poll by Emerson College.\n\nThe poll comes as Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, the first woman elected to the office, announced Friday she is dropping out of the race and launching a campaign for state treasurer. She had just 3% support in the poll.\n\nConservative political commentator Steve Hilton, the leading Republican candidate, came in second with 12%. He’s followed by Republican Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 7%, former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5% and billionaire Los Angeles real estate developer Rick Caruso, a Republican-turned-Democrat who has yet to officially jump into the race, at 4%.\n\nThe poll, taken earlier this month, found 38% were undecided, down from 54% in April.\n\nJack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College, said that while the early results are good news for Porter, who lost to Adam Schiff in a bid for U.S. Senate last year, he expected the numbers to move significantly between now and Election Day.\n\n“If I were running one of the campaigns in the low single digits, I’d say we have a lot of room to grow,” he said.\n\nIn a fundraising email Friday, the Porter campaign said the poll showed she is the “clear Democratic frontrunner, with a 13-point lead over the next closest Democrat.”\n\nOn the social media platform X, meanwhile, the Hilton campaign sought to frame the results as confirming a “two-horse race for California governor: Katie Porter v. Steve Hilton.” The state’s last Republican governor was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who held the position from 2003 to 2011.\n\nCalifornia will hold a gubernatorial primary election, including candidates from all parties, on June 2, 2026. The top two vote-getters from the primary will then face off in the general election on November 3, 2026. Newsom, a likely contender for president in 2028, is termed out.\n\n“At this moment, I believe I can make the greatest impact by focusing on California’s financial future,” Kounalakis said in a statement.\n\nPitney said her departure may free up donors who would have backed Kounalakis, a former real estate developer, to support more conservative candidates.\n\n“She had a reputation as a more centrist, business-friendly Democrat,” he said.\n\nThe poll also found that Newsom leads California’s possible contenders in a Democratic presidential primary with 23%. He’s followed by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg at 17%, former Vice President Kamala Harris at 11% and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 9%.\n\nOn the Republican side, 40% support Vice President JD Vance, 10% support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy and 9% support Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nNewsom holds a 44% job approval rating, with 38% disapproving, according to the poll.\n\nOn Friday, the governor hosted Texas Democrats who fled the state in an effort to block redistricting efforts there aimed at electing more Republicans to Congress in next year’s midterm elections. To counter Republicans in Texas, Newsom has floated putting a measure on the statewide ballot allowing California to update its congressional map to benefit Democrats.\n\nThe Emerson poll found 33% support Newsom’s proposal, while 25% oppose and 42% are unsure.\n\n“Support to redraw the state’s congressional map ahead of the Midterm Elections is strongest among Democrats by a 23-point margin, 42% to 19%, and opposed by an eight-point margin among Republicans, 36% to 28%. A majority of independent voters are unsure, while 25% oppose and 23% support,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a statement.\n\nThe poll also found the economy remains the top issue for 30% of California voters, though down from 40% in April. Next came housing affordability at 19%, immigration at 15%, threats to democracy at 13% and health care at 8%.","summary":"The poll comes after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced she would not launch a bid.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/08/california-governor-porter-newsom/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OCR-L-PORTERGOV-0312-10.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 20:14:03","author":"Ethan Varian","authors":["Ethan Varian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":349445942,"title":"GOLDBERG: Kamala Harris won’t cure what’s ailing the Democratic Party ","text":"It’s not all Harris’ fault.

A black-and-yellow banner covering a billboard on the 91 Freeway in Corona boldly states: \"Proud Boys Love Sydney Sweeney,\" according to a photo that one Corona resident shared with ABC7. The banner, which uses the neo-fascist group's signature colors, also references the hot-button American Eagle ad. \"She has the best blue genes,\" the banner says. Note \"genes,\" not \"jeans.\" It's worth remembering that President Trump during a 2020 presidential debate ordered the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" when pressed about condemning right-wing violent extremists. It's unclear who put up the banner bearing the far-right group's name, according to ABC7. A representative for Sweeney did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment on Friday. Earlier this month, jeans retailer American Eagle dropped a string of commercials for its latest campaign featuring the \"Euphoria\" star. In one advertisement, the Emmy-nominated actor who is blond says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue,” she says. Posters for the American Eagle campaign also featured the totally innovative, never-before-seen wordplay on \"jeans\" and genes.\" A slogan reads, \"Sydney Sweeney has great genes,\" with the final word crossed out and replaced with \"jeans.\" Sweeney, who seems to have a penchant for odd marketing opportunities, and the ads quickly faced criticism on social media, with users alleging the campaign leaned into the language of eugenics. Eugenics is a discredited practice that essentially touted the idea of improving the human race through selective breeding. It gained traction in the early 20th century and was used as a justification for Hitler's Nazi Germany to wipe out millions of Jewish people, and U.S. authorities to forcibly sterilize more than 60,000 people in California and more than 30 other states. In an attempt to quell the ire, American Eagle posted a statement stating that its campaign \"is and always was about the jeans.\" Sweeney and the American Eagle campaign notably found support among the conservative crowd — it wasn't the first time for the 27-year-old \"Immaculate\" actor. Days after the ad dropped, public records revealing her most recent voter registration history resurfaced, unveiling she registered as a Republican in June 2024. Trump found that irresistible to post about on his Truth Social platform. “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there. It’s for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.’ Go get ‘em Sydney!” he posted Monday. In an earlier version of his post, Trump misspelled the actor's name as \"Sidney Sweeney.\" He also used the post to diss brands he claimed used \"woke\" marketing, including Jaguar and Bud Light. Trump also couldn't resist throwing shade at pop star Taylor Swift, who openly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election. Amid the fashion fracas and social media discourse, it seems neither Sweeney nor American Eagle had anything to lose. Sweeney shrugged off her latest bout of controversy last week as she was spotted doing karaoke with some \"Euphoria\" co-stars in Santa Monica. She also hit the red carpet on Monday to promote her latest film, \"Americana,\" from writer-director Tony Tost. American Eagle, on the other hand, saw its stock surge this week.","summary":"As Sydney Sweeney remains mum on the backlash to her American Eagle jeans ad, a defaced billboard in SoCal claims she has new supporters: neo-fascist group the Proud Boys.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-08-08/sydney-sweeney-proud-boys-socal-billboard","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/595b5a1/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5349x3565+0+0/resize/1486x990!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9d%2F2d%2Fbe65bb794afa99a6ba2db1ab6f06%2Fknicks-nets-basketbal","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 18:49:34","author":"Alexandra Del Rosario","authors":["Alexandra Del Rosario"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.25},{"id":349412786,"title":"Dem ‘Blueprint’ Promised By Hakeem Jeffries Still Nowhere To Be Seen At Self-Imposed Deadline","text":"House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries pledged to roll out a plan articulating Democrats’ policy agenda — explicitly not about President Donald Trump — by August 8, but appears likely to miss his self-imposed deadline.\n\nJeffries committed to unveiling a “blueprint for a better America” that would specify what Democrats stand for within 100 days of delivering an address on April 30. Though Jeffries and House Democrats have continued to beat the drum torching the president and his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the caucus has largely steered clear of rolling out any policy proposals reminiscent of a “blueprint” — and appears likely to miss his Friday deadline of specifying any policy details.

And you will see a vision for this country’s future that isn’t about Donald Trump.

Their economic numbers are terrible, are just terrible. And I think we’re running away with every election we’ve had. We’re going to run away with Virginia. We’re going to win New Jersey. We’re starting to recruit every candidate that we want.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Abrams continued pushing, mentioning polling showing that Trump isn’t exactly in the midst of collapsing. \"I pulled up the recent approval polling from The New York Times and Real Clear Politics, and the aggregation puts Trump’s approval between 44 and 45.8, with 53 and 51.4 disapproval, as of August the 6th. That’s not a collapse. That’s basically a little bit above where he was.\" Carville dismissed the numbers, saying the polling for upcoming elections \"in no way reflect that.\" \"I don’t want to get into saying this poll, that poll, this aggregate poll; but I look at like the UMass Amherst poll, I look at Gallup, I look at people like that. I see something completely different. I’m very, very, very confident that this administration is going to be widely rejected in the elections coming up; and they’re gonna be particularly widely rejected in the elections in 2026,\" he said. One of Carville's more recent predictions didn't go so well. In the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, the political veteran was so convinced that Kamala Harris would win, he wrote a column for the New York Times titled, \"Three Reasons I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Win.\" Carville's column slammed Trump as a \"repeat electoral loser\" and claimed \"This time will be no different,\" while heaping praise on the Democratic nominee.

Gov. Geoff Duncan says President Donald Trump's social media attacks criticizing his move from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party validates his major switch in political affiliations. \"Failed former Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan, of Georgia, is a total loser,\" Trump wrote early Friday on his Truth Social platform. The president charged that Duncan was \"never able to get anything done, all he ever did was complain. We didn’t want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I’m told he became a Democrat. Good riddance Geoff. You don’t even have a chance!!!\" Asked about the criticisms, Duncan told Fox News Digital in an exclusive national interview hours later, \"I think he's making my case for me that the Republican Party no longer wants to love their neighbor. There's nothing in that tweet or Truth Social post or whatever that shows any sort of attitude that I want to be a part of.\" FORMER LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN ABANDONS GOP TO JOIN DEMOCRATIC PARTY \"So I wish him the best of luck. I hope he figures out how to run this country better than he is now for the next couple of years. But I'm proud to not be a Republican, especially with him at the tip of the spear,\" Duncan highlighted. In announcing his decision, Duncan cited several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, including health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and poverty. He wrote that his time in office taught him the best way to \"love my neighbor\" is through public policy. Duncan told Fox News, \"I find it easier to love my neighbor as a Democrat It's not a perfect landing spot, but it gives me a better opportunity each day when I wake up to love my neighbor.\" GEORGIA GOP EXPELS FORMER LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN FROM PARTY, CITING ALLEGED DISLOYALTY Duncan, a former health care executive and minor league baseball player, served in Georgia's legislature for four years before running and winning election as lieutenant governor in 2018. He decided against seeking re-election in 2022. After leaving office, Duncan – who was a vocal GOP critic of Trump's repeated efforts to reverse his razor-thin November 2020 election defeat in battleground Georgia to former President Joe Biden – worked towards what he said was \"healing and rebuilding a Republican Party that is damaged but not destroyed.\" Duncan endorsed Biden in the 2024 presidential race and later supported Vice President Kamala Harris after she replaced Biden at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket. Duncan spoke in a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last August. The Georgia Republican Party expelled him from the GOP earlier this year. \"Neither party is hitting it out of the park. You don't have to look any further than the stats to see that Republicans have their issues. Democrats certainly have their issues,\" Duncan told Fox News. \"I've tried this reform thing before on the Republican side, and Donald Trump has sucked the life and future out of the Republican Party, in my opinion.\" Duncan's old boss, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, is term-limited and cannot seek re-election next year. Duncan confirmed to Fox News that he's considering a 2026 run for governor. \"My family and I are certainly not ready to make that big of a decision right here, right now. But it is something that we're considering for sure. I mean, my phone has continued to ring for months on end, from Democrats, independents and even some folks on the right that want us to consider this,\" Duncan said. Asked about his timetable, Duncan said \"2026 is coming like a freight train. And certainly, if this is a decision that we go forward with, it'll have to be within, within a few months.\" Duncan emphasized that \"if Democrats, especially in Georgia, want to be successful, they're going to have to live in the middle and not the fringes. They're going to have to have a moderate slate of candidates that are able to use common sense to provide their leadership. And I think there's a gravitational pull in that direction.\" Nearly half-a-dozen Democrats in Georgia have already launched gubernatorial campaigns, including former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who later worked in the Biden administration. Pointing to the two leading Republicans running for governor, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and state Attorney General Chris Carr, Duncan said \"I hope we're able to sit back and find a Democratic candidate that can win the governorship and not allow a governor Trump to show up for four years in the state, because that's exactly what's going to happen.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The Republican slate is going to be dominated by whoever Donald Trump endorses, and that person is going to be a sock puppet for Donald Trump,\" Duncan argued. \"And no Georgian wants that. No Georgian wants the inconsistencies of Donald Trump to manage how their kids are educated, how their streets are kept safe and how government interacts with those that need it the most.\" Looking ahead to next year's elections, when Georgia will once again be in the national spotlight, Duncan said \"Georgia is going to continue to be the political center of the universe, as we watch the Senate race shape up. As we watch this governor's race shape up.

She ultimately lost every swing state in November and garnered about 2.3 million fewer votes than her Republican opponent.What To KnowAn Emerson College poll of California voters released Friday shows Harris at 11 percent, trailing California Governor Gavin Newsom at 23 percent and former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg at 17 percent in a potential 2028 Democratic primary. Harris is, however, ahead of New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is at 9 percent.On the Republican side, 40 percent support Vice President JD Vance, 10 percent support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, and 9 percent support Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.The poll of roughly 1,000 California voters was conducted August 4 to 5 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.The results differ from a national Emerson poll in June, when Buttigieg led the Democratic pack with 16 percent followed by Harris at 13 percent, Newsom at 12 percent, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both 7 percent, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 5 percent, and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker at 3 percent. Twenty-three percent were undecided.However, that poll took into account U.S. voters and not just those from California.Camille Mumford, communications director for Emerson College Polling, told Newsweek via email on Friday that directly following the 2024 election, their November poll found Harris front of mind for Democratic voters who named her as their top choice for the nomination in 2028.\"Eight months later, voters appear to be looking for a new face as the nominee, and Harris has fallen into the pack of potential candidates,\" Mumford said. \"Harris performs strongest among Black Democratic primary voters nationally, 30 percent of whom supported her in June; and those in the Midwest and South, 16 percent of whom support Harris, compared to 9 percent of those in both the Northeast and West.\"Harris, who has a history in California as former district attorney, attorney general and U.S. Senator, lacked a strong home base in the 2020 Democratic primary, Mumford noted.In Emerson's September 2019 poll, Biden, Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren led the primary with Harris trailing in fourth place. She then dropped out in December of that year, ahead of the deadline for taking her name off of the California primary ballot.California Governor RaceNow that Harris has said she won't run for California governor, it's allowed other familiar faces in the state to garner more attention.Per the new Emerson poll, California voters find former Democratic Representative Katie Porter leading the primary for California governor with 18 percent, followed by Republican political commentator Steve Hilton at 12 percent, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 7 percent, and former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5 percent. About 38 percent remain undecided.What People Are SayingSpencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, in a statement: \"With Kamala Harris officially out of the race, Katie Porter has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, increasing her support from 12 percent to 18 percent since the April Emerson poll.\"Harris, in a statement released on X on July 30: \"Over the past six months, I have spent time reflecting on this moment in our nation's history and the best way for me to continue fighting for the American people and advancing the values and ideals I hold dear.\"I have given serious thought to asking the people of California for the privilege to serve as their governor. I love this state, its people and its promise. It is my home. But after deep reflection, I've decided that I will not run for Governor in this election.\"What Happens NextIt remains to be seen whether the former vice president will enter the 2028 presidential race.","summary":"\"Voters appear to be looking for a new face as the nominee,\" a polling expert told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-newsom-buttigieg-democrats-polls-2110800","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699144/kamala-harris.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=936fd57a72353730c7ecfa82bb2ec536","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 17:30:09","author":"Nick Mordowanec","authors":["Nick Mordowanec"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":349397056,"title":"Mary Peltola's Chances of Defeating Dan Sullivan in Alaska Senate Race—Poll","text":"A new poll of Alaska's 2026 Senate race showed Democratic former Representative Mary Peltola only one point behind incumbent GOP Senator Dan Sullivan.Newsweek reached out to Sullivan's campaign and the Alaska Democratic Party for comment via email.Why It MattersAlaska is among the states Democrats are hoping to make competitive in next year's Senate races, though it backed President Donald Trump by double-digits in the 2024 presidential race.Democrats must win at least two Senate races in double-digit Trump states to win back control of the Senate. Maine—which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by seven points—and North Carolina—which voted for Trump by only three points—are viewed as Democrats' top targets. However, no other Harris or single-digit Trump states are up for grabs, so they are looking at races in states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio and Texas as potential opportunities.What to KnowA new Data for Progress poll released on Friday suggested Alaska could be competitive if Peltola jumps into the race. Peltola represented Alaska's at-large Congressional seat from 2022 to 2025 and narrowly lost to GOP Representative Nick Begich III in November.She has not made her plans clear for 2026 but has been floated as a potential candidate in either the Senate or gubernatorial race.The polling memo wrote that Peltola is \"uniquely popular,\" being viewed positively by 52 percent of Alaskans despite the state's conservative bent.If she were to challenge Sullivan in the Senate race, the incumbent would hold only a one-point lead at this point in time, the poll found. Forty-six percent of respondents said they would vote for him, while 45 percent said they would cast their ballots for Peltola. An additional 5 percent said they would not rank either candidate, while 4 percent were still unsure.The survey was taken July 21 to 27 and polled 678 likely voters in Alaska using SMS and web panel respondents. The poll's margin of error associated with the sample size is ±4 percentage points.Notably, Alaska uses a ranked choice voting system. In the primary, the four candidates who receive the most support advance to the general election, regardless of their party. In the general, voters rank their candidates based on preference. Candidates are eliminated one-by-one until one reaches 50 percent support.Peltola, meanwhile, held a lead over Republican candidates in a hypothetical poll of the governor race. On the first round of ranked choice, 54 percent of respondents said they would vote for her.Trump carried Alaska by about 13 percentage points last November.What People Are SayingElisa Rios, a former campaign manager for Peltola, told The Alaska Beacon in July: \"It's really just where she can make the greatest impact for Alaskans. She is going to make that decision on her own time.\"Jason Katz-Brown, of Data for Progress, told The 19th News on Friday: \"The policies that she spent her whole last two years running on, especially on fisheries policy, are really, really popular things in Alaska, and the policies of the Republican governor are extremely unpopular. All that's combined, I think, really backs up the people in the state who really want to see a Peltola governorship.\"What Happens Next?The Cook Political Report classifies the Alaska Senate and gubernatorial race as being \"Solid Republican.\" Sabato's Crystal Ball lists the Senate race as Solid Republican, but the gubernatorial race as Likely Republican.","summary":"A new poll pointed to a competitive race in the traditionally conservative race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mary-peltola-chances-defefating-dan-sullivan-alaska-2110886","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699223/mary-peltola-senate-poll-alaska.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=416db964fc9421af9849b1f3c3632496","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 16:56:01","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":349405494,"title":"CBS TV chief breaks public silence on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' cancellation","text":"The CBS television chief broke his public silence about the decision to cancel \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" echoing company talking points Thursday that the program will be shuttered for purely economic reasons. Paramount Chair of TV Media George Cheeks spoke about canceling Colbert’s show during a press conference following the close of a long-planned merger that put CBS’ parent company under new ownership. Cheeks, one of the few executives from the previous regime to stick around after the Skydance Media merger, oversaw all of CBS when the decision was made to cancel the program. \"We are huge fans of Colbert, we love the show. Unfortunately, the economics made it a challenge for us to keep going,\" Cheeks told reporters in his first public remarks about Colbert since it was revealed the program would end in May 2026 and the \"Late Night\" brand would be retired. CBS CANCELS 'THE LATE SHOW,' STEPHEN COLBERT TO END PROGRAM IN MAY 2026 \"The challenge in late night is that the advertising marketplace is in significant secular decline,\" Cheeks continued. CBS said it was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night\" when announcing the surprising plans last month. \"The Late Show,\" which Colbert took over from David Letterman in 2015, famously leaned into liberal politics in the Trump era and became a major platform for Democratic politicians. Colbert had been outspoken with his criticism of Paramount settling President Donald Trump's lawsuit against the company over CBS' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the run-up to the election. Paramount settled the lawsuit last month, and the FCC approved the long-planned, $8 billion merger with Skydance shortly after. CNN'S ANDERSON COOPER SHOWS UP TO SUPPORT 'LATE SHOW' HOST STEPHEN COLBERT AFTER CANCELLATION Many have questioned the decision, suggesting that it was done to appease Trump and the FCC, but everyone involved has pointed directly to the show’s bottom line from the start. \"It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,\" the network said when first announcing the \"Late Show\" would be canceled. Puck News' Matt Belloni reported that the late-night show \"has been losing more than $40 million a year\" for CBS and that it had a budget of \"more than $100 million per season.\" COLBERT TELLS TRUMP TO 'GO F--- YOURSELF’ AFTER PRESIDENT TAUNTS HIM OVER SHOW CANCELLATION When breaking his public silence, Cheeks did not confirm the exact amount but acknowledged the \"Late Show\" was losing significant cash. \"At the end of the day, it just wasn’t sustainable to continue,\" he said.

Gov. Geoff Duncan Considers Run for Office After Party Switch","text":"The former lieutenant governor of Georgia says he is considering a run for higher office as a Democrat after leaving the Republican Party, citing policy disagreements and a political shift he says has been years in the making.\n\nGeoff Duncan, who served as Georgia’s lieutenant governor from 2019 to 2023 as a Republican, is weighing a bid for higher office after switching to the Democratic Party. He told WSB-TV a decision on his political future could come “in the next few weeks or months.”\n\n“I think Georgians want people who can speak truth to power in the middle,” Duncan remarked. Duncan has not indicated which role he might pursue; some expect he could run for governor in 2026, when Kemp’s tenure ends due to term limits.\n\nDuncan held a seat in the Georgia House from 2013 to 2017. Notable candidates already in the race for governor include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who served in the Biden administration, and Republicans Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and state Attorney General Chris Carr.\n\nIn an op-ed published Tuesday in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Duncan wrote that his transition to the Democrat Party began before President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He cited differences with the GOP over health care, Medicaid expansion, gun control measures, immigration policy, and programs for low-income families.\n\n“My journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia,” Duncan explained. “My decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.”\n\nDuncan criticized recent cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as well as mass deportation policies under the Trump administration. He expressed support for securing the border, deporting individuals convicted of felonies, and providing a path to citizenship for other undocumented immigrants.\n\nHis shift comes after the Georgia Republican Party expelled him earlier this year, citing his endorsement of President Joe Biden in the 2024 election, his later endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, and his opposition to certain GOP candidates, including Jones and 2022 Senate nominee Herschel Walker. Duncan also spoke at the Democratic National Convention in support of Harris.\n\nGeorgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon responded to the announcement by telling WSB-TV, “Geoff Duncan has finally said out loud what any person with eyes has known for years: He is a Democrat.”\n\nTrump reacted on Truth Social, calling Duncan a “total loser” and saying, “We didn’t want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I’m told he became a Democrat. Good riddance Geoff.”\n\nDuncan, a frequent critic of Trump since January 6, 2021, has previously called for the GOP to “move on” from the president, describing him in interviews as “a horrible human being” and saying the party must “purge” itself of “Trumpism”.\n\nHe stated that his time in office taught him that public policy is the best way to “love your neighbor,” pointing to his work on Georgia’s rural hospital tax credit program and bipartisan hate crimes legislation. “The list of reasons why I’m now a Democrat continues to grow,” Duncan wrote. “Most importantly, my decision puts me in the best possible position each day to love my neighbor.”","summary":"The former lieutenant governor of Georgia says he is considering a run for higher office as a Democrat after leaving the Republican Party.\n\n\nThe post Former Georgia Lt.

Instead, we get Mayor Pete appearing on a Substack Live with Aaron Parnas, a Gen Z Lib plant, where the politician tried to play both sides of the aisle. \"I think in order to bring people together on this, we also have to take everyone seriously, including parents who have questions,\" Buttigieg told Parnas. \"People who have questions or wonder what this means ... they’re going to have questions about how to make sure that’s fair, and we should take those questions seriously and face those together,\" Pete continued.

Gov. Eleni Kounalakis drops out of governor's race, pivots to run for treasurer","text":"The field of candidates for California governor expanded rapidly this year as a growing number of politicians entered the race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, but now it's starting to shrink. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a major Democratic donor and the first well-known candidate to formally launch a campaign for governor in April 2023, said Friday morning that she is dropping out of the governor's race and will instead run for state treasurer. Her announcement is the second big development in the governor's race in the last two weeks. Last Wednesday, former Vice President Kamala Harris said she would not run, creating a vacuum other Democrats in the race are rushing to fill. Kounalakis said in a statement that as treasurer, she can \"make the greatest impact by focusing on California's financial future.\" The state treasurer manages California's assets and serves on powerful boards that oversee the state employee pension systems and award financing for affordable housing and infrastructure projects. That role, Kounalakis said, would allow her to focus on \"fiscal responsibility, economic opportunity and strategic investment in our state's priorities — from affordable housing and clean energy to infrastructure and education.\" \"This work is critical and I am prepared for the challenge,\" Kounalakis said. Kounalakis is the former U.S. Ambassador to Hungary and the daughter of a wealthy real estate developer from Sacramento. In 2016, Kounalakis was a California co-chair of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, helping raise money and advising on foreign policy. Her family has deep ties to the well-heeled world of Bay Area political donors and power brokers, including U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) who gave Kounalakis a nod on TV last week after Harris decided not to run for governor. Her exit from the governor's race creates an opening for other candidates to build relationships and secure contributions from those donors, some of whom were waiting to give until Harris made a decision. The other Democrats in the race include Toni Atkins, a former Assembly speaker and Senate president pro tem; Xavier Becerra, former California attorney general and Biden Cabinet secretary; Stephen Cloobeck, a philanthropist and businessman; Katie Porter, a former congresswoman from Orange County; Tony Thurmond, the superintendent of public instruction; Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles; and Betty Yee, the former state controller. There are two prominent Republicans running: former Fox News commentator Steve Hilton and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco. Early polling showed Kounalakis in the top half of the gubernatorial field, but most voters also said they haven't made a decision yet and don't know the candidates. Kounalakis had raised millions of dollars in her race for governor, most of which her campaign said she will be able to transfer to her race for treasurer. She will face several other longtime California politicians in that race, including state Sen. Anna Caballero (D-Salinas); the former mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf; and Tony Vazquez, a member of the state Board of Equalization. Kounalakis was first elected lieutenant governor in 2018 and was reelected in 2022. The office is a largely ceremonial post that has been a launchpad for the governor's mansion in the past: Both Newsom and former Gov. Gray Davis previously served as lieutenant governor.","summary":"Her exit from the governor's race creates an opening for other candidates to build relationships and secure contributions from well-heeled Bay Area donors.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-08-08/lt-gov-eleni-kounalakis-drops-out-of-governors-race-pivots-to-run-for-treasurer","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d8df11/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcf%2F00%2Fc0af144c4b1dbcbf4c701aa65f19%2F1508550-pol-me-cadem-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 14:38:13","author":"Laura J.

Yes. Almost inadvertently, I’d say. ABC News has the same problem so many leading cultural institutions do in America: A lack of viewpoint diversity… It is no secret. There are hardly any people who supported Donald Trump at ABC News — or the other corporate/legacy/mainstream news networks. And this is bound to impact coverage, not so much out of malevolent bias (that’s the cartoon version peddled by Trump, Brendan Carr, and online MAGA), but more out of what is a kind of deafness. The old news divisions don’t hear many of the voices of the country, because those voices aren’t in the newsroom. Yes, news teams go out with a microphone and a camera and accost people at Trump rallies; but to me that often comes off as weirdly anthropological and inaccurate, kind of like trying to understand nature by visiting a zoo. You don’t really see a tiger at the zoo, just a version of a tiger.\n\nWhadda load of crap.\n\nHe says the bias isn’t “malevolence,” even though he worked at ABC News for nearly 30 years and the hiring practices never changed. Choosing to hire only leftists is, yes, a choice. Over Moran’s four decades, a deliberate choice was made by the network to not hire those who disagree with Democrats or those with enough empathy and experience outside the bubble to recognize Republicans as fellow human beings. We’re seen as so weird, so bizarre, so different, and such others at ABC News that Moran admits we’re treated like zoo animals.\n\nOf course that’s deliberate. What else could it be? I can understand a few years of insularity before someone says, ‘Wait a minute, we’re sitting here discussing abortion/gun control/taxes/immigration/global warming, and no one disagrees. This is wrong. We’re too bubbled. We need outside voices.’ We’re all human. We can all get too comfortable. I get that. But 30 years?!?!? No, that’s not only deliberate, it is a deliberate abuse of the publicly-owned airwaves.\n\nABC should lose its broadcast license.\n\nAll I can say to the regime media, Moran, and Kessler, is keep it up… Don’t ever change. These mercenary admissions-after-it-matters, the blatant hate hurled at Trump and his supporters under the guise of news, the arrogant and trolling refusal to admit bias… It’s killing y’all, and it’s killing a Democrat Party that has no clue how to operate in an environment where 1) nobody trusts their media allies, and 2) New Media and social media can now get the truth out.\n\nLet’s just hope Kessler is 100 percent accurate about — tee hee — this:\n\nBut now, working at The Post feels like being on the Titanic after it struck an iceberg — drifting aimlessly as it sank, with not enough lifeboats for everyone. The Carpathia (i.e., Bezos) appears too far away and too distracted to help. And the captain is shouting commands that the solution is a different ship.\n\nBurn, baby, burn…\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

Donald Trump's deputy's first stop was at Chevening House stately home for a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy. In true American vacation style, the pair were pictured fishing on the grounds of the mansion. Despite coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum and the Trump administration's America first policies , Lammy is hoping he can bond with Vance over their shared Christian faiths and dysfunctional working class upbringings. A good relationship will be key if the UK is to score favourable terms in the trade deal set to be announced in June. Israel's plans for Gaza and Russia's war in Ukraine are also likely to feature on the agenda as debates on how to end the conflicts rage on in London and Washington. Yesterday. Vladimir Putin revealed where he is likely to meet Donald Trump for a face-to-face meeting on ending the Ukraine war. Mad Vlad named the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a potential location for the summit with the Orange Manbaby. The Russian dictator said: \"We have many friends who are willing to help us organise such events. One of our friends is the president of the United Arab Emirates.\" The proposed peace talks will be the first meeting between US and Russian leaders since Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva back in June 2021. The Kremlin said earlier today that the talks are set for the \"coming days\". After JD Dunce's official business has concluded at Chevening House, he will head for the Cotswold for some time off with his family. However, the VP was warned he could drive residents in a tiny Cotswolds town round the bend by clogging up the streets with his security. Trump's deputy has reportedly rented a country cottage in Charlbury for a break with his wife and three children. A local business owner said: “It’s the talk of the town. They’ve locked our local website forum so people can’t say any more about it. “I’m just worried about the parking, all those secret service cars! “Good luck to him - getting round these roads is no joke. They’ll have some fun with these lanes, getting around in a big car.” Charlbury has hit the headlines in recent weeks after a string of celebrities were spotted visiting the desirable village. It comes after Kamala Harris was seen having lunch in the local Bull pub last week during Steve Jobs’ daughter Eve’s society wedding.

However, even as an official peace agreement is not expected to be signed, the meeting is still viewed as a major win for not only regional stability, but for Trump as well. \"I believe they've had a significant position in this whole process,\" Matias Perttula, director of Save Armenia, told Fox News Digital. \"We just returned from Armenia over the last week [where] we had several government meetings, including with the national security advisor, the president of Armenia and a couple other ministries, and from what we can tell the engagement from the Trump administration has been a lot more robust than the Biden administration.\" Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan are each expected to meet with Trump prior to signing a pledge for peace between the two nations, which have been embroiled in, at times, brutal conflict since the late 1980s. The conflict largely centered around the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a mountainous area in Azerbaijan with a majority-Armenian population, but which declared independence in 1991. While Armenia, along with the international community, never formally recognized the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as an independent state, it became its chief financial and military backer. The territory assumed a de facto role in Armenia until Azerbaijani forces overwhelmed the republic in a swift campaign in September 2023, prompting mass evacuations of ethnic Armenians before it was then dissolved on Jan. 1, 2024. This region is expected to remain a major issue in the ongoing negotiations. ARMENIA'S PRIME MINISTER URGES SWIFT BORDER AGREEMENT TO AVOID CONFLICT WITH AZERBAIJAN Though both nations announced in March that they had reached a consensus on finalizing a peace deal, several factors surrounding the mountainous area have prevented a finalized agreement from being reached, as witnessed in the July meeting between the leaders when they met in the UAE but failed to find a resolution. Chief among Azerbaijan’s demands is that Armenia should amend its constitution and remove all references to the Nagorno-Karabakh territory. Though this demand is not a simple request that just Pashinyan can agree to as it would require a national referendum. \"There's no legal consequence whatsoever,\" Perttula told Fox News Digital, explaining that both Armenian and American legal experts have refuted the demand as inconsequential, and therefore should not serve as a precursor to reaching a formalized peace deal. \"There needs to be a real consideration for the right of return for the 120,000 Armenian Christians that were forced off the lands of Nagorno-Karabakh that has been their ancestral homeland for centuries,\" Perttula added. \"I think that needs to be a key point in terms of formalizing this whole peace agreement.\" \"We want peace at the end of the day,\" he added. \"We want peace and normalization.\" NETANYAHU SURPRISES TRUMP WITH FORMAL NOBEL PEACE PRIZE NOMINATION DURING HISTORIC WHITE HOUSE MEETING Trump, while on the campaign trail, highlighted the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and accused then-Vice President Kamala Harris of doing \"NOTHING as 120,000 Armenian Christians were horrifically persecuted and forcibly displaced.\" Trump said he would \"work to stop the violence and ethnic cleansing, and we will restore PEACE between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\" Trump has repeatedly championed his push to end conflict across the globe and in June celebrated a peace agreement that the U.S. helped broker between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda with an Oval Office signing. \"In a few short months, we’ve now achieved peace between India and Pakistan, India and Iran, and the DRC and Rwanda, and a couple of others, also,\" Trump said during the event.

I deserve it, but they will never give it to me.\" The White House last week lobbied for the president to win the award come December when White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"It’s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\"","summary":"Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev meet with President Donald Trump to address decadeslong conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh territory.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-host-armenia-azerbaijan-leaders-ahead-peace-pledge-white-house-eyes-nobel-peace-prize","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/armenia-and-azerbaijan-conflict-comes-to-an-end.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376685391112","publish_date":"2025-08-08 13:30:38","author":"Caitlin McFall","authors":["Caitlin McFall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.144},{"id":349342092,"title":"Danica Patrick sets pulses racing as she shows off stunning physique while on vacation in Ibiza","text":"Danica Patrick sets pulses racing as she shows off stunning physique while on vacation in Ibiza\n\nMORE: DailyMail+ Power List ranks NFL coaches from $30m flop to sideline saint \n\nBy JAMES COHEN, SPORTS REPORTER\n\nPublished: 14:11 BST, 8 August 2025 | Updated: 14:30 BST, 8 August 2025\n\nMotorsports legend Danica Patrick has set pulses racing after pulling on a blue bikini and showing off her recent travels in an Instagram post. \n\nThe retired race car driver has spent the last month on a European vacation and shared her latest update with followers on Thursday afternoon. \n\nPatrick, 43, posted a series of photos from her trip to the Spanish island of Ibiza as she kicked back and relaxed in a swimsuit on the beach.\n\nThe former IndyCar and NASCAR driver struck a pose by a wooden cabin before later enjoying paella at a beach club as she showed off her incredible physique.\n\nThe caption to Patrick's post read: 'Beautiful Ibiza'.

That’s precisely what Donald Trump endured in the Season 27 premiere of the long-running animated series. Sources say the president was “seething.” But will Trump strike back? Can he? And more importantly, should he?\n\nWhile Trump has aimed late-night critics like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon (recently declaring in a press briefing that they “have no talent” and hinting they could be next to disappear), South Park remains untouched for now.\n\n“I’m sure Trump could move some mountains to damage the South Park name and potentially get it cancelled,” said Adrienne Uthe, founder and strategic advisor at Kronus Communications, in an interview with the Irish Star.\n\nBut Uthe believes he probably won’t. “It wouldn’t be a good look. (…) You’ve got to be able to laugh at yourself, and needing to silence voices only shows weakness in this instance. South Park is consistent in that they make fun of everyone — let them cook.”\n\nDonald Trump’s latest meltdown reportedly stemmed from South Park’s premiere episode titled “Sermon on the Mount.” \n\nThe savage half-hour lampooned the president with a particularly surreal sequence: a n-ked Trump stumbling through a forest with Satan as his reluctant guide. If that wasn’t enough, the episode included an AI-generated PSA that comically praised Donald Trump while also mocking his physique and legal quagmire.\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone, who’ve helmed the irreverent show since 1997, didn’t back down when asked about the blowback during San Diego Comic-Con. Their response? A deadpan “We’re terribly sorry,” which was dripping with sarcasm and perfectly on-brand for two men who’ve never met a sacred cow they didn’t grill.\n\nWhite House insiders weren’t amused.\n\nOne source told Deadline that the president was furious and called the episode “childish” and “vulgar,” while also noting that the White House had even received a warning about the episode’s contents. It was possibly due to South Park’s ties to Paramount+, which is involved in the pending $8 billion Skydance-Paramount merger awaiting FCC approval.\n\nParamount has officially agreed to merge with Skydance. pic.twitter.com/8OavnXeLTz\n— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) July 8, 2024\n\nAs Trump continues to hint that more shows could be in danger (especially ones that mock him), fans are watching closely.\n\nThe recent surprise cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert sparked rumors that politics, not just ratings, were at play.\n\nCBS exec George Cheeks tried to douse the flames, saying: “The challenge in late night is that the advertising marketplace is in significant secular decline.” But that didn’t fly with fans on social media.\n\nOne user on X (formerly Twitter) posted: “He mentions Colbert has better ratings than Kimmel or Fallon… and yet Colbert gets canned because of ‘his ratings’ and not the fact that he called the network out for paying a bribe to Trump in a baseless lawsuit.”\n\nThe lawsuit they’re referring to? In July, CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, agreed to settle a $16 million lawsuit with Trump over a 60 Minutes segment featuring ex-US Vice President Kamala Harris. The timing (plus the Colbert cancellation) is suspicious. \n\n🚨BREAKING: After CBS’s 60 Minutes posted the unedited version of its October interview with Kamala Harris online, President Trump has doubled the value of his lawsuit against them from $10 billion to $20 billion.\nCBS is cooked! 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/rRI8qruI1N\n— I Meme Therefore I Am 🇺🇸 (@ImMeme0) February 9, 2025\n\nStill, South Park as a cultural institution is ruthlessly bipartisan in its mockery.\n\nWhether you’re Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, or Donald Trump, South Park is an equal-opportunity offender.

He didn’t have a bogus degree or some fluffy think tank internship on his resume; he won on merit. The liberal press also mocked him for his lack of experience. However, if I were looking to hire someone to pull the levers of government, I’d sooner take a teen who thinks fast in a life-threatening situation than any middling wannabe bureaucrat. \n\nThey also loathe Coristine because he is a normal white man who proved their entire narrative wrong. The far-left wants everyone to believe white men are villains responsible for every problem in the world. But, as it turns out, Coristine is a selfless hero, not just for his contributions to DOGE and the American taxpayer.\n\nAnd let’s be real. How would a liberal react in Coristine’s situation? Your average D.C. resident probably would have tried to reason with the carjackers and mention that they voted for Kamala Harris. \n\nWe all know how that would’ve ended…","summary":"Justice for Big Balls!","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/08/08/mr-right-doge-big-balls-carjacking-dc-democrats/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2217854935-scaled-e1754486001277.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 13:13:06","author":"Mr. Right","authors":["Mr. Right"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.445},{"id":349414300,"title":"Thanks to Trump, you’ll find America in our rearview mirror","text":"Do not miss the point: The battle is for our children’s future, not our present.\n\nOur present America is battered beyond recognition. The pillars of our democracy stand as the ruins of Rome, at times just a whisper of what we were. We were never perfect — not even close, but at one point, our messed-up system was better than all the other messed-up systems because most of us believed, ultimately, in the ideal that we are all born equal, with the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. To the Christians among us, try Galatians 5:14 on for size.\n\nMany of us have jettisoned the ideals of loving our neighbor as ourselves, so today’s politics sound more like pre-pubescents on the playground fighting over who is our favorite superhero, rather than adults discussing mutually beneficial political policy. The far-right mediascape is populated by thin-lipped, thin-skinned, thinly-veiled fascists who aspire to be Joseph Goebbels. Sorry: That’s the Stephen Miller seat and only one chief instigator at a time, please. The far-left is so far-left they sound like the far-right. The vast majority of us would rather go see a movie. “The Fantastic Four” was pretty good. \n\nThe free press does not exist. Trump controls the White House reporting pool. He has intimidated media companies, legislators and universities, and he leads a White House filled with the sort of flotsam one would usually find at the bottom of a long-clogged shower drain. But they’re all smart enough to lie to the president to his face to save their own butts. They are the latest tail end of the Trump human centipede, and the press gets to feed off the droppings. \n\nAnyone not adhering to the Boss’s “Please, Please Me” mentality — what a horrible interpretation of the first Beatles’ hit — gets the “off with their head” routine. Thus, last week Trump fired a heretofore little known government worker who had the audacity to submit job numbers the president didn’t like.\n\nTrump told us her numbers were “wrong” but he still hasn’t explained how he knows this. Did he do the math himself? Unlikely. Did he task someone else to do it? That’s also unlikely, as his reaction was nearly instantaneous. The more likely fact is that Trump lied when he said he knew the numbers were “wrong,” all because he didn’t like the numbers and wanted someone who would cook the books for him because he can’t face reality. The greater fact is that he may no longer be able to face reality.\n\nThat is Trump. In many cases, through his sheer will alone, and against all facts, he has created our shared reality. As a result, there are millions of Americans who still believe the Democrats stole the 2020 election, even though there are no facts showing that to be true. It is merely what Donald wants, so in Oklahoma the state government plans on institutionalizing his delusion by teaching that there were “discrepancies” in the election when there were none. This does not bode well for our future, teaching fiction over fact. It sets our children up for failure — and yet in Oklahoma they’ve decided politics determines reality, not facts.\n\nFor those who still don’t understand the situation, please rewatch Matt Hooper telling off Mayor Vaughn in “Jaws.” “I think that I am familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and BITES YOU ON THE A*S!”\n\nIt’s a curious time to be alive. The problem boils down to this: The man who has the greatest influence on our shared reality is observably and arguably suffering a precipitous mental decline and is unable to do the job he was elected to do just six months ago. That leaves Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller holding his leash. \n\nLast week Trump admitted he did nothing after Jeffery Epstein “stole” a 16-year-old girl who worked in the spa at Mar-a-Lago. This is a damning piece of information the old Trump, at the top of his manipulative game, would never have willingly given us. But he had it pulled out of him by reporters last week fairly easily — in mere minutes. Compounding that unforced error, the old Trump would never have fired a statistician who supplied him with information he didn’t like; he would have just invented and reported his own figures. He finally tried that Thursday, but it didn’t go over well because he’d already fired the statistician.\n\nDuring a White House event on Wednesday celebrating a deal with Apple Inc., a reporter asked Trump this: “You were the driving force behind Operation Warp Speed, these mRNA vaccines that are the gold standard. Now your health secretary is pulling back all the funding for research. What is going on?”\n\n“Research into what?” Trump said.\n\n“mRNA vaccines,” the reporter replied.\n\n“We’re onto other things,” the president said. \n\nTranslation: He has no idea and doesn’t care. He’s already forgotten vaccines, Greenland and Canada, and he has told Netanyahu he can pave over Gaza. Why or how could Trump possibly care about vaccines when he didn’t have anything to do with Epstein?\n\nTrump’s recent vertiginous stupor, exacerbated by his Epstein fear, coincides with our country’s moral and ethical malaise. We have stumbled dizzily from our ideals. We are overcome with anger and accusations; we rely on emotions rather than logic, fiction instead of fact and fantasy instead of science. When former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert last week that she had anticipated most of Trump’s actions since the election, but didn’t expect the ease with which Congress, colleges and the press capitulated, I wanted to shout, “Where the F**K have you been?” \n\nSome of us have been warning everyone since the first Trump administration — and some even warned us before then. The late Robin Williams, in a 2012 standup routine, called Trump “The Wizard of Oz,” and pointed out his attraction to young girls — even his own daughter. “There are people in Arkansas going, ‘that’s just f**king wrong.’”\n\nIf you haven’t been paying attention, you’re not alone. Millions cannot believe how far America has fallen, and they still do not understand how our politics works today. To understand the current political climate and culture, just watch the WWE. Before he signed an executive order on Tuesday afternoon in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Trump’s team actually piped the WWE’s “Undertaker Theme” through the sound system. The WWE is a shallow reality show perpetuated by rich hustlers to con those of average means so the rich can get richer and the poor don’t notice. Just like the White House.\n\nThe WWE is also our current equivalent of Bread and Circuses, “panem et circenses,” of ancient Rome. In Rome it was free food and entertainment and don’t look now but the Visigoths are coming. Today it’s no food and televised entertainment by a man in a wig that looks like a South Park cartoon character. Idea’s the same.\n\nThe Democrats decry Trump’s policies and politics, and recently so have his closest supporters. Nobody’s happy. And with the announcement of the completion of the new white-concrete Rose Garden and the looming construction of the Trump Ballroom at the White House, there are millions who believe the president will never leave the White House until he’s wheeled into his ballroom to lie in state. Of course it’ll only be a private showing — for those who are willing to donate to the Trump family business.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics?

To say that today’s politics is Orwellian is being unkind to Orwell. That drama is in our rearview mirror — as is the “constitutional crisis.” Turns out there was no constitutional crisis. The Republican Congress never put up a fight against fascism; the GOP in both chambers were willing accomplices. Crisis averted.\n\nBut the crisis Trump can’t avert is now on full display. This week his public appearances have been rare, staged and cautious. He didn’t make himself available at all until he began Tuesday morning with a rare phone-in to CNBC. He was probably sitting in his tighty-whities as he made a fool of himself, live on the air, over his latest polling numbers. \n\nThen Trump was next seen Tuesday walking on the White House roof. For a second it looked like he was a mental patient escaping nurse Ratched. Why did he do this? Who knows. Trump shouted down at reporters who waved at him. He made a comment about installing missiles, and at one point a colleague wondered, “Does he think he can fly?” But Trump didn’t fly or jump, he walked back inside.\n\nFinally, on Tuesday, he showed up in the EEOB to sign the executive order. The issue? The 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. “Most presidents begin their day with something this trivial,” a former White House official told me. “This is how Trump ends the day.” \n\nNot entirely. He also held a brief presser with his chosen propagandists parading as journalists. After he got one real question from CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about the Ghislaine Maxwell controversy, he took only one more question before fleeing abruptly.\n\nTrump wasn’t this distant from us during the height of COVID. Hell, he crammed us into the Brady Briefing Room and made the doctors accompanying him violate health protocols by appearing together in such tight quarters.\n\nBut the Epstein bombshell, combined with firing a government statistician because she gave him job numbers he didn’t like, has struck fear in Trump’s larcenist, shriveled heart.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is attempting to make the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” the central strategy to regaining control of the House and perhaps the Senate — but the DNC doesn’t scare Trump. It’s the Republicans and his MAGA base that have him fearful. Again, he cannot harness the whirlwind that blew him into office. That is the crisis he cannot avoid.\n\nA Republican strategist, who asked to speak on background, said the GOP is having a “difficult time” selling Trump to the base. “These days he’s not doing himself any favors. And he doesn’t seem to get it, or doesn’t care. He thinks he can bully his own supporters.”\n\nOn Tuesday, conservative radio host Michael Savage posted on X that Trump has rankled his own supporters with seven deadly political sins. “Trump voters who I spoke with say this; He has alienated them because of; 1) escalating instead of defusing the Ukraine/ Russia war; 2) pushing a bloated pork barrel spending bill and attacking Musk; 3) hiding the Epstein list; 4) firing the labor statistics chief who refused to back down; 5) unconditional support for Netanyahu’s war.6) accepting a plane from Qatar which will cost $1 bill to retrofit; 7) building a gilded ballroom in the WH (no, they will NOT vote for a Dem but may sit out the next election in protest).”\n\nThe MAGA base which swept him into office could lead the efforts to neuter Trump in the midterms and lay the groundwork for another impeachment, or at least the derailing of his so-called legislative agenda.\n\nBut none of that addresses the damage that has already been done in the first six months of Trump’s new administration. The fact that MAGA is pushing back is of keen interest, but it appears, so far, that means little. Trump is currently trying to counter any resistance from Democrats by increasing the number of Republicans in Congress. In Texas he’s hoping to gerrymander districts to give him another five congressional seats. Statehouse Democrats have fled the state to deny Texas Republicans a quorum for a vote on congressional redistricting. On Thursday, Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn, who had requested that the FBI assist state and local law enforcement efforts to hunt down the absent Democrats, said the agency had agreed to help. \n\nShould Trump succeed in gerrymandering Texas, it may look to many that the game is lost. That’s not true for a variety of reasons including, but it’s not limited to the fact that Trump’s greatest challenge remains from his own angry followers.\n\nIt would be the greatest irony that while Trump and his Texas minions try to keep the Democrats from destroying the president, it is the MAGA crowd and their “Seven Deadly Donald Sins” that could do in Donny. Then again, many have predicted his demise several times before and have been wrong.\n\nWhat happens next will, surely, be recounted in history books and remembered by our children and grandchildren for the rest of their lives — if we’re lucky.","summary":"Republicans in Congress have capitulated to a circus boss who is no longer running the show","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/08/08/thanks-to-trump-youll-find-america-in-our-rearview-mirror/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trump-2228110815-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 13:00:44","author":"Brian Karem","authors":["Brian Karem"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":349382054,"title":"The threat of political violence is keeping parents out of elected office","text":"Persistent harassment and threats of violence may be impacting who decides to become an elected official or candidate — especially for parents of young children.\n\nBy Barbara Rodriguez for The 19th\n\nWhen Liuba Grechen Shirley ran for Congress in 2018, she began a journey that helped change federal policy to ensure parents like herself could use campaign funds to pay for child care.\n\nThe Democrat has been public about her struggles with balancing a campaign and securing child care. Less known was the harassment and threats of violence that Grechen Shirley says she experienced at the time. Her car window was smashed, and anonymous calls popped up at her daughter’s nursery school, which was listed on public records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\n“There were people who called and harassed the nursery school because they could find that that’s where I was spending money,” she said.\n\nNone of this deterred Grechen Shirley’s run for office, an ultimately unsuccessful bid but one that launched years of advocacy to make sure candidates at all levels of elected office could use campaign dollars for child care expenses. To date, 40 states allow its use, a recent milestone that’s taken years due to the nation’s patchwork of laws and regulations.\n\nNow Vote Mama — the umbrella organization Grechen Shirley founded that supports parents who run for office — is elevating the use of campaign funds for security measures. Its lobbying entity has begun advocating for policies on the state level that ensure parents and others with concerns about the safety of their families have more financial means to protect themselves.\n\nThe organization’s research arm, Vote Mama Foundation, released a report on Monday that shows federal candidates are increasingly spending money on security. While the expenditures do not focus on parents, the report’s findings conclude that the increase in spending indicates a dwindling sense of safety for candidates, which “creates a barrier to entry for caregivers seeking office and discourages a new generation of candidates with young families from running for office up and down the ballot nationwide.”\n\nThe possibility that parents might forgo such political engagement is likely to impact their already limited representation in elected office: Vote Mama Foundation has collected data on mothers with minor children and estimated that they are just 8 percent of state legislators. They represent just 6.8 percent of all federal legislators.\n\n“Campaign funds for child care opens the door for more moms to run and to serve in office, but campaign funds for security — it keeps that door open, by ensuring safety shouldn’t be a deterrent for people who want to run for elected office,” Grechen Shirley said.\n\nFederal candidates had been able to use campaign funds for security expenses on a case-by-case basis since 2009, but an FEC rule in 2024 clarified the use of such funds for the reasonable cost of security measures for a federal candidate, federal officeholder, member of their family and employees. Among the buckets of allowable expenses:\n\n Security devices such as hardware, locks, alarm systems, motion detectors and security camera systems;\n Structural security devices such as wiring, lighting, gates, doors and fencing;\n Security personnel;\n Cyber security software, devices and services.\n\nVote Mama Foundation, which appears to be the only organization tracking security spending, analyzed security-related transactions in FEC filings between 2014 and 2024. It estimated more than 860 candidates for federal office spent over $41 million on security measures during that time — with 2020 and 2024 accounting for nearly half of all spending.\n\nThe bulk of the federal spending on security — 78 percent — was done by men, and nearly 80 percent of that amount was spent by White men. While women represent just 22 percent of security spending, women of color make up 63 percent of that amount — nearly two-thirds.\n\nWhile the Vote Mama report focuses on federal campaign spending, Grechen Shirley said the new data connects the dots on the shortcomings of state-level policy, which will need to play out individually. North Dakota recently became the 10th state to allow for spending campaign funds on candidate safety — and the first since the June assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her spouse. Lawmakers in Oklahoma have recently returned to the subject, and the Minnesota legislature now plans to cover costs for enhanced home security for lawmakers.\n\nRelated | Alleged Minnesota assassin was Trump supporter who echoed GOP views\n\nVote Mama is calling on more states to allow campaign expenditures in order to empower more parents to run for and stay in office. It notes such policies should come at no expense to taxpayers since candidates would be using the money they’re raising.\n\nReports of harassment and threats of violence against elected officials and candidates have become more common. Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI), a nonpartisan research initiative out of Princeton University that tracks and mitigates political violence in the United States, maintains a public dataset that shows more than 250 incidents of threats and harassment targeting local officials have been reported in the first half of 2025 — up 9 percent from this point in 2024.\n\nBDI, in partnership with the organization CivicPulse, also maintains a quarterly survey of local elected officials, and its latest findings show many officials are seeking more safety support, including for personal security and enhanced privacy protections. One in 3 women reported their gender identity as a perceived driver of the hostility they faced, compared to just 1 in 50 men.\n\nAmong recent interviews with elected officials, BDI staff say there are elected officials who are mothers who have indicated they do not plan to run for higher office explicitly because they fear the safety risks to their children. Others say they plan to wait until their kids are young adults. Some of these mothers already have safety strategies in place to limit what information they share publicly about having kids.\n\nShannon Hiller, executive director of BDI, said almost half of all women in the survey report that they worry about threats, harassment or attacks in the future — that’s the case for about a third of men.\n\n“This is not just only a problem for women, but it’s important to note that this sort of climate is impacting certain types of officials even more than others,” she said.\n\nThe issue reached renewed attention following the death of Hortman and her spouse in a shooting at multiple private residences that also injured Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his spouse. The alleged gunman, who reportedly had a “hit list” of multiple Democrats besides Hortman and Hoffman, has been arrested.\n\nThat follows an alleged arson at the official residence of Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro in the spring, and years of attempted attacks and threats of violence against others. Last year, after President Donald Trump was shot in the ear in an assasination attempt at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, the incident drew public condemnation from women who have been targets of political violence.\n\n“No one should have to risk their lives to serve in office, to stand up and fight for their constituents,” Grechen Shirley said.\n\nDebbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, noted that running for the legislature or local office is often a low-paying part-time job, even though the public expectations can make it feel like a full-time gig. That already made it a tough sell for women candidates, especially those with young children, who must now contend with safety concerns that disproportionately impact them.\n\n“Women make up less than a third of elected officials at any level of office. If it has a chilling effect on women running for office or running for reelection, we’re at risk of losing women’s voices,” she said. “When you lose women’s voices in these decision-making bodies — where policy is made that affects all of our lives — then you think about our democracy, it really puts in many ways our democracy at risk.”\n\nSecurity spending is used across the political spectrum. From 2014 to 2024, Democrats spent more than $18 million, and Republicans spent more than $14 million. Trump spent $6.8 million on security measures, according to the report. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran for president last election cycle before being tapped to be health secretary, spent $5.7 million.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris spent $1.7 million on security. In Congress, former Sen. Krysten Sinema spent $1.4 million, followed by former Rep. Cori Bush with $831,000 and Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez with $666,000.\n\nRelated | Mike Johnson loses his war against new moms—and he’s pissed\n\nGrechen Shirley said there is bipartisan support for addressing security concerns among elected lawmakers and candidates.\n\n“Both Democrats and Republicans are getting threats. This is something that is common sense, and it’s already approved at the federal level,” she said. “Now we have to get this approved at the state level to make sure that people are safe.”\n\nIn a recent policy brief with the Brennan Center for Justice, BDI called for expanded access on the state-level for personal security measures and data collection on the issue. The brief also noted the Trump administration’s rollback of security protections for former officials and the president’s clemency of nearly 1,600 participants convicted in the January 6 attack on the Capitol has “created a more permissive environment for politically motivated attacks.”\n\nHiller said that context is important if the public wants to better understand how to address political violence.\n\n“People have to be thinking about holding their elected leaders accountable if they’re contributing to that kind of climate and permissive environment around threats and harassment in particular,” she said.","summary":"Persistent harassment and threats of violence may be impacting who decides to become an elected official or candidate — especially for parents of young children.\n\n\n\nBy Barbara Rodriguez for The 19th\n\n\n\n\nWhen Liuba Grechen Shirley ran for Congress in 2018, she began a journey that helped change federal policy to ensure parents like herself could use campaign funds to pay for child care.\n\n\n\nThe Democrat has been public about her struggles with balancing a campaign and securing child care.

Known for its off-year elections, Virginia often sets the tone for the congressional midterms that take place throughout the country the following year. In Virginia, an election in a purple district outside of the capital of Richmond has the potential to swing control of the Democrat-run House of Delegates to Republicans.\n\nVirginia’s November elections will feature all 100 seats in the House of Delegates and the top three executive positions in the state, including the governor’s mansion.\n\n>>> Sign up for our Virginia email newsletter\n\nIn House District 57, encompassing parts of Henrico and Goochland counties near Richmond, incumbent Republican state Del. David Owen is seeking reelection against Democrat challenger May Nivar. This district is known for being competitive—having swung back-and-forth between parties in recent election cycles. \n\nOwen won the seat in 2023 after a tight battle against Democrat Susanna Gibson, securing the win by nearly 1,000 votes despite being outspent by roughly $500,000 by Gibson. In the 2024 presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris received over 53% of the district’s votes, while President Donald Trump drew 44%.\n\nNivar emphasized the need for students to have access to quality education. “I am committed to raising teacher pay, addressing teacher shortages, and ensuring schools have the specialists and counselors needed to support our children,” Nivar says on her website. “Investing in our schools is investing in Virginia’s future.”\n\nThe Daily Signal contacted Nivar’s campaign but had not received comment as of publication time.\n\nNivar is an alumna of the CEO Action for Racial Equity Fellowship and a former member of Altria’s Women’s Network Mentoring Committee. Additionally, she has garnered endorsements from several prominent Democrats, including the Democrats’ nominee for governor, Abigail Spanberger—who grew up in Henrico county—and former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\nThe Republican candidate is also focusing on schools, citing education as one of the top issues his district faces.\n\n“I helped pass a bipartisan budget that included record investments in education, increased teacher pay, and strengthened school safety,” Owen told The Daily Signal. “Additionally, I co-patroned two education bills, including one that will ban harmful dyes in school lunches such as Red No. 40, and another that requires school leadership to notify all parents of any school-connected overdoses.”\n\nThe Republican delegate said he went door-to-door and delivered over 1,200 student Honor Roll certificates. \n\n“I found that many schools in our district no longer publicly honor academic achievement,” he said. “I believe that needs to change. We should be celebrating excellence, not minimizing it. I’ll continue advocating for an education system that uplifts effort, celebrates success, and reinforces the value of education.”\n\nIf re-elected, Owen said one of his top priorities will be to eliminate the car tax. \n\n“Virginians are tired of being taxed year after year simply for owning a vehicle,” he said. “This tax hits working families, commuters, and small businesses, especially in District 57, where reliable transportation is essential for daily life. Getting rid of the car tax would provide immediate financial relief to thousands of residents and make our region more affordable.”\n\nNivar said she would promote good-paying jobs, increase wages, cut red tape for small businesses, and provide tax relief for families.\n\n“I will also work to lower the cost of living—making housing, health care, and everyday necessities more affordable—and invest in career and technical education to prepare workers for the jobs of tomorrow,” her website says.\n\nNivar’s priorities include addressing climate change and expanding the use of clean energy, according to her website.\n\n“Preserving the Virginia Clean Economy Act is essential to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050,” she said on her website. “I will also oppose any efforts to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a critical program that mitigates climate change and protects us from extreme weather. By acting boldly now, we can ensure a sustainable, healthier Virginia for generations to come.”\n\nAs reported previously by The Daily Signal, a recent study conducted by the Thomas Jefferson Institute showed the phasing out of coal and gas in favor of renewable sources such as wind and solar, as mandated by the Clean Economy Act, will lead to “more shortages and skyrocketing costs” for energy. \n\nUnder the law, energy companies that fail to comply with the energy mandates will face noncompliance costs. The Thomas Jefferson Institute projected these costs to climb to $609 million in one year, with consumers facing the effects.","summary":"With Virginia’s state elections just under three months away, candidates across the commonwealth are mobilizing their campaigns.

In the first public poll since former Vice President Kamala Harris opted to not run for governor, former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter had the support of 18% of registered voters in California, while Republican commentator Steve Hilton had the backing of 12%, according to the Emerson College poll. No other candidate in the sprawling field had double-digit support, and 38% of voters said they were undecided. The primary will take place June 2. The candidates have yet to start aggressively advertising or reaching out to voters, so these numbers could fluctuate wildly over the next 10 months. When asked about a special election that could occur in November, voters were split over a proposed Democratic effort to redraw congressional districts. One-third of voters support the effort, a quarter oppose it and 42% were unsure, according to the poll. Redistricting typically occurs after the once-a-decade census, but California is considering a middecade redrawing of congressional boundaries to counter potential moves by Texas and other GOP states to boost the number of Republicans in the House and keep the GOP in control of Congress. California state lawmakers are expected to vote on calling a special election about the matter after they return from summer recess Aug. 18.

The 49-second-long video was stitched strategically to look like the stars talking about how all Trump has done in his 200 days as the President is “win.”\n\nThe caption that accompanied the video read, “200 Days.

The caption also listed a list of goals that the Trump administration claims to have achieved in its time in office.\n\nWill Ferrell has been one of the several high-profile individuals who have spoken out against the President very actively. During the 2024 election, the 58-year-old appeared in a YouTube video while he wore a “Loud White Men for Kamala” t-shirt. He did not stop his support for the former Vice President there. Ferrel also appeared in a campaign video for Harris.\n\nThe actor also criticised the Trump administration for their decision to dismantle the Department of Education.

As part of the settlement, Starbuck will serve as a consultant to Meta, working with its Product Policy team to bolster their existing efforts to combat political bias in its AI models and reduce the risk of \"hallucinations\" – made-up information – generated by the chatbot. \"Both parties have resolved this matter to our mutual satisfaction. Since engaging on these important issues with Robby, Meta has made tremendous strides to improve the accuracy of Meta AI and mitigate ideological and political bias. Building on that work, Meta and Robby Starbuck will work collaboratively in the coming months to continue to find ways to address issues of ideological and political bias and minimize the risk that the model returns hallucinations in response to user queries,\" Meta and Starbuck said in a joint statement. \"I’m extraordinarily pleased with how Meta and I resolved this issue. Resolving this is going to result in big wins that I believe will set an example for ethical AI across the industry. I look forward to continuing our engagement as a voice for conservatives to ensure that we’re always treated fairly by AI,\" Starbuck told Fox News Digital. ZUCKERBERG WANTS TO GIVE EVERYONE THEIR OWN PERSONAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE THROUGH META&apos;S NEW VISION Starbuck filed suit in Delaware Superior Court against Meta in April after its chatbot allegedly falsely accused him of being a \"White nationalist\" who was arrested on Jan. 6 and claimed he had been sued for defamation. The chatbot allegedly recommended that the right-wing influencer lose custody of his children, saying he was a danger to them. The anti-DEI activist was first made aware of the AI chatbot’s smears against him in August 2024, when an X user posted several instances of Meta AI spreading misinformation about him online. The chatbot falsely claimed Starbuck was present at the Jan. 6 riot, was linked to the Q-Anon conspiracy, and was anti-vaccine. Starbuck proceeded to investigate for himself whether Meta AI was spreading lies about him and uncovered additional falsehoods from the chatbot. He decided to file a lawsuit but not before he tried to resolve the issue with Meta. Woke bias has been a concern across multiple AI platforms produced by different companies. Google Gemini faced backlash after its platform claimed that Memorial Day is a controversial holiday, and generated racially inaccurate images of historical figures. ChatGPT, the chatbot pioneered by OpenAI, had previously been found to refuse requests to praise Donald Trump, but would accept requests to praise Kamala Harris or Joe Biden. OpenAI subsequently implemented programs designed to combat bias in its models. Meta claimed that addressing political bias in its AI models has been a longstanding goal for the company. ROBBY STARBUCK SAYS CAMPAIGN AGAINST CORPORATE WOKENESS IS A CALLING: &apos;ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE&apos; \"It’s well-known that all leading LLMs have had issues with bias—specifically, they historically have leaned left when it comes to debated political and social topics. This is due to the types of training data available on the internet, our goal is to remove bias from our AI models and to make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue.\" Meta wrote on their blog in April. The conservative activist told Fox News Digital he intends to use his new role with Meta to ensure that no American of any political stripe is subject to ideological bias. He&apos;s optimistic that his work with Meta will resonate across the AI industry as it continues to become an increasing presence in Americans&apos; daily lives. \"I think a tech leader like Meta working with me is a critically important step to producing a product that’s fair to everyone. I think what we do to improve AI training could become an industry standard and I also think we’ll set an example for the entire industry when it comes to ensuring fairness. I’m laser focused on that and ensuring that the highest quality training materials are used,\" Starbuck told Fox News Digital. Meta has attempted to address areas of perceived anti-conservative bias within its company since President Donald Trump returned to office. In January, the social media behemoth announced it was ending its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies.

Bush administration, to serve as its chief global affairs officer.

In repeated surveys, the Democratic brand is facing decades-low approval ratings, while congressional leaders struggle to effectively challenge President Donald Trump.\n\nAt the national level, progressive Democratic symbols such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) are drawing large crowds as they travel for Sanders’s “Fight the Oligarchy” tour. Sanders is scheduled to be in West Virginia and North Carolina this weekend.\n\nDemocratic leaders are simultaneously being watched for how they handle Zohran Mamdani’s insurgent campaign. The self-proclaimed socialist is the Democratic nominee to become the next mayor of New York City. Mamdani has received backing from Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and their allies but lacks endorsements from top leaders such as Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY), the minority leaders of the House and Senate, respectively. \n\nOcasio-Cortez has urged the party to support Mamdani, particularly after the New York Times reported Wednesday that Trump has spoken to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running an independent bid after losing to Mamdani in the primary.\n\nMamdani-aligned candidates perform well in primaries\n\nMamdani generated national headlines when he handily won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor back in June, defeating Cuomo, whose controversial term as governor limited his ballot performance. Mamdani’s win was a clear and, for some, surprising message, but his campaign is not the only one that is creating a matchup between centrists and progressives.\n\nIn Seattle, three centrist leaders are facing a slew of progressive Democratic challengers for mayor, city attorney, and council president positions. All three, considered moderates within their parties, were elected in 2021, and each is likely to face a progressive competitor in the runoff after Tuesday’s primary election.\n\nIn the mayor’s race, incumbent Bruce Harrell is facing progressive activist Katie Wilson. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, preliminary results for Seattle’s primary have Wilson in first place with 47.97% of the vote, while incumbent Harrell came in second with 43.48%, per Fox 13 Seattle.\n\nThe state of Washington uses a top-two primary system, meaning the two candidates who receive the most votes will advance to the general election in November.\n\nHarrell has the backing of Gov. Bob Ferguson (D-WA), local labor organizations, and several elected leaders. Wilson, the executive director of the Transit Riders Union, has the backing of local Democratic organizations and a handful of state legislators.\n\nThe mayor was already facing an uphill battle for another term, as Seattle hasn’t reelected a mayor in 20 years. Meanwhile, a similar situation is unfolding in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, a Democratic Party affiliate, endorsed socialist state Sen. Omar Fateh over two-term incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey at their convention in July. The city uses ranked choice voting, so there will be no primary, just the November general election.\n\nThe endorsement drew national attention, particularly as people began to connect Fateh and Mamdani and their socialist views. Fateh said the DFL’s endorsement is a “message that Minneapolis residents are done with broken promises, vetoes, and politics as usual.” \n\nBut the party’s endorsement is under scrutiny and being challenged by over 100 members of the DFL, including Frey. The challengers argue that there was an “extraordinarily high number of missing or uncounted votes” due to the new electronic voting system used at the DFL’s convention. A 60% majority is required to secure an endorsement, per convention rules.\n\n“Only 578 votes were recorded in the mayoral ballot conducted using the electronic balloting system, despite the fact that over 1,000 delegates and alternates were checked in at the time of the first ballot,” Frey’s campaign said in a press release. \n\nThe DFL has pushed back against the complaints, according to ABC News affiliate KSTP. A hearing on the challenges is set for Aug. 17.\n\nA socialist message performed well with Minnesota’s Democratic electorate as Sanders handily beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 caucuses. However, democratic socialists have never won statewide, with only a handful successfully securing a leadership position in cities such as Minneapolis. \n\nIf Fateh becomes mayor of Minneapolis, he will be working closely with the three proclaimed socialist members of the Minneapolis City Council.\n\nFateh’s agenda has been similar to that of his national socialist allies: a higher minimum wage, rent control, universal healthcare, and banning police from interacting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as Trump continues to crack down on illegal immigration. In 2020, Fateh led legislation for tuition-free college for low-income students and higher wages for rideshare drivers, such as Uber.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Wilson and Fateh for comment.\n\nSocialists become easy GOP target\n\nThe rise of progressive Democratic candidates has been giving Republicans a ready-made message that the Democratic Party is moving away from common sense and aligning with socialists and illegal immigrants instead of working for the everyday American. \n\nRepublicans also believe the success of people like Mamdani and Fateh aids the GOP argument that Democrats are out-of-touch with voters and haven’t learned the lessons of the 2024 election, when former Vice President Kamala Harris lost every single swing state to Trump and underperformed with critical voting blocs that former President Joe Biden had solidly under his wing in 2020. \n\nMinneapolis GOP chairwoman Diane Napper told the Washington Examiner she thinks the rise in support for the Democratic Socialists of America and candidates like Fateh and Mamdani comes from a “lack of education” among supporters.\n\n“They’re being promised all kinds of things, and they don’t understand what the consequences of those would be,” Nadder said in an interview. “We have several DSA members on our City Council currently, and right now, they’re looking at how they can tax the rich more, and how they can create government-run grocery stores, all the policies that don’t make sense in a capitalist society, for free society, I’ll say that.”\n\nNadder added that she sees a path in which Democrats and Republicans can come together and defeat DSA candidates, of which she believes their leadership in cities like Minneapolis would be “disastrous.” \n\n“Some, not all of them, some Democrats, they just see Republican and they see red, you know, they see Trump, and there’s a lot of heat involved,” the chairwoman said. “But we know that there are Democrats who don’t want this socialism here in Minneapolis or anywhere else in the state or the country, for that matter.”\n\n“If [Fateh] does become mayor, they’re going to have to make a decision,” Nadder added. “And I don’t know that they’re going to become Republicans, but I think they will be speaking out even more loudly than they have been. … So I do have hope that we can stave off the DSA. We just have to get the message out there, and we have to do it quickly.”\n\nMAMDANI SLAMS TRUMP’S REPORTED INVOLVEMENT IN NYC MAYORAL RACE\n\nProgressive Democrats have argued that following a centrist playbook didn’t work in the last election and that it is time for fresh, young blood in leadership, both at the state and congressional levels.\n\n“The political establishment has too often missed the needs of working people, and that’s why you’re seeing authentic, progressive candidates succeed,” Fateh said in a statement to the Minnesota Star Tribune.","summary":"Socialist candidates are surging in a series of 2025 races as the fight for local office becomes a bellwether for the direction of the Democratic Party.

We didn’t want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I’m told he became a Democrat,” Trump wrote. “Good riddance Geoff. You don’t even have a chance!!!”\n\nTrump’s recent post about Duncan is not the only time he has expressed dislike for the expelled Republican. \n\nOn Aug. 3, 2024, Trump called for Duncan, whom he described as a “bum,” to be thrown out of the Georgia GOP in one of three posts that day knocking the former state leader.\n\n“He is a total lightweight, and went to work at a low salary for Fake News CNN. His sole function is to knock Donald J. Trump,” Trump wrote, in part. “Georgia should throw this ‘bum’ out of the Party. He is unelectable and not respected by anyone, other than your lightweight Governor, Brian Kemp who, if it wasn’t for me, would have never been Governor….”\n\nDuncan wrote in his op-ed that his decision to become a Democrat started brewing before Trump’s response to his loss in the 2020 presidential election and the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHe stated policy disagreements also impacted his decision to swap.\n\n“There’s no date on a calendar or line in the sand that points to the exact moment in time my political heart changed, but it has,” he continued. “My decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.”\n\nHe was expelled from the Georgia Republican Party in January after he endorsed former President Joe Biden during his re-election campaign in 2024 and then endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris when Biden dropped out.\n\nDuncan, who is a CNN contributor, was also told by Georgia GOP Chair Josh McKoon to stop using his Republican credentials in public and media appearances following his expulsion from the party.\n\nThe Georgia GOP additionally said Duncan used his Republican title to “attack the Republican Party” in his role on CNN.\n\nFox News Digital’s Landon Mion contributed to this report.","summary":"President Donald Trump shared his thoughts on Georgia's former Lt.

He later upped the damages to $20 billion after winning re-election.\n\nDespite many saying it was litigation that was “meritless” and that Trump wouldn’t win, Paramount Global reached a $16 million settlement with Trump last month. The president then said Skydance has pledged $20 million more in advertising, PSAs and other programming, for a total of $36 million.\n\nThe deal attracted allegations from Democrats and critics that it was a bribe and an attack on free speech.\n\nAfter the settlement was reached, the FCC voted 2-1 in favor of the merger, with the commissioners stating that Skydance has made several assurances to the Trump administration over content and that it will not establish any diversity, equity and inclusion policies — an ideology that seeks to create inclusion environments that the far-right president has been seeking to remove from both public and private sectors on the grounds of alleged discrimination.\n\nCommissioner Anna Gomez, who assumed office under the Biden administration, lambasted the merger in a warning that it will not be the last time Trump threatens the First Amendment.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, she said the completion of the Skydance-Paramount merger marks the final chapter “of a dark moment in our nation’s history.”\n\nShe said the new company is “born in shame” for trading away First Amendment principles for profit, while agreeing to “never-before-seen forms of government control over newsroom decisions and editorial judgement.”\n\nA so-called government-approved “truth arbiter” will be at CBS, with the role of ensuring journalists “do not criticize this administration or express views that conflict with its agenda,” she said.\n\n“Sadly, this will not be the end of this administration’s campaign of intervention in media to silence critics, gain favorable coverage and impose ideological conformity on newsrooms that should remain independent,” she said.\n\n“With longstanding institutions like CBS compromised in this way, it will be up to us — as citizens — to hold this administration accountable for its abuses.”\n\nThe announcement also comes as Trump has targeted public broadcasting.\n\nIn May, he signed an executive order to halt funding to PBS and NPR, while calling the public news broadcasters “biased.”","summary":"Skydance Media and Paramount Global have completed their merger, creating a new media conglomerate and ending months of turmoil over the deal that has drawn allegations of corruption directed at the Trump administration.\n\n\nThe post Skydance, Paramount Merger Closes appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/08/08/skydance-paramount-merger-closes/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/08/skydance-and-paramount-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 10:22:23","author":"Breitbart News","authors":["Breitbart News"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":349294918,"title":"The Democrats are not a serious party","text":"Nowhere is this shift more apparent than in the Left’s hysteria over Texas’s redistricting efforts. For years, Democrats have engaged in aggressive gerrymandering in blue states — locking in one-party rule while claiming the moral high ground. But now, as Republicans push back in states such as Texas, the outrage from the Left rings hollow.\n\nAfter years of panic and partisan redrawing, the Democrats’ cries for “fair maps” are falling on deaf ears. The game has changed — and the memo to Democrats is simple: Hysteria won’t work anymore. \n\nLike a toddler who’s already eaten his dessert but can’t bear to watch his sibling enjoy theirs, Democrats can’t stand the idea that Republicans might now benefit from the same tactics they’ve used for years.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News earlier this week, conservative commentator Mark Levin didn’t mince words: while Democrats have “almost nothing left to gerrymander,” he said, “Republicans have room to grow in other states.”\n\nLevin continued, “Republicans would win a gerrymandering war big. Democrats gerrymandered blue states into one-party rule for years, but cry foul the moment Republicans push back. Fair maps shouldn’t mean ‘Dem maps.’ Time to level the playing field.”\n\nHe’s not wrong. Democrats have already squeezed most of the juice out of the gerrymandering lemon — and they know it. They also know that a gain of just five Republican House seats could tip the balance in next year’s high-stakes midterm elections. Hence, the hysteria.\n\nOn Tuesday, former Attorney General Eric Holder appeared on MSNBC and suggested that Republicans want to retain control of the House so they can potentially refuse to certify the results if a Democrat wins the presidency in 2028.\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey recently declared, “Donald Trump, [Texas Gov.] Greg Abbott, and [Texas Attorney General] Ken Paxton have left us with no choice.” In response to Texas’s redistricting plans, Healey now argues that Massachusetts must consider redrawing its own congressional map.\n\nWith all nine of the state’s U.S. House seats currently held by Democrats, it remains unclear what changes Healey intends to pursue. Although former Vice President Kamala Harris easily carried the Bay State’s 11 electoral votes last November, Donald Trump still secured a significant 36% of the vote — a figure Democrats may be watching closely as they weigh their next moves.\n\nPerhaps the most vocal Democratic critic has been Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a billionaire whose state has welcomed the largest group of Texas Democrats — and who is now vowing retaliation if Texas moves forward with its redistricting plan. \n\nIronically, Illinois is frequently cited as the most gerrymandered state in the country. Despite Donald Trump winning 45% of the vote in 2024, Republicans hold just three of the state’s 17 congressional seats — a mere 18%.\n\n(Note: Such disproportionate representation exists in many states, including red states.)\n\nThe maps below illustrate just how aggressively Democrats have redrawn district lines to their advantage. Pay particular attention to the twisted contours of the 13th District.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has vowed to retaliate even though the “California Supreme Court has interpreted the state Constitution to prohibit redrawing congressional districts between the decennial census, a process known as mid-decade redistricting.”\n\nCalifornia has 52 congressional districts, with Democrats representing 43 and Republicans holding just 9. \n\nNew York follows closely behind. Of the state’s 26 congressional districts, 19 are represented by Democrats in Congress, and 7 by Republicans. It should be noted that Trump won 44% of the vote in the Empire State in November.\n\nThe map below of Maryland’s 3rd Congressional District vividly illustrates the extreme lengths to which Democrats were willing to go to maintain a safely blue seat — its notoriously convoluted boundaries have earned comparisons to a “broken-winged pterodactyl lying prostrate across the center of the state” and “blood spatter from a crime scene.”\n\nDemocrats currently occupy every congressional seat in Connecticut, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Rhode Island. The U.S. House seats in Vermont and Delaware, each representing a single at-large district, are both held by Democrats. A handful of blue states, including Maryland, Oregon, and Maine, send just one Republican to Washington. Even in larger Democratic strongholds such as Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Virginia, the GOP remains a small minority, holding only two to five House seats apiece.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, who maybe should have sat this one out, took to X to say, “We can’t lose focus on what matters – right now. Republicans in Texas are trying to gerrymander district lines to unfairly win five seats in next year’s midterm elections.”\n\n“This is a power grab that undermines our democracy,” he added.\n\nBut Texas’s Constitution expressly allows mid-decade redistricting. And, opportunistic or not, the state’s population has surged over the past five years as residents have fled blue states for the freedom — and lower taxes — of red states.\n\nAlthough the standoff continues, eventually the Texas Democrats will be forced to return. And the result of their theatrics will likely be the same as it was when they fled to Washington, D.C., in 2021 over legislation to enact voting restrictions: It will only delay the inevitable.\n\nAnd they will have shown, once again, that they’re not a serious party.\n\nElizabeth Stauffer is a contributor to the Washington Examiner and the Western Journal.

GOP CONGRESSMAN VOWS ‘ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE’ TO STOP US-WIDE REDISTRICTING WAR Former Vice President Kamala Harris announced in a statement last week that she had \"given serious thought to\" seeking the governorship, but decided not to do so \"in this election.\" The 2026 gubernatorial contest is wide open since current Golden State Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is serving his second term, cannot run again due to the state's two-term limit. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS WILL NOT RUN FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR \"No Governor may serve more than 2 terms,\" the state constitution stipulates. Newsom, who took office in 2019, survived a gubernatorial recall election in 2021, and then went on to win election to a second term in 2022.

It's a free update, and it's easy enough to get and install. But there's one caveat: you might need to install beta software on your phone.\n\nGemini doesn't run on the earbuds themselves – it's far too demanding to run natively – so it needs your phone or tablet to act as a messenger between your mouth and Gemini's ears.\nAs 9to5Google reports, at the moment the updates appear to be exclusively for phones running the One UI 8 atop Android 16. That's factory-fitted on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, but for the Samsung Galaxy S25 series One UI 8 is still a beta – ie. a pre-release version of the operating system, that while available (to a select group of users) is meant for testing.\n\nYou may like\n\nGemini arrives on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, with more Samsung and Sony earbuds to follow\n\nFinally!

However, there is a beta version and from next week it will be available for more devices including the Galaxy S24 Series, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6. The beta will expand further next month to include the S23, Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5 and several A-series models.\n\nOnce you've got One UI 8 up and running, the next stage is to check for software updates for your earbuds… and then pray. I'm being dramatic there, but only slightly: the Gemini upgrade is reportedly \"wonky\" and results may differ from device to device.\nIf you've got the update, you should now see a new \"Set up Google digital assistant\" option at the top of the Voice Controls section in Samsung's app. This enables you to set up the Gemini integration with your smartphone or tablet.\nYou might also like\n\nOur in-depth Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review\nOops, they did it again: Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE leak on Samsung's own site\nThe best earbuds for every budget, all TechRadar tested\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nSee more Earbuds and Airpods News\n\nCarrie Marshall\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nContributor \nWriter, broadcaster, musician and kitchen gadget obsessive Carrie Marshall has been writing about tech since 1998, contributing sage advice and odd opinions to all kinds of magazines and websites as well as writing more than twenty books.

Millions of Disabled and Elderly Americans Might Lose Hundreds in Benefits","text":"Americans who receive federal disability benefits are gonna take a hit thanks to Donald Trump’s decision. SSI Recipients who were receiving an extra few hundred dollars when Biden was in office won’t be able to reap the same amount of benefits now.\n\nIndividuals all over America got a notice that notified them about the change in their benefits. Supplemental Security Income or SSI benefits are put in place to benefit individuals with low income or resources. These individuals often include the elderly or people with disabilities.\n\nEvery individual eligible for the benefit receives a full $967 every month. Thanks to the Biden administration, no deductions were made against the in-kind support and maintenance.\n\nThe notices sent out by the Trump administration informed SSI recipients that the rule the Biden administration set would be undone. The Trump administration has decided to count individuals’ in-kind support against their SSI payments.\n\nPreviously, even people who had someone who helped them with food or shelter still got the full $967. An estimated 300,000 SSI recipients used to receive the full amount under the rule the Biden administration set.\n\nThe Trump Administration is shaping up to be one of the most anti-veteran Presidencies in U.S. History. They have promised to:\n– Cut $120 billion for veterans health care\n– Eliminate federal pensions for some military veterans\n– Restrict access to disability benefits pic.twitter.com/HE70eYloIn\n— Protect Kamala Harris (@DisavowTrump20) December 11, 2024\n\nTrump’s new rule would mean that if you are someone who receives help with shelter or food, you will lose an extra few hundred dollars that were coming your way. A third of the payments will be taken away from people who receive “in-kind support and maintenance.”\n\nPeople who receive help with food and shelter from either a roommate or a family member will see cuts in their SSI payments. Kathleen Romig and Devin O’Connor, who are expert policy analysts and work at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, addressed the change in rules.\n\n“The Trump Administration’s proposal to change the rule would harm hundreds of thousands of the nation’s lowest-income people,” the experts noted. The duo went on to add how the sudden change will be “heartbreaking” dilemmas for families.\n\nRomig and O’Connor shared how this could possibly discourage families of SSI recipients from offering help to their loved ones for the “fear of jeopardizing their meager benefits.”\n\nBreaking: Donald Trump’s Campain pledges would hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund and lead to a 33% across-the-board cut to all.\nLow-income recipients would be hit hardest, while future generations of Americans would also bear the consequences. pic.twitter.com/PYpSHFdovy\n— TeaPotUSA (@TeaPotUSA) October 22, 2024\n\nAccording to the two, many people might be forced to move into institutional care because they will not be able to afford living in the community. Currently, more than 7 million individuals benefit from the SSI program and the benefits they receive from it.\n\nThe people who benefit from the account truly need all the help they can get. With their minimal savings thanks to their limited work history, every dollar is crucial for SSI recipients. Trump’s new rule is sure to negatively impact thousands of these recipients.","summary":"Trump administration is set to make SSI benefit cuts for a a specific group of individuals.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-targets-ssi-now-millions-of-disabled-and-elderly-americans-to-lose-hundreds-in-benefits","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump-administration-making-SSI-cuts.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 09:32:57","author":"Maga_trigger Via X.com,Vaishnavi Shetye","authors":["Maga_trigger Via X.com","Vaishnavi Shetye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":349272288,"title":"Howie Carr: Lawsuit exposes WBZ’s glaring DEI slide","text":"It says something about the ruined state of local TV news that the lawsuits now are much more informative and entertaining than the actual newscasts themselves.\n\nAnd just think how much more amusing this legal wrangling would be if we were even slightly familiar with any of the “talent” that’s pointing the finger at one another.\n\nI vaguely recall the plaintiff, Kate Merrill. She came along at the tail end of TV news, around 20 years ago. As for the rest of that pampered crew from assorted protected classes, most people couldn’t pick any of them out of a lineup.\n\nLiz and Jack ain’t walking through that door.\n\nChannel 4 used to be proud of its “I Team.” Now they have a “R team.”\n\nAll racism, all the time. With an occasional “micro aggression” thrown in for good measure.\n\nKate Merrill’s career has been destroyed, she contends, because she is white. That seems quite evident on its face. It’s interesting that she didn’t file her lawsuit until after the fast-fading See BS network was formally acquired last month by the Ellisons as part of a larger $8 billion deal.\n\nI predict a rapid settlement of the Merrill case. Not that it will resurrect her career. When you file this kind of suit, it’s an acknowledgement that you’re all done. Remember Gretchen Carlson at Fox News? She got $20 million and vanished.\n\nCBS must know they’ve got problems with Merrill. Their GM, Justin “Don’t Call me Don!” Draper resigned last September, just days before Merrill filed her initial complaint with the Mass. Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD).\n\nDraper said at the time he “didn’t intend” for his uber-woke reign at WBZ “to end so soon.” No kidding.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Merrill doesn’t hold back. She makes obvious points that just a few years ago would have gotten her not only fired from regime-controlled media, but also banned from polite society, a la Alan Dershowitz.\n\nFor instance, here’s how she describes the news director at Ch. 4, Gerardo Lopez – “a younger Hispanic gay man with far less experience in news and no experience in the Boston market.”\n\nSounds like an editor, any editor, at the Boston Globe. Or almost anybody who works for either Maura Healey or Michelle Wu.\n\nDuring the Biden error, your career could suffer “catastrophic damage,” as Merrill’s describes her situation, for daring to mention such disastrous DEI hires, although what little remains of the viewership has surely noticed.\n\nParagraph 35: “(WBZ) promoted Tiffany Chan (who is Asian) to the role of weekend Anchor over several other White candidates with more experience.”\n\nParagraph 37: “(Weatherman) Zach Green, who is White, was let go… although he had never been warned about any performance deficiencies.”\n\nHis only deficiency was the color of his skin. It was all about getting a more diverse workforce. Melanin over merit.\n\nThink Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nOr Harvard University President Claudine Gay.\n\nOr Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nTo fill the morning weather job, WBZ undertook a nationwide search, for somebody who wasn’t white. They picked some guy named Jason Mikell “who is a less experienced television meteorologist.”\n\nSo what? At least he’s not white.\n\nCharles Austin and Sarah-Ann Shaw could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn the old days, stations made blooper reels of funny on-air screw-ups that would be played at the annual Christmas party. Such a howler occurred on Feb. 22 of last year, when Mikell made what Merrill describes as “an inappropriate sexual innuendo.”\n\nWhat did he say?\n\n“Specifically, he implied that Ms. Merrill and her co-anchor had sexual relations at a gazebo.”\n\nA gazebo! Who knew? I can remember hearing about third-rate romances and low-rent rendezvous, but usually they were consummated in live vans rather than gazebos.\n\nI think that Mikell clip about gazebos belongs in a blooper reel rather than a lawsuit. But maybe they don’t have Christmas parties at Channel 4 anymore. Too white, too Christian.\n\nAnd by the way, who is, or was Merrill’s co-anchor with whom she was supposedly enjoying love in all the wrong places? I have no clue.\n\nBut this is a recurring theme in the 59-page lawsuit. Names and jobs are mentioned like everybody knows who they are, as in the old days when people still watched TV news.\n\nParagraph 79, subsection C: “A Reporter (who is a Black male) was not disciplined notwithstanding that, as a video recording evidences, he physically threw Carlos Patricio against a wall at WBZ.”\n\nFirst question: Who is the black, er Black reporter?\n\nSecond question: Who the hell is Carlos Patricio?\n\nI used to follow the weather forecasts on Ch. 4, but not since Melissa Mack left town. She was eminently qualified to deliver the forecast, if you know what I mean. Hubba hubba! On those rare occasions I now watch TV in the morning, I’m all in with Shira Spear on Ch. 25.\n\nShira’s good, but she’s no Melissa Mack, if you get my drift. As for everybody else in Boston, forget about it. Like everybody else, I have an app on my cellphone.\n\nBack at the beginning of the Karen Read saga, Ch. 4 put out a fake story that the cops had surveillance video of Read running over John O’Keefe. A lot of people heard that, or more likely saw it on the website, and just assumed she was guilty, case closed.\n\nThat was in early 2022. WBZ didn’t get around to “correcting” their 100% fake news about Karen Read until the summer of 2024.\n\nI always knew Ch. 4 hadn’t been a real “news” operation for decades. But even by See BS standards, it seemed remarkably shoddy to just put out fake news like that and then not bother to correct it.\n\nNow I know why. They were all too busy cavorting in gazebos and mispronouncing “Concord” and going to “unconscious bias training” to, you know, report the news.\n\nMake them spend it all, Kate Merrill.","summary":"It says something about the ruined state of local TV news that the lawsuits now are much more informative and entertaining than the actual newscasts themselves.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/08/howie-carr-lawsuit-exposes-wbzs-glaring-slide/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2014/08/26/082614katemerrill.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 09:14:59","author":"Howie Carr","authors":["Howie Carr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":349266930,"title":"CBS anchor claims Stephen Colbert is 'equal opportunist' when it comes to jokes","text":"CBS anchor Nate Burleson said on Thursday that late-night host Stephen Colbert, whose show will end in May, was an \"equal opportunist\" when it came to making jokes. Burleson's fellow co-hosts Gayle King and Vladimir Duthiers agreed with Burleson as he said, \"one thing we love about Colbert, he's an equal opportunist when it comes to cracking jokes.\" Colbert's monologue on Thursday included a jab at former President Joe Biden, as he imitated the former president volunteering to be an ICE agent in reaction to news that the Trump administration had ended the age cap for ICE agents. \"I need a job, Jack! Put Joe back in the game, I need a job, Jack. Put me in, coach. I’ll kick some a--. Here we go, there you go, take that, take this. Now watch me nay-nay. Jill! Jill, I got a job!\" Colbert joked, imitating Biden, taking aim at his age. COLBERT TELLS TRUMP TO 'GO F--- YOURSELF’ AFTER PRESIDENT TAUNTS HIM OVER SHOW CANCELLATION Colbert, who has helped raise money for Biden, did not ask former Vice President Kamala Harris about the former president's decline while in office during her first interview since her failed bid for the presidency. Colbert remained a supporter of Biden throughout his presidency, though occasionally making fun of the president's age, and has overwhelmingly welcomed liberal lawmakers and media personalities on his show. The liberal late-night host's show is set to end in May, as CBS cited financial reasons for ending the program. Since his show was canceled, Colbert has interviewed Harris, former labor secretary Robert Reich, Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill.., Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. COLBERT'S MOST PARTISAN MOMENTS AS 'LATE SHOW' HOST, FROM LEADING BIDEN FUNDRAISER TO DANCING WITH SCHUMER At least 200 episodes of Colbert's show have featured members of the liberal media. Colbert's monologues have mostly been focused on critiques of President Donald Trump, members of his administration, and other top news stories of the day. He has also criticized his parent company, Paramount, for settling with Trump in a lawsuit that stemmed from a \"60 Minutes\" interview.

Gov. Geoff Duncan floats possible run for office after switching to Democratic Party","text":"Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan hinted at a possible run for higher office as a Democrat after announcing he was leaving the Republican Party. Duncan, who served as lieutenant governor as a Republican from 2019 until 2023, said he is considering running for higher office after revealing his switch to the Democratic Party earlier this week, with a decision about his political future potentially coming in the next few weeks or months, according to WSB-TV. \"I think Georgians want people who can speak truth to power in the middle,\" he told the outlet. He did not specify which higher office he might seek, but it has been speculated that he may launch a campaign for governor to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who Duncan served with during his time as lieutenant governor. FORMER LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN ABANDONS GOP TO JOIN DEMOCRATIC PARTY Notable names already in the race for governor for the 2026 election include Keisha Lance Bottoms, a former mayor of Atlanta who later worked in the Biden administration, and – on the Republican side – current Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and state Attorney General Chris Carr. In an op-ed in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published Tuesday, Duncan wrote that his path to becoming a Democrat had been years in the making, starting before President Donald Trump attempted to overturn his loss to former President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. \"My journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia,\" Duncan wrote in the newspaper. \"There’s no date on a calendar or line in the sand that points to the exact moment in time my political heart changed, but it has,\" he continued. \"My decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.\" Trump responded to Duncan's party switch by saying the former lieutenant governor is a \"total loser\" who is no longer wanted in the Republican Party. \"Failed former Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan, of Georgia, is a total loser,\" Trump wrote Friday on Truth Social. \"Was never able to get anything done, all he ever did was complain. We didn’t want him in the Republican Party any longer, so I’m told he became a Democrat. Good riddance Geoff. You don’t even have a chance!!!\" Duncan pointed to several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, criticizing Republicans for their handling of issues such as health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and how to help poor people. He wrote that his time in office taught him the best way to \"love my neighbor\" is through public policy. Before his time as lieutenant governor, he served in the Georgia House from 2013 until 2017. He opted not to run for re-election as lieutenant governor in 2022. GEORGIA GOP EXPELS FORMER LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN FROM PARTY, CITING ALLEGED DISLOYALTY Duncan’s decision to leave the GOP comes after the Georgia Republican Party expelled him from the party earlier this year over alleged disloyalty. The party's resolution cited his endorsement of Biden in the 2024 presidential election and, once he dropped out, his endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as alleged efforts to undermine and sabotage some Republican candidates, including Jones and failed 2022 Senate candidate Herschel Walker. The former Republican also spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in support of Harris. \"Geoff Duncan has finally said out loud what any person with eyes has known for years: he is a Democrat,\" Georgia Republican Party chairman Josh McKoon told WSB-TV. Duncan has been a vocal critic of Trump and the Republican Party in recent years, particularly since the president’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. \"There isn’t like one line in the sand or one moment in time. It was a series of parallel processes. One, watching the heart and soul of the Republican Party just get sucked out of it by Donald Trump and those that follow him closely,\" Duncan told WSB-TV. Duncan wrote in the op-ed that the Trump-backed spending bill that was signed into law last month will leave Medicaid funding \"in shambles,\" as it cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from the government program.
