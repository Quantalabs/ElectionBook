Experts say it's all part of a master plan","text":"A man had been murdered and protests were spreading across the United States.\n\nTraumatized Americans, sickened by violence, were searching their souls, asking what should be done. It was a fraught time, but the Duchess of Sussex knew she had to speak out.\n\n'I wanted to say the right thing and I was really nervous that I wouldn't, or that it would get picked apart,' she told students at her old Los Angeles high school in June 2020, after the killing of George Floyd.\n\n'I realize,' she said, 'the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing.'\n\nMeghan Markle seemed fearless back then.\n\nNow, with the country stunned once more by murder - this time of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk - and with President Donald Trump visiting her husband's homeland, Meghan's relative silence may speak volumes.\n\nNatalie Trice, who has spent 30 years advising clients about public relations and communications, senses a 'scaled-back approach' that 'feels like a deliberate shift, but maybe not one she has decided on.'\n\nAnd, Trice says, that's a bit of a shame.\n\n'Right now, look at what's happening to women's voices, and the voices of minorities,' she added. 'Meghan could use her voice not just for Hollywood visibility, but for impact, to amplify others, shape conversations and challenge the status quo.'\n\nIndeed, it's not that the 44-year-old has disappeared in the last 18 months - far from it.\n\nAsked in August whether there were any issues she was 'dying' to weigh in on but couldn't, Meghan told Bloomberg: 'No. I just make a choice of what matters to me, and what is important to me.'\n\nShe added: 'If there was anything I wanted to say or felt necessary to say then I'd say it.'\n\nMeghan relaunched her Instagram account in January and has been busily documenting date nights with her husband Prince Harry and idyllic scenes from their picture-perfect garden. Even their two children - six-year-old Archie and Lilibet, four - feature in the glossy montages: something that was once an anathema to the privacy-obsessed pair.\n\nWhen the Los Angeles wildfires broke out earlier this year, the couple visited an evacuation center and helped hand out emergency food parcels.\n\nShe tried again with a podcast.\n\nHer 12-part Archetypes series had been dropped by Spotify in June 2023 and Confessions of a Female Founder debuted in April with much fanfare, but as of today there have only been nine episodes, with the last released in June. And last month the second season of her critically panned Netflix lifestyle show, With Love, Meghan, made its debut.\n\nTrice said that Meghan's apparent pivot from meaty issues to soft-focus Instagram photos could be orchestrated by Netflix, which signed a deal to promote both her shows and her lifestyle brand, As Ever. \n\nBoth the Duchess and Netflix were approached by the Daily Mail for comment, but declined to do so. \n\nTrice said it was a delicate decision.\n\n'Meghan is walking a communications tightrope,' Trice said. 'Say too much, she's criticized. Say nothing, and she's accused of being performative. It's a classic case of \"damned if she does, damned if she doesn't\".'\n\nEden Gillott, a PR specializing in crisis communications, agrees.\n\n'She has a business brand to protect and a show built around friendship and joy that doesn't align with political hot takes,' he claimed. 'By holding back, she is repositioning her voice to be more intentional, closer to the Michelle Obama model, where people lean in when she does choose to speak.'\n\n'Holding back' is not a trait that many may associate with Meghan.\n\nShe often tells the story of her childhood activism, describing how at the age of 11 she wrote to a dishwasher liquid company and demanded they change their advertisements that appealed to only women to ones that targeted all consumers.\n\nIn May 2016, she said on a Comedy Central late-night show that Donald Trump was 'misogynistic' and 'divisive'. He, in return, called her 'nasty.' She prided herself on 'speaking her truth', claiming to the world that there was racism inside the British royal family and championing political causes such as paid family leave and voting rights.\n\nMeghan declared in Glamour magazine in 2017 that her heroines included Madeleine Albright, the first female secretary of state, and trailblazing environmentalist Jane Goodall. On moving to California in March 2020, she contacted Gloria Steinem to ask her to work on a voter-registration drive.\n\n'She reminds me that when you have anger, you have to channel that energy into something that makes a difference,' said Meghan at the time. 'That's what activism is. It's about how we show up.'\n\nOnly years later, in 2021, the Duchess told a summit why she was so passionate about paid parental leave, insisting: 'Even before I had any sort of privilege in my life - when my life and my lifestyle were very, very different - I always stood up for what was right.'\n\nFor a moment, Meghan even took up the mantle of gun-control activist.\n\nShe visited the Texas town of Uvalde in May 2022 following one of the worst school shootings in US history and sent a letter of support to members of the Moms Demand Action movement, founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting. She returned with Harry in March 2024 to visit the family of teacher, Irma Garcia, who was among the 21 Uvalde victims.\n\nBut that crusading activity, too, seems to have faded: she had nothing to say about last month's Minneapolis church shooting, during which two young students were killed and nearly two dozen adults were injured.\n\nOnce, her name was even tossed around as a possible political candidate, with Meghan and Harry reportedly meeting Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, in October 2020 via Zoom to discuss her replacing then-Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nThe rumors surged once more in 2023 when Senator Dianne Feinstein died, with speculation that Meghan might seek the seat.\n\nNow she is adamant that the idea does not appeal.\n\n'No,' Meghan said in April, when asked if she would ever consider running for office. 'Never. Oh, God. I mean, you could say, \"Never say never.\" No, I'm not interested in that. No.'\n\nMark Borkowski, a crisis PR consultant, said: 'Meghan has learned, the hard way, that volume isn't the same as influence. The early phase of \"finding her voice\" became a cacophony - every speech, every podcast clip, every political nudge was amplified and often weaponized against her. The result? Fatigue. The media got bored of the sermon, the public got tired of the tone, and her commercial partners got nervous.'\n\nBorkowski said she was likely being warned to steer clear of controversy, in a bid to maintain a broad appeal.\n\n'Netflix and her other backers don't want noise - they want focus,' he said. 'A glossy docuseries or lifestyle brand can't thrive if the headlines are dominated by political spats or stray comments about the royals. Silence, in this case, is a strategy: it keeps the attention on the product, not the controversy.'\n\nWhich leaves her, well... chatting to her friends on her podcast and TV show, and making jam?","summary":"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, was once weighing in on women's rights, gun control and politics.

Just the opposite was true.\n\nThe shooter, Tyler Robinson, was on record with his family expressing hatred for the conservative Kirk.\n\nRobinson engraved his bullets with both Antifa-like “anti-fascist” messaging and transgender references.\n\nHe lived with his transgender partner, who was a leftist.\n\nStay up to date on the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\n\nCharlie Kirk’s mentor reveals Turning Point USA founder’s final moments: ‘He was with Jesus’\n\nTrump says he told Charlie Kirk ‘you have a good chance at being president’\n\nJimmy Kimmel raged against Trump and his ‘MAGA mouth-breathers’ almost every night for a year before ABC pulled him off air\n\nCharlie Kirk had ‘break-up’ with Candace Owens after she went ‘too down the rabbit holes’\n\nArmed man posing as law enforcement arrested at Arizona stadium where Charlie Kirk’s funeral will be held\n\nRobinson’s aim was to end Kirk’s peaceful conservative career because he hated his politics and popularity and feared his influence.\n\nFive, the left used the death of Floyd to promote its hard-left and otherwise unpopular agenda — defunding the police, cashless bail, decriminalization of theft and DEI mandates.\n\nIt manipulated outrage, chaos and months-long violence to ram through radical cultural and top-down legal changes that otherwise had little popular support.\n\nConservatives upset over Kirk’s murder will bolster Turning Point USA. \n\nThey are determined through peaceful means to persuade more youth about the poverty and dangers of progressive thought.\n\nWhy is the left fabricating the circumstances surrounding and following Kirk’s murder?\n\nIn its signature projective style, the left is terrified that the right might follow its own example — by manipulating facts, ginning up street violence and issuing non-negotiable demands to achieve its agenda.\n\nBut the chief difference between the Kirk assassination and the death of Floyd is that the post-Floyd agenda had no majority support and so had to be rammed through in hysterical times by implied threats of unending violence beyond five months of continued mayhem.\n\nThe post-Kirk agenda eschewed violence because it was both morally wrong and politically counterproductive — since most Americans naturally favored most of what Kirk championed.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.","summary":"What a difference in how Americans reacted to Charlie Kirk vs. George Floyd&#39;s deaths","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/19/opinion/what-a-difference-in-how-americans-reacted-to-charlie-kirk-vs-george-floyds-deaths/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-h524pnpam-1758314796995.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1758300444&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Y3L9dLTt-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-20 19:05:25","author":"Victor Davis Hanson","authors":["Victor Davis Hanson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":362150976,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel's liberal bias laid bare as study reveals exact number of pro-Trump guests he hosted in the last four years","text":"Disgraced late-night host Jimmy Kimmel has only hosted one conservative guest in the last four years, according to new research.\n\nThe study noted that the only prominent conservative on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in recent years was MyPillow CEO and Trump ally Mike Lindell, according to research conducted by the conservative NewsBusters organization. \n\nThe research comes after Disney and ABC decided to indefinitely suspend the show after Kimmel's monologue about Charlie Kirk's assassination. \n\nNewsBusters is a project under the Media Research Center, which uses TV news archives and databases to collect data. \n\nA separate study from the organization claimed that 92 percent of the jokes Kimmel made on his show since January 2023 were at the expense of conservatives, and 97 percent of his political guests were left-leaning. \n\nNewsBusters also found that out of 7,797 political jokes that Kimmel made over 369 episodes, 7,189 were about right-leaning people or topics. \n\nThe study claimed that only 565 of his jokes targeted those on the left, which equates to about seven percent. \n\nNewsBusters cited Kimmel's top target as Donald Trump, with a whopping total of 3,584 jokes at the president's expense. \n\nHis second most-joked-about political figure was former president Joe Biden, with about 386 jokes targeted at him. \n\nExiled former Representative George Santos ranked third, followed by Elon Musk, Mike Lindell, Melania Trump, Donald Trump Jr., MAGA/Trump supporters, Eric Trump, and then Republicans as a political party. \n\nThe study noted that Lindell has appeared on Kimmel twice in recent years, once in 2021 and again in 2023. \n\nHowever, his appearance in 2023 was a comedic skit where he sat inside a claw machine as Kimmel trolled him, asking questions like: 'Why do you think people don't take you seriously?' \n\nNewsBusters mentioned a recent interview Kimmel conducted with comedian Bill Burr, but noted that his politics aren't consistently conservative or liberal. \n\nEven though the study claimed Kimmel had only one conservative on his show in four years, former Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared on the show in July when comedian Fortune Feimster guest-hosted. \n\nSchwarzenegger has latterly abandoned his GOP roots and revealed he was voting for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's election. \n\nGeorge Conway, who was previously married to former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, also appeared on the show last September. \n\nConway was a founding member of The Lincoln Project, a political action committee comprised of moderate and former Republicans heavily critical of Trump.\n\nKimmel has hosted several conservatives on his show throughout its entirety, including Trump, who came on the show in 2015. \n\nTrump told Kimmel during his interview that he was willing to debate Bernie Sanders and defended the temporary ban on Muslims he had proposed at the time. \n\nDuring his first presidential campaign, Trump also sat down for interviews with Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon. \n\nOther conservatives to appear on Kimmel's show include: Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in 2016, Senator Ted Cruz in 2016, and Senator Bill Cassidy in 2017. \n\nKimmel's show has become a flashpoint of partisanship following its abrupt suspension after Kirk slammed the 'MAGA gang' for using Kirk's assassination 'to score political points' by mischaracterizing his alleged killer, Tyler Robinson. \n\nHe then cut to a video of Donald Trump talking to reporters during his monologue, where the president answered a question about how he was handling Kirk's death. \n\nWhen asked how he was holding up, Trump responded: 'I think very good,' before directing the reporter's attention to construction on the White House ballroom. \n\n'He's at the fourth stage of grief: construction,' Kimmel joked. \n\nThe suspension has resulted in an outpouring of support from those who believe Kimmel's free speech was infringed upon following pressure from the Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. \n\nHowever, those on the right have defended the federal government, claiming the move was due to Kimmel's unpopularity. \n\nDaily Mail has reached out to Kimmel's representatives and Disney for comment on the recent study.","summary":"A new study has slammed Jimmy Kimmel for a liberal bias, noting the lack of conservatives to appear on his show.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15117605/jimmy-kimmel-left-wing-conservative-guest.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/20/18/102309149-0-image-m-40_1758388423407.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/20/8833640469793949003/1024x576_MP4_8833640469793949003.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-20 18:37:06","author":"Editor,Sophie Gable","authors":["Editor","Sophie Gable"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":362124920,"title":"The students who debated with Charlie Kirk: ‘His goal was to verbally defeat us’","text":"In the days after his killing, Charlie Kirk was remembered by his allies as a great debater. A quote taken from a widely shared video of Kirk discussing his life’s work – “when people stop talking, that’s when violence happens” – emblematized such eulogies.\n\nKirk toured American college campuses with his rightwing non-profit Turning Point USA, where he would set up a tent, table and microphone, and debate with undergrads. The goal, he said, was to “save western civilization”, and remembrances after his death positioned him as a budding statesman – a conservative hero who strode across the political divide for the sake of open dialogue.\n\nKirk applied basic rules of civility to his debate style, asking opponents their name and saying it was nice to meet them. He engaged young people in political discourse at a time when society has been split into bitterly antagonistic camps. But his critics are taking issue with any version of his legacy that does not account for the bigoted nature of his arguments. They are also closely examining his very style of deate.\n\n“I don’t think Charlie entered debates to come to a common consensus or to discover the truth,” said Mason, a 26-year-old graduate student who debated with Kirk on the YouTube show Surrounded last fall. “I think Charlie came to debates to verbally beat his opponents.”\n\nThis made him a formidable combatant. “He knew the arguments for nearly every conservative principle and even theological concept, and he spent years to develop that ability, so he was very great at pivoting and changing the conversation when it was not going his way,” said Mason, who is based in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring one debate, Kirk insisted on the truthfulness of a racist hoax about Haitian immigrants eating their neighbors’ pets. In another, he falsely called the term foetus “just a word for a human being”. He goaded college students, who eagerly stepped up to query or challenge him, with leading questions that were intended to elicit strong emotions – “what is a woman?” and “what is racism?” were two of his go-tos.\n\n“At its core, debate is supposed to be an academic exercise, with the goal being to be forthright and genuine in the information you present,” said Trent Webb, a professor of writing studies and rhetoric and director of the speech and debate team at Hofstra University. “In a good faith debate, the final goal is to reach consensus. If that doesn’t happen, then a lot of academics would consider it to be an exercise in futility.”\n\nAfter a Kirk debate, clips spun out on to social media, inviting millions into the fray. In celebration of perceived wins, Turning Point USA titled its YouTube videos things like: “Charlie Kirk ANNIHILATES Smart-Aleck Student Accusing Him of Propaganda”, “Charlie Kirk wrecks DEI talking points” and “Liberal Student Can’t Answer Charlie Kirk’s Simple Question.”\n\nDr Charles Woods, a professor of rhetoric and composition at East Texas A&M University, and the host of The Big Rhetorical Podcast, said Kirk distilled nuanced topics into stifling, good v bad arguments.\n\n“Charlie turned myriad opportunities for meaningful dialogic transactions rooted in civility and turned them into confrontational interactions by amplifying binaries in his argumentative structure,” Woods wrote in an email. “What we know is that there is a spectrum of ideologies and worldviews, not just two: Charlie’s and whoever is on the other side of the microphone.”\n\nHasan Piker, the popular leftist Twitch streamer who was scheduled to debate with Charlie Kirk later this month, wrote in a guest essay published in the New York Times that his would-be opponent was an “expert” at “[taking] advantage of people’s resentments and [redirecting] them toward vulnerable communities”.\n\nStill, leftists lined up to debate with him. Some, like a sociology professor who appeared genuinely curious to talk about the economic prospects of young people under Donald Trump, desired a meeting of the minds. For his part, Piker told Slate that while he is “not the biggest fan of the debate format”, he finds the forum “entertaining” and “galvanizing”.\n\nPerhaps no forum fit Kirk’s shtick better than the platform given to him by Jubilee Media, a YouTube channel that produces Surrounded, a thunderdome of debate where one person is encircled by a ring of ideological opponents who attempt to undercut his stances in lightning-fast rounds of verbal sparring, governed by literal red flags.\n\n“Can 25 Liberal College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative?” asked the series’ first episode, an hour and a half of nonstop ragebait released last September. In the show, Kirk debated with his opponents such statements as: “Abortion is murder and should be illegal” (wherein Kirk said yes, he would hypothetically make his 10-year-old daughter carry a child to term if she were to get pregnant from rape); “college is a scam”; and “Kamala Harris is a DEI candidate.” (Consider these Kirk’s greatest hits; he often debated these topics on campuses.)\n\nNaima Troutt, a 22-year-old film student at the University of Southern California, said the students made $25 for their appearance on the show, which has since raked in more than 35m views on YouTube and spawned countless viral clips.\n\nA campus organizer who was involved with Black Lives Matter and Palestinian solidarity protests, Troutt did not know who Kirk was when she showed up to set that day, which helped her see him as less of a rightwing celebrity and more as a man she disagreed with.\n\nTroutt described a “camaraderie” between the students, with some of the more “chronically online” trying to explain Kirk’s significance to her before they started filming. But Kirk was not as eager to chum it up. “He was either on his phone, or outright rude. You got the sense that you were an opponent to him even when you weren’t debating.”\n\nTroutt jumped into the hot seat twice to spar with Kirk over fetal viability, Harris’s qualifications for president and affirmative action. They agreed on practically nothing, but Troutt found some merit in debating Kirk. “I think I became much better at articulating my viewpoints and defending my viewpoints, because one thing about Charlie is that as much as I disagree with – and at times hate – everything that he believed and stated in the past, the fact is he’s one of the only rightwingers who regularly puts themselves out there,” Troutt said.\n\nTroutt is not alone in this opinion. California governor Gavin Newsom, who debated with Kirk on his podcast earlier this year (and admitted his son was a fan), wrote in a statement that he “admired [Kirk’s] passion and commitment to debate”. Representatives for New College of Florida, formerly a progressive school that fell under the control of rightwing allies of Governor Ron DeSantis, announced it will commission a statue of Kirk with his table and mic on campus. The school’s social media officer told Fox News that the statue will represent “what America is all about”.\n\nUltimately it was not rhetorical prowess but an insult that made Troutt a social media folk hero in #resistance circles: after Kirk attempted a gotcha moment by saying that “foetus” means “little human being” in Latin, Troutt called his self-satisfied smile “creepy”.\n\n“Smiling is creepy?” Kirk clapped back, to which Troutt responded: “No, your smile specifically.” The quip landed her an Interview magazine feature branding her “the college student who owned Charlie Kirk”. (Foetus in Latin actually means “a bringing forth; producing; fertile”.)\n\nIn March, Kirk asked her to come to the stage for a 10-minute debate he held at USC, where they tussled over DEI again.\n\n“I was shocked by that,” Troutt said. “I literally just roasted this man, and now he wants to debate with me again. But the second time he was a lot nicer. A lot of Trump and Kirk supporters came to watch it, and it was a more hostile environment, but he was less hostile to me.”\n\nMason, who debated with Kirk on Surrounded, describes himself as a progressive and felt it important to showcase leftist values.\n\n“They’re so often caricatured, especially for those in echo chambers of the right,” Mason said. (He asked that his last name not be shared for privacy reasons.) “As someone who feels very confident in my beliefs and convictions and my ability to communicate, I think it’s beneficial for me to go on a platform like this.”\n\nMason and Kirk’s topic was gender and transgender rights. Mason got Kirk to admit that he did not know the bimodal theory of gender, to which Kirk called him “condescending”; Mason apologized for his tone, but said he was “trying to match” Kirk’s energy toward other debaters. Despite the testiness, the pair had a lively debate.\n\n“Having a conversation with him was very easy to do,” Mason said. “I’ve consumed so much of his content that I knew what he was going to say. I wouldn’t say that it was easy for a lot of the other [Surrounded debaters], because he understands the sport of rhetoric and debate, and is really good at controlling the conversation. I had to put in a strong effort to assert myself.”\n\nWebb, the Hofstra professor, called the unmoderated format of Surrounded where claims are not factchecked, “unnerving”.\n\n“You can’t negate that it’s very interesting to watch,” Webb said, “but those students are not armed with proper data and evidence, and a lot of times they’re speaking to things that sometimes are blatantly untrue.”\n\nAfter the debate, Kirk hinted that he wanted Mason to come on his radio show. That never happened, but the two kept in touch. The second time they debated – about wealth inequality at the USC event – Kirk praised his “high IQ”. But Kirk never put the debate up online. “I like to believe that’s because the conversation didn’t go the way he planned,” Mason said, “but it could have also just been because I don’t have the same online presence as someone like Naima.”\n\nThe circus around Kirk’s social media did not just advance conservative causes. His work boosted young leftists like Troutt and to a lesser extent Mason. Gaining a platform as “the girl who owned Charlie Kirk” overwhelmed Troutt at first. “It did feel like getting thrown to the wolves,” she said. But she sustained her viral moment and has over half a million followers on TikTok, where she posts about politics.\n\nThis small online community of Kirk debaters consider themselves an influential voice of reason against “alt-right” internet stars like Kirk, Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens.\n\nHungry for another go, Troutt and other Surrounded debaters were scheduled to star in a reunion episode with Kirk later this month. On the morning of the day Kirk was killed, debaters in a Surrounded group chat were theorizing what topics might come up so they could start preparing. “It was surreal that in the middle of all of that, we got a news article sent by someone, saying: ‘Oh my God, this just happened,’” Mason said.\n\nAfter Kirk died, a range of reactions poured out on social media, with many recalling Kirk’s incendiary takes or honoring his memory. Kirk allies advocated for firing those who they said spoke against him. Meanwhile, some of the debaters were criticized by followers for their eulogies of their former opponent and the sadness they expressed about his killing.\n\nDean Withers, who appeared on the Surrounded episode and was called “the Democrats’ Bro Whisperer” by the the New York Times, mourned Kirk’s death through tears in a TikTok video. Tilly Middlehurst, a student who Kirk asked about feminism and what defines a woman at an event for Cambridge Union Society, her university’s debate club, choked up as she said the act of political violence left her “shaken and disgusted”.\n\nWithers later said that he became emotional watching the violent video of Kirk’s shooting online, because a close friend had been in the audience of the event and because he knew Kirk personally. “My tears weren’t me telling you how you should feel, but rather you happening to see me in how I felt,” he said. Middlehurst made her social media profiles private. (Neither responded to a request for comment. A representative for Cambridge Union Society wrote in an email: “Any comments made by speakers who openly debated with Mr. Kirk during our event earlier this year are expressed in a personal capacity and do not reflect the views of the Cambridge Union.”)\n\nTroutt felt “hesitant” to speak about Kirk’s death, though people looked to her for comment. “I don’t want to say the wrong thing and hurt people and lead to more violence. But I do want to help people in this moment process what this means for our country,” she said.\n\nAfter speaking with the Guardian, Troutt posted her own TikTok. “All acts of gun violence are horrible and must be condemned. That is my baseline,” she said in the clip. She added: “Mind your karma, watch what you put online.”\n\nMason believes that “two things” can be true at once: “The video [of the shooting] was incredibly grotesque, this is terrible across the board, and I do grieve for his young children, but that does not make the life or the principles that the victim stood for any more palatable.”\n\nHe found it hard to square the Kirk he interacted with, if briefly – a professional, nice enough man – with the hateful views he promoted.\n\n“I think that speaks to the dissociation that politics allows, where somebody can have these abstract concepts of what a group is, or speak ill of them, but it’s much more difficult to be insulting or vitriolic toward somebody who’s right in front of you,” Mason said.\n\nIn the aftermath of his death, Kirk’s legacy remains as divisive as one of his debates. But there is no denying his influence on public discourse.\n\n“When we teach argumentation and debate in our classrooms, it’s not necessarily agenda-driven,” said Webb, the rhetoric professor.\n\n“Social media has taught us to believe that all opinions said online are valid and require response, and because of that, people are nowadays easily baited into these ‘debates’.”","summary":"Young liberals challenged Kirk’s conservative views on the viral YouTube series Surrounded - an ‘unnerving’ spectacle, according to a rhetoric expert\n\nIn the days after his killing, Charlie Kirk was remembered by his allies as a great debater. A quote taken from a widely shared video of Kirk discussing his life’s work – “when people stop talking, that’s when violence happens” – emblematized such eulogies.\n\nKirk toured American college campuses with his rightwing non-profit Turning Point USA, where he would set up a tent, table and microphone, and debate with undergrads. The goal, he said, was to “save western civilization”, and remembrances after his death positioned him as a budding statesman – a conservative hero who strode across the political divide for the sake of open dialogue.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/20/charlie-kirk-debate-style","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ca85b3c29512417bd36d12939f5117df2b3720/311_1054_2090_1671/master/2090.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 18:00:20","author":"Alaina Demopoulos","authors":["Alaina Demopoulos"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.294},{"id":362113764,"title":"Josh Shapiro says Kamala is 'going to have to answer' for why she never raised concerns over Biden's health","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro told ESPN host Stephen A. Smith that former Vice President Kamala Harris is \"going to have to answer\" for why she never raised any concerns to the public over former President Joe Biden's health in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Smith, on his \"Straight Shooter\" podcast on Thursday, asked Shapiro why Harris didn't share her concerns over Biden's health before revealing them in her new book \"107 Days.\" \"I haven't read the former vice president's book, and she's going to have to answer to how she was in the room and yet never said anything publicly,\" Shapiro told Smith. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS WHAT BIDEN TOLD HER JUST BEFORE CRUCIAL DEBATE WITH TRUMP THAT LEFT HER 'ANGRY' Shapiro said he was \"extremely vocal\" about Biden’s fitness to run again and argued that Biden’s staff failed to fully brief him on his dwindling chances of victory. \"I can tell you that I tried to speak to them candidly about it and to do so in a constructive manner. I believe in talking directly to the individuals, not running around and talking to the media,\" Shapiro said. \"I don't mean that disrespectfully, but I think in that moment, you've got to be direct, and I was.\" Smith then asked Shapiro whether he plans on running for president in 2028, and if so, what he believed needs to be done to get the country back on the right track. KAMALA HARRIS HAD PROFANE MESSAGE FOR GOVERNORS UNEASY ABOUT SUPPORTING BIDEN Fox News Digital reached out to representatives of former Vice President Harris for comment. Before addressing whether he plans to run for president, Shapiro explained how humbled and honored he is to be the governor of Pennsylvania, and that he does not take his current job for granted. \"I also love this country, and I really believe, for the many of the reasons as you and I were talking about at the beginning of this conversation, we are at an inflection point, and I am troubled by what I'm seeing in this country, and I'm concerned about what I'm seeing in my party and I know that I have a voice that needs to be heard in that process,\" he detailed. \"How that voice ultimately gets heard, how it manifests itself, what I ultimately do, well we'll see. I don't think that's a decision that one can make sitting here right now.\" Shapiro emphasized his deep love for the country and his party, adding that he wants to help steer both in a more \"common sense direction.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The book, \"2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,\" by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times, and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, described a vetting process that came down to three finalists: Walz, Shapiro, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. While most political experts felt Shapiro, governor of a key swing state, was the most logical choice, the book states that the interview with Harris and Shapiro \"revealed the two were not a perfect match.\" \"He came across as overly ambitious, pushing Harris to define what his role would be.

Harris has weighed in on Disney’s decision to pull ABC’s \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" off the air \"indefinitely,\" defending Kimmel and slamming what she calls an \"outright abuse of power\" by the Trump administration. \"What we are witnessing is an outright abuse of power. This administration is attacking critics and using fear as a weapon to silence anyone who would speak out. Media corporations — from television networks to newspapers — are capitulating to these threats,\" Harris wrote on X about Kimmel’s suspension. \"We cannot dare to be silent or complacent in the face of this frontal assault on free speech. We, the people, deserve better.\" Many X users, including Musk, the platform’s owner, were quick to point out Harris’ own past statements, some suggested they appeared to support censorship. Musk resurfaced a 2019 tweet by Harris when Trump was serving his first time. Harris, a U.S. senator representing California at the time, was running for vice president when she made the post on X, now Twitter. \"Look let's be honest, @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account should be suspended,\" Harris wrote on Sept. 30, 2019. DISNEY’S JIMMY KIMMEL BENCHING PROMPTS CELEBRATION, BUT ALSO CAUTION, FROM CONSERVATIVES Musk re-posted the message on Friday, adding a thinking face emoji. Kimmel's show was pulled after he accused conservatives of reaching \"new lows\" in trying to pin a left-wing ideology on Tyler Robinson, who is accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, even though prosecutors reaffirmed those ties in an indictment. \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said, sparking outrage. There have been several questions about the role the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) played in the suspension. Those questioning the move are on both sides of the aisle, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, warning conservatives that they \"will regret\" setting the precedent. \"What he is saying is Jimmy Kimmel was lying. That's true, he was lying, and lying to the American people is not in the public interest,\" Cruz said on an episode of his podcast. \"He threatens explicitly — we're going to cancel ABC News' license. We're going to take him off the air, so ABC cannot broadcast anymore … He threatens it.\" CRUZ WARNS CONSERVATIVES 'WILL REGRET' FCC CENSORSHIP PUSH AGAINST ABC, OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS FCC Chairman Brendan Carr joined Fox News' Sean Hannity on Sept. 17, the day the suspension was announced, and defended the move. \"Broadcasters are different than any other form of communication,\" Carr said, pointing to affiliate groups like Nexstar and Sinclair that announced they would no longer carry \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" He argued that local stations acted appropriately, saying they were \"standing up to serve the interests of their community.\" \"Over the years, the FCC walked away from enforcing that public interest obligation,\" Carr said. \"I don’t think we’re better off as a country for it.\" FCC CHAIR BRENDAN CARR DEFENDS ABC AFFILIATES PULLING JIMMY KIMMEL SHOW AFTER MONOLOGUE ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that the decision to \"fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC.\" \"That has now been reported,\" Leavitt said. \"And I can assure you it did not come from the White House and there was no pressure given from the president of the United States.\" The Biden-Harris administration has seen its share of censorship controversies, particularly in its interactions with social media companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. During a 2021 press conference, then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration was \"flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In August 2024, just ahead of the presidential election, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted in a letter that the Biden-Harris administration pressured Facebook to censor Americans. Zuckerberg made the admission in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, more than a year after providing the committee with thousands of documents as part of its investigation into content moderation on online platforms.

There were no mass riots after his death of the sort that followed Floyd’s demise.Floyd’s death was used by the Left to justify five months of rioting, arson, murder, looting, and attacking police officers.The postmortem respect for Kirk’s singular life was not characterized by $2 billion in property damage; the torching of a police precinct, a federal courthouse, and an iconic church; 35 deaths; and 1,500 injured law-enforcement officers.Instead, thousands of people peacefully joined his Turning Point USA organization and promised to redirect their lives toward peaceful political engagement.Two, after Kirk’s death, no prominent Republican or conservative is encouraging ongoing mass (and often violent) protests in the manner of high-profile leftists like former Vice President Kamala Harris.She blurted out on national television in June 2020, “But they’re not gonna stop. They’re not gonna stop, and this is a movement, I’m telling you. They’re not gonna stop, and everyone beware, because they’re not gonna stop. They’re not gonna stop before Election Day in November, and they’re not gonna stop after Election Day. Everyone should take note of that, on both levels, that they’re not going to let up—and they should not. And we should not.No conservatives—like the spouse of Gov. Tim Walz—declared of the 2020 arsons, “I could smell the burning tires, and that was a very real thing. I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.”Instead, Kirk’s supporters are calling on everyone to express their anger peacefully at the ballot box by registering to vote and showing up for the 2026 midterms.Three, Kirk was not Floyd. He was a law-abiding, religiously devout, political organizer, happily married with two children. Kirk was a media figure and head of a huge 501(c) (3) nonprofit whose brand was calmly debating students who disagreed with him.Floyd should not have died while in police custody. But Floyd’s comorbidities were many. When arrested, he was under the influence of fentanyl and methamphetamine, with a heart condition and recent COVID-19 infection.He was a career felon, with eight previous criminal convictions, who had in the past staged a violent home-invasion robbery and pointed a knife at the abdomen of one of the female occupants.In contrast, when Kirk was killed, he was not on drugs. He was not resisting police officers. And he was not trying to pass counterfeit currency. Instead, he eschewed violence and tried to engage in polite dialogue with students of different views.Four, Kirk was not, as alleged by the Left, murdered by a right-wing shooter. His death was not an example of right-on-right violence. Just the opposite was true. The shooter, Tyler Robinson, was on record with his family expressing hatred for the conservative Kirk.Robinson engraved his bullets with both Antifa-like “anti-fascist” messaging and transgender references. He lived with his transgender partner, who was a leftist. Robinson’s aim was to end Kirk’s peaceful conservative career because he hated his politics and popularity and feared his influence.Five, the Left used the death of Floyd to promote its hard-left and otherwise unpopular agenda—defunding the police, cashless bail, decriminalization of theft, and DEI mandates. It manipulated outrage, chaos, and monthslong violence to ram through radical cultural and top-down legal changes that otherwise had little popular support.Conservatives upset over Kirk’s murder will bolster Turning Point USA. They are determined through peaceful means to persuade more youth about the poverty and dangers of progressive thought.Why is the Left fabricating the circumstances surrounding and following Kirk’s murder?In its signature projective style, the Left is terrified that the right might follow its own example—by manipulating facts, ginning up street violence, and issuing non-negotiable demands to achieve its agenda.But the chief difference between the Kirk assassination and the death of Floyd is that the post-Floyd agenda had no majority support and so had to be rammed through in hysterical times by implied threats of unending violence beyond five months of continued mayhem.The post-Kirk agenda eschewed violence because it was both morally wrong and politically counterproductive—since most Americans naturally favored most of what Kirk championed.\n\n(C)2025 Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

As per the former VP’s upcoming memoir, 107 Days, it is now disclosed that things weren’t as simple as they might have looked between her and the former First Lady Jill Biden. \n\nTo be precise, fireworks weren’t the only thing sparking on July 4, 2024. That Independence Day, Harris, along with her husband, Doug Emhoff, accompanied the then-President Joe Biden and Jill Biden on the White House balcony to watch the sky light up. Usually, it should have been circled with cozy vibes, but instead, as per an information recalled by Harris, things were a bit icy. She told sources Jill turned to Emhoff and snapped. “She seemed tense, even angry. ‘What’s going on?’ she demanded. ‘Are you supporting us?’”\n\nIt seemed like Jill was a bit worried about Harris and her husband weren’t fully backing the re-election bid of Joe Biden, and despite Emhoff reassuring her, the damage was done. And as per reports, when the couple was alone, Emhoff vented, “They hide you away for four years, give you impossible, s– jobs … never fight back when you’re attacked, never praise your accomplishments. And still, they have to ask if we’re loyal?”\n\nSocial media piles on Jill\n\nAnd when netizens got to know about this, the supporters of Harris didn’t hold back either, with an X user writing, “So Jill really was a b— and a Karen to Kamala,” and this pointed at the frustration that multiple people felt over Jill Biden’s alleged treatment of the former VP.\n\nAnd Harris herself seemed to throw shade, too. On July 4, 2025, she posted a pic of herself and Emhoff watching fireworks the very night Jill went off on Doug. But in the photo, the Bidens were mysteriously cropped out. Her caption? “Things are hard right now. They are probably going to get worse before they get better.” Ouch. The snub quickly went viral. Political commentator Link Lauren called the move “symbolic.”\n\nJill snubs Kamala – on live TV\n\nThe chilly vibes didn’t end there. At Jimmy Carter’s funeral in January 2025, cameras caught Jill Biden snubbing Harris yet again. As the Bidens slid into the pew, Jill sat right next to Kamala but made zero effort to greet her. Instead, she subtly turned away — and yes, CNN’s Jake Tapper noticed. “You didn’t see a typically warm greeting between the First Couple and a Second Couple,” he remarked.\n\nHarris Memoir: “Reckless” to Let Biden Decide on 2024 Run\n• In her memoir “107 Days,” Kamala Harris calls it “recklessness” to let Biden and Jill decide alone on his 2024 run, arguing the stakes demanded broader input beyond “individual ego”\n• Harris claims Biden’s team… pic.twitter.com/HbJbztgEgl\n— Network Axis Group (@NetAxisGroup) September 11, 2025\n\n Between the balcony blow-up, the cropped photo, and that funeral frost, it’s safe to say Harris and Jill Biden’s feud has gone from whispers to full-blown Washington drama.

In the book \"107 Days,\" Harris wrote that she \"agrees\" with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females. \"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,\" Harris wrote, per Politico. \"With goodwill and common sense, I believe we can come up with ways to do this, without vilifying and demonizing children.\" Harris never directly addressed the topic during her campaign, as it became one of the more influential factors in the election. Harris wrote she wouldn't turn against transgender people, and argued President Donald Trump \"was painting a bull’s-eye on their backs and putting them in peril.\" \"This is a community with which I have a deep connection,\" she wrote. \"There was no way I was going to go against my very nature and turn on transgender people.\" Trump's campaign ad with the slogan \"Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you,\" was hailed as the most effective message of the 2024 election. It highlighted the Democrats' position of enabling biological males in women's sports. Harris admitted in her book that her campaign should have \"given even more attention to how we might mitigate Trump’s attacks,\" regarding that message. The most notable instance of Harris addressing her record on transgender issues came during her interview with Bret Baier on Fox News in October. When Baier pressed Harris on her past support of tax-payer-funded gender transition surgeries for prisoners, Harris shied away from taking a stance and called it a \"remote issue.\" Still, the topic of trans athletes in women's sports may have haunted Harris on election day, according to data. A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms,\" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\" Since the election, many key Democrats have distanced themselves from outwardly supporting trans athletes in women's sports. Meanwhile, a report by the New York Times suggests that former President Joe Biden himself did not agree with trans athletes participating in women's and girls' sports. \"According to a number of former Biden-administration officials, there remained a simmering debate inside the administration about whether those Title IX protections should extend to sports,\" the Times reported, saying that \"one side…maintained that there was no legal difference between letting trans students use bathrooms that align with their gender identity and letting trans student athletes play on sports teams that align with their gender identity.\" However, Biden was \"on the other side…who believed that the competitive, zero-sum nature of sports made them different from bathrooms — that some transgender athletes would enjoy unfair physical advantages over women. \"Most important, one of the officials holding this view was Biden himself,\" the Times wrote. The Times received a quote from a former Biden administration official who said Biden was \"particularly focused on the competition issue.\" This story first appeared on foxnews.com.","summary":"In her new book &quot;107 Days,&quot; Kamala Harris wrote that she &quot;agrees&quot; with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/culture/kamala-harris-reveals-reservations-about-transgender-athletes-womens-sports-new-book","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2207749841-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 15:18:07","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":362158460,"title":"Susan Shelley: Trump holds the media to account","text":"The marquee attraction at the Trump presidential library might be the wall of plaques thanking the donors who built it.\n\n“Paramount, parent company of CBS.” Thank you for the $16 million donation to settle a lawsuit over “60 Minutes” producers editing an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris in a deceptive manner, making her answers sound better than they really were, right before the election.\n\n“ABC News.” Thank you for the $15 million donation to settle a defamation lawsuit over George Stephanopoulos falsely saying the former president was found liable for “rape.”\n\nAnd Trump is just getting started.\n\nHe’s suing the Wall Street Journal for $10 billion for reporting that he sent a lewd drawing to Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump denies.\n\nHe’s suing 19 members of the Pulitzer Prize Board for defamation after “independent reviewers” decided in 2022 to uphold the 2018 National Reporting Pulitzer Prizes awarded to the Washington Post and The New York Times for reporting the false story that Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.\n\nAnd now he’s suing The New York Times and Penguin Random House for $15 billion over articles and a book by two reporters, published just weeks before voting began in the 2024 election. The lawsuit alleges these were written with “actual malice, calculated to inflict maximum damage” on Trump, and published “maliciously” in full knowledge that the articles and the book were “filled with repugnant distortions and fabrications” about him.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said it was a “Great Honor” to sue The New York Times for defamation and libel, calling the paper a “virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party.”\n\nMaybe the Times could sue Trump for saying that. But the discovery would kill them.\n\nThe discovery may kill the Pulitzer Prize Board, too, speaking figuratively, of course. The defendants in that lawsuit tried mightily to persuade a court to pause or toss Trump’s complaint, but that didn’t happen. Instead, Trump won some key legal victories and the case moved on to the discovery phase. Trump’s lawyers are set to depose one of the key “independent reviewers,” former Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler, on Oct. 21.\n\nTrump says he was defamed by the Pulitzer Board’s statement in 2022 saying “two independent reviews” had found that “no passage or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.”\n\nGiven that the Mueller report and other government investigations found no collusion between Trump and Russia, the then-former president said the Pulitzer Board issued this statement “with knowledge or reckless disregard for its falsity.”\n\nHe has a point. And soon he may have another plaque for the donor wall at the presidential library.\n\nOne of the Pulitzer Board members, Poynter Institute for Media Studies president Neil Brown, told the court there’s a “real specter of this litigation being used to inflict irreparable harm on the Pulitzer Prizes and on the Defendants.”\n\nWhat actually inflicts irreparable harm is the refusal to acknowledge that mistakes were made. Renowned investigative journalist Jeff Gerth wrote a lengthy critique of the prize-winning reporting in 2023 for the prestigious Columbia Journalism Review. He pointed out that it was “Clinton and her campaign” that by 2016 “would secretly sponsor and publicly promote an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that there was a secret alliance between Trump and Russia” and that “the media would eventually play a role in all that.”\n\nGerth wrote that Trump told him, during an interview at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that in the early weeks of 2017 he was initially hoping to “get along” with the press, but the Russia stories kept coming. “I realized early on I had two jobs,” Trump said, “The first was to run the country, and the second was survival. I had to survive: the stories were unbelievably fake.”\n\nTrump has been fighting the media for survival ever since. Looking at where he is now, you’d have to say he’s winning. So it’s interesting to view his combativeness against the press not as an extension of a personality trait, but as a targeted political and media strategy for the survival of his brand as well as his political career.\n\nThe first lady is similarly combative. Melania Trump sued The Daily Mail over a 2016 article that alleged her modeling agency was an escort service. The case was settled with a reportedly multi-million-dollar payment to Mrs. Trump, a retraction and an apology.\n\nMore recently, attorneys for the first lady obtained retractions from HarperCollins UK, publisher of a book about Prince Andrew, and from a former top campaign adviser to Bill Clinton, James Carville, who repeated similar defamatory statements about an “Epstein connection” on his podcast. Carville released a statement saying, “We took down the video and edited out those comments from the episode. I also take back these statements and apologize.”\n\nIf Carville can do it, anybody can. The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Pulitzer Prize Board should admit they were wrong. If they continue to push false narratives, they may find themselves spending eternity on a donor plaque at the Trump presidential library.\n\nWrite Susan@SusanShelley.com and follow her on X @Susan_Shelley","summary":"Unbelievably fake","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/20/susan-shelley-trump-holds-the-media-to-account/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_73714-2.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 14:30:52","author":"Gqlshare,Susan Shelley","authors":["Gqlshare","Susan Shelley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":362150974,"title":"Travis Barker's daughter Alabama, 19, reveals pregnancy loss in heartbreaking TikTok post… before quickly deleting it","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nReal Estate\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Sep 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJimmy Kimmel preparing sensational return to TV after being suspended indefinitely over Charlie Kirk comments\n\nFans devastated as beloved California theme park announces it is closing for the rest of the year\n\nEast Coasters ditch the Hamptons and turn charming summer escape into full time haven\n\nJimmy Kimmel was just the start.

In the book \"107 Days,\" Harris wrote that she \"agrees\" with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females. \"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,\" Harris wrote, per Politico. \"With goodwill and common sense, I believe we can come up with ways to do this, without vilifying and demonizing children.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Harris never addressed the topic directly during her campaign, as the issue went on to be one of the more influential factors in the election. Harris wrote she wouldn't turn against transgender people, and argued President Donald Trump \"was painting a bull’s-eye on their backs and putting them in peril.\" \"This is a community with which I have a deep connection,\" she wrote. \"There was no way I was going to go against my very nature and turn on transgender people.\" Trump's campaign ad with the slogan \"Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you,\" was hailed as the most effective message of the 2024 election. It highlighted the Democrats' position of enabling biological males in women's sports. Harris admitted in her book that her campaign should have \"given even more attention to how we might mitigate Trump’s attacks,\" regarding that message. INSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS The most notable instance of Harris addressing her record on transgender issues came during her interview with Bret Baier on Fox News in October. When Baier pressed Harris on her past support of tax-payer-funded gender transition surgeries for prisoners, Harris shied away from taking a stance and called it a \"remote issue.\" Still, the topic of trans athletes in women's sports may have haunted Harris on election day, according to data. A national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms,\" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\" Since the election, many key Democrats have distanced themselves from outwardly supporting trans athletes in women's sports. Meanwhile, a report by the New York Times suggests that former President Joe Biden himself did not agree with trans athletes participating in women's and girls' sports. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"According to a number of former Biden-administration officials, there remained a simmering debate inside the administration about whether those Title IX protections should extend to sports,\" the Times reported, saying that \"one side…maintained that there was no legal difference between letting trans students use bathrooms that align with their gender identity and letting trans student athletes play on sports teams that align with their gender identity.\" However, Biden was \"on the other side…who believed that the competitive, zero-sum nature of sports made them different from bathrooms — that some transgender athletes would enjoy unfair physical advantages over women. \"Most important, one of the officials holding this view was Biden himself,\" the Times wrote. The Times received a quote from a former Biden administration official who said Biden was \"particularly focused on the competition issue.\" Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledged transgender sports concerns while Democrats distance themselves from the issue after election defeat.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/kamala-harris-reveals-reservations-about-transgender-athletes-womens-sports-book","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6378459061112","publish_date":"2025-09-20 14:06:32","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":362091856,"title":"Larry Wilson: Speak out against the rising tide of tyranny","text":"Just as you can’t reasonably discuss political violence in our nation without acknowledging that it is perpetrated by insane extremists of all stripes, so you can’t pretend that the other side is full of melty snowflakes who can’t take the heat when your side takes cancel culture to new levels without any sense at all of the double-standard irony.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, unlike any other president in modern memory, in the wake of the assassination of his ally Charlie Kirk refused to acknowledge that such violence is being perpetrated by malign forces on the right as well as on the left. But Trump as usual takes such a position to extremes. Asked at a press conference why he did not order flags lowered to honor Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives who was assassinated alongside her husband this summer, as he did for Kirk, Trump initially said he was “not familiar” with the case. Uh huh.\n\nNow, more than ever, the Trump administration is on the warpath against (formerly) protected expressions of opinion. In what was already one of the most precarious moments for freedom in our society in our time, Trump is making matters radically, dangerously worse.\n\nHis vice president tells podcast listeners that if they hear opinions they don’t like from other Americans, they should contact employers in order to have people fired.\n\nWhen Trump hears TV host Jimmy Kimmel say something he doesn’t like, he doesn’t just use his bully pulpit to disagree. He says that his Attorney General Pam Bondi’s recent statement about her intent to prosecute what she sees as “hate speech” about the late Charlie Kirk could mean she will “go after” Kimmel’s employer ABC “because you treat me so unfairly. It’s hate.” Trump and his FCC chair, Brendan Carr, started talking about revoking ABC’s broadcast license, which is not really a thing that exists, except on the local-station level. No matter. It’s a threat to the network’s business by powerful people. This despite the fact, as free-speech group FIRE notes, “The FCC has no authority to control what a late night TV host can say, and the First Amendment protects Americans’ right to speculate on current events even if those speculations later turn out to be incorrect.” But, in order to protect corporate interests, ABC steps in and gets ahead of the game, cancelling Kimmel’s show on its own.\n\nIn the midst of a previous political correctness epidemic, it was the American right that created the term “cancel culture,” and insisted, quite correctly, that people can say what they will in our free society. Not anymore. It’s one more sign that this administration is not really of the right, though they play conservatives on TV. They’re something else entirely: merely authoritarian.\n\nAlthough, not if people of good will, ourselves, don’t allow it, and rebel, as good Americans always have, against the rising tide of conformity.\n\nTalking of TV hosts, I have to love what David Letterman said in response to Kimmel’s suspension: “You can’t go around firing somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian — a criminal — administration in the Oval Office. That’s just not how this works.”\n\nAgain, it is if we let it happen without speaking out.\n\nTrump, who doesn’t believe in the First Amendment, sued “60 Minutes,” sued ABC News, sued his friend Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal. And now, in his most absurd effort yet at censoring the press, he’s suing The New York Times for a cool $15 billion for, among other things, endorsing Kamala Harris in an editorial he describes as “deranged” because the endorsement wasn’t for him, and for failing to write that Trump was already “a mega-celebrity and an enormous success in business” when he was hired for “The Apprentice” TV show.\n\nStop the assassinations. Snitch on people you know who are crazy and want to kill political figures, so their guns are taken away. And, just as importantly, stand up against these despots who want to take away the most American thing of all: your freedom of speech.\n\nLarry Wilson is on the Southern California News Group editorial board. lwilson@scng.com","summary":"Merely authoritarian.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/20/larry-wilson-speak-out-against-the-rising-tide-of-tyranny/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IDB-L-CONSTITUTION-0202-01.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 14:00:38","author":"Gqlshare,Larry Wilson","authors":["Gqlshare","Larry Wilson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":362124952,"title":"Even Tucker Carlson is worried about Trump’s free speech crackdown | Arwa Mahdawi","text":"Welcome to the resistance, Tucker Carlson?\n\nForgive me; I’m sorry; mea culpa!

There isn’t an official Department of Thought Control yet, but no doubt we’ll get there soon.\n\nI wish I was joking about all this but, as you will have noticed, we are in a critical moment for free speech in the US. The killing of Charlie Kirk was a tragedy for his family, but the Trump administration has been ruthlessly using Kirk’s death to further a crackdown on dissent and erode first amendment protections.\n\nThe day after Kirk was fatally shot, for example, the deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, urged people to report any “foreigners” to the state department who post on social media “praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event.” The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, later said that the state department has “most certainly been denying visas” to people celebrating Kirk’s death. It’s obviously not in good taste to celebrate anyone’s murder, but the fact that calling out Kirk’s divisive and bigoted views could possibly be considered “rationalizing” his death and get you deported is chilling.\n\nIt’s not just foreigners who are being told they should be wary about what they say. On Monday Vice-President JD Vance, who was guest-hosting an episode of the Charlie Kirk Show, encouraged people to report anyone celebrating the influencer’s death to that person’s employer. Presumably so said employer can fire them.\n\nThere have, of course, already been numerous Kirk-related firings and suspensions. An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency was reportedly placed on administrative leave over an Instagram post describing Kirk as “the literal racist homophobe misogynist.” MSNBC fired political analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested Kirk’s “awful words” fueled “awful actions”. Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show was suspended “indefinitely” after he noted “many in Maga Land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”. Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah has also said she was fired over social media posts after Kirk’s killing.\n\nThe weaponization of Kirk’s death is so alarming that even one of Trump’s former allies is rattled. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host who was once one of the loudest voices in the Magasphere, recently issued a stark warning about the way that the Trump administration appears to be leveraging Kirk’s murder to trample civil liberties.\n\n“You hope that a year from now, the turmoil we’re seeing in the aftermath of [Kirk’s] murder won’t be leveraged to bring hate speech laws to this country,” Carlson said on Wednesday during an episode of his podcast. This was in reference to Attorney General Pam Bondi’s comments (which she has now walked back) that the Trump Department of Justice would “target” people disseminating “hate speech” following Kirk’s killing.\n\n“And trust me, if it is, if that does happen, there is never a more justified moment for civil disobedience than that, ever,” Carlson added. “Because if they can tell you what to say, they’re telling you what to think … There is nothing they can’t do to you because they don’t consider you human.”\n\nLike Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman who has recently started speaking a limited amount of sense on certain topics, Carlson is no ally to progressives. Indeed Carlson’s hate-mongering, and his former public cheerleading for Trump, are a large part of why we are in such a mess. But the fact that even a far-right voice like Carlson is worried about the authoritarian direction in which the US is heading should chill you to the bones. Carlson appears to have realized that no one is safe in the dictatorship that Trump appears intent on building. Not even him.\n\nNuns on the run in Austria\n\nSister Regina, 86, Sister Rita, 81, and Sister Bernadette, 88, are doing it for themselves. And by “it” I mean defying their diocese by running away from their nursing home and returning to their former convent. The convent has no electricity or running water so the nuns have started an Instagram account and are crowdfunding for supplies.\n\nFrench first lady will present court with ‘evidence’ she is a woman\n\nRightwing influencer, crackpot and conspiracy theorist Candace Owens has repeatedly insisted that Brigitte Macron is actually a man. Owens even said she would “stake [her] entire professional reputation” on it. Now the Macrons, who are suing Owns for defamation, are submitting “scientific evidence” to a US court to prove Brigitte was not born male. RIP Owens’s “professional reputation”.\n\nGirls and women in Colombia are being held as sex slaves\n\nThe country’s Catatumbo region, near the border with Venezuela, has seen increased violence in recent years. The Guardian reports on more than 150 girls and women aged from 11 to 50 who have escaped what they describe as “sexual slavery” by armed groups in the region. Escapees have warned there are many more women and girls in captivity.\n\nThe Trump administration compares birth control to abortion\n\nTrump officials recently ordered that millions of dollars’ worth of contraceptives intended for low-income countries be destroyed. “President Trump is committed to protecting the lives of unborn children all around the world,” a spokeswoman from USAID told the New York Times. “The administration will no longer supply abortifacient birth control under the guise of foreign aid.” By falsely claiming that pills, intrauterine devices and hormonal implants induce abortions, the Trump administration may be paving the way to ban birth control, experts warn.\n\nIsraeli minister salivates over ‘real estate bonanza’ in Gaza\n\n“A business plan is on President Trump’s table,” Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said at a property development conference in Tel Aviv this week. “The demolition, the first stage in the city’s renewal, we have already done. Now we just need to build.” Mainstream media outlets keep referring to what is happening in Gaza as a “war”. But as the likes of Smotrich make clear, this is a genocidal land grab.\n\nPete Buttigieg criticizes Kamala Harris for passing him over because he’s gay\n\nIn her new memoir, Harris said Buttigieg was her “first choice” for running mate; “he would have been an ideal partner – if I were a straight white man”. Forget Buttigieg’s sexuality, the fact that Harris thinks a former McKinsey consultant, the epitome of an out-of-touch elite, who polled at 0% with Black voters would have been a good running mate is mind-boggling.\n\nThe week in pawtriarchy\n\nA new study has found chimpanzees may consume the equivalent of about one beer a day because of all the fermented fruit they eat. Some researchers believe this supports the “drunken monkey” hypothesis: the idea that humans got a taste for booze because our primate ancestors were constantly on the jungle juice. It seems the ape-oclayptical state of the world is enough to drive anyone to drink.\n\n Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist","summary":"The former Fox News host is speaking out against the administration’s response to the Charlie Kirk shooting\n\nForgive me; I’m sorry; mea culpa!

The move, which came after Kimmel's remarks about the accused killer of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has jolted the U.S. media and entertainment industries and intensified free-speech fears as the Trump-appointed FCC chair Brendan Carr threatened to revoke broadcast licenses from stations that carry what he called \"garbage.\" Major media and tech companies are now controlled by Trump supporters or billionaire business leaders who lined up behind Trump during his inauguration, donated to his inaugural fund, or visited the White House bearing gifts. Billionaire GOP donor Larry Ellison's Oracle is part of a consortium of investors with the inside track to take control of the U.S. operations of the video-sharing platform TikTok. This week, the Trump administration announced it had agreed to a framework for a deal with China that would allow the sale of TikTok's U.S. assets to continue to operate in the U.S. Companies such as CBS, Meta Platforms, and the editorial pages of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times have made editorial or operational changes following Trump's re-election in ways that lay the groundwork for less adversarial coverage of the president. \"There is a continued lurch to the right throughout much of our major media in the United States right now,\" said Victor Pickard, professor of media policy and political economy at the Annenberg School of Communication at University of Pennsylvania. \"I expect to see more of this to come. There's no countervailing force against it.\" The decision Wednesday night is the second time since Trump's re-election that ABC parent company Walt Disney has taken action in response to on-air comments. In December, ABC News agreed to give $15 million to Trump's presidential library to settle a lawsuit Trump had filed over remarks that anchor George Stephanopoulos made involving sex abuse claims brought against Trump by writer E. Jean Carroll. \"They're all terrified,\" said Steve Kroft, who was a longtime \"60 Minutes\" correspondent, specifically citing the nightly broadcast news. \"The thing that scares me the most about this administration is this retaliatory mindset, to go after its enemies. And I think they're clearly going after the news people. That's the top of their list.\"Live Events Disney declined to comment. \"Jimmy Kimmel is free to make whatever bad jokes he wants, but a private company is under no obligation to lose money producing an unpopular show,\" said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. \"Jimmy Kimmel's terrible product isn't a free speech problem; it's a talent problem.\" CAMPAIGN AGAINST PERCEIVED BIAS Pressure on traditional media comes after conservatives successfully pushed digital platforms to pare back content moderation which they portrayed as biased. Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, which had banned Trump for \"incitement of violence\" after the January 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, pand promised to restore \"free speech\" to the platform. Renamed X, Musk eliminated its Trust and Safety team in favor of a system that allows its users to fact-check posts, and restored accounts of conservatives who previously had violated Twitter's policies. Content on the platform has become more right-leaning since the acquisition, according to research from Queensland University. Meta Platforms disbanded its third-party fact-checking program in the United States, changes that affected Facebook, Instagram and Threads. The company elected Dana White, a Trump ally and the chief executive of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to its board, and elevated prominent Republican policy executive Joel Kaplan as global affairs head. \"We've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. It's time to get back to our roots around free expression,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in January. FCC POWER OVER MEDIA MERGERS Beyond broadcast licenses, media mergers involving local broadcasters require the FCC's blessing. The son of longtime Trump supporter Larry Ellison, David Ellison, helped secure regulatory approval for his company Skydance Media to buy Paramount, with the promise that the CBS network would reflect the \"varied ideological perspectives\" of American viewers. Prior to the deal, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a 2024 lawsuit Trump filed over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he claimed gave a distorted view of his rival for the White House. The FCC has said the settlement and regulatory review were unrelated. Last week, the company announced the appointment of its new ombudsman, Kenneth R. Weinstein, a former president and CEO of the conservative Hudson Institute. Paramount is reported to be in talks to acquire The Free Press and bring founder Bari Weiss into a leadership role at CBS News. The former New York Times opinion writer built a national following by challenging what she views as the illiberal left and \"wokism.\" Now Paramount is preparing a bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery, home to CNN, while Larry Ellison's cloud giant Oracle is in play to buy TikTok, which would put a key communication tool that reaches 170 million Americans in the hands of a conservative billionaire. When asked about allegations of a right-leaning shift at CBS, a spokeswoman for parent-company Paramount directed Reuters to CEO David Ellison's previous comments about the network's political neutrality. \"We're an entertainment company first,\" Ellison has said. \"Everyone - left, right, young, old - is its audience. I'm not going to be in the position of making political statements about anything.\" 'THE EASY WAY OR THE HARD WAY' Disney was attempting to find a way to defuse the social media backlash against Kimmel's comments when the FCC's Carr turned up the heat. The regulator said Kimmel misled viewers about the alleged shooter's affiliation with Trump's Make America Great Again movement, and urged local stations to push back, raising the possibility of the FCC revoking the broadcast licenses of local television stations that did not comply. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson on Wednesday. ABC pulled Kimmel off the air after Nexstar Media Group, the largest owner of broadcast stations in the U.S., decided to preempt the show in the wake of his comments about Kirk. Sinclair, the nation's largest owner of ABC-affiliated TV stations, followed suit. Several ABC affiliates ran a Charlie Kirk special on Friday in Kimmel's regular time slot. Nexstar will need the FCC's approval to complete its announced $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna, the owner of 64 television stations and exceed the agency's regulatory cap on station ownership. \"The decision to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar,\" said Gary Weitman, the company's chief communications officer. \"And they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\" LAWFARE AGAINST THE PRESS Trump has used the courts to attack major media outlets over unflattering coverage. He has filed nine media-related civil suits since 2020, including a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times and book publisher Penguin Random House filed this week, and a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal in July. The Journal has said the lawsuit is meritless. The Times said Trump's lawsuit has no legitimate legal claims and is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. A federal judge on Friday struck the Times lawsuit over its content, saying that a complaint is not \"a public forum for vituperation and invective\" or \"a protected platform to rage against an adversary\" and gave Trump 28 days to file an amended complaint. First Amendment scholars see the moves, taken together, as a broad attempt to suppress free speech in America. \"The Trump administration is becoming increasingly brazen in its abuse of government power to silence its critics,\" said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, in a statement. Even as some conservatives have targeted Kirk critics, others have also expressed concern about the use of government power to suppress speech. \"During the Biden administration, conservatives rightly complained when the government went after their speech,\" said David Inserra, a fellow for free expression and technology at the Cato Institute. \"But now the Trump administration is using many of the same arguments to justify censorship.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onJimmy Kimmeljimmy kimmel showDonald TrumpFree SpeechBrendan Carrwashington postwarner bros discoverywalt disneywall street journalultimate fighting championship\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Biden reportedly called Harris as she sat in a hotel room preparing for the only debate of her abbreviated campaign. He apparently wanted to wish her luck — and to scold her. The then-president said, \"My brother called. He’s been talking to a group of real power brokers in Philly,\" according to an excerpt of the book in The Guardian. He then allegedly asked if Harris was familiar with several people related to the matter, which she was not.

He wasn’t inclined to believe it, he claimed, but he thought I should know in case my team had been encouraging me to put daylight between the two of us,\" Harris wrote in the book, according to an excerpt of the book in The Guardian. Biden then went on to talk about his past debate performances, leaving Harris confused, \"angry and disappointed,\" according to The Guardian. She was upset that her boss had called before a critical moment in her political career and made \"it all about himself.\" Harris added that Biden was \"distracting me with worry about hostile power-brokers in the biggest city of the most important state.\" Then-first gentleman Doug Emhoff apparently noticed his wife was in distress and advised her to \"let it go\" before facing off against Trump. HARRIS TAPS DEM EMAILS LISTS TO MARKET NEW BOOK, SPARKING PARTY NEUTRALITY CONCERNS While Harris avoided criticizing Biden during her campaign, she has used her upcoming book to shed light on the tensions between them as she took his place as the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris’ book is set to hit shelves on Sept. 23, but it has already sparked conversations about the 2024 election cycle. In another section, Harris said while \"it’s Joe and Jill’s decision\" became a mantra ahead of the 2024 election cycle, she said it was \"recklessness,\" rather than \"grace,\" according to an excerpt released by The Atlantic.

In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision,\" Harris wrote. Harris also revealed in her book that then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was her \"first choice\" as running mate, not Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. However, she said it was \"too big of a risk\" because the campaign was \"already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man.\" Fox News Digital's Deirdre Heavey and Greg Norman contributed to this report.","summary":"Kamala Harris reveals in her new book that Biden called just before her debate with Trump to wish her luck — and to give her a warning about major donors.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-reveals-what-biden-told-her-just-before-crucial-debate-trump-left-her-angry","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/harris-biden-book-excerpt.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379416343112","publish_date":"2025-09-20 11:23:57","author":"Rachel Wolf","authors":["Rachel Wolf"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":362018748,"title":"The ideology behind the Left’s embrace of political violence","text":"A comparable or even noticeable level of condemnation does not, however, come from the Left in response to the well-established recent pattern of violence against conservatives.\n\nWhen Luigi Mangione killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said, “Violence is never the answer, BUT people can only be pushed so far.” She should have stopped talking after “violence is never the answer.” There is no justification for murder, no matter what one thinks of our third-party payer healthcare system.\n\nWhen Democrats burned Teslas to protest Elon Musk’s place in the Trump administration, late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel mocked the businessman and said he deserved it for being a “Nazi.” Kimmel knew his audience, which celebrates political violence, and rejoiced at the attacks on Musk. According to a Rutgers University poll, almost 60% of those who consider themselves “left of center” said the destruction of Tesla dealerships to protest Musk’s political opinions was at least somewhat justified. The same poll found that 56% of those “left of center” respondents also felt the murder of Trump would be at least somewhat justified.\n\nThe Rutgers poll is not alone. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression polled about free speech for years and found that one-third of students said “using violence to stop a campus speech” is acceptable. That same poll found that while 93% of baby boomers and 86% of Generation X said using violence to stop speech is never acceptable, only 58% of Gen Z agreed.\n\nMost recently, YouGov found that 24% of liberals said it is acceptable to be happy about the death of a political opponent compared to only 3% of conservatives. And while 26% of young liberals agreed with the statement that political violence is sometimes justified, only 7% of young conservatives agreed.\n\nThe embrace of violence on the Left stems from the twin beliefs that emotional discomfort is the moral equivalent of physical harm and that the threat of harm it claims to feel from the Republican Party is the equivalent of fascism.\n\nIf, as transgender activists have said, “misgendering a trans person is an act of violence,” why shouldn’t conservatives, such as Kirk, who believe men are men and women are women, which is an obvious fact, be met with violence?\n\nIf, as Democrats from former President Joe Biden to former Vice President Kamala Harris to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) have said, “Trump supporters like Charlie Kirk are fascists,” and the United States met fascists with lethal violence during World War II, why shouldn’t conservatives also be met with violence, as Kirk was?\n\nToday’s Democratic Party is a deeply unhappy and isolated movement. Democrats, particularly young Democrats, are far more likely to be sad and depressed than conservatives. Democrats are far more likely than conservatives to cut off friends and family over political differences.\n\nIf Democratic Party leaders don’t tone down their rhetoric, keep silencing those who believe in biological sex rather than an ideological gender agenda, and keep insisting that support for Trump is the same as support for fascism, we will get more violence of the sort we have seen recently in New York City, Minneapolis, and at Utah Valley University.","summary":"Two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump, the murder of a health insurance executive in New York City, the burning of Tesla dealerships and vehicles nationwide, and the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk — all these events are appalling in themselves.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LAURA FOX, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR and BETHAN EDWARDS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:03:20 EDT, 20 September 2025 |Updated:03:27 EDT, 20 September 2025 \n\nFor over 20 years Strictly Come Dancing has been viewed as one of the glitziest family-friendly shows on TV, where celebrities push themselves to the limit learning a string of difficult routines.\nBut the gruelling BBC competition has faced scandal after scandal in recent years which as the new series kicks-off on Saturday night Daily Mail take a look at the shocking allegations. \nThe BBC told Daily Mail this week that they will be standing by new contestant Thomas Skinner after it emerged he cheated on his wife.\n\nIn August, it was claimed two of the show's stars are being investigated for using drugs, while another historic name has been arrested on suspicion of rape. \nThese are just the tip of the iceberg in what's been months of turmoil for the series, in the wake of Wynne Evans' controversial axe and allegations of abusive behaviour aimed at pros Giovanni Pernice and Graziano Di Prima.\nIn the past, Strictly fans also quipped about show's famous 'curse,' which saw some stars engage in romances with their professional partners during or after the show.\n\nView gallery\n\nThe curse of Strictly Come Dancing: As Thomas Skinner admits to cheating on his wife, a drugs probe is launched and an ex-star is arrested for rape, how scandals continue to plague the 'family-friendly' BBC show (pictured: hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly)\n\nView gallery\n\nThe BBC competition has faced scandal after scandal in recent years which as the new series kicks-off on Saturday night, Daily Mail take a look at the shocking allegations after Thomas Skinner admitted to cheating on his wife last week\n\nAnd while it's a term that bosses would rather forget, it seems that the show could truly be under a dark cloud, as its list of controversies continues to grow. \nThe cloud seems to have taken a toll on the new series, with fans berating this year's lineup, featuring significantly less women than men, as its worst yet. \nAnd these don't even touch on past scandals that hit the show, including voting gaffes, ageism rows, and controversial exits.\nFor BBC bosses it may be full steam ahead for Strictly's return on September 20, but for viewers, it will be hard to forget these dramas that have dominated the headlines...\nThomas Skinner \nThomas Skinner has been at the centre of this year's Strictly Come Dancing series even before the hit show kicked off. \nThe former Apprentice star admitted last week that his 'fling' with aesthetician Amy-Lucy O’Rourke was a 'moment of madness' which saw him almost 'ruin his life'.\nThomas cheated on his wife Sinead just weeks after their wedding in May 2022, which Amy-Lucy, 35, claimed lasted three months long in an interview with Daily Mail.\nThe couple, who share a son Henry, five, and two-year-old twin daughters, Roma and Darla, married in May 2022.\n\nView gallery\n\nThe BBC told Daily Mail this week that they will be standing by new contestant Thomas Skinner following his cheating scandal\n\nView gallery\n\nThomas cheated on his wife Sinead (pictured) just weeks after their wedding in May 2022, which Amy-Lucy O’Rourke, 35, claimed lasted three months long in an interview with Daily Mai\nHe told The Sun: 'I had a fling. It was nothing more than that. It was the one time, it was a mistake. I woke up feeling absolutely terrible about it.\n'I felt so guilty. I told my wife. I let her down in that brief moment of madness where I wasn’t thinking, where I didn’t appreciate what I had.'\n'When I told my wife, I fully understood if she was to never speak to me again. No one else made me do what I’ve done. But it just shows something so brief could ruin your life.'\nThomas, who has become known for his social media videos and 'Bosh' catchphrase, met Sinead in a bar in London back in 2018.\nRape allegations \nIn August, it was reported that a male star who previously competed on Strictly was arrested on suspicion of rape. \nThe male suspect is reportedly being 'quizzed by police over allegations involving non-consensual intimate image abuse'.\nAccording to The Mirror, bosses are confident the dance show, including training sessions, can carry on. They also reported that a police investigation is continuing.\nThe Met Police said the alleged rape victim is being supported by specialist officers.\n\nView gallery\n\nIn August, it was reported that a male star who previously competed on Strictly was arrested on suspicion of rape (hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman pictured) \nA Met spokesman told Daily Mail: 'On Friday, August 22, officers arrested a man on suspicion of rape and non-consensual intimate image abuse.\n'This is a joint investigation with Hertfordshire Constabulary and while the investigation is in its early stages, we urge anyone with any information to come forward to us.\n'The arrest follows a third party allegation of sexual and drug-related offences. Enquiries are ongoing.'\nThe Met Police also added the alleged rape victim is being supported by specialist officers.\nCocaine use probe \nLawyers launched an external probe into the family-friendly show earlier this month amid claims two of its stars had used cocaine. \nIt was reported by The Sun On Sunday that detectives from the Met Police were allegedly examining other allegations.\nSources said: 'It's a significant new development in the BBC's recent string of crises that they have now got the police involved in investigating allegations surrounding Strictly. This is a very dramatic turn of events.\n'Despite all the show and its team have been through over recent months, it's hugely controversial that you've now got Scotland Yard detectives probing Strictly.\n'This is their biggest prime-time family entertainment show, so it's not a good look for the BBC.'\nA BBC spokesperson said: 'We have clear protocols and policies in place for dealing with any serious complaint raised with us. \n'We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.' \n\nView gallery\n\nLawyers launched an external probe into the family-friendly show earlier this month amid claims two of its stars had used cocaine (the Strictly pros are pictured in 2024)\n\nEXCLUSIVE Accusations of rape, cocaine and an embittered star. Dark clouds hanging over new Strictly series \nOne of the stars involved in the drugs probe was also suspected of drinking while working on the show after crew smelled alcohol on their breath.\nThe Sun alleged that it was widely known that the pair, who have not been named, took the Class A substance, and that one of these Strictly performers was known for being a drinker.\nThe publication reported that junior members of the team were asked to keep an eye on them during last year's show and to look for signs that they may have been boozing during work hours.\nA BBC spokesperson said: 'We do not recognise these claims and any suggestion that anyone has been asked to monitor an individual is completely untrue.'\nLast week, a staffer also claimed they were offered cocaine by one of the show's stars.\nHe went on to claim that drug use was so common on the show, that when he found a suspicious bag of white powder, an unfazed senior producer told him to 'leave it on my desk' as the incident failed to raise even an eyebrow. \nIt was also reported that the two stars who took cocaine on the show have been offered professional support.\nLack of interest from women\nThis year's Strictly lineup has already earned a mixed reaction from fans, with this year's cast including several former reality stars such as Love Island winner Dani Dyer and ex-Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison .\nYet it appears that female celebrities are too terrified to sign up, with six women appearing on the cast this year compared to nine males, and bosses have certainly lowered the previously high bar with who they allow to take part. \nStrictly bosses previously banned influencers and reality stars from taking part, with now the likes of former Apprentice contestant Tom, who was fired by Lord Sugar in 2019, deemed famous enough to compete, with one Daily Mail reader saying: 'More than half are not celebrities.'\nThe disappointing line-up hasn't gone unnoticed as thousands of Strictly fans took to platform X to voice their criticisms.\nA TV source added: 'Strictly isn't the show it used to be. It has been hit by scandal after scandal and now it's impossible for it to recover.\n\nThis year's Strictly lineup has already earned a mixed reaction from fans, with this year's cast including Love Island winner Dani Dyer (right) and ex-Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison (left)\n\nView gallery\n\nStrictly previously banned reality stars from taking part with now ex-Apprentice contestant Tom Skinner, who was fired by Lord Sugar in 2019, deemed famous enough to compete\n'Bosses used to be very particular about the lineup but now celebrities who have previously been on a host of shows, even winning I'm A Celeb in Vicky's case, have been recruited.\n'The lack of women in the cast this year says it all, females are afraid to take part due to the controversies of recent years while few changes have been made to ensure safety in the training rooms.\n'It's sad because the show was once so loved by viewers of all ages but there's an unavoidable darkness now and insiders even believe this could be the last ever series.'\nThis year's cast also includes EastEnders actress Balvinder Sopal, Game of Thrones star Kristian Nairn, Lioness Karen Carney, Lorraine Showbiz correspondent Ross King and influencer Ellie Goldstein, who made history when she became the first model with Down syndrome to cover British Vogue magazine. \nRugby player Chris Robshaw, Neighbours actor Stefan Dennis, YouTuber George Clarke, Doctor Who actress Alex Kingston, and sportsman Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink will also be taking to the Strictly ballroom next month. \nWynne Evans' axe\nWynne, who used to front the Go Compare ads, appeared on Strictly Come Dancing last year when he was partnered with Katya Jones.\nHowever, his time on the show was mired in controversy. \nWynne was filmed using the vile term 'spit roast' – a three-way sex act – to his co-star Jamie Borthwick in relation to professional dancer Janette Manrara during the launch of the Strictly Live Tour.\nAn apology was released on the singer's behalf and he was subsequently suspended from Strictly Come Dancing's live tour.\nEvans has claimed he did not see the statement before it was put out. It read: 'My language was inappropriate and unacceptable for which I sincerely apologise.'\n\nView gallery\n\nWynne Evans, who competed on the show in 2024, was accused of inappropriate behaviour and forced to apologise for making an unacceptable sexual remark on stage \nHe explained his initial reaction to finding out he had offended someone was 'Oh God, I'm so sorry' but this was taken as a formal apology by the press team. Evans said the apology 'validated the story' and 'made it look worse'.\nEvans said he was placed on 24/7 suicide watch by a crisis team after the saga which has completely derailed his career.\nWynne denied it was a sexual jibe about a female presenter and insisted he used the term 'spit roast' as a nickname for fellow contestant Jamie Borthwick.\nDuring his time on the main show, Wynne found himself caught up in a 'wandering hand' incident with his Strictly professional dance partner, Katya Jones.\nWynne appeared to slide his hand across Katya's waist, before she pushed him off. Later in the show, he offered his partner a high five, which she ignored before turning back to the camera, stonY-faced.\nThe opera singer confirmed in May the BBC will not be renewing his one-year rolling contract, meaning he wouldn't be returning to his radio show, following a four-month investigation in the wake of inappropriate comments made during his time on Strictly.\nGraziano Di Prima's sacking\nGraziano was fired by BBC bosses in July last year, after it was claimed he'd been 'physically and verbally abusive' towards his celebrity dance partner Zara.\nAddressing his exit from the show, a 'devastated' Graziano wrote on Instagram over the weekend: 'I deeply regret the events that led to my departure from Strictly. My intense passion and determination to win might have affected my training regime. \n'While respecting the BBC HR process, I acknowledge it's only right for the sake of the show that I step away. I am saddened that I wasn't allowed to offer a quote to the online news stories, and I take on board the sensitivity of the situation. \n'There's more to this story that I am unable to discuss at this time, but I am committed to being strong for my family and friends. I wish the Strictly family nothing but success in the future.'\nDaily Mail revealed that Strictly production staff raised concerns about Graziano's conduct last year, but bosses only went as far as to issue quiet warnings to him.\nThe group expected him to be sacked instantly. They are said to be furious that their complaints were ignored, meaning the abuse towards Zara was allowed to continue. Graziano was even signed on for Strictly's 2024 series.\nA source from the show said: 'There were multiple occasions where both physical and verbal attacks were made. It was more physical than verbal, but all of it was dreadful.'\n\nView gallery\n\nGraziano Di Prima was fired by BBC bosses last year, after it was claimed he'd been 'physically and verbally abusive' towards his celebrity dance partner Zara\n\n2023: Strictly's Graziano reveals rehearsal strictness to Zara\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:40\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nIt was not until staff got hold of a video allegedly showing Graziano repeatedly hitting Zara – nine months after their initial complaint – that he was fired. \nPreviously, his fans and famous friends had rallied behind him, including fellow Strictly stars Katya Jones, Susannah Constantine and Catherine Tyldesley, who liked and commented on his Instagram post announcing his departure. \nHowever, Catherine - who was partnered with Johannes Radebe in the show in 2019 - has now removed one of her more supportive comments.\nZara broke her silence on Graziano's sacking in a lengthy statement, writing on Instagram that while much of her time on Strictly 'was everything I could have dreamt of' inside the training room with Graziano, there were 'particular incidents which are incredibly distressing'.\nShe explained that she didn't report the incidents at the time as she was 'scared' of backlash. \nInstead it was junior production staff who came forward to share what they had witnessed as the investigation into pro dancer Giovanni Pernice was taking place.\nGraziano later admitted he 'crossed the line', but denied spitting at Zara, and insisted his behaviour was one-off incident.\nIn response Zara's spokesperson said: 'It's a matter of public record that the BBC deemed the conduct to be so severe that they removed him from the show immediately.\n'Zara has already confirmed in a statement released on her social media earlier this week that the reported conduct was not a singular incident.'\nGraziano has continued to insist he would never deliberately hurt anyone. 'These vile, false allegations ruined my life in a matter of minutes — professionally, financially, psychologically and reputationally,' he said. \nFollowing his sacking it was reported that Graziano has now 'called in top lawyers to sue the BBC ' in a bid to clear his name.\nBarristers from Whitestone Chambers have 'already read thousands of text and WhatsApp messages' and believe the Italian 'could sue for unfair dismissal'.\nA source said: 'Graziano feels he wasn't allowed a fair opportunity to give his side of the story so has been heartened to hear the legal team think he has a case for unfair dismissal.'\nThey added: 'They've also looked at his BBC contract and believe there are grounds to sue. He is weighing up his options but remains hopeful he can clear his name.' \nGiovanni's 'bullying' row \nIn May, it was revealed that longtime Strictly professional Giovanni Pernice had quit the BBC series, after he was accused of 'bullying' his celebrity partner Amanda Abbington.\nGiovanni faced a wave of scrutiny after his dance partner Amanda, who he was partnered with during the last series, dramatically quit the competition last year due to 'personal reasons'. \nThe actress is said to have demanded footage of their rehearsals after struggling with Giovanni's 'militant approach to training'. She was later diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nAmanda is then said to have met with Laura Whitmore and Ranvir Singh for an 'emotional summit', with the trio apparently speaking about their 'difficult' experiences with him.\n\nView gallery\n\nIn May 2024, it was revealed that longtime Strictly pro Giovanni Pernice had quit the series, after he was accused of 'bullying' his celebrity partner Amanda Abbington \n\nView gallery\n\nThe actress is said to have demanded footage of their rehearsals after struggling with Giovanni's 'militant approach to training'\nGiovanni rejected the claims immediately, and a BBC investigation ruled in September that her claims of physical aggression and threatening behaviour were not upheld.\nWhen BBC bosses published their report into Giovanni's behaviour, it cleared him of the most serious allegations of physical aggression, but upheld verbal bullying and harassment.\nComplaints of verbal bullying and harassment meant the BBC issued an apology to Amanda, but Giovanni said he was 'pleased the report has not found any evidence of threatening or abusive behaviour'.\nThe famous Strictly 'curse' \nSince its very first series, Strictly Come Dancing has famously been dogged by its 'romance' curse, which has spanned 20 scandalous years. \nThe curse - which has claimed several marriages - is at odds with the show's family-friendly image, with bosses attempting to play down its significance, despite leaving viewers gripped thanks to some couples' sizzling chemistry. \nStrictly hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons during season one, when viewers were transfixed by the apparent close bond between newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky and her hunky partner Brendan Cole.\nAlthough the pair went on to win the show, their success was blighted by affair rumours.\nBBC presenter Natasha soon split from long-term partner Mike Barnard while Brendan dumped his fiancée and fellow dancer Camilla Dallerup.\nHowever, Natasha has always denied any wrongdoing, saying: 'There was chemistry, of course, and I certainly fell in love with dancing, but I did not fall in love with Brendan.' \n\nView gallery\n\nSince its very first series, Strictly has famously been dogged by its 'romance' curse, with stars including Kristina Rihanoff and Ben Cohen going onto date after the show (pictured in 2013)\nIn 2013, professional dancer Kristina Rihanoff was forced to defend her romance with her rugby player partner Ben Cohen, insisting their romance only began after the end of his marriage to wife Abby. \n'He left his wife a year ago,' she told the Daily Mirror. 'Recently we started dating but we're allowed to see each other as two single people.'\nShe said: 'Ben's said it many times and I'll say it again - I wasn't involved in the breaking up of his marriage.'\nMeanwhile Abby described the split and resultant divorce as 'the most traumatic thing to ever happen to me'.\nBen met Abby in 1995 at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before welcoming their daughters in 2008. \nBen and Kristina, who share daughter Milena, nine, split in March after 12 years together. \nOn the same series, Countdown's Rachel Riley's relationship with Pasha Kovalev ended her marriage to husband Jamie Gilbert, to whom she had been married for just one year. \nIn 2015, Georgia May Foote announced her split from Coronation Street co-star Sean Ward after she came runner-up in the show, and she was later spotted kissing her dance partner Giovanni Pernice. \nAnd 2018 saw romances emerge between Kevin Clifton and Stacey Dooley, as well as Dianne Buswell and Joe Sugg. \n\nView gallery\n\nRachel Riley began dating her dance partner Pasha Kovalev in 2013 after splitting from her husband, and since then they've gone onto marry in 2019 and they now have two daughters\n\nView gallery\n\nFour months after the 2018 series, concluded Stacey Dooley and her partner Sam Tucknott announced they were separating and she later dated Strictly partner Kevin Clifton \nFour months after the 2018 series concluded, filmmaker and journalist Stacey and her partner Sam Tucknott announced they were separating.\nThe couple had been together for five years before the split - but the separation was far from a clean break.\nIn 2019, Sam accused Stacey of having an affair with Kevin Clifton while she was still in a relationship - however they have both denied this.\nHe told The Sun he discovered Stacey and Kevin's romance when he was leaving their shared home after the break-up and he saw a message from the professional dancer flash up on her phone, which he claims said: 'I love you.'\nAccording to Sam's version of events, they argued before Sam left the flat they shared in Brighton, before Stacey sent him a message later that evening explaining she had fallen for her dance partner.\nThe newspaper reports she wrote: 'I didn't start entertaining and texting him (Kevin) until I split up with you. I was not with you when we started it all. I did fall for him but when we were done. I will tell you anything you want to know.'\nOne of Strictly's most controversial 'curses' was the end of Seann Walsh's relationship with Rebecca Humphries after he was snapped kissing his then-dance partner Katya Jones - on Rebecca's birthday.\nAt the time, Katya was also married to fellow professional dancer from the series, Neil Jones.\nFollowing the revelation, Rebecca released a scathing statement on her X/Twitter account in which she accused Seann of 'aggressive' behaviour, and claimed he called her a 'psycho' when she expressed suspicion about cheating.\nFormer Eternal singer Louise Redknapp, who was married to Jamie Redknapp when she starred in the show in 2016, has revealed she believes the show contributed to the breakdown of her marriage.\nWriting in her memoir You've Got This, she said: 'If I'd done the show four years earlier, this wouldn't have happened. I wouldn't have walked away from my marriage.'\nShe said that, previously, she would have been 'too scared' to leave her husband, with whom she shares two children, but that taking part in Strictly, which saw her reach the final, set her on a 'new path' and proved she could 'find work again'. \nAgeism row \nStrictly found itself embroiled in an ageism row in 2009, when it was revealed that Arlene Phillips, who was 66 at the time, had been dropped from the judging panel in favour of singer Alesha Dixon.\nArlene later said that she only found out she'd been sacked from Strictly Come Dancing when a journalist called her for comment on a radio show. \nThe dancer and choreographer was axed from Strictly in 2008 after four years as a judge.\n\nView gallery\n\nStrictly found itself embroiled in an ageism row in 2009, when it was revealed that Arlene Phillips, who was 66 at the time, had been dropped from the judging panel\n\nView gallery\n\nWhen Phillips was replaced by Alesha Dixon, who was 26 years younger, the show was accused of ageism \nShe was the only judge on the panel - which at the time also comprised of Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Len Goodman - not to have her contract renewed. \nWhen Phillips was replaced by Alesha Dixon, who was 26 years younger, the show was accused of ageism. \nThe axing caused uproar among fans and calls of sexism while Harriet Harman, the minister for women and equality, blamed ageism when the debate reached the House of Commons.\nAnton's 'racism' claims \nIn 2009 professional dancer - and now judge - Anton Du Buke used a racial slur to describe his partner Laila Rouass, which he said was 'backstage banter'. \nFormer host Sir Bruce Forsyth came to his defence, but this only made the situation worse. \nSir Bruce said: 'We used to have a sense of humour about this. You go back 25, 30, 40 years and there has always been a bit of humour about the whole thing.'\nBut he was later forced to issue a statement saying: 'To be absolutely clear, the use of racially offensive language is never either funny or acceptable.' \nAt the time, a BBC source described Anton as a 'dead man dancing' and calls rose for him to be sacked from the show. \n\nView gallery\n\nIn 2009 professional dancer - and now judge - Anton Du Buke used a racial slur to describe his partner Laila Rouass, which he said was 'backstage banter'\n\nView gallery\n\nAnton Du Beke makes an on-air apology to Laila Rouass for the slur in 2009 as the pair hoped to 'move on' from it\nBut Rouass defended him after he apologised and when asked if she wanted him axed from the series, the Footballers Wives star said: 'Absolutely not. Anton has apologised and I've accepted it. \n'This happened a couple of weeks ago now and we are having a good time.\nShe added: 'We just want to move on from it.'\nMeanwhile Anton quickly released an apologetic statement, reading: 'I must say immediately and categorically that I am not a racist and that I do not use racist language.\n'There was no racist intent whatsoever but I accept that it is a term which causes offence and I regret my use of it, which was done without thought or consideration of how others would react.'\nStrictly veteran Anton since recovered from the incident and in 2021 even joined the judging panel. \nJohn Sergeant's controversial exit \nIn 2008, former political journalist John Sergeant won over millions of viewers when he competed on Strictly with Kristina.\nHe delivered a now-iconic Paso Doble which saw him drag dance partner Kristina across the floor, and judge Arlene Phillips quipped that he would 'sit and read The Guardian' instead of rehearsing.\nDespite clearly struggling with the steps, and receiving a low score from the judges week after week, viewers voted to keep him in the competition, sparking fears that he could go all the way and be crowned series champion.\n\nView gallery\n\nIn 2008, former political journalist John Sergeant won over millions of viewers when he competed on Strictly, despite his wooden dance moves earning him consistently low scores\n\nView gallery\n\nFans were stunned when John publicly announced that he would quitting the competition in week 10, following fears that he would go all the way to the final\nFans were stunned when John publicly announced that he would quitting the competition in week 10, meaning the BBC had to offer refunds to viewers who voted for him.\nHe said at the time: 'The trouble is that there is now a real danger that I might win the competition. Even for me that would be a joke too far.'\nJames Jordan's 'sacking' \nOutspoken dance pro James Jordan was sacked from the main line-up of the show in 2014, despite offering to continue on the show as a backing dancer, while his wife Ola Jordan remained a part of the main lineup.\nJames later appeared on Celebrity Big Brother, where he accused the rest of the professionals of being 'beige' and 'not massive characters'. \nAt the time, a Strictly spokesperson said: 'James Jordan was offered a role still on [Strictly Come Dancing].\n\nView gallery\n\nOutspoken dance professional James Jordan was sacked from the main line-up of the show in 2014, while his wife Ola Jordan remained (pictured together)\n'It wasn't to be partnered with a celebrity, but it was to be involved in specials such as Children in Need, that sort of thing.\n'But he declined that. He was offered a reduced role on the show.'\nJames responded on Twitter: 'Yes, it's true I WILL NOT be retuning to 'BURN THE FLOOR'.... Sorry, I mean 'Strictly Come Dancing'. \nHe added: '....do not believe everything the BBC have written in their statement.'\nSeann and Katya's drunken kiss \nIn 2018, comedian Seann Walsh and his dance partner Katya Jones sparked a social media firestorm, when they were pictured sharing a steamy kiss on a night out.\nIt occurred just three weeks into the series, and proved to be the most seismic hit of the famous 'curse' yet. \nAt the time, Katya was also married to fellow professional dancer from the series, Neil Jones.\nFollowing the revelation, Rebecca released a scathing statement on her X/Twitter account in which she accused Seann of 'aggressive' behaviour, and claimed he called her a 'psycho' when she expressed suspicion about cheating.\nShe said: 'It's more than lying, it's controlling.'\nAt the end of her statement, she revealed she had taken their cat in the split.\n\nView gallery\n\nIn 2018, comedian Seann Walsh and his dance partner Katya Jones sparked a social media firestorm, when they were pictured sharing a steamy kiss on a night out\n\nSeann Walsh talks about the moment 'career died' amid scandalous kiss\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:33\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nFollowing the scandal, Seann appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show where he cut a sombre figure and admitted: 'I think everything she said in that statement is right.' \nHe continued: 'And I think if you lie and cheat on the person that you're meant to care for and be in a relationship with, then that is a form of abuse, of course it is. All I can be is as sorry as I am. I hope one day that she'll forgive me.' \nSeann went onto reveal he felt traumatised even when he sees a 'Strictly no parking sign' and that he'll never dance again due to the intense fallout from the kiss.\nVoting gaffes \nTypically Strictly Come Dancing's voting system is a well-run machine, allowing viewers to call in and back their favourite couples, or vote for free online.\nHowever, in 2008 the system was hit by a huge gaffe in the semi-finals, as viewers noted that it would be literally impossible to save Holby City star Tom Chambers from the dance-off.\n\nView gallery\n\nIn 2008, Strictly's voting system was hit by a huge gaffe in the semi-finals, as viewers noted that it would be literally impossible to save Holby City star Tom Chambers from the dance-off\nRachel Stevens and Lisa Snowdon had received exactly the same score from the judging panel - and both scores were so high that Tom would be in the dance-off even if every single viewer watching voted for him.\nHours after the issue emerged, the BBC announced that all three contestants would be going through to the final, with all the votes carried over into the following week. \nThe drama sparked nearly 300 complaints to media watchdog, however they opted against sanctioning the BBC, as it had 'resulted from an oversight'. \nCraig's awkward apology \nStacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton now share daughter Minnie together, but they first came together after winning the 2018 series of Strictly Come Dancing. \nAhead of the following series in 2019, Craig - who has often been known as the 'nasty' judge over the series - joked to host Tess Daly while giving advice to the new contestants: 'Of course, if you sleep with your dance partner that helps.'\n\nView gallery\n\nCraig was forced to apologise in 2019 after he said 'sleeping with your partner' can help secure a Strictly victory, in reference to Stacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton's romance\nWhile the comment wasn't broadcast during the launch show, with bosses demanding Craig re-film the moment, the judge was slammed over the comments and he was forced to issue an apology. \n'I'm deeply sorry for the offence caused to Kevin and Stacey and everyone who works on the show,' he said.\n'I recognise that what I said was hurtful, cruel and incredibly disrespectful. It was a huge error of judgment that I very much regret.'\nShirley's 'sexism' row \nHead judge Shirley Ballas found herself at the centre of a sexism row after she was accused of favouring the male contestants over the females during the 2022 series. \nThe series judge was also been accused of having 'favourites whether they have ability or not', with some viewers calling for her to be sacked on Twitter as they claimed she has 'no credibility as a judge'.\n\nView gallery\n\nHead judge Shirley Ballas found herself at the centre of a sexism row after she was accused of favouring the male contestants over the females during the 2022 series\nIt came after the twinkle-toed star called for the television audience at home to have 'respect' after she received a flurry of 'hurtful messages' on social media.\nIn August 2022, Shirley revealed how she was forced to seek counselling after receiving a torrent of vile abuse during the last series of Strictly Come Dancing.\nThough Shirley eventually returned to the 2023 series, she previously told how she even toyed with the idea of not coming back.\n\nSTRICTLY LINEUP 2025\n\nHarry Aikines-Aryeetey\n\nProfession: Olympic Sprinter and Gladiator\nHarry says: 'I'll be bringing tons of energy to light up the dance floor.

The 47th President of the United States also confirmed that the administration is planning to put troops back due to its proximity to China's nuclear weapons production sites.Martina Navratilova, the tennis legend turned social activist, has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump for a very long time. Over the years, the 18-time Grand Slam champion has often shown her disapproval of Trump's policies, decisions, and statements. She also openly supported Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in the 2025 presidential elections.Recently, Donald Trump attended a press conference at Chequers, the official country residence of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, where he expressed a desire to negotiate a takeover of Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, which U.S. troops abandoned during their withdrawal in 2020 under the rule of then-President Joe Biden.In his speech, Trump also said that it was the most 'embarrassing' day when the US handed Bagram, the focal point for logistics for U.S. troops, to the Taliban.\"We'll see what happens. But we're talking to Afghanistan. It should never have been given up. It's the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. I was leaving Afghanistan. I was leaving. I was the one who got it down to 5,000. But we were going to keep Bagram.\"Reacting to it, Navratilova pointed out that Trump was the one who made a pact with the Taliban and was responsible for releasing the Afghan political and militant movement back into the world.\"Not to mention the fact that trump is the one who made the deal with the Taliban!!!!!! And released a whole bunch of Taliban a**holes back into the world.\"Martina Navratilova once sported an 'Impeach' hat during a Wimbledon Legends’ Doubles match, taking a dig at Trump when he served as the US President.Martina Navratilova called Donald Trump a 'racist' for ordering the removal of slavery exhibitsNavratilova at the French Open Tennis Tournament.

'What's going on?' Jill allegedly asked. 'Are you supporting us?'\n\nIn shock at the insinuation that he and Harris had been anything but loyal to the Bidens, he immediately said, 'Of course we are supporting you,' the memoir reads.\n\n'Okay. That's really important. We need to know that,' Jill snapped back.\n\nWhen they returned from the awkward exchange, Harris noted that her husband seemed upset. He later told his wife he was frustrated that Jill doubted them. \n\nAt the time, skepticism from the left had begun to arise about Biden's mental capabilities, following his disastrous June 27 debate against Donald Trump. \n\nHarris noted that she never doubted Biden's qualifications, but in his old age, 'Joe got tired,' she wrote. \n\nShe said that during the entirety of her time serving alongside Biden, she had never 'witnessed anything remotely like the level of confusion, incoherence, and debility we saw on the debate stage.' \n\nBut Harris said she never tried to interfere or put a stop to Biden's 'reckless' re-election campaign. \n\nHarris revealed that going into the 2024 campaign, she automatically followed the 'mantra' set by the White House, that Biden would decide with his family if he wanted to run again.\n\n'Was it grace, or was it recklessness?' Harris asked. 'In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high.'\n\nJill allegedly issued Emhoff a warning after Biden officially dropped out of the race and Harris was instantly pushed to the forefront as the Democratic candidate. \n\nHarris explained that when she launched into her rushed campaign - at day 106 - Jill returned a call from Emhoff, whom he tried to reach to the day before. \n\n'Be careful what you wish for. You're about to see how horrible the world is,' she bluntly cautioned him, Harris wrote. \n\nHarris attributed Jill's hostility toward her to a years-old grudge from when Harris ran against Biden in the 2020 presidential election. \n\n'I had always admired Jill for her fierce loyalty to her family and also her dedication to teaching,' the former vice president said. \n\n'But I suspect Jill hadn't quite forgiven me for the 2019 primary debate, when I'd gone hard at Joe over his early opposition to busing. \n\n'Although I had regular lunches with Joe, there wasn't a lot of family socializing.'\n\nHarris was referring to a July 2019 debate, during which an unflattering 1981 interview of Biden opposing efforts to desegregate schools came up.\n\nA California senator at the time, Harris grilled Biden for his position, which he tried clarifying by saying he 'did not oppose to busing in America,' only to busing ordered by the Department of Education. \n\nThis strained relationship between the Bidens and Harris seemingly appeared on August 3 when Harris said she was arranging for interviews to select who would run as her vice president.\n\nShe called upon Bill and Hillary Clinton for advice - and she never mentioned consulting with the Bidens. \n\nIn the book's acknowledgement section, Harris once again hinted at tension between her and Jill - thanking Biden for his support, but leaving out his wife's name.","summary":"The former vice president, 60, made the bombshell assertion in her political memoir, 107 Days, which will hit the shelves on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15116775/Jill-Biden-Kamala-Harris-husband-loyalty-memoir.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/20/06/102302149-0-image-m-17_1758347308598.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 06:09:31","author":"Editor,Sonya Gugliara","authors":["Editor","Sonya Gugliara"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":362033966,"title":"Kamala Harris' kiss and tell book will only hurt her and the party, Democrat says","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nHannity September 20, 2025 09:06 \n\n Kamala Harris' kiss and tell book will only hurt her and the party, Democrat says \n 'Hannity' panel discusses excerpts from former Vice President Kamala Harris' forthcoming book and how it may further divides a troubled Democratic Party.\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRHANNITYV-VIDEOPOLITICSDEMOCRAT ELECTIONSKAMALA HARRIS","summary":"&apos;Hannity&apos; panel discusses excerpts from former Vice President Kamala Harris&apos; forthcoming book and how it may further divides a troubled Democratic Party.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379834003112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/12b36a35-a74c-40f8-91c5-7ec74d286f9d/5367a79b-ca33-458f-8589-dfe700ae790b/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 06:07:51","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":362034124,"title":"Judge throws out Trump’s $15 billion lawsuit against New York Times, citing improper content","text":"NEW YORK, (Reuters) – A federal judge yesterday threw out U.S. President Donald Trump’s $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times NYT.N over its content, calling it a “decidedly improper and impermissible” effort to attack his adversaries.\n\nU.S. District Judge Steven Merryday said Trump’s complaint against the Times, four reporters and the publisher Penguin Random House was too long and burdensome, and violated a federal civil procedure rule by omitting a short and plain statement of why Trump should win.\n\nHe faulted the Republican president for instead packing the 85-page complaint with unnecessary attacks against critics, statements lauding his successes and “singular brilliance,” and even a defense of his late father Fred Trump.\n\n“A complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective — not a protected platform to rage against an adversary,” the Tampa, Florida-based judge wrote. “A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally.”\n\nMerryday, an appointee of Republican former President George H.W. Bush, gave Trump 28 days to file an amended complaint “in a professional and dignified manner” of no more than 40 pages.\n\nA spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement: “President Trump will continue to hold the Fake News accountable through this powerhouse lawsuit against the New York Times, its reporters, and Penguin Random House, in accordance with the judge’s direction on logistics.”\n\nA Times spokesperson said: “We welcome the judge’s quick ruling, which recognized that the complaint was a political document rather than a serious legal filing.”\n\nPenguin Random House said it applauded the dismissal, citing the judge’s description of the complaint as improper and impermissible.\n\nTrump has turned to the courts as part of his campaign to rein in reporting and commentary he considers unfair to him.\n\nHe sued over three articles and a book by two of the Times reporters. He accused the defendants of defaming him prior to the 2024 presidential election in order to sabotage his campaign and disparage his reputation as a successful businessman.\n\nFriday’s order is an unusual rebuke by a federal judge to a sitting president over decorum in the judicial process.\n\nIn his four-page order, Merryday said plaintiffs like Trump are supposed to “fairly, precisely, directly, soberly, and economically” tell defendants in complaints why they are being sued.\n\nTrump’s complaint said the defendants “baselessly hate President Trump in a deranged way,” and that their actions “represent a new journalistic low for the hopelessly compromised and tarnished ‘Gray Lady,'” a nickname for the Times.\n\nIt also contended that the Times itself was “deranged” for endorsing Democrat Kamala Harris for president.\n\n“Although lawyers receive a modicum of expressive latitude in pleading the claim of a client,” Merryday wrote, “the complaint in this action extends far beyond the outer bound of that latitude.”\n\nOne of Trump’s lawyers also represents the president in his $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal, over an article about a birthday greeting sent to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.\n\nTwo of Trump’s other lawyers helped him obtain a $16 million settlement in July with CBS News’ parent Paramount Global over the editing of an interview with Harris on “60 Minutes.”","summary":"NEW YORK,  (Reuters) &#8211; A federal judge yesterday threw out U.S. President Donald Trump&#8217;s $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times NYT.N\n\n\nThe article Judge throws out Trump&#8217;s $15 billion lawsuit against New York Times, citing improper content appeared first on Stabroek News.","url":"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/09/20/news/world/judge-throws-out-trumps-15-billion-lawsuit-against-new-york-times-citing-improper-content-2/","image":"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 06:04:43","author":"Stabroek News","authors":["Stabroek News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":362124840,"title":"Coldplay preaching peace and love to Charlie Kirk is all well and good. But would it hurt artists to take a stand? | Elle Hunt","text":"I don’t mind committing to record that I am a fan of Coldplay. A Rush of Blood to the Head, Parachutes and Viva La Vida … are legitimately good albums. And Fix You remains a tearjerker despite decades of overuse in medical dramas.\n\nYet, if your taste is better than mine, you may not know that they’re on tour. On my Instagram stories, at least, there has been a conspicuous absence of Coldplay posts, compared to the wall-to-wall coverage of the Oasis reunion shows (though I’m not convinced Oasis have more good songs in their catalogue).\n\nWhen I attended last week, the stalls were packed with perhaps the most diverse and global crowd I’ve ever seen. Even the haters – not that there were any present – would have to admit Coldplay put on a dazzling show, with 3D special effects and guest performers, including Fela Kuti’s son Femi, Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna and an entire orchestra from Venezuela. In some ways it was a triumph of technology and globalisation, but as a platform, I couldn’t help feeling it was squandered.\n\nSuch was Chris Martin’s eagerness to preach peace, love and tolerance from the stage that he overshot it a bit, entreating us to direct our good feeling “to Ukraine … and Russia, Palestine … and Israel” and everywhere else besides. Well – sure. People aren’t their governments, and there’s suffering everywhere. But in those conflicts, suffering is not evenly proportioned. Elyanna sang Coldplay’s single We Pray with palpable emotion. I wondered: what would she have said if she’d expressed herself more?\n\nSimilarly, on Friday at Wembley, the closing night of the tour, Martin exhorted the crowd to “send love anywhere you wanna send it in the world”. He went on: “You can send it to Charlie Kirk’s family. You can send it to anybody’s family. You can send it to people you disagree with but you send them love anyway.” It is this lack of a definitive statement, along with the barely there acknowledgment of how genuinely divisive these issues and events are, that rendered his warm-fuzzy sentiments hollow even by stadium-rock standards, like a Christian music concert with zero mention of God.\n\nPerhaps this really is as deep as his engagement goes: you don’t get to 10 studio albums and more than 20 years of world-dominating success by being a firebrand. And, maybe controversially, I don’t believe artists are obliged to speak out about politics: it’s generally neither edifying nor productive for the cause when they weigh in half-heartedly with word salad.\n\nWhen the 1975’s Matty Healy paused their otherwise brilliant headline set at Glastonbury to elaborate banally on their “conscious decision” to eschew politics in favour of “love and friendship”, it struck a bum note for me in the crowd. No fan of the 1975 needs or expects Healy’s hazy expansions – why stop the show to say nothing?\n\nMany artists, notably young women, do consistently address the conflict in Palestine and other struggles – Chappell Roan, Renée Rapp, Jade Thirlwall among them. Whether this reflects the higher standards placed on women in the public eye, the pressures of their politically engaged young fans or the fact that they are genuinely invested is up for debate; their frequent eloquence, and fearless references to genocide, suggests the last. But their powers of influence are limited: girls and young women are a formidable economic force, but less influential politically.\n\nColdplay, on the other hand, are middle Britain. I’m willing to bet that there will have been a far greater proportion of Tory – and no doubt Reform – voters at Wembley than the other gigs I’ve attended this year. Only by the most creative interpretations of peace, love and understanding can either party be said to stand for them (loving the St George flag, maybe?). What would it mean, I wondered, for Martin to say: “And, while we’re at it, don’t vote for Nigel Farage”?\n\nMaybe nothing. After all, Charli xcx’s “Kamala IS brat” and Swift’s “childless cat lady” endorsement didn’t get Harris over the line. And relative to many acts, Coldplay already do a lot of good – albeit for uncontroversial causes – as laid out on screens before the show: funding small music venues, cleaning up oceans, rewilding forests, generating clean energy. That’s not nothing – for their beneficiaries, it’s doubtless transformative. Though with the ongoing threat of the climate crisis, these appeals somewhat amount to an understatement of reality.\n\nNobody should expect political salvation from pop stars – especially Coldplay. To give the Peep Show quote routinely parroted at Coldplay fans: “People like Coldplay and voted for the Nazis – you can’t trust people.” For now, the former group outnumbers the latter, but hatred is doubtless figuring more prominently in global political movements, and it is not placated or stalled by vague appeals to love. So perhaps it wouldn’t hurt for more artists to take a clear, well-defined stand, rather than aim for palatability and maximum consensus.\n\n Elle Hunt is a freelance journalist","summary":"At Wembley, Chris Martin exhorted the crowd to ‘send love anywhere you wanna send it’.

Tim Walz said he would use an unprecedented third four-year term in office to enact stricter gun laws and protect the state from what he called the “nightmare” of the second Trump administration.\n\nWhile Walz has not introduced any new significant policy proposals since officially announcing his candidacy, he has touted his achievements as governor, including funding boosts for K-12 education, worker protections, and the passage of gun safety measures like universal background checks.\n\nOn Friday, he asked voters for more time to finish work, including new gun laws.\n\n“We have some unfinished business to attend to,” he told supporters. “We’ve made important strides. … We’ve expanded background checks, we’ve added red flag laws and we funded mental health care — but it’s not even close to enough,” Walz told his supporters.\n\n“As governor, I’m going to use the power of this office to figure out how to help stop this bloodshed,” he continued.\n\nMuch could change between now and the election in November 2026, but in its earliest phases, top issues in the race for Minnesota governor include addressing significant fraud in social programs and whether to pass new gun control legislation in the wake of the June assassinations of former House speaker Melissa Hotman and the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis in August.\n\nWalz’s initial campaign pitch is focused on preserving gains made during his first two terms, like paid family and medial leave and universal free school lunches, gun control measures and opposing the “cruelty and corruption” of Donald Trump’s second presidency.\n\nNo governor has ever won a third four year term in state, and Walz’s record as governor and elevation to the national stage last year as Democratic presidential candidate’s running mate Kamala Harris could harm his credibility as a moderate who can perform in rural and urban areas alike, many political observers say. Still, the exact effects are to be seen.\n\n“Walz did particularly well in his former House district in southeastern Minnesota, and that helped to boost his margin in his first two election contests,” said Steven Schier, a professor emeritus of political science at Carleton College in Northfield.\n\n“The question is whether his popularity has eroded out there and in greater Minnesota — to the extent that his reelection becomes more questionable in 2026,” he continued.\n\nDespite that potential erosion, Schier said the contest for the governor’s office will likely center around winning over suburban and independent voters. Walz’s chances of reelection will also depend on the level of Trump’s unpopularity in Minnesota, he said.\n\nGovernment fraud\n\nA major issue absent from Walz’s Friday speech was the issue of significant fraud in state government programs, an issue that’s shaping up to be the focus of Republicans in the early stages of the election.\n\nMinnesota U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson has said he believes fraudsters have stolen close to $1 billion from the state in recent years, and investigations continue to unearth new schemes.\n\nRep. Kristin Robbins, a Maple Grove Republican now running for governor, leads a GOP-created House fraud committee, has made the problem a central issue to her campaign.\n\n“A third Walz term would be an unprecedented DISASTER,” she said in a social media statement after Walz announced his reelection campaign. “Under Tim Walz, Minnesota has seen higher taxes, higher crime, and rampant fraud.”\n\nWalz announced an executive order Tuesday directing agencies to “intensify” fraud detection efforts and created a new anti-fraud division in the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension earlier this year.\n\nAnd in the past, he’s pointed out that fraudsters are being held criminally accountable — more than 50 of 75 charged in the Feeding Our Future scandal, where authorities say fraudsters stole $250 million intended for needy children during the pandemic.\n\nStill, fraud investigations are likely to remain in the headlines, presenting a lasting vulnerability for the governor, Schier said.\n\nSoon after Walz officially announced he would be running for governor again earlier this week, federal prosecutors announced eight charges in what they said was a scheme to defraud a federally funded housing stabilization services program run by the state.\n\n“The problem is this fraud issue doesn’t go away very soon, because there’ll be additional relevant investigations, prosecutions and so forth, well into the election year,” Schier said. “Obviously, Kristin Robbins is hoping to ride that issue.”\n\nGun violence\n\nWalz officially announced his bid for a third term as governor as he continues to meet with DFL and Republican leaders for negotiations on a potential special legislative session on guns in the wake of last month’s school shooting in Minneapolis.\n\nWalz and Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislators are calling for new policies including a state ban on semiautomatic assault-style weapons like the AR-15, which was used in the Annunciation shooting.\n\nRepublicans, who say school security and improving mental health services are the best way to avoid future tragedies, have firmly opposed any new gun control measures. In his speech, Walz criticized Republicans for talking about “anything except what’s at the heart of this matter.”\n\nA series of public Senate hearings this week failed to yield any consensus among DFL and GOP Senators, raising questions about whether a special session would result in any meaningful legislation being passed.\n\nNo gun control bill could pass without bipartisan support in a narrowly divided Legislature, where the House is tied 67-67 between the DFL and GOP and the Senate is a one-seat DFL majority.\n\nStill, Walz says he’ll call lawmakers back to the Capitol “one way or the other.”\n\nUnprecedented 3rd term\n\nWalz was first elected in 2018 and won a second term in 2022. No governor has served three consecutive terms in Minnesota history. Rudy Perpich tried in 1990 but lost to Republican Arne Carlson.\n\nPerpich served as governor from 1976 to 1979 after Gov. Wendell Anderson resigned to allow Perpich to appoint him to the U.S. Senate. Perpich lost the 1978 election, but won in 1982 and again in 1986.\n\nNo other prominent DFL candidates have publicly signaled plans to run for governor in 2026.\n\nBesides Robbins, several Republicans have announced plans to seek their party’s gubernatorial nomination, including 2022 gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen and Kendall Qualls, who sought the GOP nomination in 2022.\n\nNo Republican has won statewide office in Minnesota since 2006.","summary":"Gov.

But she was frustrated her loyalty was sometimes questioned by the former president and his family.\n\nOn one occasion, Biden called her hours before she was due to debate Trump, while she was preparing in a hotel room.\n\nAccording to Harris, Biden told her some \"real powerbrokers in Philly\" had decided not to support her, because they'd heard she'd said bad things about him.\n\nShe also wishes she'd done more to distance herself from Biden after he stepped aside.\n\nA particular regret was telling a talk show she couldn't think of anything she'd have done differently to Biden if she'd been president — a comment that haunted her throughout the campaign.\n\n\"Stationed at various places around the set, my staff were beside themselves,\" she writes. \"Why. Didn't. I. Separate. Myself. From. Joe. Biden?\"\n\nBut Harris also writes that the \"rapport between Joe and me was genuine\". Before the election campaign, the pair regularly lunched together in the White House.\n\n\"He'd have a club sandwich; I'd have grilled fish. And then, with a conspiratorial grin, he'd order us up a chocolate shake or a sundae.\"\n\nShe says Biden's White House helped 'fuel' her critics\n\nHarris complains that the Biden White House rarely defended her from attack, and even added \"fuel to negative narratives that sprung up around me\".\n\n\"They had a huge comms team,\" Harris writes. \"But getting anything positive. Said about my work or any defence against untrue attacks was almost impossible.\"\n\nShe cites an example involving the AUKUS submarine deal with Australia.\n\nIn 2021, Harris travelled to France to \"help reset our tattered relationship after we signed the Australia-UK-US security pact\".\n\nFrance was incensed after Australia terminated an agreement to buy French submarines. France had recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia, and president Emmanuel Macron later said then-prime minister Scott Morrison had lied to him.\n\n\"This had caused tremendous friction,\" Harris recalls. But she met Macron, talked up French-US cooperation in other areas, and \"warmed the chill\".\n\nShe also visited a medical institute and, during a conversation with research, said she wished politicians did more research before coming up with \"the plan\" for everything.\n\n\"I said 'the Plan' with exaggerated emphasis and air quotes,\" Harris writes.\n\n\"Fox News, the New York Post, and Newsmax went wild, claiming I'd faked a French accent.\n\nShe 'pleaded with Joe' to show empathy for Palestinians\n\nDuring the election campaign, a lot of Democrats hoped Harris would take a stronger position than Biden against Israel harming innocent Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nIn the end — possibly to her detriment — Harris maintained ironclad support for Israel, even if her language sometimes seemed a little tougher on it.\n\nShe argued then — and continues to in the book — that Israel's war (now officially deemed a genocide by a UN probe) is \"not a binary issue\".\n\nBut she also writes that she was frustrated by Biden's seeming inability to express genuine empathy for Palestinians.\n\n\"I had pleaded with Joe, when he spoke publicly on the issue, to extend the same empathy he showed to the suffering of Ukrainians to the suffering of innocent Gazan civilians,\" she writes.\n\nHarris was frustrated anti-genocide protesters targeted her rallies, but not Trump's.\n\n\"I wished they would understand that sitting out the election of voting for a third candidate would elect Trump and kill any effort for a just peace, any hope for a two-state solution.\"\n\nShe writes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"was bent on undermining Joe Biden\" and, during her own meeting with him during the campaign, his \"hooded gaze and disengaged demeanour made it clear to me that he was running out the clock\".\n\n\"He wanted Trump in the seat opposite him,\" Harris writes.\n\nShe felt she couldn't choose a gay running mate\n\nAfter she became the Democratic nominee for president, Harris had an \"excruciatingly tight timeframe\" to find a running mate.\n\nShe chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, but reveals in her book that he wasn't her first pick.\n\n\"Of the eight names on the list for vetting, I might as well say that Pete Buttigieg was my first choice,\" she writes.\n\nButtigieg, known to many as Mayor Pete, was Biden's transportation secretary who had previously run against him for the party's presidential nomination. He's also married to a man.\n\n\"He would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white woman,\" Harris writes.\n\n\"But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man.\n\n\"Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let's just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.\"\n\nButtigieg said he was surprised to read that. \n\n\"I just believe in giving Americans more credit than that,\" he told Politico. \"Politics is about the results we can get for people and not about these other things.\"\n\nTrump was 'surprisingly' nice to her in private\n\nTrump's attacks on Harris during the campaign were harsh and personal. He mispronounced her name, questioned her racial identity and mocked her \"crazy person\" laugh.\n\nBut when she spoke to him on the phone after one of the apparent attempts on his life, she encountered a man who was \"surprisingly effusive\", she writes.\n\n\"You've done a great job, you really have,\" Trump said, according to Harris's retelling in the book. \"My only problem is it makes it very hard for me to be angry at you.\"\n\nHarris writes Trump went on to tell her he was going to \"tone it down\", that his daughter Ivanka was a \"big fan\" of hers, and that her husband Doug \"looks like a really good guy\".\n\n\"People had told me,\" Harris writes, \"that he had the capacity, one to one, to show a warmer side. That he could even be charming. I hadn't believed it. But now I was experiencing it.\n\n\"And then, a reality check: He's a con man.

(RELATED: ‘Rhetoric That’s Getting Officers And Agents Hurt Every Day’: Todd Lyons Goes Off On Jasmine Crockett Bad-Mouthing ICE)\n\n“He’s only saying Kamala’s fascist because he ran out of sting that she was dumb. That’s your word. He was just making fun of it. But Jessica, just listen,” Watters said. “If you don’t mind.”\n\n“No, it was literally my turn,” Tarlov said. “I do mind, deeply.”\n\nTensions between Republicans and Democrats increased during the 2024 presidential election cycle. Corporate media and Harris’ campaign escalated their rhetoric against Trump.\n\nPrior to the 2024 election, Trump was called a fascist by Harris, with former President Joe Biden saying Trump should be locked up.\n\nThe callouts by Democrats notably came after the first assassination attempt against Trump on July 13, 2024, when 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired multiple rounds into a rally in Butler, Pa. The shooting killed volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore and left Trump with a bullet grazing his ear.\n\nRepublicans have pleaded with Democrats not to label them.\n\n“You guys have called us this word a lot. You can’t control yourselves. We can’t control you. Nancy [Pelosi] can’t. No one can. At this point, say it. Say it all you want. I’m done complaining about it because we look weak when we complain,” Watters said.\n\n“‘Please don’t say it. We’re warning you. It’s putting people in danger. Everyone’s getting shot. Their cars are getting firebombed. Conservatives can’t give a speech at a college.'”\n\n“I’m done with saying it. You guys are going to say it. It kind of reminds me of little kids when they call you a name and then you react. They’re like, ‘Oh, we’re going to call that name again.’ So we’re done. Call us whatever you want. Call us the F-bomb. Call us the real F-bomb. I don’t care anymore,” Watters added.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 2024, a second attempt against Trump was uncovered when Secret Service agents found would-be assassin Ryan Routh hiding in the bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., with an AK-47-style rifle.\n\nSince the beginning of Trump’s second term, Democrats have continued to say that his administration is a threat against democracy. Disney’s ABC indefinitely suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel following his comments about Kirk’s alleged shooter, causing renewed uproar over the issue of free speech.\n\nAccording to a recent Napolitan News Service poll, data shows 26% of those aged 18 to 34 believe America is “better off now that Charlie Kirk has been killed,” despite saying “it is always difficult to wish ill of another human being.” Among Democrats, 24% agreed with the sentiment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He said he has a list of enemies. You think I’m not on that list?”\n\nGuillermo, whose full name is Guillermo Rodriguez, countered, “Jimmy, we need you to help us get through this. You have a very important voice.”\n\n“I do?” Kimmel replied. “Maybe you’re right.”\n\nThe TV host then spent his 10-minute, sometimes-teary monologue grousing about Trump’s victory and how it was “a terrible night for women, for children, for the hundreds of thousands of hard working immigrants who make this country go, for health care, for our climate, for science, for journalism, for justice, for free speech.”\n\n“It was a terrible night for poor people, for the middle class, for seniors who rely on Social Security, for our allies in Ukraine, for NATO and democracy and decency,” he continued in a mawkish tone.\n\n“And it was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him. And guess what? It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him too. You just don’t realize it yet.”\n\nAfter making a “joke” about sharing a jail cell with Taylor Swift, Kimmel quipped: “We’ll see how funny that is in six months. When the great talkshow host roundup begins.”\n\nTen months later, ABC executives pulled him off the air — but his ratings had started nose-dived almost immediately after the election, as he resumed his Trump tirades.\n\nMonthly Nielsen figures showed “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” fell to just 1.1 million total viewers in August 2025, were cut nearly in half from January’s 1.95 million, trailing behind every one of his late night peers.\n\nHere’s the latest on Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension after Charlie Kirk comments\n\nJimmy Kimmel raged against Trump almost every night for a year before ABC pulled him off air\n\nDisney bosses want Jimmy Kimmel to ‘de-escalate’ before putting show back on air: reports\n\nHow late-night hosts handled Jimmy Kimmel suspension in first shows since ABC yanked him from air\n\nJimmy Kimmel’s suspension just latest example of Disney yanking celebrities off the air\n\nKimmel’s August household rating of 0.35 was his lowest point of the year. Viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 were his worst demographic.\n\nThe “Man Show” alum averaged only 129,000 viewers in that bracket in August, off from 212,000 in January and less than half his June peak of 284,000.\n\nKimmel was indefinitely canned got into trouble early in his monologue Monday night when he decided to talk about the brutal killing of Kirk at an event at Utah Valley University in Orem last week.\n\n“We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who killed Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” he told the audience at the El Capitan Entertainment Centre in Hollywood, California. \n\nKirk, 31, was fatally shot amid his “American Comeback” college speaking tour on the campus of Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.\n\nTyler Robinson, a “radicalized” 22-year-old with a live-in trans partner, was captured 33 hours later and charged with Kirk’s murder.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox had told The Wall Street Journal in a piece published Sept. 13 that Robinson subscribed to a “leftist ideology.”\n\nKimmel’s deal with ABC had been slated to run through May 2026 under a three-year extension signed in September 2022 — but he was abruptly pulled before his show aired Wednesday night. \n\nThe $16-million-per-year late-night host has refused to apologize for his remarks during his Monday monologue, part of the reason that Disney CEO Bob Iger and TV boss Dana Walden pulled the show.\n\nKimmel reportedly told execs that he intended to “clarify” his remarks in an upcoming monologue — only to double down and signal he was going to go after Trump supporters again.","summary":"\"You've heard him.

But the signature \"Hot Topics\" segment that frequently blasts Trump has suddenly gone cold as speculation escalates that the Trump administration is considering taking action against \"The View.\" Show host Whoopi Goldberg and her all-female panel has been conspicuously silent on ABC's suspension of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in the wake of blistering backlash over Kimmel’s comments about slain right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. The late-night host said during the monologue on his show Monday that the \"MAGA gang\" was characterizing Tyler Robinson, the Utah man accused in the shooting death of Kirk, \"as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has indicated that \"The View\" might be investigated to see whether it qualifies as \"a bona fide news program,\" which would exempt it from the agency's equal time rule. The absence of commentary since the news about Kimmel broke on Wednesday has been particularly glaring after late-night hosts Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Jon Stewart criticized the decision by the Walt Disney Co.-owned network on their respective programs Thursday night. The network's action has been largely condemned in entertainment circles, sparking major protests outside Disney headquarters and Kimmel's Hollywood Boulevard studio. MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace on Thursday called out the silence of \"The View\" during her \"Deadline: White House\" show, noting Walt Disney Co. had previously pledged $15 million to Trump’s library to resolve a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate statements about Trump by ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. She served as a co-host of \"The View\" for one season. \"Those women are fearless, and the story didn't come up,\" Wallace said. \"It's obviously being felt and acted upon at ABC more broadly.\" Trump's bitter campaign against \"The View\" and his desire to cancel it was highlighted last July after co-host Joy Behar declared that Trump was \"so jealous\" of former President Obama. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers fired back in a statement sent to entertainment venues calling Behar \"an irrelevant loser suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome ... She should self-reflect on her own jealousy of President Trump’s historic popularity before her show is the next to be pulled off air.” In sharp contrast to the current hush about the president, Goldberg and her co-hosts unleashed a vicious attack on Trump after he blasted the show during a campaign rally last year. \"So I watched that stupid 'View' where you have these really dumb people,\" Trump told the large crowd, which responded with boos. Saying that \"politics can do strange things to demented people,\" he relayed how he had hired Goldberg as a comedian before his political career, \"and her mouth was so foul. She was filthy dirty, disgusting ... I said I would never hire her again.\" The opening segment of \"The View\" the following day showed the hosts entering as Christina Aguilera's \"Dirrty\" played. Addressing Trump, Goldberg said, \"As a matter of fact, I was filthy, and I stand on that ... How dumb are you? You hired me four times ... and you didn't know what you were getting? How dumb are you?\" Co-host and senior ABC News legal correspondent and analyst Sunny Hostin weighed in: \"Donald Trump, I want to thank you for personally (sic) telling so many lies and committing so many alleged crimes and providing us with material on a daily basis. You help us do our jobs, and I am so appreciative.\" Noting that she was a former prosecutor, she added, \"I admit, I may not have spent as much time in a courtroom as you have ... And like Madam Vice President Kamala Harris, I've had a history of prosecuting sex offenders, so thank you for keeping people like us in business.\" Hostin concluded with an invitation to Trump to come on \"The View: \"I'll even give you a free 'View' mug — not to be confused with a mug shot. Because that's your area.\"","summary":"ABC's daytime talk show, regularly critical of Trump, has been conspicuously silent in the wake of the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show and as it faces threats from the FCC chairman.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2025-09-19/the-view-jimmy-kimmel-trump-fcc","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b090a36/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F44%2F39054ab34ce69a93e92942037aad%2F178949-lr-0232.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 23:26:12","author":"Greg Braxton","authors":["Greg Braxton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":361937900,"title":"Jay Jacobs and other NY Democrats have great reasons to reject Zohran Mamdani","text":"Zohran Mamdani is unraveling New York’s Democratic Party, and Republicans are ready to pick up the pieces.\n\nThe state’s three most important leaders — Gov. Kathy Hochul, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins — have now all endorsed the 33-year-old leftist for NYC mayor.\n\nThey’re opening the floodgates for Mamdani’s extreme agenda to take root across the state.\n\nBut standing in the way is Jay Jacobs, the party’s state chair and a sworn enemy of its socialist wing.\n\nHe bluntly rebuffed the prospect of an endorsement: “I reject the platform of the so-called ‘Democratic Socialists of America’ and do not believe that it represents the principles, values or policies of the Democratic Party.”\n\nNassau County Reps. Tom Suozzi and Laura Gillen likewise refused to back Mamdani.\n\nInstead, they doubled down on their concerns about his radical views on public safety and Israel.\n\nThese regular Democrats recognize the danger that the young radical poses to the wider party: Their reelection bids could be early casualties of a Mamdani mayoralty.\n\nBoth hail from purple districts that voted in Republicans in 2022, when then-Rep. Lee Zeldin ran an impressively close race against Hochul on a tough-on-crime message.\n\nIn total, Democrats lost four New York House seats in 2022, three of which they regained last year.\n\nThe GOP’s pitch to voters writes itself: Don’t want socialist extremism to spread near you? Vote Republican.\n\nFor all of his charm, Mamdani is an extremely polarizing figure.\n\nIf his extreme criminal-justice agenda cuts down a police headcount hovering near three-decade lows, New Yorkers are going to feel increasingly unsafe as response times climb.\n\nAs they will if social workers replace cops and fail to deal adequately with violent mentally ill and homeless people.\n\nZeldin showed that’s a recipe for Republicans to flip swing House seats yet again.\n\nA Manhattan Institute poll conducted in January showed 70% of New York City voters want more police officers; 81% want more on subways. \n\nDon’t expect those numbers to decrease in swing districts like Suozzi’s and Gillen’s.\n\nWorse, if civil unrest occurs on Mamdani’s watch, how will he restore order — if he even tries?\n\nHe’s vowed to disband the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, the unit responsible for responding to large protests and mass shootings like the July atrocity at 345 Park Ave.\n\nScrapping the SRG would give President Donald Trump a reason to send troops to New York to quell disturbances — and allow Republicans to take credit for bringing order to chaos, as happened in Washington, DC.\n\nDemocrats’ embrace of Mamdani will also drive moderate and center-left Jews who fear and detest his antisemitism to vote for the GOP next year, including for Hochul’s likely general-election challenger, Rep. Elise Stefanik.\n\nThey have nowhere else to go. \n\n(Remember, Nassau County is about twice as Jewish as the Big Apple, which itself is home to more Jews than any other city in the world.)\n\nHow can Jews stand behind a party that’s championing someone who’s repeatedly refused to condemn globalizing the intifada?\n\nIs it now suddenly OK for Democrats to back arresting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu?\n\nLittle wonder pro-Israel House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are still holding out on their endorsements.\n\nFearing for their safety, New Yorkers might move to other states, accelerating the outmigration that already threatens to cost New York up to three House seats in the 2030 redistricting.\n\nThey’ll join others who’ll avoid the state in the face of new taxes on the wealthy.\n\nHeastie said last week that he’d push to raise taxes for Mamdani’s agenda, calling millionaire taxes “popular.”\n\nBy Democrats’ new logic, they expect to win elections by raising taxes.\n\nAs fiscal expert E.J. McMahon and the Citizens Budget Commission have shown, however, an increasing share of the nation’s millionaires have already made their home outside of New York.\n\nWith a projected $34.3 billion state budget gap through 2029, Albany is also going to feel the pinch when New York’s biggest taxpayers bail.\n\nJacobs, Suozzi and Gillen prove that it wasn’t necessary for the state’s top brass to back Mamdani after he won a closed primary with about 32% voter turnout.\n\nAfter all, he didn’t endorse Joe Biden or Kamala Harris last year. \n\nState Dems could have reciprocated the cold shoulder.\n\nInstead, Mamdani’s record will be tied to his endorsers.\n\nHochul, in particular, has ceded her chance to be the adult in the room with Mamdani.\n\nShe could’ve ensured that the city is still governed responsibly and its residents are safe.\n\nIf Mamdani wins in November, there’s little to prevent him from making the state a bellwether for democratic socialism nationwide.\n\nBut Americans as a whole aren’t going to embrace his radical agenda like New York City and its leaders have.\n\nThey’ll make it known at the ballot box.\n\nJohn Ketcham is director of cities and a legal policy fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

He also noted that Biden would often request more meetings to make decisions on issues as he finished his term, according to Axios.\n\nThe ex-chief of staff went on to say that former First Lady Jill Biden urged him to adjust the president’s schedule to ensure he could get more rest, Axios reports. Zients reportedly said that fellow aide Annie Tomasini also requested that he limit Biden’s schedule and shorten the distances the president had to walk.\n\nZients said the president’s son, Hunter Biden, was present for discussions about his father’s presidential pardons, according to the report. As he prepared to leave office, Biden issued pardons to members of his family and political allies who had been the targets of attacks by President Donald Trump. \n\nThe group included Hunter, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and lawmakers who served on the House committee that investigated the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nZients’ testimony comes as lawmakers investigate whether “Biden’s cognitive decline was covered up by his inner circle,” and if critical decisions were made on his behalf using an autopen, according to the committee’s website.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Zients and Biden’s office for comment.\n\nEarlier this year, leaked audio of Biden’s 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur revealed the extent to which the then-80-year-old president struggled to remember key details and dates. \n\nThe audio, published by Axios, included a moment when Biden’s attorneys had to remind him of the year his son Beau died and the year that Trump was first elected president.\n\nWhile the transcripts were already public at the time, the audio also revealed that Biden spoke in a halting, whispering voice, punctuated by long silences.\n\nIn her forthcoming memoir, former Vice President Kamala Harris has also unveiled new details about her relationship with Biden after he dropped from the race and endorsed her as the Democratic nominee. \n\nIn one anecdote, Harris recounted that Biden called her — moments before she walked on stage to debate Trump — to ask if she’d been badmouthing him to Democratic donors. She said the moment threw her off balance at a critical point in her bid for the White House.\n\nHarris also slammed Biden’s decision to stay in the 2024 presidential race for as long as he did.\n\n“‘It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,” Harris wrote, in an excerpt published by The Atlantic.\n\n“Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision,” she continued.\n\nHarris’s memoir, 107 Days, will be released on Tuesday.","summary":"Jeff Zients reportedly testified that the former First Lady urged him to adjust Biden’s schedule so he could get more rest","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-memory-jill-white-house-decline-b2830207.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/19/21/38/GettyImages-1461459785.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/8biS5tHB-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-19 21:37:35","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":361934954,"title":"Kamala Harris mocked for cringe quoting of rap lyric in memoir opener","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is being mocked for quoting a lyric from a Kendrick Lamar song in her upcoming memoir.\n\nHarris includes the cringeworthy quote at the front of in her soon-to-be-released book ‘107 days.’ The book provides an in-depth account of her perspective from her devastating defeat to Donald Trump.\n\n‘I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA…I was born like this,’ reads the quote attributed to Lamar’s 2017 rap song ‘DNA.’\n\nConservatives on social media slammed Harris for including the quote by claiming the decision reveals she is unrelatable to the public.\n\n‘Wow this incredibly reddit,’ wrote a popular ‘Lord of the Rings’ fan account named ‘The Middle-earth Mixer.’\n\n‘Isolated Lib elites have no ability to relate to people.’\n\nMeanwhile, conservative political consultant Ryan Girdusky wrote, ‘I mean... was she unable to find a Dr. Seuss quote?’\n\nAnother X user joked, ‘Recommend title: \"How I spent billions in 107 days, paid celebrities to endorse me, paid podcasts to endorse me, paid media figures to endorse me, asked media to edit my answers if they sound bad, or even requested entire interviews to be scrapped - but still got my ass kicked.\"’\n\nOther comments accused Harris of hiring a ghost writer to complete the book with one X user claiming, ‘This is indistinguishable from parody.

Former US vice president Kamala Harris — who lost to Donald Trump at last year&apos;s presidential election — said it was a \"frontal assault on free speech\". Other critics, including former president Barack Obama, condemned Kimmel&apos;s suspension, calling it capitulation to unconstitutional government pressure and a violation of free speech. On Monday&apos;s Jimmy Kimmel Live! show, Kimmel suggested Kirk&apos;s alleged shooter was a supporter of Trump and mocked the president for talking about a new White House ballroom when asked about Kirk&apos;s death. Within 48 hours, broadcaster ABC announced the show would be suspended \"indefinitely\". Kimmel had previously said it was \"horrible and monstrous to shoot another human\" and sent his \"love\" to Kirk&apos;s family in a post on social media. Trump celebrated his suspension, claiming Kimmel was \"fired for a lack of talent\" and suggested broadcasters who criticise him should lose their licences. Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), praised local station owners for pressuring the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, saying Kimmel&apos;s removal was \"not the last shoe to drop\" . Brendon O&apos;Connor, professor at the University of Sydney&apos;s US Studies Centre, said it was a \"case of moving against free speech\" and said the targeting of comedians and satirists was synonymous with the moves of authoritarian leaders. Dr Emma Shortis, director of the Australia Institute&apos;s International and Security Affairs program, said the move wasn&apos;t unpredictable. \"Trump has always attempted to silence people who say things he doesn’t like,\" she told SBS News. \"The difference now is that Trump and his supporters have levers of power that allow them to actually cancel people.\" In 2013, Trump won a multi-million dollar lawsuit against a Miss Universe contestant who publicly complained that the beauty pageant&apos;s results were fixed. Campaigners in his 2016 presidential run were also required to sign non-disclosure agreements, which were voided in 2023 as part of a settlement of a class action lawsuit by a former campaign aide. In May 2025, Trump issued an executive order titled Ending Taxpayer Subsidisation of Biased Media that cancelled funding for the National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). \"Neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens,\" he said in a statement at the time. Trump&apos;s vendetta against news organisations that he perceives as hostile to him continued on Friday, with the president berating outlets that he said were \"against me\". \"They&apos;ll take a great story and they&apos;ll make it bad. See, I think it&apos;s really illegal, personally,\" Trump, who has sued multiple major news organisations this year, told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. A federal judge on Friday threw out a multi-billion-dollar defamation lawsuit Trump had launched against the New York Times over its content, calling it a \"decidedly improper and impermissible\" effort to attack his adversaries. Trump is also suing the Wall Street Journal and its owners, including Rupert Murdoch, over a report that his signature was on a 2003 birthday greeting for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump claims the signature is a forgery. The US First Amendment protects free speech against government interference, including indirect pressure through third parties. In 1963, the US Supreme Court ruled officials cannot create a \"system of informal censorship\" by pressuring private actors. The FCC cannot revoke licences for negative coverage or other speech disliked by the government. It also doesn&apos;t regulate programming from networks such as ABC, CBS and NBC — its authority lies with local broadcast affiliates that use public airwaves. ABC itself also has speech rights and can decide not to air a show it sees as harmful. That means proving a First Amendment violation would require Kimmel to show ABC suspended him under government coercion. While the FCC was historically an independent regulator, Shortis said the appointment of Carr — who helped draft Project 2025, described on its release as a \"manifesto\" for the next conservative president of the US — has made it \"safe to say\" the body is no longer impartial. Carr was first appointed by Trump during his first term in 2017 and was nominated again by then-president Joe Biden in 2023. He has also spoken in favour of free speech, having said it is \"central\" to America&apos;s democracy. He wrote in the Project 2025 manifesto that the FCC \"should promote freedom of speech\". He has been critical of television networks before, including in 2024 when he accused broadcaster NBC of violating the FCC&apos;s \"equal time\" rule — requiring broadcasters to give political candidates equal air time — when Harris appeared on the network&apos;s show Saturday Night Live the just days before the presidential election. He&apos;s also railed against an ostensible anti-conservative bias in big tech. In his Project 2025 chapter, he wrote that the FCC had an important role to play in \"reigning in big tech\" and what he said were its \"attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square\". Some Republicans have argued the suspension was about fighting \"hate speech\" and was made to serve the public interest. In rare circumstances, the FCC can revoke a broadcast licence under a public interest standard, with expectations that a broadcaster must \"air programming that is responsive to the needs and problems of its local community of license\". It&apos;s an argument Carr used, saying on Wednesday that the FCC was going to \"enforce the public interest obligation\". Republican Assembly member James Gallagher said that while he didn&apos;t agree with ABC&apos;s decision to pull Kimmel&apos;s show, it was not a free speech issue. \"Private companies, like ABC and others, do have the ability to decide what they want to show on their programming. So it&apos;s not a direct, free speech issue where the government is involved,\" Gallagher said. Democrats and free speech advocates disagree. Pen America, a non-profit which says it stands for the freedom to write, said the decision marked \"a new level of capitulation and censorship of speech more redolent of autocracies than democracies\". Fellow talk show host Stephen Colbert called it \"blatant censorship\", while Jimmy Fallon on his NBC talk show joked he wouldn&apos;t be censored — before pretending to praise Trump&apos;s looks and Nobel Peace Prize prospects. The broadcaster of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, CBS, announced in July that the show would be ending in May 2026. The announcement came days after Colbert criticised parent company Paramount for settling a US$16 million ($24 million) lawsuit with Trump. Shortis said the bigger picture relating to the pulling of Kimmel&apos;s show was clear. \"The head of the regulator went on a right-wing podcast … and talked about broadcasters risking their licences and then had a direct response,\" she said. \"I don&apos;t think it was a direct order, but more of a mute threat.\" O&apos;Connor said Kimmel&apos;s cancellation was a \"case of moving against free speech\" and \"clear intimidation\", with satire increasingly under pressure. \"These late-night comedians who have a lot of negative things to say about Trump have been under attack from the administration and their supporters,\" O&apos;Connor told SBS News. \"Of course, they&apos;re going to say all sorts of things that offend all sorts of people.\" \"If that place of satire is no longer available in the United States on mainstream television, then I think it does tell us about the character of American democracy and American free speech.\" He added that clamping down on comedians is a hallmark of authoritarian leaders. \"They clamp down on cartoons, on satirists, and treat them as though they&apos;re news broadcasters,\" O&apos;Connor said. \"In reality, the role of these people is sometimes to say things that are offensive. Not everyone is going to agree with that — but it&apos;s the role of the satirist in our democratic societies.\" Shortis said Trump&apos;s move is one plucked from the \"authoritarian playbook\" and that it was a \"clear-cut\" argument that the move was made to limit free speech. \"In this case, I think it&apos;s pretty straightforward. I think that administration is reading directly from the authoritarian playbook,\" she said. It&apos;s a reading that would be challenged by Trump, who has previously characterised himself as a great defender of freedom and democracy. One of his first moves after being re-elected for a second term was to sign an executive order \"enshrin[ing] the right of the American people to speak freely in the public square without government interference\". He accused the previous Democratic administration of \"exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the federal government did not approve\". Shortis warned that Kimmel&apos;s suspension, following Colbert&apos;s earlier cancellation, could embolden further crackdowns on comedians. \"We need to see this latest movement with Jimmy Kimmel in the context of what else the Trump administration is doing,\" she said. \"It&apos;s all part of the Trump administration&apos;s broader assault on American democracy and has to be understood as such.\" download our app subscribe to our newsletter</b","summary":"What began as a late-night joke has spiralled into a test of free speech in Trump’s America.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-and-free-speech-questions/2u5tx5gyx","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/42fd515/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2999x1687+0+217/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff2%2F8d%2F0a1691e44f2d9ae9b21655daf3fe%2Fgettyimages-501759336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-19 20:37:13","author":"Alexandra Koster","authors":["Alexandra Koster"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":361946706,"title":"The FCC Chair's Unprecedented, and Constitutionally Problematic, Response to Jimmy Kimmel","text":"On Monday Jimmy Kimmel said:\n\nWe hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it. In between the finger-pointing, there was, uh, grieving on Friday − the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this. Yes, he's at the fourth stage of grief: construction. Demolition, construction. This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend; this is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish, OK? And it didn't just happen once. And then we installed the most beautiful chandelier. Responses you wouldn't believe. Who thinks like that, and why are we building a $200 million chandelier in the White House? Is it possible that he's doing it intentionally so he can be bad about that instead of the Jeffrey Epstein list?\n\nYesterday, FCC Chair Brendan Carr said:\n\nPublic interest means you can't be running a narrow partisan circus and still meeting your public interest obligations. That means you can't be engaging in a pattern of news distortion.\nIt appears to be some of the sickest conduct possible. In some quarters, there's a very concerted effort to try to lie to the American people about the nature of one of the most significant, newsworthy, public interest acts that we've seen in a long time.\nFrankly, when you see stuff like this — I mean, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the F.C.C. ahead.\n\nA few hours after Carr's remarks, ABC indefinitely suspended Kimmel's show.\n\nAnd this evening, Donald Trump said of broadcasters:\n\nThey give me only bad publicity or press. I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away.\n\nWhat Is the FCC's Statutory Authority?\n\n47 U.S.C. 301 grants the FCC control over the radio spectrum and directs the FCC to grant licenses to use specified frequencies for a specified number of years. So wireless broadband providers, satellite television providers, local broadcast stations, etc. must obtain FCC licenses. Licenses are generally very valuable (broadband auctions for initial licenses have yielded more than $200 billion to the Treasury), and a licensee really wants to be able to renew its license and to sell it to someone else who will then be able to renew it (otherwise, the buyer would not pay very much). This creates two principal levers the FCC uses to control licensees.\n\nFirst, under 47 U.S.C. 310 the FCC must approve any proposed transfer of a license as long as it finds that \"the public interest, convenience, and necessity will be served thereby.\" This was the source of the FCC's leverage with respect to the CBS/Skydance transaction: CBS wanted to transfer the licenses for the local TV stations it owned, and the FCC had to approve. As readers know, the FCC did approve that transfer after (in the words of the FCC press release) Skydance committed not to have any DEI policies, to \"ensur[e] that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum,\" and to invest new capital. And of course the FCC approved the transfer shortly after Stephen Colbert's show was cancelled – at a minimum creating an appearance problem (or an opportunity, for those who want future transferees to fear the FCC).\n\nThe second key source of authority is 47 U.S.C. 309, which specifies that the FCC can similarly deny renewal of a license if the FCC does not find that the licensee \"has served the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\"\n\nIs This Consistent with the First Amendment?\n\nAt this point a key question may occur to you: how can it be consistent with the First Amendment for any FCC renewal or transfer decisions to turn in any way on the content, much less the viewpoint, of a licensee's speech? Content-based regulation of cable television providers (whose systems often require rights-of-way from a government) or websites that transmit content via wireless frequencies would be subject to strict scrutiny, which is nearly always fatal, and viewpoint-based regulation is always invalidated. Indeed, even without the use of any rights-of-way or frequencies (which the Court never mentioned in its cable and internet cases), the Court would apply strict scrutiny. (And by the way, the Court has invalidated the regulation of knowingly false speech -- indeed, particularly offensive false speech, in the form of lying about receiving military medals.)\n\nSo how can the FCC look at content under sections 309 and 310?\n\nThe answer in the case law has been that in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation the Supreme Court held that broadcasting is subject to less rigorous First Amendment scrutiny primarily because it is uniquely pervasive, and secondarily because it is uniquely accessible to children. And in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, the Court allowed mandates that broadcasters host speech the government deemed valuable, based largely on spectrum scarcity. (Red Lion does not suggest that scarcity justifies restricting harmful speech, but rather justifies requiring broadcasters to air valuable speech.)\n\nDenying a renewal or transfer based on viewpoint goes beyond Pacifica and Red Lion, and there is a reasonable argument that neither decision extends that far. Even if they did, it would not follow that the Supreme Court would permit such actions.\n\nPacifica and Red Lion have been subject to persuasive criticism for years. As to Pacifica, broadcasting is just another medium of communication. The government powerfully argued in cases involving cable television, the internet, and telephones, (all of which Congress chose to regulate) that those other media are just as pervasive, and just as available to children, as broadcasting, and in each case the Supreme Court rejected the government's argument and invalidated the regulation under strict scrutiny, making it harder and harder to defend Pacifica.\n\nRegarding Red Lion, to quote from my Internet & Telecommunications Regulation casebook, \"almost all resources —e.g., wires, labor, steel, land, and investment capital —are scarce in that (a) if given away at no charge people would request more of them than is available and (b) if we could create more of them, that additional increment could also be put to productive use.\" Indeed, in some respects radio frequencies are less scarce than land: the range of usable frequencies has increased more than 10-fold in the last 50 years – as if we had discovered 10 new usable Earths. And the Court declined the opportunity to apply Red Lion in later cases like Miami Herald v. Tornillo (newspapers) and Moody v. NetChoice (social media), making it harder and harder to defend Red Lion.\n\nAs Justice Thomas noted in FCC v. Fox,\n\nRed Lion and Pacifica were unconvincing when they were issued, and the passage of time has only increased doubt regarding their continued validity. The text of the First Amendment makes no distinctions among print, broadcast, and cable media, but we have done so in these cases.[Internal quotation marks omitted.]\n\nFCC commissioners and staff are aware of the First Amendment problems with content-based FCC decisionmaking, and the broader governance concerns raised when government wields so much power. Indeed, the FCC repealed the Fairness Doctrine (whose legal hook was the threat of non-renewal) and later (after much prodding from the D.C. Circuit) the Personal Attack and Political Editorial rules (which were similarly predicated on the threat of non-renewal) on First Amendment grounds. And see the final block quote below. Many people (myself included) expect that if the Supreme Court squarely confronted Pacifica and/or Red Lion, it would overrule them.\n\nBut the costs for a licensee to challenge a non-renewal or transfer denial are very high. The Court has made it clear that only it can overrule its cases, so a licensee would face months if not years of delay on a transfer (often fatal to transfer deals) or on a renewal, with no guarantee of success. The obvious incentive is for the private party to do what the government wants. That is why Trump had leverage over ABC, leading it to settle a very weak lawsuit. That's how things work in lots of countries we don't want to emulate.\n\nWould This Be an Ordinary Application of FCC Standards?\n\nFirst things first: Trump said the quiet part out loud tonight – he thinks that broadcasters have been too critical of him and thus maybe their licenses should be taken away. That has never happened, and here's hoping it never will.\n\nNow to Carr's stated focus – news distortion. First, it has been applied only to news shows (which of course Kimmel's show is not). Second, the FCC has created guardrails around it that seem to exclude Kimmel's monologue. As the FCC stated in rejecting a news distortion complaint against a Fox television station in 2007:\n\nIn evaluating whether an allegation of news distortion impacts the licensee's ability to serve the public interest, the Commission analyzes both the \"substantiality\" and \"materiality\" of the allegation. An allegation is \"material\" only if the licensee itself is said to have participated in, directed, or at least acquiesced in a pattern of news distortion. An allegation of news distortion is \"substantial\" if it meets two conditions: it is deliberately intended to slant or mislead; and it involves a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report. It is sufficient for a petitioner to raise a \"substantial and material question of fact\" as to intent, and the Commission cannot require a petitioner to demonstrate \"intent.\" However, the Commission determines in the first instance whether the evidence submitted raises a substantial question of fact.\nSection 326 of the Act prohibits the Commission from censoring radio communications, and the First Amendment to the Constitution strictly limits the Commission's authority to interfere with the programming decisions of licensees. In light of these limitations, and because journalistic or editorial discretion in the presentation of news and public information is the core concept of the First Amendment's Free Press guarantee, \"the Commission's policy makes its investigation of an allegation of news distortion 'extremely limited in scope.'\" In showing an intent to distort, \"[i]t is not enough to dispute the accuracy of a news report…or to question the legitimate editorial decisions of the broadcaster.\" Allegations of deliberate distortion must be supported by extrinsic evidence \"such as written or oral instructions from station management, outtakes, or evidence of bribery.\" With respect to a report's accuracy in particular, the Commission has stated that it possesses \"neither the expertise nor the desire to look over the shoulder of broadcast journalists and inquire why a particular piece of information was reported or not reported.\" To do otherwise \"would involve the Commission deeply and improperly in the journalistic functions of broadcasters.\"\n\nIn the Matter of TVT License, Inc., 22 F.C.C. Rcd. 13591, 13592 (2007).\n\nThird, the FCC has found distortion in only eight cases since 1969, and just once since 1982. Fourth, in none of those cases did the FCC revoke the license based on the distortion. A representative example involved a \"letter of admonishment\" that had no impact on the licensee (and proved to have no impact on its future renewals) despite the FCC\n\nfinding \"repeated instances of deceptive programming broadcast by the station\" in five different news programs over a two-year period. Deceptions included staff members concocting letters and phone calls that were presented on the air as having been issued from viewers, supposedly spontaneous questions by members of studio audiences which were prepared by staff members and fictitious interviews with various people misidentified as members of the public.\n\nThe only finding of news distortion since 1982 was a similar letter of admonishment in 1993 for NBC\n\nstaging a segment of a \"Dateline NBC\" report on unsafe gas tanks in General Motors trucks. The report showed video of what it called an \"unscientific\" test crash in which a GM truck exploded into flames after being hit from the side. GM's investigation found that NBC producers had rigged the test by attaching incendiary devices to the truck's gas tank.\n\nThe most recent attempts at news distortions were A) a claim, piggybacking on the state court determination in Dominion Voting System's suit against Fox News, that a Fox television station disseminated false statements about Dominion, and B) claims that CBS distorted the news by airing different footage of Kamala Harris's response to the same question on 60 Minutes and Face the Nation. The FCC rejected all these challenges shortly before Trump took office without holding any hearings, as it should have. It began all the orders by stating:\n\nThe freedom of speech and the press is enshrined in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, and is necessary to promote the vigorous dialogue necessary in a representative democracy. When the government — including Congress, the Courts, and the Executive Branch (and States and local government) — seeks to curtail the freedom of expression on \"\"matters of valid public interest,\" doing so implicates the very heart of speech that the First Amendment is meant to protect. Accordingly, for nearly a century since the Commission's inception in 1934, the Communications Act has expressly prohibited the Commission from engaging in the \"power of censorship,\" or issuing regulations or conditions that \"interfere with the right of free speech.\" It has instead plainly recognized that \"[b]roadcasters—not the FCC or any other government agency—are responsible for selecting the material they air\" and that \"our role in overseeing program content is very limited.\" Moreover, \"the Commission does not—and cannot and will not—act as a self-appointed, free-roving arbiter of truth in journalism.\"\n\nIn the Matter of Preserving the First Amendment, Application of Fox Television Stations, LLC for Renewal of License of WTXF-TV, Philadelphia, Pa (Jan. 16, 2025).\n\n(By the way, that last quotation was from a 2020 order rejecting a challenge to the airing of allegedly false statements about Covid-19 by President Trump and others.)\n\nThe only remotely analogous FCC action was Carr's decision, upon becoming chair, to reopen the challenges to CBS's handling of Kamala Harris's answers (but not to Fox's statements about Dominion). But it would take chutzpah for Carr to claim that his Kimmel comments are not unprecedented simply because he did something roughly analogous nine months ago.\n\nThe bottom line: treating Kimmel's statement as news distortion would be unprecedented. Indeed, that understates the point. The idea that his statement resembles anything the FCC has punished as news distortion is somewhere between strained and frivolous.\n\n[Edit to make explicit that the first two limits on news distortion knock out application to Kimmel's monologue.]","summary":"And Trump's much more extreme one.

Josh Shapiro says Trump's threats to revoke TV licenses are an attempt to 'stifle dissent'","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Friday accused the Trump administration of “trying to stifle dissent” after ABC removed late-night comedy host Jimmy Kimmel from the airwaves this week following comments from a federal regulator. “Without question, they’re trying to stifle dissent,” Shapiro, a Democrat, told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, also characterizing the move as “extremely dangerous.” Shapiro’s comments come after President Donald Trump suggested that the television networks were “97% against” him and that those who give him “bad publicity” should have their federal broadcasting licenses revoked during a Thursday night gaggle aboard Air Force One. “And if they’re 97% against, they give me only bad publicity, press,” Trump said. “I mean, they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away.” Ultimately, the president said the decision would be up to Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. Shapiro on Friday said that his reaction to the Kimmel suspension was “fear” and “worry for our country.” “Our foundational principle in this country, which has roots in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania — William Penn settled here in the 1680s — is about freedom of expression, freedom of speech. And to see that being undermined by the long arm of the federal government is extremely dangerous,” the Pennsylvania governor said. He added that, “whether you agree with Jimmy Kimmel or not, whether you found him funny or not, to fire someone because he told a joke about the president repeatedly, and the president didn’t like it, to fire him because he was inartful in his words in the wake of the killing of Charlie Kirk ... that is dangerous.” Kimmel’s suspension comes as the administration has ratcheted up threats against media organizations and calls to investigate groups it deems to be part of the “radical left” in the wake of the conservative activist’s assassination. The president and his allies have an extensive history of attacking the media. Most recently, on Friday, a judge threw out a recent lawsuit Trump had filed against The New York Times and four of its reporters, accusing them of defamation. Last year, Trump sued ABC News, accusing anchor George Stephanopoulos of making “false and disparaging” statements about him. ABC agreed to pay $15 million to a presidential foundation for Trump as part of the settlement in that case. And earlier this year, Paramount, the owner of CBS News, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from Trump that accused the network of deceptively editing an interview of his former rival, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. ABC announced Wednesday that Kimmel, the host of the daily late-night program, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” would not be appearing on the network “indefinitely“ following commentary he made on air about the man accused in the fatal shooting. “The MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said Monday about Tyler Robinson, who is accused of fatally shooting Kirk at an event at Utah Valley University last week. Robinson was charged this week with aggravated murder, among other counts. Bullet casings left at the crime scene referenced fascism, obscure internet memes and video games. Robinson’s mother told investigators that over the last year, her son had become “more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro-gay and trans rights oriented.” She also said that Robinson had begun to date his roommate, who “was transitioning genders.” Carr criticized Kimmel’s comments from earlier in the week in the wake of Kirk’s assassination during an interview Wednesday with a conservative commentator, calling Kimmel’s remarks “truly sick.” He added that, “This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney,” ABC’s parent company. “The FCC could make a strong argument that this is sort of an intentional effort to mislead the American people about a very core fundamental fact, a very important matter,” Carr added in the interview. Carr joined Fox News on Thursday, saying that he didn’t think the Kimmel suspension “is the last shoe to drop.” “I don’t think this is the last shoe to drop. This is a massive shift that’s taking place in the media ecosystem. I think the consequences are going to continue to flow,” he said, suggesting that if broadcasters don’t like being held “accountable ... they can turn their license in to the FCC.” In the days following ABC’s announcement, officials and activists on both sides of the political spectrum raised concerns that the network was bowing down to threats from a member of the federal government, saying that it raised concerns about free speech and free expression. Asked by Welker whether he believed the Trump administration was trying to stifle dissent, Shapiro said yes, “without question.” “The president, in his own words ... made clear he wants to look at the licenses and the certifications for particular media outlets if all they’re doing is attacking Trump,” Shapiro added. On Friday, Shapiro said that free speech is “the bedrock” of the U.S. “I mean, listen, the bedrock of our free society is the freedom of speech, the freedom for someone like you to ask me questions and opine about my work, whether I agree with you or not, whether I like what you report or not,” the governor told Welker. “You’ve got the freedom and the right to be able to do that, and that is something that protects all of us, all of us and it is dangerous what this president is engaged in.”","summary":"Gov.
