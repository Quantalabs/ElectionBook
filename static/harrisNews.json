Yet, people do listen to this eccentric elder who, after not succeeding as a carpenter, ventured into politics, remained there, and amassed wealth through it. CNN’s Dana Bash listens to him:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., criticized former Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign on Sunday, highlighting their susceptibility to influence from affluent individuals in 2024 and their failure to address working families’ issues.\nCNN’s “State of the Union” host Dana Bash questioned Sanders regarding a statement he made during one of his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour events about the former vice president.\nBash played a clip of Sanders addressing an audience, saying, “In my opinion, one of the reasons Kamala Harris lost this election is because she had too many billionaires advising her not to advocate for the working-class in this country.”\nThe CNN host reacted to the clip and said, “ouch.”\n\nLet’s be frank, there were numerous reasons Kamala Harris lost the (2024) election, and having too many billionaires advising her wasn’t among the top ten – or even the top 500. She primarily lost because her personality is abrasive and grating, her cackling laugh is off-putting, she possesses all the charm and charisma of a carbuncle, and candidly, she’s not particularly intelligent. She ran an exceptionally poor presidential campaign, and she faced an opponent who genuinely appealed to the working class – by promising jobs, by ensuring boys wouldn’t play against working-class girls in sports or enter their locker rooms, by promising affordable gasoline, and by pledging to expel millions of illegal immigrants from our country – and he’s delivering on these promises.\n\nWe might also remember that Bernie used to complain about millionaires until he became one (remember that net worth? $15 million). Now he complains about billionaires. He’s the very definition of a one-trick pony.\n\nBut here’s the really funny part of the Bash interview:\n\n“I think the clue to Democratic victories is to understand that you’ve got to stand unequivocally with the working class of this country. You need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working people,” Sanders said. \n“Is it [a] radical idea to say that in the midst of a competitive global economy, we need to make sure we have the best educated workforce that all of our kids, regardless of income, should be able to get a higher education? These ideas exist all over the world. They don’t exist in America, and they don’t exist because of the power of the oligarchs, economically and politically,” he said. \n\nBernie is, and always has been, deficient in the “clue” department. This is one more illustration of that.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIf you&#8217;re searching for someone to instruct you on how to connect&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Bernie Sanders, Lacking Traditional Work Experience, Urges Democrats to Support Workers first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/bernie-sanders-lacking-traditional-work-experience-urges-democrats-to-support-workers/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bernin039-the-Jet-Fuel-Socialist-Sanders-Has-Exactly-Zero-Apologies.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 23:26:10","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.272},{"id":349911598,"title":"Chicago’s ill omens for Mamdani, let the kids play and other commentary","text":"Parenting beat: Let the Kids Play\n\n“Today’s kids want to spend their childhood in the real world,” report Lenore Skenazy, Zach Rausch & Jonathan Haidt at The Atlantic: “Let’s give it back to them.”\n\nThinking that “smartphones and social-media platforms are addicting” the nation’s youth “misses a key part of the story.”\n\nIn a national survey, most children said “they aren’t allowed to be out in public at all without an adult.”\n\n“Fewer than half of the 8- and 9-year-olds have gone down a grocery-store aisle alone; more than a quarter aren’t allowed to play unsupervised even in their own front yard.”\n\nBut this overprotective parenting is just hysteria, and “kids will always have more spare hours than adults can supervise — a gap that devices now fill.”\n\nWake up: “Even this generation of digital natives still longs for what most of their parents had: time with friends, in person, without adults.” \n\nSchools watch: Chicago’s Ill Omens for Mamdani\n\n“To evaluate the merits” of Zohran Mamdani’s vows such as “ending mayoral control of city schools” and “hiring ‘thousands more teachers,’” just “look 800 miles west,” argue Santiago Vidal Valvo & Esme Vroom at City Journal.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson “embraced a union-first approach to education.”\n\nHis school board extended a “no-closure pledge” — stopping shutdowns of underperforming schools — and hiked spending to “nearly double the national average.”\n\nThe “alarming” results: Only “one in three elementary school students can read at grade level, and barely one in five is proficient in math.”\n\nChicago’s lesson is clear: “Allowing unions to drive education policy” produces “failing schools — and thousands of children failing to reach their potential.”\n\nGaza experts: Israel Must Control Aid to End Hamas \n\n“Israel is not starving Gaza,” explain Erez Winner & Gadi Taub at Tablet, despite much “mendacious propaganda.”\n\nSince March, it has tried to counter Hamas’ strategy of “increasing its own population’s suffering” by “breaking its control of the aid entering the strip.”\n\nThis requires evacuating civilians from “discrete areas” and laying “siege” “until all combatants surrendered and gave up the hostages they held”; Israel failed to “execute this plan,” instead “sending aid to pockets” still under Hamas control, where “almost 90% of aid trucks” are looted.\n\n“To recover momentum” and “achieve its war aims” (including the “utter and total destruction” of Hamas), Israel must “gain control over the aid supply.” \n\nFed monitor: Powell’s Tariff Double Standard\n\nFederal Reserve boss Jerome Powell and his colleagues are “obsessed with the inflationary effects” of tariffs as “they never have been with any other taxes,” huffs Donald L.

When asked about reports that the Palestinian population is starving to death, Huckabee answered: “Oh, I think that there are certainly people suffering in Gaza. It’s happening because Hamas has not allowed the food to get to the people who are hungry.”\n\nAfter Patta said CBS “spoke to the World Food Program” and that the organization has “not shown evidence” of food theft by Hamas, Huckabee added, “I’m shocked they would say that.”\n\nHe then touted the work of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a Donald Trump-endorsed non-profit founded in February that has been tasked with distributing aid to Palestinians. “The GHF sites are effective and they are getting food to people. It’s not perfect, but it’s doing what President Trump required us to ask us to do that was set up through GHF,” Huckabee said.\n\n“Get food to people but in a way that Hamas can’t do it. But GHF has no ability to verify who is getting that food. How do we know that those people aren’t from Hamas? You can’t absolutely guarantee that they’re not. But there’s zero verification process.”\n\nIn July, United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) director of philanthropy Hani Almadhoun told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes that GHF is made up of “mercenaries who are hired with big pay and brought into Gaza to shoot the people who are being starved.”\n\nThe narrative Huckabee suggested on Friday is also reminiscent of Trump’s October 2024 claims that CBS edited an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Trump specifically insisted the network intentionally edited her response to a question about Gaza and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nParamount eventually reached a $16 million settlement with Trump over the lawsuit, covering both plaintiffs’ fees and costs as well as a donation that will be allocated to a future presidential library. Going forward, “60 Minutes” will also “release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.”\n\nHowever, while Trump also claimed the network will be airing PSAs to combat deceptive editing, CBS refuted that detail and was not forced to apologize.","summary":"\"Ever wonder how the media edits an interview to give you a different story than the one they had?\" the U.S. Ambassador to Israel says\n\n\nThe post Mike Huckabee Accuses CBS News of Intentionally Editing Gaza Interview for a &#8216;Different Story&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/mike-huckabee-accuses-cbs-news-editing-gaza-interview/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mike-huckabee-cbs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 19:59:21","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.517},{"id":349903980,"title":"Get a rare glimpse into the sick minds behind the EU’s warmongering","text":"In the world of Western mainstream media political commentary, not everything is fun. In fact, mostly, things are grimly serious, the sort of seriousness that comes with solid, never-questioned self-importance. But sometimes that professional pomposity reaches a tipping point when strenuous efforts to be very earnest involuntarily produce priceless outcomes.\n\nThat is the case with a recent elephantine op-ed that has surfaced in Politico under the illustrious names of Gabrielius Landsbergis and Garry Kasparov. Its one, relentlessly reiterated argument is touchingly simple as well as out of touch with the world we really live in: The EU, this fantasy goes, is too consensual, peaceful, and nice (tell the migrants drowning in the Mediterranean or traded as slaves in Libya with de facto EU support). It must become tough, decisive, and fierce, with plenty of arms and gritty oomph. Because otherwise it won’t survive in a world shaped by the big bad “global network of authoritarians” (I won’t enumerate them here; it’s just the usual suspects of every Centrist’s fever dream) and, for good measure, terrorists, too. (Surely, the latter, at least, do no longer include Mr. Jolani, the former leader of the Al Qaeda franchise in Syria who has recently been reborn miraculously as an avatar of diversity now going by Al Sharaa?)\n\nLandsbergis is a political nepo baby, enthusiastic NATO sectarian, and the former foreign minister of Lithuania. While popular at international meet-ups of adult – so they say at least – Europeans calling US presidents “daddy,” a 2023 poll back home in Lithuania saw him fail to breach the 2-percent threshold. If that sounds like perfect material for a blind date with Kamala Harris, Landsbergis certainly has time on his hands after losing his constituency last year and announcing he wanted to take a break from politics. No less, it seems, than his voters clearly needed a break from him.\n\nKasparov is, by comparison with Landsbergis, at least an original phenomenon, the idiot savant of chess. A former world champion, he has now spent decades proving that one can be a chess genius and a perfect dunce in every other respect, especially politics. Since he has combined this obstinate – and almost brave, if that is the word – playing to his worst weaknesses with an equally stubborn obsession with going after Russia and its leadership he still has his fans, in the West.\n\nTogether, Landsbergis and Kasparov have signed off on a gargantuan effort to produce another Long Telegram. Clearly, they are driven by a comically misplaced ambition to best American diplomat and Ur-Cold Warrior’ George Kennan – a complex, dour, and vain man, but certainly no fool, as his later fall from official grace and opposition to daft Western expansionism showed – who issued the renowned call to arms against the Soviet Union in 1946/47.\n\nWhat early Cold War Kennan did for the US – and by extension, its postwar empire – Kasparov and Landsbergis would very much, desperately like to be able to do for the EU. And they have striven mightily. Yet they have strutted into the classical trap of the epigone: think of their imitation clarion call as a mix between embarrassingly poor-but-eager fan fiction, a bizarre alternative history of the EU, and a rambling and rather dull party speech masquerading as an op-ed.\n\nYes, that is how bad it is. Indeed, the screed by the Lithuanian has-been and the chess master who went full blockhead is so self-defeatingly shoddy that it’s difficult to know where to begin. So, for starters, just for a rough sense of what we are dealing with, this is a text asserting the EU systematically promotes politicians who are “excellent negotiators.”\n\nSuch as Ursula von der Leyen, we must assume? The one really in charge (although no one can coherently explain why) in the EU who has just “negotiated” a grotesquely disadvantageous anti-”deal” – really an unconditional surrender without a fight – with the US, built on the elegantly simple principle “You get everything, we get nothing, and we’ll pay you for that as well.”\n\nThis claim about the EU producing excellence at the negotiating table, is all the more curious (Is “curious” the word? Would “symptomatic” be better?) since Landsbergis and Kasparov do mention that recent fiasco at Trump’s Turnberry Golf Berghof as well. Somehow, between the former foreign minister and the former chess champion, no one noticed the contradiction.\n\nBut then again, these are the same bright minds who believe that the EU is a beacon of “free trade.” In reality, one purpose the EU was built for – apart from suppressing national sovereignty and whatever faint elements of democracy postwar European states actually have featured – was to not allow for free trade. In reality, the EU permits something resembling free trade only when it is perceived as advantageous to its own agenda or that of specific states and pressure groups – or, of course, when it is forced to do so.\n\nIn all other cases, it practices a whole plethora of protectionist policies, from the classic Common Agricultural Policy to so-called anti-dumping rules that it uses as geopolitical weapons. It also runs an enormous redistribution scheme between its member nations, something that Landsbergis from Lithuania certainly knows from its most cushy side. While not directly a trade issue, that, too, is far from the pure doctrine of free markets and invisible hands.\n\nFinally, it was, obviously, precisely the EU’s – not Russia’s – refusal to even consider “free” trade for Ukraine with both itself and Russia that played a key role in triggering the original Ukraine crisis of 2013/14.\n\nMore examples of painfully under-informed and under-thought (both polite expressions) statements could be added. But why torment ourselves? You get the gist: Details – though by no means minor – are not Landsbergis and Kasparov’s forte. What about the grand argument then? It is not merely ignorant but positively toxic.\n\nFor Kasparov and Landsbergis, it is certain that the EU and “Putin’s Russia” can never “peacefully coexist,” and while hedging a tiny bit with regard to China, they say essentially the same about the bloc's relationship with Beijing as well. As card-carrying members of the “daddy”-saying club, they let the US off lightly, bending themselves into submissive pretzels by, on one side, noting that it is abandoning its EU vassals and, on the other, saying that that’s okay, daddy, and, anyhow, we Europeans need tough love.\n\nIn effect, they paint a picture of an EU that can rely only on itself. And that is the madness of their article: They are right – even if cowardly – about the fact that it cannot rely on the US. But they are wrong, in fact, deluded, about two key things.\n\nFirst, they are dishonest about “going it alone.” Because they are, of course, not ready to be consistent and encourage the EU to, in that case, actually put its own interests above the demands of the US. The obvious test here is Ukraine. If Landsbergis and Kasparov were ready to face the fact that the EU must end, instead of increase, its support for Kiev, then one could take them seriously to an extent. But the opposite is the case.\n\nSecond, there is no need to “go it alone,” and, in fact, there is no such option. If Kasparov and Landsbergis could free themselves for a moment from their ideological obsessions, they would easily realize that the way forward for the EU in a world where the US has become an even more damaging “friend” than before is to seek normal relationships with others, in particular with China and Russia. In terms of both security and economics, these are the relationships that would allow the EU to perhaps escape decline. Yet driven by provincial phobias and petty personal grudges, Kasparov and Landsbergis miss the obvious.\n\nWhat is profoundly disturbing about their rant is not that it exists: someone will always be full enough of themselves to produce flimsy, atrocious ideas and mistake them for advice to share. Yet in a halfway normal environment, such things would stay on Reddit. That they are treated as worthy of a mainstream platform is a sign that, indeed, the EU has severe problems and needs radical change. Just not along the lines suggested by Landsbergis and Kasparov.","summary":"Two high-ranking gravediggers share their Reddit-level advice on resuscitating the bloc \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/622674-eu-warlike-fevered-minds/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.08/article/689611a32030277299760108.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 19:54:32","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.214},{"id":349903662,"title":"Greg Gutfeld Says ‘It Took Guts’ for Jimmy Fallon to Host Him, Mocks Stephen Colbert – ‘My Uber Driver’ | Video","text":"Greg Gutfeld and Co. took a victory lap for the Fox News host’s appearance last week on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,” with the consensus being that not only was it a fun moment – but something late-night culture needs more of.\n\n“I brought fun by the gallon to our pal Jimmy Fallon,” the “Gutfeld!” [and self-proclaimed king of late night] said on Friday night’s monologue. “It went so well all the way home I could not stop talking about it with my Uber driver [displaying a picture of “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert.] \n\nThe canceled-by-May CBS host, criticized after his exit was announced for never having conservative guests, continued to get roasted as Gutfeld boasted.\n\n“But it was nothing like the critics predicted,” Gutfeld said. “They expected me and Mr. Evil Fox News to attack Jimmy Fallon and they were mad when I did not.

And despite spending so much, we’re the only major country not to guarantee healthcare all people.”\n\nAfter Bash interjected that Harris spoke “about affordability,” Sanders demurred and said he didn’t “want to rehash that campaign” but does see it as a useful guide for Democrats in the future.\n\n“But I think the clue to Democratic victories is to understand that you got to stand unequivocally with the working class of this country,” he said. “You need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working people. Is it a radical idea that we join every other major country and guarantee healthcare to all people? Is that a radical idea? You tell me how many people are talking about that. Is it a radical idea to say that we’ve got to raise the minimum wage to $17 an hour?”\n\nHarris’ campaign was dissected in the days and weeks that followed Trump’s Election Night victory. \n\n“I think if this campaign is reducible to one moment, we are in a 65% wrong-track country,” James Carville said on November 10. “The country wants something different. And she’s asked, as is so often the case, in a friendly audience, on ‘The View,’ ‘How would you be different than Biden?’ That’s the one question that you exist to answer, alright? That is it. That’s the money question. That’s the one you want. That’s the one that everybody wants to know the answer to. And you freeze! You literally freeze and say, ‘Well, I can’t think of anything,’” he explained while speaking to Tim Miller on the Bulwark podcast.","summary":"\"How do you run for president and not develop a strong agenda, which speaks to the economic crises facing working families?\" he asks \"State of the Union\" co-host Dana Bash\n\n\nThe post Bernie Sanders Says Influence of &#8216;Very Wealthy People&#8217; Caused Kamala Harris&#8217; Defeat in 2024: &#8216;Broken and Corrupt&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/bernie-sanders-says-influence-of-very-wealthy-people-caused-kamala-harris-defeat-in-2024-broken-and-corrupt-video/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bernie-sanders-kamala.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 17:10:30","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":349888090,"title":"Opinion: Political deepfakes are worrisome, but censorship isn’t the answer","text":"This column was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nA few weeks ago, a video popped up on YouTube, purporting to be a verbal clash between Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, and Gov. Gavin Newsom during a congressional hearing.\n\nThe video claimed that Hawley cleaned Newsom’s clock in their debate over a lawsuit that Newsom had filed. The problem is it was fake, created with video snippets of both politicians and a voiceover describing what supposedly happened.\n\nThe video, which has since vanished from YouTube, is a fairly crude example of how technology can be manipulated to depict seemingly real events.\n\nMore sophisticated examples of artificial intelligence, known as deepfakes, can literally put words in political figures’ mouths or even create seemingly real persons.\n\nLast year, Christopher Kohls, going by the name “Mr. Reagan” on social media, posted a video in which Kamala Harris seemingly acknowledged that she had been the “ultimate diversity hire” when Joe Biden chose her as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nKohls said it was a parody, but Elon Musk posted it on his social media platform X, drawing criticism from Newsom and a vow to outlaw such material. It was one of many clashes with Musk, the billionaire electric car and rocket tycoon, after he became a Donald Trump ally.\n\nWithin weeks, Newsom signed two bills aimed at either regulating or banning AI-generated political videos. Kohl, later joined by other content creators, sued, contending that they violate free speech.\n\nLast week John Mendez, a federal judge in Sacramento, struck down one of the measures, Assembly Bill 2655, carried by Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat. He ruled that the federal Communications Decency Act protects X and other sites from liability for material posted by third parties, such as Kohl or Musk.\n\nAB 2655 would have barred internet sites from posting deceptive political material during campaign seasons. “They don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to,” Mendez said.\n\nNotably, Mendez indicated that he will also reject the second measure, Assembly Bill 2839, carried by Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat. It would prohibit anyone from “knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election communication … that contains certain materially deceptive content.”\n\n“I think the statute just fails miserably in accomplishing what it would like to do,” Mendez said, adding “It’s become a censorship law and there is no way that is going to survive.”\n\nAs the country’s political polarization deepens, voters become more willing to believe allegations that those on the other side of the divide are evil, corrupt and power hungry. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence makes political deepfakes ever more sophisticated and capable of fooling gullible voters into believing their lies.\n\nExaggeration, selective facts and downright lies have always been evident in political campaigns, but historically held in check, at least partially, by newspapers and other political media.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the mainstream media have fallen on economic hard times and have become less capable of policing political discourse. Meanwhile, X, YouTube, podcasts and other digital media have exploded as alternative sources but they tend to drive polarization rather than counteract it.\n\nThe bills that Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor enacted last year were clearly aimed at crippling media on the other side of the ideological divide but, as Judge Mendez ruled, violate free speech.\n\nCensorship cannot be the answer. The approach that Newsom and legislators took is a slippery slope that would invite retaliation from their political rivals, thus deepening the already yawning political divide.\n\nIt is, however, a genuine quandary. Unfettered use of AI-driven deepfakes in political campaigns present an obvious peril, but so does any effort to prohibit free speech, no matter how distasteful.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

A key progressive voice in the reddest of red states. Senator Bernie Sanders is spending this congressional recess back on what he calls his Fighting Oligarchy Tour, trying to help Democrats find their footing among working-class Americans and reclaim power next November. I hit the road with the senator in West Virginia as he took his message to the heart of Trump country.\n\nIt's good to be with you here. We're in Wheeling, West Virginia. And it's so fascinating that this is part of what you call your Fighting the Oligarchy Tour, because this is a state where Donald Trump got 70 percent.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: Really?\n\nBASH: Seventy percent.\n\nSANDERS: Wouldn't have known that tonight.\n\nBASH: Well, yes. And this was an auditorium that was packed. It was at capacity. Still, what makes you think that your message tonight is going to resonate in such a red state?\n\nSANDERS: Well, among other things, when I ran for president, I think here in West Virginia we won every single county. Look, this is a working-class state. It's one of the poorest states in the country. People are hurting. And they want candidates to come before them to stand up for the working class and take on the oligarchs, who have so much economic and political power. So I think- I think the message will resonate here. I think it will resonate in many red states throughout the country, because, at the end of the day, 60 percent of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. They don't want to see tax breaks for billionaires. They don't want to see the rich get richer. They want health care as a human right. They want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. They want to be able to live in housing that they can afford.\n\nBASH: One of the things that you talked about here, as you have been talking about since even before it passed, is what the president calls his Big Beautiful Bill, cuts to Medicaid, other programs; 25 percent of West Virginians receive Medicaid; 15 percent rely on food stamps. And yet, as I mentioned, West Virginians overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump. How do you square that circle?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that's a longer story that has to do with the failure of the Democratic Party in general to speak to the needs of the working class. This used to be, decades ago, one of the strongest Democratic states in the country. Now it's a strong Republican state, because I think, in many ways, the Democratic Party has turned its back on what was its space. But I think our job and what -- the reason I'm here and the reason we go to red states all over the country is to make it clear that there are some of us who are prepared to stand up for the working class. And if we become -- if we stand together, if we're united, if we don't let Trump divide us up, there's no stopping what we can do as a nation in terms of improving life for ordinary people.\n\nBASH: You said the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class. You said something pretty tough when you were speaking to this crowd about Kamala Harris.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSANDERS: One of the reasons, in my view, that Kamala Harris lost the election is, she had too many billionaires telling her not to speak up for the working class of this country. (CHEERING)\n\nBASH: Ouch.\n\nSANDERS: Well, no, I think -- I mean, I don't think that that's -- I like Kamala. She's a friend of mine. But she was -- her core consultants were heavily influenced by very wealthy people. How do you run for president and not develop a strong agenda which speaks to the economic crises facing working families? You have more income and wealth inequality today than we have ever had. You have 60 percent of our people living paycheck to paycheck. You have got a health care system which is broken and dysfunctional. And despite spending so much, we're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. How do you not talk about those issues?\n\nBASH: She talked about affordability.\n\nSANDERS: Well, but in a vague -- I don't want to rehash that campaign.\n\nSANDERS: But I think the clue to Democratic victories is to understand that you have got to stand unequivocally with the working class of this country. You need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working people. Is it a radical idea that we join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people? Is that a radical idea? You tell me how many people are talking about that. Is it a radical idea to say that we have got to raise the minimum wage to $17 an hour? Is it a radical idea to say that, in the midst of a competitive global economy, we need to make sure we have the best-educated work force, that all of our kids, regardless of income, should be able to get a higher education? These ideas exist all over the world. They don't exist in America. And they don't exist because of the power of the oligarchs economically and politically. All right, let's be clear. In my view, the current political system in the United States of America is broken and corrupt. Does anybody think that it makes any sense at all that Elon Musk can spend $270 million to elect Trump as president and then become the most important person in government? Billionaires should not be able to buy elections. And, by the way, that's not just a progressive perspective. Conservatives understand that too.\n\nBASH: What makes you so sure that the solution that you're offering, which is a more assertive federal government, is something that is going to fly in places where people have been voting in recent years Republican and have an inherent distrust of government?\n\nSANDERS: Well, they should -- and they should have a distrust, for a number of reasons. The government is too bureaucratic and not responsive. But -- and let me tell you what I'm sure you already know, is that, if you look at the polling -- and I asked the people here today. You heard me ask.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSANDERS: Anybody here think that the American health care system is vaguely effective?\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSANDERS: Nobody in America thinks it's working. We spend twice as much as other countries, 85 million uninsured or underinsured; 60,000 people die a year because they can't get to a doctor on time. Do you think that, in America, with all of our genius, all of our capabilities, we, spending so much money, cannot provide a high- quality system that guarantees health care to all people? And do you think people here don't know that? They know. They know we can do it. Throughout Europe and other countries, you don't have to leave college $50,000, $100,000 in debt, or a half-a-million in debt if you go to medical school. That makes zero sense. But, look, let's be clear on the message of tonight and what I will continue to give. You have a government today that is run by the wealthiest people in this country. They are extremely greedy people. They want it all. And we have got to stand up to them. Unfortunately, for many decades, that has not been the Democratic Party, and that has got to change.\n\nBASH: I'm sure you have heard about some Democrats who are talking about embracing the so-called abundance movement...\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nBASH: ... the idea that liberal politicians have created too much regulatory red tape and it stops government from getting anything done. I spoke recently to Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres, who said that Democrats shouldn't be the party of more government, but the party of better, cheaper and faster government. What do you make of that idea? \n\nSANDERS: Well, I think it is clear. Look, I deal with bureaucracy every day at the federal level, the state level, at the local level. It's absolutely true. To build a house, to do this, do that, you have to go through all kinds of things. To apply for Medicaid, you have got to fill out 87 forms. Dealing with your insurance companies, you have got to fill out a million forms. We live in a world which is much, much too complicated. So, if the goal is to make it sure that, within environmental safeguards, we can move forward much faster, the answer is yes. But that is not the fundamental problem facing America. The fundamental problem facing America is that you have got a handful of oligarchs who have enormous wealth, enormous economic power, enormous political power, and they want even more. That is the fundamental issue. Should we make government more efficient? Absolutely.\n\nBASH: Just a couple of political questions.\n\nPresident Trump suggested this week that the vice president, JD Vance, is probably the favorite to take over the so-called MAGA movement. He's from this kind of area. I mean, he's from Appalachia. He probably has appeal in red states and working-class areas. Do you think him being an heir to the MAGA movement is something that should be concerning to Democrats trying to defeat MAGA?\n\nSANDERS: Not my thing at all. I really don't know. I don't particularly care. I think he has nothing really -- neither Trump nor he, nor the Republicans of today have anything of significance to say to working-class people. What they're trying to do is to divide us up. Oh, you're a Muslim. You're undocumented. You're black. You're gay. Let's divide everybody up so that rich can become richer. Our job is to bring people together. Doesn't matter to me who heads the Republican Party.\n\nBASH: Redistricting.\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nBASH: What's going on in Texas. Republicans are pushing to redraw the state's map to try to bolster the House GOP majority, eliminating Democratic seats. I know you have been a very -- a longtime opponent of gerrymandering with redistricting, but you also say the Democratic governors should -- quote -- \"fight fire with fire\" and redraw...\n\nSANDERS: Look, there are a couple of things here. \n\nSANDERS: What is quite incredible, I mean, see, we are taking Trumpism kind of as normal. Trump is the one who came up with the idea. He says, hmm, let's see. Texas, I think we can get five more seats. Do it. Oh, yes. Yes, sir. You're the great leader. We will do it. And they're off and trying to do it. So everybody knows what's going on. It is undemocratic. It is outrageous.\n\nBASH: And yet you think Democratic governors should try to push back and do the same thing?\n\nSANDERS: I think it's sad. I think they have no choice. I mean, what Trump is trying to do, he understands that there is a good chance that the Republicans will lose control over the House, I would hope the Senate as well. That will be a tougher fight. So he's trying to make -- in his authoritarian way, say, hey, I don't want to lose elections. Let's rig the system. Give me five more votes in Texas to me, maybe some other states. So what should Democrats do, sit back and say, oh, gee, Trump is doing this terrible -- we can't do anything, let them win the election, when they should? So Democrats have got to fight back. I think it's pathetic, but I think that's what they have got to do.\n\nBASH: Even though you have said that gerrymandering undermines the political process?\n\nSANDERS: It does. Of course it does.\n\nSANDERS: It's -- what we have now is a terrible situation, and Republicans are making it worse. But what do you do? If Republicans are doing it, you have to respond. It's pathetic, but I think you have to respond.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBASH: Up next, much more of my interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, including Bernie 2028? Plus, the FBI is now getting involved as Texas Republicans escalate their redistricting fight. Our panel weighs in ahead.\n\nBASH: Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. As we enter a critical week on the foreign policy front for the White House, I asked Senator Bernie Sanders about President Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin, as well as what he thinks the future might hold for him and his movement.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBASH: The president announced that Vladimir Putin is going to come to Alaska on August 15th and they're going to meet. First, what's your reaction to Vladimir Putin coming onto American soil for this meeting?\n\nSANDERS: Vladimir Putin is a really awful guy. When you talk about oligarchs, Putin is one of the richest guys in the world, running a kleptocratic society, and then he invaded Ukraine with incredible destruction. I mean, tens and tens and tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed. People in Ukraine are suffering terribly because this guy wanted to start the most -- the largest war since World War II in Europe. So, I'm not a great fan of Vladimir Putin.\n\nBASH: What about the idea of this summit or meeting?\n\nSANDERS: Look, we -- I -- you know, it's -- the bloodshed and the suffering is terrible. If, in fact, an agreement can be negotiated which does not compromise what the Ukrainians feel that they need, I think that's a positive step forward. We all want to see an end to the bloodshed.\n\nBASH: Do you trust a Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin deal?\n\nSANDERS: Well, it's not -- it can't be Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. The people of Ukraine obviously have got to have a significant say. It is their country. So, if they feel, the people of Ukraine feel that the agreement is positive, that's good. If not, that's another story.\n\nBASH: Let's talk about Israel.\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nBASH: Israel's Security Cabinet approved a plan to take control of Gaza City. Your response?\n\nSANDERS: Look, Israel had a right, of course, to defend itself from the terrible terrorist attack from Hamas, but what they have done since then is gone to war against the entire Palestinian people. There are now some 60,000 who are dead, most of whom are women, children, and the elderly. You have got 18,000 kids, kids who have been killed, 3,000 children who have had one or another limb amputated. And now, on top of all of the destruction, human destruction, incredible destruction of their housing, of their schools, of their universities, of their health care systems, on top of all that, what Netanyahu does is impose a blockade preventing food to come in, and people are starving to death. So I think the good news is that we are making some progress. I offered a resolution, as you know, a couple of weeks ago. We got 27 votes from Democrats to stop military weapons going to Gaza, no Republican support. But you know what I think? I think Republicans at the grassroots level are also catching on that it is not a great idea to provide billions to a government that starves children.\n\nBASH: Would you say Hamas has some culpability in people starving?\n\nSANDERS: No.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBASH: Why, when they spent so much money building tunnels and everything under...\n\nSANDERS: So, right now, right now, what is going on is a slaughter, all right? And right now, Israel is -- with few exceptions, is in control of the military situation. It is not Hamas. Hamas is a terrible terrorist organization, all right? And I certainly hope they have no future in a new Gaza or Palestine. But the fault right now is 100 percent on a Netanyahu government, who has waged an all-out war, committed just -- I mean, it is war crimes. They are war crimes. Netanyahu is a war criminal, just as the guy who is head of Hamas is a war criminal. And the United States taxpayers should not be funding Netanyahu.\n\nBASH: You have been critical of Benjamin Netanyahu for a very long time. But I want to ask you just about something that sometimes gets lost, especially right now, when this debate is so emotional and so raw, which is -- especially on the left -- which is, take Netanyahu out of this. Do you believe in the notion of Israel as a Jewish state?\n\nSANDERS: Yes, I do, for a lot of reasons. But, right now, what Netanyahu has done, what the Israeli government has done is become almost a pariah state. And I fear very much that Israel now is looked in very, very unfavorable light by people all over the world, all over the world, not just in the United States.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSANDERS: I was told that West Virginia was a conservative state. Somebody got it wrong.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBASH: Something that I'm sure you have seen, a Gallup poll. Did you see this Gallup poll?\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nBASH: And what the Gallup poll found was that you are one of the most widely admired Americans. And I believe you're only second to the pope.\n\nSANDERS: You want me to declare my candidacy for pope? Is that what you're asking?\n\nBASH: I don't think -- I don't think that you're eligible, for a lot of reasons.\n\nSANDERS: All right. Then I won't do that.\n\nBASH: I watched you tonight. I have watched you for a very, very long time. You're obviously still full of vigor and intensity for the things that you're passionate about and have been for decades. Is there another presidential run in you?\n\nSANDERS: Oh, God. Let's not worry about that. I am going to be 84 years of age next month, as a matter of fact. So I think that speaks for itself. But, right now, what is more important, in my view -- and I want to see, obviously, the most progressive candidate that we can have -- is to rally the grassroots of America. A moment ago, you asked me about West Virginia and why people vote for Donald Trump. Our job is to turn that around. Our job is to educate and organize and give people, working-class people, an agenda which understands that, in the richest country in the history of the world, we can, in fact, provide a decent standard of living for all of our people.\n\nBASH: But, Senator, you know better than I that you could have a very hungry and energized base with an idea of what they want, but if they don't find leadership or find the person that can articulate that, it doesn't change.\n\nSANDERS: Well, you're asking a complicated issue. I think strong grassroots movements will bring forth the appropriate leadership. I think, when people give up on the political process, when you have a handful of billionaires deciding who will run, which is the case right now...\n\nBASH: Are there people out there who will -- that you feel comfortable and confident will take up the Bernie Sanders mantle and run in 2028?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that's not the Bernie Sanders -- will they stand up and fight for economic and social and racial justice? Absolutely. There are some great young people.\n\nBASH: Want to name names?\n\nSANDERS: No.\n\nBASH: Thank you so much.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you.\n\nBASH: It's nice to see you here.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nBASH: And our thanks to the Capitol Theatre, the beautiful Capitol Theatre, in Wheeling, West Virginia, for hosting us.","summary":"On CNN, Dana Bash demonstrated what passes for an “interview” of prominent elected liberal on State of the Union.

JB Pritzker on Sunday ripped socialist New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani’s contention that people of his net worth shouldn’t exist.\n\n“Look, how much money you have doesn’t determine what your values are,” Pritzker fired back on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nMamdani had declared shortly after his shock Democratic primary win in June that he that he doesn’t want Americans to be allowed to amass billion-dollar fortunes.\n\n“I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country,” he told “Meet the Press” at the time.\n\nBut Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, Sunday rattled off his beliefs in universal healthcare, free public education, democracy and opposition to “MAGA Republicans” as evidence that he is a legit Democrat.\n\n“It does not matter what your income level is. What matters is what your values are. And that’s what makes me a Democrat,” the ultra-wealthy pol contended.\n\nPritzker, who has led Illinois since 2019 and is one of the richest politicians in the country, has an estimated net worth of about $3.6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHis fortune stems almost entirely from his family’s wealth from its ownership of the Hyatt hotel chain, which was founded by his late uncle, Jay. Some of the gov’s wealth comes from other investments, such as the Pritzker Group.\n\nThe Pritzkers have been a fixture on Forbes’ “America’s Richest Families” for decades. \n\nThe Illinois Democrat has donated heavily to the party throughout the years and tapped into his deep pockets for his own runs, having spent an estimated $323 million on his two campaigns for governor.\n\nNow he’s gearing up to seek a third term — although he hasn’t ruled out a 2028 presidential run.\n\nMamdani’s campaign did not respond to a Post request for comment.\n\nAs with many top Democrats, Pritzker has refrained from backing Mamdani outright.\n\nThe governor has meanwhile made headlines for welcoming Texas Democrats to Illinois in a bid to disrupt GOP redistricting efforts in the Lone Star State. Pritzker shrugged off Republican attacks on him for being hypocritical, given that his state has one of the most heavily gerrymandered maps in the country.\n\n“What Texas is trying to do is, again, violate the Voting Rights Act. We didn’t,” Pritzker claimed. “We held public hearings, legislative hearings. People attended them. They spoke out. There was a map that was put out. There were actually changes made to the map.”\n\nDemocrats control 14 of Illinois’ 17 congressional seats — or 82%. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the state in November with 54% of the vote.\n\nBy comparison, Republicans have 26 of the 38 congressional seats in Texas — or 68%.

As the Trump administration uses cruelty—and publicizes it—to push for self-deportation, Dr. Phil’s broadcasts are important.\n\nAs Isabela documented in January, the daytime host has gone along with ICE raids, in faux-documentary style reports, often parrotting government talking points without investigation. “This truly is a targeted ICE mission,” McGraw tells viewers, “they’re not sweeping neighborhoods like people are trying to imply.” The truth? That day, ICE arrested 1,179 people nationwide, according to NBC News, just half of whom were deemed “criminal arrests.”\n\nA month before the raid, McGraw reportedly brokered a friendly meeting between Homan and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, after which Adams announced he would alter sanctuary city laws; this allowed local law enforcement to work more closely with the federal government on immigration enforcement.\n\nAnd as my colleague Mark Follman has written, McGraw also lent credence to Trump’s baseless claims that former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris somehow benefited from his attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year. (“I’m not saying they wanted you to get shot,” McGraw said in that interview, “but do you think it was OK with them if you did?”) More recently, McGraw appeared alongside Trump in Texas, in the wake of last month’s tragic floods that killed more than 130 people, including more than two dozen kids and counselors at a summer camp; Trump also appointed McGraw to a (so-called) Religious Liberty Commission.\n\nDespite all this, McGraw refused to tell the Times whether or not he voted for the current president. (“When people ask me about that, I ask them if they’ve listened to what I said,” he said. “Did you?”) McGraw also claimed that, despite his appearance at last fall’s Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, he would have appeared at a rally with Harris, the Democratic nominee, but that her team stopped following up with him in the midst of discussions. (Harris’s spokespeople told the newspaper they were not aware of any such conversations.)\n\nThe main thing that the host’s non-answers shine a light on is how sensitive he seems to be to criticism about his support for Trump’s policies.\n\nThis past week, when Bill Maher confronted McGraw about why he joined ICE raids, he claimed that it was “bullshit” that he, or ICE, were responsible for “separating families.” \n\nBut the Trump administration has continued to separate families. \n\nAnd as Alida Garcia, an organizer and former immigration official under Biden, told the Times: “When you are riding along with the government, they are putting you on a publicity tour. He is participating as basically a propaganda machine for ICE.”","summary":"Dr. Phil McGraw, the daytime television psychologist-turned-Trump surrogate, really wants you to believe a ludicrous claim: He is just not that into politics. &#8220;I don’t think I’m qualified to talk about politics,&#8221; he told the New York Times, in a new profile published on Sunday.

JB Pritzker, on 'Meet the Press,' says he won't rule out '28 presidential run","text":"Gov. JB Pritzker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” said he’s not ruling out a 2028 presidential run — and called President Donald Trump a “cheater” in his personal and professional life.\n\nThe Democratic governor also once again defended Illinois’ Democratic-led congressional maps as he remains in the national spotlight for helping Texas Democrats take refuge in Illinois to avoid Republican redistricting efforts in their state.\n\nPritzker, who was on Kamala Harris’ vice presidential shortlist, has been asked about his political future for years — and he’s always vowed that Illinois was his first priority. But pressed by Welker on whether he can completely rule out a presidential run, the governor offered up a small glimpse.\n\n“I can’t rule anything out, but what I can rule in is that no matter what decisions I make, and I mean in particular about what I do here in the state of Illinois, is about the people of Illinois,” Pritzker said, according to an NBC transcript of Pritzker’s pre-recorded interview. “Indeed, any future decisions of mine will always be guided by that.”\n\nThe governor was asked if it was hypocritical for him to criticize Texas’ redistricting plan as Illinois has 14 Democratic districts out of 17 congressional districts in a state that saw 44% support for Trump in the 2024 election. \n\n“Well, remember that what Texas is trying to do is, again, violate the Voting Rights Act. We didn’t. We held public hearings, legislative hearings. People attended them. They spoke out. There was a map that was put out. There were actually changes made to the map. And a map was passed, and it was done at the end of the census, the decennial census. So that’s how it’s done in this country,” Pritzker said.\n\nThe governor pointed the finger at Trump, saying Texas Democrats are changing the rules mid-decade “at the behest of the president of the United States, who’s clearly attempting to and says that he deserves to have five more seats.”\n\n“... He knows he’s going to lose the Congress in 2026. That’s why he’s going to his allies and hoping that they can save him. And we’ve all got to stand up against this,” Pritzker said. “This is — it’s cheating. Donald Trump is a cheater. He cheats on his wives. He cheats at golf. And now he’s trying to cheat the American people out of their votes.” \n\nWelker asked Pritzker, whose worth is estimated at $3.7 billion by Forbes, about Democratic nominee for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani’s comments that billionaires shouldn’t exist.\n\n“Governor, is that the kind of message that Democrats should be embracing?” Welker asked.\n\n“Look — how much money you have doesn’t determine what your values are. And I’m a Democrat because I believe that everyone deserves healthcare. I’m a Democrat because I believe we’ve got to fund education and have a free public education available to every kid in this country,” Pritzker said. “I’m a Democrat because I believe that we’ve got to stand up for our democracy and against the MAGA Republicans who are literally trying to take away people’s rights all across this country. So it does not matter what your income level is. What matters is what your values are, and that’s what makes me a Democrat.”\n\nThe Democratic governor took a different approach on Tuesday’s “Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” instead making light of his wealth and trading barbs about Illinois’ congressional maps. Pritzker told Colbert he was “OK” with being a billionaire when Colbert offered that being a billionaire is “not a very popular thing to be right now.”\n\n“You’re OK with it, I’m sure,” Colbert said. “You know what? That shows real courage.”\n\n“I’ve got to stand up for my people,” Pritzker said to laughs.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor/2025/08/10/gov-jb-pritzker-meet-the-press-2028-election","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/605ed62/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5187x3458+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F63%2F02f7ba894cf4a5e200e6a3f098e8%2Felect","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 13:00:00","author":"Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":349834080,"title":"Latest line: A good week for Katie Porter, a bad week for Eleni Kounalakis","text":"Katie Porter\n\nDemocratic former Orange County congresswoman appears to be the biggest beneficiary in the 2026 governor’s race after Kamala Harris opts out, as a new poll now shows her in the lead and her fundraising grows.\n\nEleni Kounalakis\n\nStuck at 3% in polls, low-profile Democratic lieutenant governor, part of a wealthy Sacramento developer family, drops out of 2026 governor’s race, and announces she will run for state treasurer instead.\n\nRick Caruso\n\nLos Angeles billionaire who lost 2022 L.A. mayor’s race may have an opportunity in the governor’s race with Harris and Kounalakis out.

What divides opinion is the margin of victory. There are three viewpoints on the numbers. One – there will be a tight race, but the PPP will go beyond its one-seat majority. Secondly, there is the widespread belief that the PPP will pick up many more seats than its present configuration.\nThe third position of some people, but particularly those in PPP circles, is that a two-thirds majority is possible. The contention of this article is that the largeness of the PPP’ votes will be decided by the Irfaan Ali variable. A myriad of factors explain an election victory.\nFirst, there is the terrible sight of a non-performing government. Two examples should suffice. The Rishi Sunak regime in the UK was simply in tatters. The British people lost respect and hope in the Conservative Government. The Labour Party victory was the result of an atrocious incumbent and nothing else.\nIn Trinidad, the Rowley Government had reached the point of no return. Whoever headed the opposition would have won, so no credit should be given to Kamla Bissessar. She is not an exciting politician. Secondly, an incumbent can lose if the president and prime minister have to find a successor and the successor is a terrible, lacklustre choice. The stupidity of selecting Kamala Harris will become a permanent blot on the face of the American Democratic Party.\nThirdly, an election victory can be secured through the dialectical role of the powerful, penetrating, charismatic, and enigmatic individual. The American electorate voted not for the Republican Party candidate but for the man, Trump himself. It is possible if the Republicans had their own candidate and Trump ran as an independent. He still would have won. Trump’s victory has to be put down to the concept known as the role of the individual in history. In Barbados, it was impossible for Mia Mottley not to be re-elected. Her personality was the decisive factor.\nWe come now to Irfaan Ali. The PPP will achieve victory in September because an oil economy has changed the face of Guyana. It is basic political theory that will continue to exist that if a government has the resources to develop a country, voters will be grateful.\nIt is an absolutely twisted mind that can look at the transformation of Guyana over the past five years and deny it. The debate will go on forever that the PPP became accepted and popular because it had national wealth to effect a deep transformation of the totality of Guyana. How can one fault a ruling party for becoming popular and reassured of electoral victory if the economy allowed it to spread the national wealth? That is the reality of the world of politics.\nThe PPP’s achievements and accomplishments (there are subtle differences in the two words) are impressive. It is hard for the decent, nationalistic mind to reject that reality. This reality will cause it to become the next government. I contend that although it will secure a majority vote, the personality of Irfaan Ali will allow the PPP to go far beyond its one-seat majority.\nMy deeply held belief is that a two-thirds majority is out of reach because the PPP will need ten more seats. However, I am prepared to say that it is a possibility due to the role Irfaan Ali will play, as Trump and Mottley did. I am convinced that the PPP will receive multi-racial votes and votes across demographic fences and ballots that cut across class and gender, and this will be due to the personality of Ali.\nPeople are fascinated by the emergence of Ali and what he has become. One reason is that the present generation in this country has not seen a leader in another country who had an inviting style like Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali. Ali is well-liked throughout Guyana, and one of the sustaining factors in this psychological process is that people believe he is a good man who means well for Guyana.\nI think the perception of Ali is penetratingly positive in this country, and out of this frame of mind, people want to see him rule for a second term. From the time Ali became a different leader from what the Caribbean produced before, I have argued that he stands a huge chance of eclipsing all previous Caribbean leaders. Guyanese are going to hand the PPP its biggest majority in the history of electoral competition in Guyana, and that will be solely because of the role of the individual in history. In Guyana’s case, that dialectical role will be played by Mohamed Irfaan Ali.\nDISCLAIMER: The views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Guyana National Newspapers Limited.","summary":"THE rising consensus in Guyana at the moment is that the PPP will be re-elected.

Smith gives clearest sign yet he might run for president and takes shot at Democrat 'frontrunner'","text":"Stephen A. Smith has given the clearest indication to date that he's 'open' to running for president as he took an early shot at a potential rival in the 2028 Democratic primary. \n\nThe sports broadcaster said he will 'leave the door open' to a presidential bid during a Friday appearance on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\n'I can't imagine myself doing it, but I haven't ruled it out because I'm disgusted with what I'm seeing on the left,' he said.\n\nSmith also said there's nobody on the Democratic side he thinks is capable of taking the mantle.\n\n'I look at the national voices for the Democratic party, it is nonexistent. As far as I'm concerned, a damn construction worker could win the Democratic nomination right now,' Smith said to shocked audience. \n\n'They are in for an a** kicking if they don't get their act together. The party is in disarray. No leadership.'\n\nMaher, a liberal who's a frequent critic of Democrats, agreed with Smith's assessment of the party and hyped up the idea of him running. \n\n'This is what they need, they need somebody who has nothing to lose who's like you know what, you like what I say, great. If you don't, I'll go back to ESPN,' Maher said.\n\nLater in the show, Smith also took aim at Pete Buttigieg, who consistently has been polling near the top of the field with likely Democratic primary voters.\n\nHowever, as Maher pointed out, there is one serious shortcoming the former transportation secretary has yet to address.\n\nMaher referenced an Emerson College poll from late June where Buttigieg led the field with 16 percent, but registered zero percent support from black voters. \n\n'You don't usually see zero anywhere. Zero's low,' Maher said. 'What is that all about?'\n\nSmith responded with a devastating, 'He doesn't move us,' before pausing dramatically for effect.\n\n'I respect the man. I've interviewed him before, very nice man, highly intelligent. But you gotta be able to move us, bro. He doesn't move us. You can speculate as to why that is, I'm not going there. He doesn't move us,' he added.\n\nBlack voters are an especially important constituency in Democratic primaries and often decide the eventual outcome.\n\nBlack people overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020, according to exit polls. Both went on to become the nominee for president.\n\nBernie Sanders, the main rival for Clinton and Biden in those elections, had anemic support with that demographic by comparison.\n\nIn the poll that showed Buttigieg on top, former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom were nipping at his heels at 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively. \n\nThe 2028 primary is shaping up to be one with many candidates, since even former President Barack Obama has publicly griped that there is no defined leader of the party.\n\nWith Kamala Harris opting not to run for governor in California, many have seen that as a decision to free her up for another shot at the White House. \n\nHarris leads most polls she is included in, with Buttigieg and Newsom consistently coming in second or third place behind her.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is another contender that's being discussed among pundits, however, there is a chance she'll try to unseat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's up for re-election in 2028.\n\nA series of polls have come out showing she'd beat the New York senator by double digits.\n\nAlthough it's early in the process, Newsom, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, Buttigieg and AOC have all visited early primary states, which is typically a signal that they are at least strongly considering a run.\n\nOther players to watch include Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.","summary":"The sports broadcaster left the door open for a 2028 presidential run in an appearance opposite Bill Maher on Friday, as he took an early shot at a potential rival in the 2028 Democratic primaries.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14986565/stephen-smith-run-president-Bill-Maher-democrat.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/10/03/101076115-0-image-m-58_1754792686485.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 02:50:06","author":"Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":349709422,"title":"Inside the enormous Biden effort to ‘debank’ Trump after Jan. 6","text":"The scale of the effort to “debank” Donald Trump because of pressure from Biden administration regulators went far beyond JPMorgan and Bank of America, The Post has learned.\n\nAt least 10 other financial institutions closed their windows to the billionaire real estate tycoon over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill -melee. \n\nThe moves came in the months after Trump left the White House in 2021, sources inside the Trump Organization told me.\n\nThe stunning scale of the blacklisting is being revealed here for the first time. \n\nIt should be reported as much as possible for the simple reason that if any big bank can cancel a former president over politics as opposed to illegality, then every American citizen is in danger of facing the same mistreatment.\n\nFor expressing an opinion, or starting a business out of step with the progressive culture norms that have infected so much of society, you too can see your economic livelihood go up in smoke and -“debanked.”\n\nDebanking is such an odd word for one of the most insidious parts of cancel culture, and its sponsors like it that way.\n\nIt sanitizes, via clumsy, obtuse lingo, what is essentially something of dangerous -Orwellian magnitude: negating an American citizen’s ability to save, and conduct business through a big bank.\n\nThat’s why Trump and Republicans like South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott are taking steps to end the politicization of banking. \n\nKeep in mind, there are already laws preventing the likes of JPMorgan, BofA and Capital One — the banks Trump has publicly stated canceled him — from being conduits for drug kingpins and Mafiosi.\n\n(Trump has sued Capital One, which denied Trump’s allegations.)\n\nDebanking takes it further. It forces banks to remove customers who might pose nothing more than “reputational risk,” a flighty rule enforced by bank regulators in recent years to keep financial institutions from doing business with people like Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe now-deceased convicted child sex predator was a JPMorgan customer for years, and in theory making it impossible for Epstein to finance his illegality sounds like what should be happening.\n\nThat is until you dig deeper.\n\nUnder pressure from the Biden administration, just after Trump lost the 2020 election and started to act out (which the last time I checked was his constitutional right), the enforcement of reputational risk took a decidedly political turn, bank officials tell me.\n\nIf you believe people at the two largest banks, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan and Brian Moynihan’s BofA, the Biden administration -unleashed its bank regulatory cops at the Office of Comptroller of Currency, the FDIC and the semi-independent Federal Reserve to go beyond nixing perverted financiers from their platform.\n\nThey used the amorphous nature of what is reputational risk to enforce a political regime, the bank -officials said.\n\nThe Bidenistas hated crypto, thought it was an affront to their power to control the economy, and pressured banks from doing business with this somewhat heterodox emerging industry, according to the bank sources.\n\nSo was anything related to guns and certain conservative religious organizations, they added. \n\nAnd most of all, anything MAGA, including the multibillion-dollar real estate and resort empire of Mr. MAGA himself, Donald J. Trump.\n\nSuch an effort isn’t easy to prove because there’s no direct smoking gun, no memo (at least not yet) telling banks to cancel Trump from their system. \n\nThe banks say the pressure was more subtle but still real: Failure to remove Trump or crypto types and others would result in heightened enforcement, -harassment and possibly fines.\n\nThe banks decided to drop customers, even rich ones like Trump, because it wasn’t worth the hassle.\n\nI have covered finance for three decades now and thought I saw it all: Bernie Madoff, Epstein, the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street scandals, penny stock scams and hedge fund implosions.\n\nBut what happened to Trump in 2021 was truly surprising given the breadth of big banks dropping him as a client and scary given their rationale. \n\nAs bad as the events of Jan. 6 were, Trump did tell the crowd that crazy afternoon to protest peacefully.\n\nTrump didn’t break the law holding a rally. \n\nYou may disagree with his rhetoric that day.\n\nHe had just lost a closely fought election against Joe Biden. \n\nTrump said he really won it. \n\nMillions of people seemed to agree.\n\nHe wouldn’t be the first politician to pull that lever. Democrat Stacey Abrams never really fully conceded when she lost in her first attempt to become governor of Georgia against Republican Brian Kemp. \n\nHow many times did Hillary Clinton say Trump was an “illegitimate president” after she lost the 2016 contest to him? \n\nDuring the violent social justice protests of 2020, Gwen Walz, the wife of Minnesota Gov. and 2024 Democrat VP candidate Tim Walz, said she “kept the windows” open to smell the burning debris.\n\n“I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening,” she said.\n\nOr how about what Kamala Harris proudly said around the same time. \n\nThe then-Biden VP candidate, who went on to get trounced by Trump in 2024, supported the defunding of the police movement that led to much more mayhem than what -occurred on Jan. 6.\n\nHer rationale for the “largely peaceful protests” that burned cities to the ground, delivered to fellow-traveler lefty late-night host Stephen Colbert, is at least as cringey as anything Trump said on Jan. 6.\n\n“They’re not going to stop,” she said during an appearance on the show. \n\n“They’re not. This is a movement. I’m telling you. They’re not going to stop, and everyone, beware . . . That they’re not going to let up. And they should not, and we should not.”\n\nDid Jamie Dimon tell Harris that her money isn’t good at JPM?","summary":"The scale of the effort to “debank” Donald Trump because of pressure from Biden administration regulators went far beyond JPMorgan and Bank of America, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/09/business/gasparino-inside-the-enormous-biden-effort-to-debank-trump-after-jan-6/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-7xzmb6tfq-1754785486519.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754771181&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4QSmeyMi-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-10 01:30:18","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":349709398,"title":"Marlow: The Lawfare Investigations Have Begun; Here’s Who the DOJ Should Investigate Next","text":"Over the past year, I have investigated all of the six major cases against Donald Trump that played out simultaneously between his two administrations for my book Breaking the Law. Each one of them involves obvious improprieties that necessitate investigations. In many instances, I believe investigators will find criminal activity, which ought to be prosecuted.\n\nPresident Trump’s voters demand these investigations. They deserve them.\n\nIt is encouraging and heartening to see that the Department of Justice has taken up a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia “Tish” James and that the Office of the Special Counsel is investigating Special Counsel Jack Smith. This could mark a new era of accountability in this country and a return to law and order.\n\nThe following list is far from comprehensive, but investigations into these lawfare conspirators would no doubt yield valuable information; and I believe, in some cases, evidence of criminality. Further details about each person listed below can be found in Breaking the Law.\n\nTHE E. JEAN CARROLL CASE\n\nReid Hoffman: The Democrat megadonor Reid Hoffman bankrolled E. Jean Carroll’s defamation suit against Donald Trump. (I regard the case as farcical, as thoroughly documented in Breaking the Law.) Hoffman hates Trump, saying he would “spend as much as I possibly can and it takes” to beat him, and he has funded a vast array of left-wing political causes through shadowy “dark money” nonprofits.\n\nCarroll, a columnist and comedy writer, was able to hire a crack legal team including Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund founder Roberta Kaplan. Kaplan was funded by a nonprofit primarily backed by Hoffman.\n\nWhile the saga played out in one-sided NYC court rooms, Hoffman was making regular visits to Joe Biden’s White House. Who specifically did Hoffman meet at the White House and what was discussed? The public ought to know.\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that this case against Trump was the brainchild of anti-Trump legal pundit George Conway.\n\nJudge Lewis Kaplan: Judge Kaplan, no relation to Roberta, showed obvious favoritism and impartiality during the Carroll trial. One example is that he would not allow a “black wool Donna Karan coatdress” that Carroll claimed to have worn during the alleged assault as evidence. Trump’s team (among others) have claimed the dress wasn’t even made at the time. Carroll has said that she has the dress and that it is unwashed, so it would presumably have Trump’s DNA on it. Yet Judge Lewis Kaplan would not allow for the dress to be admitted as evidence.\n\n“The dress was great,” Trump told me in an interview in 2025. “When they found out there was nothing on the dress, so we wanted the dress, and the judge said ‘nope.’ We’re not gonna let you show it.”\n\nThe dress could have saved the case for Trump.\n\nKaplan also did not allow several other pieces of evidence to be admitted that would have suggested that Carroll is not credible, such as a contradictory interview she had with Anderson Cooper where she could not decide if Trump had actually raped her. However, in an act of overt partisanship, Judge Kaplan allowed character evidence to be used against Trump, including the infamous Access Hollywood tape.\n\nKaplan was campaigning against Trump in the court room.\n\nAt one point, he threatened to put Trump attorney Alina Habba in jail.\n\nThe judgements against Trump for the two Carroll lawsuits totaled nearly $90 million, about eight times what Carroll had even requested.\n\nTHE STORMY DANIELS CASE\n\nAlvin Bragg and Matthew Colangelo: New York City District Attorney Alvin Bragg campaigned for office on the premise that he would pursue and prosecute Donald Trump. A George Soros-connected fund pumped money into the campaign. Bragg won and quickly built a reputation for decreasing felony convictions for New York’s worst criminals while going to extreme lengths to prosecute Donald Trump for supposed business records violations. He would ultimately bust Trump for what liberal Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said was a “crime that doesn’t exist” in order to get a televised “perp walk” of Trump that would guarantee his political future.\n\nOne of the ways he was able to accomplish that was by bringing in a ringer from President Joe Biden’s DOJ named Matthew Colangelo to head up the prosecution. Colangelo was ridiculously overqualified for the job and was currently the third-ranking official at the Department of Justice, yet he demoted himself to Bragg’s office to try to bag Trump.\n\n“It’s the rough equivalent of like a four-star general in the army, quitting his job and enlisting in the National Guard as a private,” said Will Scharf, one of Trump’s attorneys and the White House staff secretary.\n\nTo state the obvious, this is highly suspicious. The timing of Colangelo’s announcement that he would be leaving the DOJ occurred immediately after the Democrats lost their majority in the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections, which I believe adds to the likelihood he was on a political mission. The Democrats investigative power would be deeply curtailed with the new congress, and things like the J6 committee would end. It was perfect timing for them to ramp up prosecutions of Trump.\n\nTo this day, Biden has maintained that there was no coordination across the multiple prosecutions and the federal government. Given Colangelo’s presence in Manhattan, this strains credulity and ought to be investigated.\n\nThis was an incredibly weak case on its merits, yet it yielded a conviction thanks to Bragg and Colangelo.\n\nTHE GEORGIA RICO CASE\n\nNathan Wade and Fani Willis: On November 18, right around when Colangelo would have put in his two weeks notice to the DOJ, Nathan Wade, prosecutor for and boyfriend of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, was at the White House meeting with counsel for eight hours.\n\nWhy was Nathan Wade at the White House?\n\nWade was a family law attorney—that means his area of law is divorces and prenuptial agreements—with no prosecution experience. He was appointed by Willis without any checks or oversight that would have questioned his qualifications. He had zero background in RICO law, the most relevant area of the law for Willis’s prosecution. In fact, he admitted that he had to study up on it.\n\nFani Willis herself reportedly had a five-hour meeting at the White House with Vice President Kamala Harris months before the indictment. The meeting occurred on February 28, 2023, months after Wade’s meetings but months before the August indictment.\n\nHow did Nathan Wade get on this case? What was discussed during these White House visits? The public should have answers to these questions.\n\nJeff DiSantis: DiSantis was poised to be the Matthew Colangelo of the Georgia RICO case, the wringer brought back from Washington to try to win the case. Sources told Breitbart News that DiSantis was tasked as liaison between the White House and the Willis office. He was the Democrat establishment’s political operative trying to cause problems for Trump at Fani Willis’s DA office.\n\nTHE JACK SMITH CASES\n\nLisa Monaco, Vanita Gupta, and Merrick Garland: U.S. Attorney General Garland appointed the deeply partisan Jack Smith to an unconstitutional job as Special Counsel, which lead to 18 months of harassment of Trump in the middle of campaign season. This was blatant extra-legal election meddling.\n\nWhile AG Garland had a reputation for being a mild-mannered and likable professional, his top two deputies at the DOJ, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, had reputations for far-left activism.\n\nMonaco, a reliable Biden-world crony, became deputy attorney general overseeing Trump and J6 cases. Previously, she served in Obama’s White House and at Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s shadowy consulting firm WestExec. Monaco is also close with Andrew Weissmann, to the point that President Trump told me, “Weissmann is her boss,” referring to the Trump-deranged former general counsel at the FBI and top official for then–Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nGupta, upon being tapped as Biden’s number three at the DOJ, felt compelled to issue a face-saving apology for past “harsh rhetoric” toward conservatives. She has a record of cracking down on peaceful Christian pro-lifers and ignoring violent pro-abortion militants.\n\nI spoke to Trump several times about his ongoing legal battles throughout the 2024 election cycle, and he pointed the finger directly at Monaco. “Lisa Monaco, she’s really running the Justice Department, rather viciously and rather illegally, and that will be found out over the next year and a half, I predict,” Trump told me in January 2024.\n\nOccam’s razor suggests that it was Monaco and Gupta who were the likely masterminds of the Biden DOJ’s lawfare against Trump.\n\nMerrick Garland, Lisa Monaco, and Vanita Gupta interfered in our democracy when they unconstitutionally appointed Jack Smith.\n\nAndrew Weissmann: Interestingly, Trump theorized in conversation that even above Monaco in the actual hierarchy of Biden’s DOJ is Andrew Weissmann. The MSNBC contributor and lawfare architect who took a star turn as a top official in Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation into Trump appears in several chapters of Breaking the Law. If there is lawfare going on against Trump, it’s a safe bet that Weissmann has coordinated it, praised it on TV, or both. Let’s figure out what he knows and the extent of his involvement in the election interference.\n\nTHE TISH JAMES CASE\n\nAllison Greenfield: Greenfield was Judge Arthur Engoron’s top clerk when he presided over Tish James’s civil fraud case against Trump. We reported at Breitbart News that she had donated to Democrat candidates in amounts exceeding New York State ethics rules. (There is no clear evidence that she was ever disciplined following the complaint, though Greenfield never denied making the donations.) Trump, who refers to her as Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s “girlfriend,” believed she was the driving force behind the whole trial. Let’s find out.\n\nAnd finally…\n\nJoe Biden: The Joe Biden White House orchestrated the lawfare against President Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2024 election, hoping to jail or bankrupt the Republican standard bearer in order to prevent him from becoming president of the United States. The fact-pattern that I establish in Breaking the Law makes that clear. The effort to rig the race by engaging in an unprecedented level of coordination across branches of government and Democrat power structures was clearly orchestrated within the Biden White House itself.\n\nHow extensive was the White House’s efforts? Who was truly calling the shots?\n\nLet’s ask Joe Biden.\n\nThat is just a partial list of bad actors I identified in Breaking the Law. None have been held to account for any wrongs. Perhaps they acted more above-board than I suspect, and investigations could clear their names.\n\nThough, if any of them did break the law in a political pursuit of destroying Donald Trump and his movement, they ought to face justice.\n\nThis article was adapted from portions of Breaking the Law.\n\nBreaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, which has been hailed by President Trump as a “must read” book, is available in hardcover, eReader format, and as an audiobook read by the author himself.\n\nAlex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, and the host of “The Alex Marlow Show” podcast produced weekdays by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

Carrell.\n\nFirst, there is nothing we are asking for President Trump to do that has not already been done. There is nothing we are asking President Trump to do that is not already supported by existing laws and our U.S. Constitution. Three previous presidents – Hoover, Truman and Eisenhower – already used their Executive Authority to remove millions of illegal aliens from our nation.\n\nSecond, let’s be crystal clear on the correct number of illegal aliens living in America today. The number is shocking, but it is based on factual truth. A Yale/MIT demographic study was released in 2019. This study’s data was run through an algorithm 1 million times and concluded there were 22 million illegal aliens inside our nation (before Biden took office).\n\nBased on Border Agent J.J. Carrell’s 24 years of experience on the border, and through extensive research, we believe the real number of illegal aliens allowed into America under Biden was 25 to 30 million. \n\nSo, it is a fact that as many as 50 million illegal aliens live in America. That equates to over one in six residents of the USA.\n\nThis is a demographic time bomb that is ready to explode, right in time for the 2030 census. It is also a time bomb when it comes to violent crime, gangs, drugs, homelessness, organized retail theft, overcrowded public schools, overwhelmed health care system, the explosion of spending and debt, and the introduction of third-world disease into America.\n\nIn short, this third-world invasion is turning America into a third-world craphole.\n\nHere are the immediate Top 10 actions designed by the combined team of Wayne Allyn Root and J.J. Carrell to successfully and quickly deport 50 million illegal aliens:\n\n1. Appoint a military general with war-time experience to create a plan to detain and deport every illegal alien. This plan will oversee the following actions:\n\nA) Build, maintain and staff detention facilities across the southwest border.\n\nB) Military and DHS personnel (including retired military and border agents) will be cross-designated as Immigration Judges that will process cases 24/7 throughout the southwest detention facilities.\n\nC) Coordinate deportation flights, trains and buses to transport illegal aliens out of our nation.\n\nD) Military special forces and other elite military units will be assigned to CBP officers and agents to provide protection and be granted authorization to arrest individuals under immigration law. \n\n2. Cross-designate and deputize state and local police and sheriffs across America to locate, arrest and turn over illegal aliens to CBP Officers.\n\n3. Hire retired military soldiers, retired state and local police, and retired Border Patrol agents. This will immediately increase the immigration law enforcement force by thousands of ready-to-work professional LEOs (law enforcement officers who are certified to carry firearms over state lines).\n\n4. Make it so difficult to live, work and move in the United States of America for illegal aliens that they self-deport in the millions.\n\nA) Enforce E-Verify, so no illegal alien can work.\n\nB) Require Real ID to ensure noncitizens cannot function in America anymore.\n\nC) All welfare, food stamps, free health care and public-school benefits for illegal aliens are banned permanently.\n\nD) Any sanctuary state, city or county immediately loses all federal funding.\n\nE) Worksite enforcement is increased nationwide – to include heavy fines for first-time offenders, but for multiple repeat offenses, the offending businesses will be shut down.\n\n* With one caveat – businesses like hotels, restaurants, farms and agriculture will have a one-year phase-in period to terminate all their noncitizen employees and replace them with U.S. citizens. But this period will end while President Trump is still in office, and therefore will be strictly enforced. \n\n5. To make this ban of illegal alien employees work, all these foreign workers will have to be replaced by U.S. citizens. To accomplish that goal, every U.S. citizen must be required to get a job, or lose all welfare benefits. This new pool of legal U.S. citizens will fill the jobs of illegal aliens.\n\n6. We need to tax remittance monies sent outside the USA at rates so high, as to make sending the monies no longer feasible.\n\n7. The GOP-controlled Congress must pass voter photo ID (including photo and thumbprint – exactly like Mexico uses for elections) for federal elections, and an additional voting law demanding proof of citizenship for federal elections.\n\n8. President Trump must use Executive Action to institute “Census Security Reform” that permanently bans the counting of noncitizens.\n\n9. Self-deportation will save America hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, versus carrying out forced deportation. We recommend President Trump offer a generous $5,000 bonus to each illegal who self-deports. \n\nThis $5,000 bonus is a BARGAIN to force every possible illegal alien to pick up and leave, compared to the onerous cost of paying for them in the USA (including welfare, health care and public schools, we might pay $100,000+ per year). Over time, we will save trillions of dollars by paying them to leave.\n\n10. Finally, we point out that an invasion of 50 million foreigners – including MS-13, Tren de Aragua, Hamas, Hezbollah and Chinese military-age males – is absolutely positively a NATIONAL EMERGENCY. \n\nTherefore, President Trump must publicly announce that this border invasion is now officially declared a national emergency. \n\nDeclare that Joe Biden, Border Czar Kamala Harris and HHS Chief Alejandro Mayorkas committed treason by opening the borders and welcoming in tens of millions of foreign invaders. As a result, the Trump DOJ will prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nThat’s our Top 10 list of ways to efficiently and quickly deport 50 million illegal aliens. \n\nWe implore President Trump to begin to take actions – like the U.S. military involvement we recommend above – that reflect the implications of this national emergency combined with a demographic time bomb.","summary":"'This third-world invasion is turning America into a third-world craphole'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/08/top-10-ways-deport-all-50-million-illegal/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dog-costa-rican-police-immigrants-criminals-kristi-noem-dhs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 21:29:03","author":"Wayne Allyn Root","authors":["Wayne Allyn Root"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":349829648,"title":"Why the Democrats are in such a terrible state","text":"Ever since Donald Trump was reelected president last November, winning the Electoral College and the popular vote (the first time a Republican has done so since 2004), the Democratic Party has been battered by bad news:\n\n– Voter demographics Democrats have traditionally been able to rely on swung heavily Republican in 2024, including Hispanics, blacks and men (particularly young men).\n\n– Polls show record-low public support for the Democrats; the Wall Street Journal reported last month that 63% of registered voters polled said the party was “out of touch” with the concerns of everyday Americans.\n\n– 2024 Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ upcoming book “107 Days” is already being savaged in the press. The woman struggled to speak coherently or identify anything of substance she achieved during her four years as vice president; why should anyone care about whatever she says now?\n\nEven the “good” news is bad. Which Democrat is getting accolades at the moment? Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat running as a socialist for mayor of New York City. Mamdani is the stereotypical collectivist: charismatic and well-educated but appallingly ignorant of history, and 100% hypocritical; he wants to “defund” the police, create government-owned grocery stores and abolish private property. Meanwhile, Mamdani recently married in an extravagant ceremony on his wealthy family’s posh estate in Uganda, protected by heavily armed guards.\n\nThis is apparently the Next Big Thing for the Democrats. Good luck with that.\n\nWhy are the Democrats floundering so badly? There are a number of reasons, all interrelated:\n\nFirst and foremost, the Democrats have held too much power across too many industries (politics, the media, the entertainment industry, academia) for too long.\n\nAs often happens, they abused that power: manipulating the electoral process, weaponizing the justice system to go after political opponents, censoring dissenting voices in traditional and social media, poisoning education and entertainment with “woke” garbage, and lying to the public.\n\nThey also co-opted the structure and operations of countless charities and nongovernmental organizations, raking in donations and spending billions of taxpayer dollars to fund policies and programs – at home and abroad – that Americans would not have supported, had there been any public oversight.\n\nThey have been protected in all of this by the very people and institutions that should have been holding them accountable and exposing corruption – the press. Our legacy media, however – which also lean leftward – have become so assured of their own moral superiority that they were more than willing to ignore or cheer on violations of America’s most deeply held principles, as long as those violations were committed by Democrats.\n\nDemocrats became arrogant and elitist, thinking themselves untouchable.\n\nIn 2008, the Democratic Party chose Barack Obama, a man whose past was cloudy – and in some cases, deliberately obscured – as their presidential candidate, and they won. Twice. Fresh off those victories, Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016, confident that she could win despite a background that was known to be riddled with evidence of bribery, corruption, self-interest and deceit.\n\nInstead of taking Trump’s surprise victory in 2016 as a wake-up call, Democrats doubled down on their corrupt practices, which included lying to a federal court, illegal surveillance of Trump’s campaign and administration, false accusations against Trump of collusion with Russia and a $32 million boondoggle “investigation” of those false accusations.\n\nIn fact, Democrats were so overconfident about their control of the entire political and legal processes that their 2020 presidential nominee was Joe Biden, who was already in the throes of dementia. And in 2024, they removed him just a few months before the election, and installed Harris, perhaps the most inept and vapid candidate in the history of American politics.\n\nAt the rate they were going, their 2028 candidate would be a cardboard cutout. Or a corpse.\n\nEven as the Democratic Party became more flagrantly corrupt, they were losing some of their most visible members; people like former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, now Trump’s director of national intelligence; attorney and activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s secretary of health and human services; journalists Glenn Greenwald, Bari Weiss and Matt Taibbi; activists and authors Michael Shellenberger and Dr. Naomi Wolf; academic Bret Weinstein and many others. As a consequence, the party now finds itself dominated by unprincipled opportunists easily bought by the highest bidder, people too ignorant to have any convictions, and extremists whose outrageous positions are opposed by a majority of Americans, regardless of political persuasion.\n\nEven now, as detailed information about rampant Democratic Party scandals is released on a daily basis, those involved are no doubt confident that they will never be indicted; if indicted, not prosecuted; if prosecuted, not convicted; if convicted, pardoned.\n\nAfter all, that’s the way it’s worked for decades, right?\n\nThis is not to lay all the blame at the feet of Democrats. To the contrary, they have been aided and abetted by Republicans, some of whom so desperately crave press approval that they capitulate on every important issue. Others share the elitist presumptions that they should control every aspect of Americans’ lives. And then there are those in the pockets of lobbyists shilling for clients who want “regime change,” cheap labor provided by illegal immigrants, or trade policies that cripple American manufacturing and destroy jobs.\n\nTrump has not only exploited the widespread dissatisfaction conservative Americans had for establishment Republicans; he has left the RINO wing of the GOP (which was, at least at the national level, most of it) politically neutered.\n\nWhat has become crystal clear, post-Trump, is that Americans have not had a president – Republican or Democrat – who was truly looking out for American interests, for decades. At least since Ronald Reagan (who, it must be remembered, was never supposed to get the 1980 Republican nomination, and had deep-state operative and former CIA chief George H.W. Bush forced on him as vice president).\n\nPlenty of left-leaning commentators, watching Trump’s MAGA movement make mincemeat of the Republican Party establishment, warned – wrongly, as it turned out – that the GOP was dead. More astute observers (and they were few) recognized that the RINO stables were simply being mucked out, and that it was the Democrats who were headed toward a cliff – which they appear to be determined to hurl themselves headlong over.\n\nIronically, Democrats’ current predicament could have been avoided had there been any reasonable checks on their power. As it is, the Democratic Party is collapsing in a cesspool of its own creation.","summary":"'As often happens, they abused power: manipulating the electoral process, weaponizing the justice system'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/08/why-democrats-are-such-terrible-state/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/zohran-mamdani-20250730-disappointed-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 21:26:45","author":"Laura Hollis","authors":["Laura Hollis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":349669032,"title":"LIFE:  How to make the Trump revolution permanent and save America","text":"Special to WorldTribune.com\n\nCommentary by Wayne Allyn Root, August 8, 2025\n\nFirst, let me start by pointing out that President Donald Trump keeps having “the best week ever” every week!\n\nHow great are things going for President Trump nowadays?\n\n— Trump-hating HBO TV host Bill Maher is apologizing and admitting he was wrong about Trump’s tariffs.\n\n— Trump-hating New York Times columnist Bret Stephens admits Trump is having more success than he ever imagined possible.\n\n— Trump-hating liberal TV host Chris Cuomo just gave Trump a grade of “A” for the start of his presidency.\n\n— And CNBC’s liberal TV host Jim Cramer was so shocked when he heard about Trump’s trillion-dollar EU trade victory that he dropped the F-bomb on live television.\n\nIf voter photo ID isn’t passed before the 2026 midterms, then the GOP has no interest in winning elections. Period.\n\nThings are THAT good!\n\nTrump has now blown by Ronald Reagan to become the most successful and consequential conservative president of all-time.\n\nBut as wonderful and fantastic as all this Trump success is, it won’t guarantee GOP control of the U.S. government for years to come — simply because Democrats cheat, rig and steal elections.\n\nIf Trump wants to be remembered as the greatest president ever, and the president who made America great again, he needs to set the GOP up to win for years to come, if not decades to come, and make his achievements permanent, and his legacy lasting. Here is the way to do it:\n\n1. PASS VOTER PHOTO ID FOR ALL FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\nThis is how the ball was dropped the last time Trump was president. The GOP Congress had the ability to pass anything they wanted from 2016 to 2018. Yet they never passed voter photo ID for all federal elections. That was the missed opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nThat was why the GOP lost the midterms in 2018 and then Trump lost the 2020 presidential election. Democrats stole both elections with mail-in ballots, ballot harvesting and ballot drop boxes. They beat us with fake ballots, all built around no voter ID.\n\nAnd so far, the GOP is repeating the same mistake. This GOP Congress can pass anything it wants for another 18 months.\n\nIf voter photo ID isn’t passed before the 2026 midterms, then the GOP has no interest in winning elections. Period.\n\n2. PASS CENSUS REFORM THAT PERMANENTLY BANS THE COUNTING OF NONCITIZENS.\n\nThis is another way Democrats are stealing elections. They count millions of illegal aliens for the census, thereby awarding dozens of extra congressional seats and electoral votes to blue districts and blue states — all based on counting people who illegally broke into our country, and don’t belong here.\n\nThis is how Democrats are stealing elections, stealing billions in federal funding, and stealing our entire country.\n\nNot only should we be banning illegals from being counted for the census, but President Trump should immediately order a new census because the current one is a complete fraud based on counting noncitizens. With a new census, based only on a count of U.S. citizens, Democrats would lose 30 to 50 U.S. House seats and dozens of electoral votes.\n\n3. DEMAND PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP FOR VOTING IN FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\nYes, Trump already issued an executive order for this, but executive orders only last as long as the GOP controls the White House. If the next president is a crazy, radical communist like Barack Obama or Kamala Harris, or a brain-dead puppet like Joe Biden (who is controlled by crazy, radical communists), all of Trump’s EOs are reversed.\n\nBut presidents can’t reverse a law passed by Congress.\n\nWhy would the GOP Congress hesitate to pass this law banning noncitizens from voting? This is the way to stop massive Democrat voter fraud that steals seats from the GOP.\n\nAs wonderful and fantastic as all this Trump success is, it won’t guarantee GOP control of the U.S. government for years to come — simply because Democrats cheat, rig and steal elections.\n\nRight now, with control of both Houses of Congress, the GOP can pass this law. But if we lose the midterms, the opportunity is gone forever. And of course, passing this law and voter ID is the way to guarantee we win the midterms.\n\n4. PROSECUTE OBAMA, HILLARY, BRENNAN, CLAPPER, COMEY, MCCABE AND ALL OTHER KEY FIGURES FOR TREASON, FOR THEIR ROLES IN RUSSIAGATE (AND GEORGE SOROS FOR FUNDING IT ALL).\n\nThis was treason. We don’t have a nation of laws moving forward if any politician can commit treason and be given a free pass. All 77 million Trump voters demand justice. You want to excite and motivate all 77 million Trump voters to come to the polls for the midterms? Indict Obama and Hillary Clinton and watch the greatest GOP landslide victory ever.\n\n5. PASS PRESIDENT TRUMP’S CAMPAIGN PLEDGE OF “NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR SENIORS.”\n\nThis idea was my creation. I’ve been fighting for it, and lobbying for it, and shouting from the highest mountaintops for it, for a decade. I wrote about it in the spring of 2024, sent it to President Trump, and Trump adopted it during his presidential campaign.\n\nThe Big Beautiful Bill included a new $6,000 tax deduction for seniors, but it’s not a replacement for “No Tax on Social Security for Seniors.” Congress could not include this idea in the “Big Beautiful Bill”- because by law there can be no changes to Social Security in a reconciliation bill.\n\nThere are over 60 million seniors in America. Seniors vote in the highest percentage of any group in America. If the GOP wants to win elections, pass this law before the midterms. The GOP will lock up the senior vote for decades to come.\n\nThose are my “Big 5” that will result in not only GOP landslides in 2026 and 2028 but permanent GOP majority control of the United States federal government.\n\nPresident Trump has checked a record number of boxes, but this, my friends, is a CHECKMATE.\n\nWayne Allyn Root recently published “The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.” He is host of the nationally syndicated “Wayne Allyn Root: Raw & Unfiltered” on USA Radio Network, daily from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST.\n\n LIFE: How to make the Trump revolution permanent and save America\n\nLIFE: How to make the Trump revolution permanent and save America added by Editor One on August 9, 2025\n\nView all posts by Editor One →","summary":"LIFE Special to WorldTribune.com Commentary by Wayne Allyn Root, August 8, 2025 First, let me start by pointing out that President Donald Trump keeps having &#8220;the best week ever&#8221; every week!

Toni Atkins.\n\nAtkins held her first show of force in the race on Saturday since former Vice President Kamala Harris’ announcement to not join the race, with supporters packing into a new campaign headquarters in Mission Hills near the airport. Those in attendance were a who’s-who of local politics, from Mayor Todd Gloria to Supervisor Paloma Aguirre and Sheriff Kelly Martinez.\n\n“As we plant our roots even deeper here in San Diego, a place that made me who I am, I’m thrilled to share what’s next for this campaign,” Atkins told the crowd of supporters. “It’s not just a campaign headquarters, it’s the heartbeat of a movement.”\n\nIn recent weeks, two major shakeups have hit the already crowded contest for the state’s top job.\n\nLast month, Harris declined to enter the race, removing a blockbuster contender whose massive name recognition was far stronger than any rivals.\n\nAnd just on Friday, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis withdrew from the race, thinning the field even more. Kounalakis has said she now plans to run for state treasurer.\n\nThose developments have set up a wide open field of Democrats jockeying for an edge in the lead-up to a primary next June.\n\n“I believe experience matters,” Atkins said in an interview, noting her time as state Assembly speaker and president pro tempore of the state Senate.\n\n“I’ve represented this area for almost 30 years in one way or another,” she said. “The relationships are deep, and so I intend to make this the base.”\n\nAn elected official for decades, Atkins has fortified support for her bid in the San Diego area and is now looking to expand it throughout California in the months ahead. To raise her profile and meet voters elsewhere in the state, Atkins will embark on a statewide tour later this month, trekking from Red Bluff in Northern California down to Riverside.\n\n“This isn’t just the most qualified person this time,” U.S. Rep. Scott Peters said of Atkins. “This is the most qualified person in a long time.”\n\nThe crux of Atkins’ bid, Peters noted, was how to raise the profile of someone who’s already been at the top of state government for so long.\n\n“The challenge is she’s been pretty quiet,” he said of Atkin’s time in politics. “All we have to do is get that word out.”\n\nWhere’s the polling and money?\n\nPolling this early in the race has been scattershot. But with Harris officially out, where the field stands has come into sharper focus.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Katie Porter has seen the biggest bump since Harris backed away from the governor’s race, with support at 18% this month compared to 12% in April, according to a recent poll from Emerson College. But Porter has been dealt a loss recently at the state level, coming in third in last year’s U.S. Senate race.\n\nAt Saturday’s event, Peters worked in an overt dig at his former colleague in the state congressional delegation, who’s known for displaying whiteboards during committee hearings to illustrate her points.\n\n“People can be very eloquent with their whiteboards,” Peters said. “People can make a show on TV. But this is a job interview, okay?”\n\nEven so, Emerson’s poll shows a high percentage of voters remain on the sidelines, with 38% undecided and 5% listing someone else as their preference.\n\nOther Democrats involved in the race are polling in the single digits, including former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, billionaire Rick Caruso and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.\n\nAtkins is among them, with about 2% support, according to the poll.\n\nFor the Republicans, Fox News host Steve Hilton stands at 12% compared to 7% support for Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco.\n\nOn the fundraising front, Atkins has the most cash on hand of all the Democrats currently running.\n\nAccording to campaign finance disclosures, Atkins has $4.3 million in her campaign coffers. Villaraigosa has the second most with $3.4 million, while Porter has $2 million and Becerra has $2.1 million, according to disclosures.","summary":"On Saturday, Atkins held her first show of force in the governor's race, with supporters packing into a new campaign headquarters in Mission Hills","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/08/09/after-harris-shake-up-heres-where-san-diegos-toni-atkins-stands-in-wide-open-california-governors-race/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SUT-L-Toni-Atkins-001.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 19:25:48","author":"Lucas Robinson","authors":["Lucas Robinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.348},{"id":349723874,"title":"Deepfakes pose an obvious peril in politics, but Californias bans amount to censorship","text":"A few weeks ago, a video popped up on YouTube, purporting to be a verbal clash between Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, and Gov. Gavin Newsom during a congressional hearing.\n\nThe video claimed that Hawley cleaned Newsom’s clock in their debate over a lawsuit that Newsom had filed. The problem is it was fake, created with video snippets of both politicians and a voiceover describing what supposedly happened.\n\nThe video, which has since vanished from YouTube, is a fairly crude example of how technology can be manipulated to depict seemingly real events.\n\nMore sophisticated examples of artificial intelligence, known as deepfakes, can literally put words in political figures’ mouths or even create seemingly real persons.\n\nLast year, Christopher Kohls, going by the name “Mr. Reagan” on social media, posted a video in which Kamala Harris seemingly acknowledged that she had been the “ultimate diversity hire” when Joe Biden chose her as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nKohls said it was a parody, but Elon Musk posted it on his social media platform X, drawing criticism from Newsom and a vow to outlaw such material. It was one of many clashes with Musk, the billionaire electric car and rocket tycoon, after he became a Donald Trump ally.\n\nWithin weeks, Newsom signed two bills aimed at either regulating or banning AI-generated political videos. Kohl, later joined by other content creators, sued, contending that they violate free speech.\n\nThis week John Mendez, a federal judge in Sacramento, struck down one of the measures, Assembly Bill 2655, carried by Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat. He ruled that the federal Communications Decency Act protects X and other sites from liability for material posted by third parties, such as Kohl or Musk.\n\nAB 2655 would have barred internet sites from posting deceptive political material during campaign seasons. “They don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to,” Mendez said.\n\nNotably, Mendez indicated that he will also reject the second measure, Assembly Bill 2839, carried by Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat. It would prohibit anyone from “knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election communication … that contains certain materially deceptive content.”\n\n“I think the statute just fails miserably in accomplishing what it would like to do,” Mendez said, adding “It’s become a censorship law and there is no way that is going to survive.”\n\nAs the country’s political polarization deepens, voters become more willing to believe allegations that those on the other side of the divide are evil, corrupt and power hungry. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence makes political deepfakes ever more sophisticated and capable of fooling gullible voters into believing their lies.\n\nExaggeration, selective facts and downright lies have always been evident in political campaigns, but historically held in check, at least partially, by newspapers and other political media.\n\nThe bills that Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor enacted last year were clearly aimed at crippling media on the other side of the ideological divide but, as Judge Mendez ruled, violate free speech.\n\nCensorship cannot be the answer. The approach that Newsom and legislators took is a slippery slope that would invite retaliation from their political rivals, thus deepening the already yawning political divide.\n\nIt is, however, a genuine quandary. Unfettered use of AI-driven deepfakes in political campaigns present an obvious peril, but so does any effort to prohibit free speech, no matter how distasteful.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Deepfakes pose an obvious peril in politics, but Californias bans amount to censorship","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/08/07/deepfakes-pose-an-obvious-peril-in-politics-but-californias-bans-amount-to-censorship/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/California_Legislature-Sex_Trafficking_12021_9f84f7.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 18:43:56","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":349777246,"title":"When The Revolution Comes","text":"To the Editor:\n\nIt’s a familiar cry for those of us who lived through the turmoil of the ’60s. Great things will happen “when the revolution comes.” One reason the revolution never came was money. The people in the street lacked the cash and time it would take to build a unified political machine!\n\nOn the other hand, for Kevin Roberts and the folks at the Heritage Foundation, time and money have been no object. Years of planning and billions of dollars have been invested in “2025,” and it is quite well documented who the biggest contributors are. All of which led Roberts to arrogantly boast: “We are in the process of the Second American Revolution which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.”\n\nTranslated, Robert’s proclamation is a double dare suggesting any attempt to stop their machine will lead to bloodshed. So far, they’ve been very lucky. The so called “left” has remained docile and distracted, content to whine and finger-point at each other rather than fight.\n\nThe biggest distractor, of course, is extortioner-in-chief Donald Trump. He’s been incredibly successful at drawing attention away from the folks behind the curtain. But it’s not Uncle Don’s machine, and if he screws it up he could be out the door quicker than you can say “Epstein Maxwell Syndrome.”\n\nIf Democrats hope to defeat the 2025 MAGA machine, I’d suggest beginning by ignoring Donald Trump completely. He loves our attention, good and bad, and he sucks it up like a sponge. Instead, shine a bright white light on the people who hate public exposure more than anything—the corporate sponsors of the Second American Revolution.\n\nRick Littlefield\n\nBarrington, N.H.\n\nThank you for bringing up that “arrogant boast” by the architect of “the Second American Revolution.” It is truly a remarkable statement.\n\nStrip out the euphemism and Roberts is saying, “We are overthrowing the government established 236 years ago under the U.S. Constitution.” Decode the false reversal of agency, and he’s adding, “We’ll kill anyone who tries to stop us.”\n\nYou’re right about Trump. He is, indeed, not much more than an unusually skillful—and, so far, lucky—carnival barker. If his luck, and ours, changes, and the pitchfork-and-torches mob decide he’s as guilty as Epstein, perhaps he himself will end up in Alcatraz. After enduring the endless grotesqueries of the past decade, Americans who were never part of his cult deserve to see such a denoument.\n\nThis project has been under way since the infamous Powell Memorandum* of 1971. Disgusted by the post-war prosperity of the white middle class, the wealthy mobilized to take it all back, and reduce everyone else to wage slavery.\n\nYour suggestion is excellent. Corporations are backing this evil scheme. They need to be exposed, shamed, and boycotted.\n\nTrump vs. the First Freedom\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn canceling “The Late Show” with Stephen Colbert, CBS has decided to cater to the White House and refrain from any form of criticism of the President. One of the significant advantages of living in the United States is the freedom of speech and the press.\n\nIn a speech to Congress, President Franklin Roosevelt emphasized the Four Freedoms: “The first is freedom of speech and expression—everywhere in the world. The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world. The third is freedom from want—which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants—everywhere in the world. The fourth is freedom from fear—which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor—anywhere in the world.”\n\nOver the last six months, the nation has witnessed horror that we have only imagined in our nightmares. Stephen Colbert used his platform to give us a sense of humor and levity at this hour. And Colbert, as true to form, spoke truth to power. CBS deemed the cancellation a “financial decision.” I beg to differ. After the announcement, President Trump hailed the decision and used the powers of the office to take a swipe at Colbert. Colbert then took a swipe at the President in classic fashion. In canceling The Late Show, CBS has decided to silence Colbert and to keep the President happy.\n\nPresident Trump has decided to take a wrecking ball to all our freedoms, thus eroding the principles that President Roosevelt echoed in his speech to Congress in 1941. Readers may disagree with this statement, but this is a warning to the reader, and perhaps to the world.\n\nAidan J. Bain\n\nElma, New York\n\nTo add a little context, shortly before the 2024 election, candidate Donald Trump filed a ludicrous $10 billion lawsuit against Paramount—the fictitious “corporate person” who owns CBS—claiming that CBS’s show “60 Minutes” had deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris, so as to favor the Democratic candidate. After his inauguration, the Whiny-Baby-in-Chief jacked up his already-ludicrous demand to $20 billion.\n\nLast month, in a capitulation that will go down in infamy, in exchange for Trump dropping the suit, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to the Trump Presidential Library. Perhaps some gold toilet will bear their logo, rendered with Swarovski crystals. This shameful episode suggests that even the most successful mafia extortionists were really just a bunch of pikers.\n\nParamount execs will write off the $16 million as just another minor cost of doing business, as they pocket their share of the pending $8.4 billion merger with Skydance, now made possible by this “non-bribe”. At its essence, this is the theft of a public good for private gain. As such, it’s just the most recent example in a long line, going back to the land enclosures in the time of the Tudors.\n\nSo Many Questions\n\nDear Editor:\n\nWhen you do not like the message, fire the messenger. That’s how Trump responds to bad information. When the jobs number for July came in 42,000 fewer than expected and the numbers for May were revised to 19,00 from 144,000 and June from 147,000 to14,000, and hiring in manufacturing fell to a 9-year low in May, Trump predictably fired the commissioner of labor statistics. (Fox Business, August 1, 2025) Unfortunately, firing the messenger is not going to change the reality that the economy is suffering as a result of Trump’s trade policy and assault on immigrants.\n\nIn another very questionable move, Ghislaine Maxwell, the Epstein children recruiter, who is serving a 20 year sentence for sex trafficking, was secretly moved from a maximum-security prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. According to NBC News, “The Bureau of Prisons own designation policy makes Maxwell ineligible for transfer to a minimum-security prison because she is a convicted sex offender.” This raises serious questions as to why Ms. Maxwell was given this questionable transfer now, and who authorized this transfer and why?\n\nAlso of interest is that on August 1, 2025, Bloomberg reported that a FBI FOIA team redacted Trump’s name and the names of other prominent public figures from the Epstein documents. While the Republican House quickly decided to leave town early to avoid a vote on the release of the Epstein files, the problem is not going away. We need to know who was involved with Epstein regardless of who they are.\n\nRich DiPentima\n\nPortsmouth, N.H.\n\nIt’s all part of Steve Bannon’s “flood the zone” plan. Distract people from your previous sordid transgressions by committing weird, spectacular, revolting new ones.\n\nThe tragic and shameful thing is that this could all be stopped by a critical mass of Republicans in Congress. But they would have to muster up some courage and put their country before their careers.\n\nWhat are the odds of that? You might as well buy a lottery ticket.\n\nIsrael is Starving Children in Gaza\n\nTo the editor:\n\nThere are children in Gaza who look like those rescued from Dachau and Auschwitz. They are not starving because Hamas is stealing food, they are starving because Israel prevented food from entering Gaza for three months and now has made food distribution centers a shooting gallery. This is a conscious act of genocide by descendants of a genocide.\n\nUnfortunately, many in the diaspora continue to support Israel’s actions. Justifying starving, killing and forcing others they do not like into ghettos when their group is in the majority, encourages others to feel justified doing it to you when they are in the majority.\n\nIn my opinion the diaspora needs to say they stand behind Israel, but not Israel’s current government. More than half of Israelis are doing this. It is time to join them.\n\nWalter Hamilton\n\nPortsmouth, N.H.\n\nExactly. What’s more, a U.S. government with any pretense of morality would have shut off the military aid long ago.\n\nRecognize the Humanity of Palestinians\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nOn October 2, 2024, a group of 99 U.S. medical professionals who volunteered in Gaza sent an urgent letter to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. They witnessed malnutrition in mothers resulting in miscarriages and underweight newborns. Daily they saw babies starving to death because their mothers were too malnourished to breastfeed and there was no formula or clean water.\n\nMoreover, on November 21, 2024 the International Criminal Court [ICC] asserted that there was reasonable evidence to conclude that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had “intentionally and knowingly” deprived civilians in Gaza of food and water, and therefore bore criminal responsibility for using starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nRegarding Gaza, famine expert Alex de Waal explains, “I’ve been working on this topic for more than four decades, and there is no case since World War II of starvation that has been so minutely designed and controlled.”\n\nEight months have passed. Each day brings new images of emaciated children and desperate masses queuing for food. During this period, have U.S. statements and actions protected civilians, or have they shielded our government from accountability and moral urgency?\n\nLaw without universal application is a tool of power, not justice. Recognizing the humanity of Palestinians is not just a moral imperative—it is an act of resistance against the logic of genocide.\n\nTerry Hansen\n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nBiden could and should have stopped this ongoing crime. The evidence was overwhelming, long before that ICC decision, and before that October letter. But apparently there’s some mechanism in the minds of the highly-placed that allows them to overlook certain basic facts; the pertinent fact in this case being that Palestinians are human beings.\n\nCould Trump stop it? He famously lacks the usual internal restraints which govern the rest of us. Maybe if the Palestinians were to make a generous “donation” to the Trump Presidential Library… who are we kidding? How could Trump see the Palestinians as human beings when he’s so dazzled by the potential of their oceanfront real estate?\n\nHeating Cost Double Whammy Coming\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIf you are on a fixed income, you had better be ready for a tough winter. According to a recent news item on WMUR, the Canadian consul general in Boston indicates that, annually, N.H. imports approximately $444 Million in fuel from Canada. With expected tariffs, the cost of home heating oil is bound to rise significantly this winter.\n\nNow, a pending cut in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which supplies assistance for heating, cooling, and weatherizing, will seriously affect the low income households in N.H. The entire staff administering the program at the national level has been fired, and the funding is drastically cut. According to a government source, the cut may be as high as 74 percent.\n\nLIHEAP served approximately 28,000 N.H. households in 2024. During the 2024–2025 winter season, the Community Action Partnership of Strafford County spent more than $3 million to help households in Strafford County with their fuel needs. Many elderly or disabled on fixed incomes receive funds on an emergency basis when they run out of fuel in freezing weather.\n\nFreezing the low income, elderly, and disabled is cruel, particularly when done to extend tax cuts for the rich.\n\nLorraine L. Hansen\n\nRollinsford, N.H.\n\nHold on. Quiet, please. We’re getting a faint transmission from a listening device planted in the living quarters of the White House. It’s a woman’s voice, speaking with a Slovenian accent: “Let them burn MAGA hats.”\n\nA Correction on Henderson’s Point\n\nDear editors,\n\nIn your July 11th 2025 edition, under the history trivia for July 22nd, 60,000 tons of TNT is asserted to have been used to reduce Henderson’s Point, as opposed to the actual amount of 50 tons. Some have said that the Rye N.H. school board feared the Earth would wobble off its axis. In either case, I get an excuse to write and thus thank you for a wonderful newspaper.\n\nLocation Unspecified\n\nDear Admirer:\n\nThank you very much. That particular error has been rectified. Our reservoir of fallibility being inexhaustible, please do keep reading, and correcting our course when we go astray.\n\nABC News Has Gone Downhill\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nABC News with David Muir is the most watched nightly news program for a reason, and it is not a good reason.\n\nOn a recent program, in no particular order, Mr. Muir entertained his audience like a circus impresario with news of the largest great white shark ever tagged in the Atlantic, one of the Menendez brothers suffering from a kidney stone, a drowning on a beach famous for rip tides, a brief life history of Ozzy Osbourne, king of heavy metal, a Delta Airlines jet nearly getting clobbered by an AeroMexico jet landing on the same runway over top of it, the killer Brian Kohberger’s possible prison destination, Trump accusing Obama of treason, and Billy Joel looking through the window of a New York City pedicab to the delight of two of his fans.\n\nAll of this deliciousness took the place of what might have been serious news analysis of, for example, what’s going on in state legislatures, the demise of judicial independence, America’s new tariff imperialism, the insufferable destruction of life in Gaza. But, alas, not to be.\n\nKimball Shinkoskey\n\nWoods Cross, Utah\n\nWhat the heck? You’re asking a lot, here. Considering the ownership, you’re lucky Muir isn’t wearing a Mickey Mouse hat.\n\nBursting the Affordable Housing Bubble in Portsmouth\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nLet’s stop perpetuating the myth that Portsmouth can create affordable housing for anyone who wants to live in Portsmouth.\n\nIt is important to know that there is no legal definition for “affordable housing.” There is only “market-rate” housing (whatever the market can bear), “below market-rate” housing (lower than market-rate) and subsidized senior and income-qualified housing which includes units that Portsmouth Housing Authority builds and operates.\n\nWithin the past two weeks local media has published three pieces about affordable housing. In one piece, Gerry Duffy insists that our city is just not trying hard enough to build affordable housing and pleads with the city to go faster. On the other hand, Alan Forbes states that our city has done more for housing than any other municipality on the Seacoast and expects adjacent towns to increase their housing. Finally, a study presented on July 10th by RKG Associates, the city’s housing consultants, concludes that the incentives provided by the city to developers have been disincentives for building “workforce housing.”\n\nWithin the last 25 years, our city has been flooded with new housing units. (see realtor.com). But as Mr. Forbes points out, almost all units have been market-rate housing.\n\nPortsmouth is a great city to live in. However, just because someone from another town or state wants to live here, does not obligate the citizens of Portsmouth to subsidize their housing.\n\nWe do have a nationwide housing crisis. Developers apparently are not building starter homes anymore. Neither the federal nor the state government has a program to help build homes that most people can afford. Furthermore, Portsmouth, as a municipality in N.H., has very limited ability to provide housing that is affordable even though they are trying.\n\nUnderlying the entire affordability crisis is the fact that wages nationwide have stagnated while housing prices have continued to rise.\n\nThree years after arriving in America as refugees without a penny to our name, my family purchased a home in Pennsylvania that cost approximately the same amount as my father’s yearly income. It was the American dream come true for us. Because of wage stagnation, 65 years later that dream is gone.\n\nWhen neither the State of N.H. nor the federal government is helping to build workforce housing, the only way to build such housing is through a non-profit such as the Portsmouth Housing Authority (PHA). The city provides the property at a very low fee (losing some property tax revenue), so that workforce housing is affordable.\n\nFunding for the project comes from investors who are guaranteed a fixed return for a fixed number of years along with tax benefits. However, residents of such housing only qualify if their incomes are below a certain level. This type of housing is the only type of housing that can guarantee affordable rents in our city. Promises by developers to build below market housing are not enforceable under N.H. law.\n\nSo, faced with these facts, why do city officials and housing champions continue to insist that our city can create more affordable housing? Perhaps, some are just fishing for votes, others may be friends or supporters of developers who offer “height and density” as a solution in our small city and some are just not familiar with the laws and zoning rules in N.H. Our state does not allow control of rent or the price of a home.\n\nI have lived in two U.S. states and three different countries, and have seen four ways to provide affordable housing:\n\n1) Rent stabilization (see NYC).\n\n2) Housing built by states or the federal government controlling rents and home prices.\n\n3) Businesses getting creative and pooling resources to build housing for their employees (e.g. Dartmouth Health in Hanover, Harmony Homes in Dover and Service Credit Union in Portsmouth).\n\n4) Governments providing subsidies to keep rents affordable, or providing matching funds to home-purchase savings programs run by banks.\n\nPeter Somssich\n\nformer N.H. State Representative\n\nPortsmouth, N.H.\n\nThis problem is huge, and it’s only getting worse. The negative consequences are well known, and require no further elaboration from us.\n\nAs for these specific but divergent approaches to solving the problem, we’ll adhere to the old adage that it’s better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt. But we will say this.\n\nFor half a century we’ve heard it preached: the Invisible Hand of the Marketplace is the magical solution to any and all problems. Meanwhile it has relentlessly picked the pockets of people of modest means, while the wealthiest have flittered in their private jets from one glittery mansion to another.\n\nAnother Dissatisfied Reader\n\nDear Editor,\n\nThe last time I wrote to you was to castigate you for ignoring the genocide in Gaza. I think that letter was published, but I didn’t get a chance to see it or your reply since I took ill and spent the next 4 weeks in the hospital.\n\nSo now I have re-upped my subscription and what do I behold: a witty put down of Trump, very witty indeed by Steven Fowle and a bunch of articles on other subjects but nary a word on the continuing slaughter in Gaza in which Israel is now luring starving Palestinians to aid centers and then shooting them down when they appear. They have already murdered 100,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, including 50,000 children killed or injured (UNICEF) and turned Gaza into a smoldering ruin.\n\nThis is also true of the next issue, the current one. Again more advice to the Democrats: get rid of your leadership and pretend once more you’re on the side of workers the better to keep them in a fog as the US commits terrorism such as the recent Iran strike, maintains over 1,000 bases around the world, overthrows governments by cunning or force and gives lip service to gay and human rights while actually violating them every day.\n\nThe evil of Israel and its Israeli Defense Force (IDF) is beyond belief unless you have studied the Nazi Holocaust. Many of the same techniques the Nazis used prior to the extermination camps have been carried out by the self-proclaimed Jewish state with one possible exception: the Nazi troops who carried out exterminations were burdened with what they had done and had to be replaced by more industrial means (like Auschwitz) whereas the reports from Gaza by Israeli papers indicate that the IDF troops revel in shooting children and civilians and, whereas the Nazis kept their atrocities from the German people, the Israeli government does not and has a majority supporting their genocidal acts.\n\nDuring the Nazi Holocaust, Jewish organizations, led or influenced by Zionists, hushed up the Holocaust and prevented it from being widely publicized. The reason: they were in negotiation with the Nazi’s who in return, for their silence, would save the Zionist top leaders and a few thousand Jews who could emigrate to Palestine. The fate of the mass of Jews who were being deported to the camps did not concern them. They acted as agents of Nazi propaganda minimizing the harm being done to European Jewry in every country they were in and sabotaging the international boycott against German goods which had a good chance of putting Hitler out of business before the Holocaust could occur. Thus, when American troops liberated concentration camps, they were amazed at what they found.\n\n No effort was made to bomb the rail lines to the camps with the Jewish “leaders’” assent. They helped prevent immigration to the US and Britain because they wanted all Jews to go to Israel and fight the Arabs, who were the original inhabitants of that land. With this as the only option many Jews rejected going to such a place despite the Hitler threat. Hitler and the Zionists had similar views of the so-called “Jewish problem,” namely that Jews were an excrescence in any country except Israel and had to be deported. When deportation failed, Hitler ordered their extermination.\n\nI was looking at the “Northcountry Chronicle” available on your website. That paper appears to have constant coverage of the genocide in Gaza. Why doesn’t the N.H. Gazette have anywhere near such coverage? Is it so you won’t embarrass the Democratic Party most of whose politicians and officials (not just the DNC) vote to send more and more arms to Israel to be used against the Palestinian people, Lebanon and Iran?\n\nIn the next to last issue you feature a front page article suggesting to the Dems what they must do to save their party, which is in the s***ter. Nowhere does it mention their role in the genocide. In my opinion the Democratic Party should disband itself in shame making way for a real second party led by rights activists and unionists, a labor party\n\n Ultimately that’s the only way to stop Trump and Trumpism; although the Dems may resurge during the mid terms due to voter disgust with Trump and the Republicans. The voters will soon grow weary of the Dems once they experience, again, their war-mongering, genocidal, anti-union ways, not to mention their attacks on free speech.\n\nYou told me that in response to my original letter you agreed that covering the genocide was important; but you have not made it an important part of your paper. You reminded me that readers should not be choosing what subjects appear in the Gazette. Fine. But an ongoing genocide in our time rises above such reasonable concerns.\n\nRoger Rudenstein\n\nDurham, N.H.\n\nYou sent us this letter July 6th. We replied the next day, explaining that it had come too late to appear in our paper of July 11th.\n\nWe also tried to explain that W.D. Ehrhart’s writing about Gaza does, in fact, appear in the pages of our printed paper, and that “on our website, his work appears under the heading ‘Northcountry Chronicle’ for reasons that have to do with website layout and are just too tedious to relate.”\n\nWe added, “If you feel moved to recast your letter, or write another, we’re right here.”\n\nOur effort to explain the situation by email appears to have been wasted. Perhaps print will work better, as it usually does.","summary":"To the Editor: It’s a familiar cry for those of us who lived through the turmoil of the ’60s.

This is a national crisis - and the PM's silence isn't good enough","text":"Several weeks ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger – the former actor and governor of California – was invited on to leading US chat show The View. A few days earlier, Los Angeles had been gripped by serious disorder following attempts by Immigration And Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to arrest suspected illegal migrants.\n\nAs a migrant himself, what did he think about the raids, and the reaction to them, Schwarzenegger was asked.\n\n‘We got to do things legal. That is the important thing, you know?’ he replied, to the evident surprise and disappointment of his host Whoopi Goldberg. ‘You got to do things legal. And those people that are doing illegal things in America, they’re the foreigners, they are not smart. Because when you come to America, you’re a guest. And you have to behave like a guest.’\n\nIt would be wrong to describe Schwarzenegger as a classical progressive. He was elected as a Republican and holds conservative economic views. But on social issues, and the issue of immigration, he is relatively liberal. He has frequently attacked Donald Trump. At the last election he endorsed Kamala Harris. And in the wake of the 2021 Capitol riot, he issued a powerful video in which he compared the attack to Kristallnacht.\n\nOver the past seven days the arguments over links between immigration and crime here in the UK have also been intensifying.\n\nIn Warwickshire, Police and Crime Commissioner Philip Seccombe called for urgent national guidance after his local force was accused of failing to release details of two Afghan asylum seekers facing prosecution for an assault on a 12-year-old girl.\n\nOn Monday Nigel Farage courted further controversy by claiming ‘an Afghan male has a 22 times more likely chance of being convicted of rape than somebody born in this country’. He was swiftly followed by Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick, who claimed 40 per cent of sexual crimes in London last year were committed by foreign nationals.\n\nBut within government there was silence. Even though ministers were spending the week making strenuous efforts to promote their new ‘one-in, one-out’ asylum strategy, they studiously avoided engaging in the spiralling debate about criminality, migration and race. Save for a bland intervention from Keir Starmer, in which he said he wanted greater transparency on offending stats.\n\nAnd on one level this reticence is understandable. There is a clear danger of stoking existing community tensions through intemperate and inaccurate statements that scapegoat minorities. As illustrated by the tweet sent by Rupert Lowe – the increasingly preposterous MP for Great Yarmouth – who set members of the public, coastguard and police chasing after a group of illegal migrants, only for it to emerge they were actually a team of charity rowers raising funds for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.\n\nBut there is an urgent need for balance. Because by remaining silent, ministers and the liberal Left are creating a vacuum that could be exploited by agitators operating outside of the political mainstream. And, at the moment, the balance between these two dangers is not being struck.\n\nIn any contentious debate, the only safe haven is provided by\n\nthe truth. And though unpalatable, the truth as it relates to crime and migration status is clear. Some immigrant groups are disproportionately represented in the crime statistics when set against the indigenous population.\n\nIn the wake of Farage’s claim, Sky News conducted a fact-check of his figures. They found he had grossly overestimated actual offending rates among Afghan men, something that was immediately seized upon by his opponents.\n\nBut according to Sky’s analysis, ‘our estimates conclude that Afghans are actually three times more likely to be convicted of a sexual offence than someone born in the UK’.\n\nThat still represents a material, and disturbing, difference.\n\nThe Guardian conducted a similar analysis of Jenrick’s claim. Citing his figures as ‘muddled’, the paper pointed out his analysis was based on proceedings brought, rather than successful prosecutions, and inaccurately assessed the demographics of the London population.\n\nThe paper also stated that Jenrick’s figure reflected an FOI submitted by the Centre for Migration Control, which is run by a former Reform activist.\n\nBut the raw figures provided by the Metropolitan Police are clear. Between 2018 and 2024 there were 7,798 arrests in the capital characterised as ‘violence against the person’ or ‘sexual offences’ which led to further action being taken. Of these, 4,631 were British nationals, 358 were of ‘unknown nationality’ and 2,809 were identified as ‘foreign nationals’.\n\nAgain, the precise scale of the problem may have been exaggerated. But these are still significant and shocking statistics.\n\nIt’s imperative Starmer and his ministers now openly acknowledge this. Not least because, if they don’t, the narrative that they are creating – or at least masking – a system of ‘two-tier justice’, is going to become embedded.\n\nOver the decades, Labour politicians have consistently spoken out against crimes they claim have deeper social significance. Attacks on ethnic minorities. Violence against women. Low-grade sexual intimidation, such as wolf-whistling.\n\nRightly. So now they cannot be seen to simply turn a blind eye to the concerns of those saying the influx of asylum seekers is having a detrimental impact on their communities. Especially when the crime statistics show those fears are not groundless.\n\nYes, Keir Starmer, Yvette Cooper and their colleagues are trying to prioritise action over rhetoric. Yes, it’s easy for Nigel Farage, Robert Jenrick and others to point to the problem without providing any practical, concrete solutions.\n\nBut bland managerialism in the face of a mounting national crisis is not enough.\n\nWhen are we at least going to see the Prime Minister or Home Secretary visit one of the communities selected to host asylum seekers, and directly address local residents’ worries?\n\nOr see Starmer use the weight of his office to echo Schwarzenegger and state: ‘If you come to our country seeking sanctuary you are a guest. We will not tolerate any breaches of our laws. Entry to the UK is a privilege, not a right.’\n\nThe Left cannot let opposition to migrant crime become the preserve of the Right. Especially when every offence doesn’t just impact the victim but every other migrant seeking to enter Britain in genuine pursuit of sanctuary, or a new life.\n\nDeflection such as ‘it’s only a small number of migrants’ or ‘the people pointing to this issue are just peddling hate’ isn’t just counterproductive, it’s offensive. In what other context would you hear a liberal breezily declare: ‘It’s only a handful of sexual assaults – let’s focus on the things that matter’?\n\nThe time has come for the Prime Minister to speak out about the link between migration and crime. Because the vacuum he is creating over the issue will not stay a vacuum for long.","summary":"Several weeks ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger - the former actor and governor of California - was invited on to leading US chat show The View.

Given his core nature and personality, Trump’s attacks on prominent Black Americans have recently become even more explicit and direct. \n\nFirst, he accused former President Barack Obama of “treasonous” behavior for launching an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But that was not the end of it. On Monday, following a criminal referral from Trump’s Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered federal prosecutors to open a grand jury investigation into the baseless accusations. Multiple investigations, including two led by Republicans, and other reporting have repeatedly shown that Russia did, in fact, seek to meddle in the election in favor of Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by launching a social media disinformation campaign using Russian bot farms, and by hacking the Clinton campaign’s emails. \n\nNo such conspiracy on Obama’s part exists. But with Trump’s consolidation of power and lack of traditional guardrails, he has the full power of the state at his command to advance his authoritarian campaign against Obama, Clinton and other people and groups that he has already targeted — or will soon be targeting — for “treason” and other “crimes.”\n\nIn the meantime, Trump has placed other prominent Black people in his sights. \n\nLast week, Trump targeted Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, Al Sharpton and others with claims they were part of a conspiracy in which they were paid to endorse his rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. “IT’S NOT LEGAL!” he posted on Truth Social. “For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,’ this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system.” Trump said he would soon “call for a major investigation.”\n\nAgain, no such conspiracy exists.\n\nOn Aug. 1, Trump called radio personality Charlamagne tha God, who is a Black man, a “low IQ individual” and a “racist sleazebag” because he dared to question the president’s policies and behavior. On Fox News’ “My View with Lara Trump,” Charlamagne tha God said “the least of us are still being impacted the worst” and was critical of Trump’s response to the Epstein scandal. \n\nThen, in a Truth Social Post on Monday, Trump criticized CBS journalist Gayle King, who is also Winfrey’s best friend. “Gayle King’s career is over. She should have stayed with her belief in TRUMP. She never had the courage to do so. No talent, no ratings, no strength!!!” \n\nBut the president still was not finished with his bigoted provocations. On Tuesday, he escalated his racist appeals, telling CNBC in a phone interview that “inner city” people — a not-so-subtle code for Black Americans — are lazy. “Illegal aliens” — meaning Hispanics and Latinos — are strong and have a natural talent for physical labor, he said. “[P]eople that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They’re just not doing that work, and they’ve tried, we’ve tried, everybody tried, they don’t do it…These people do it naturally, naturally.”\n\nThese are all — Trump’s slur that Winfrey, Beyoncé and other Black celebrities are basically crooks, and that Black people are inherently lazy — centuries-old white supremacist tropes. His comments are part of a much larger pattern of behavior where he has repeatedly insulted Black people, specifically Black women, as being dumb or stupid or “low IQ.”\n\nThis is the same white racist “logic” used to justify Black chattel slavery and over 100 years of American apartheid and racial tyranny in the South, and other parts of the country, under the period of Jim Crow and into the post-civil rights era and beyond. \n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture explains the origins of the stereotype that Black people are somehow inherently “lazy” as compared to white people and other “races” as:\n\nMany of the stereotypes created during the height of the trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and were used to help commodify black bodies and justify the business of slavery. For instance, an enslaved person, forced under violence to work from sunrise to sunset, could hardly be described as lazy. Yet laziness, as well as characteristics of submissiveness, backwardness, lewdness, treachery, and dishonesty, historically became stereotypes assigned to African Americans.\n\nTrump’s racist attacks merited media attention. But it did not receive the in-depth coverage it deserved. As Bill Kristol, Andrew Egger and Jim Swift of The Bulwark observed of Trump’s accusations of treason against Obama, “You might expect it to be big news. And yet it faded into the background almost at once. How far through the looking glass are we, that this sort of thing reads to so many as a ‘dog bites man’ story?…”\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nIn a searing essay, former MSNBC host and author Joy Reid captured the moment:\n\nI guess we Blacks can just hang it up, at this point. Companies have effectively been told they’re not allowed to hire us anywhere…Presumably, the regime envisions whatever Black people, brown people, women and LGBTQ people who aren’t deported, working as maids in white Christian homes, like in the ‘good old days’ when America was great…\n\nFilmmaker Kevin Willmott put it another way in The Nation: “The Confederacy has gobbled up the Union…The entire nation is capitulating to the new Confederate States of America.”\n\nThe mainstream media’s failure to consistently connect Trump’s racism and authoritarianism to the nation’s worsening democratic crisis is not a mere “failure of imagination.” It is an act of complicity that further normalizes racism and authoritarianism in the Age of Trump. Further, as media critics like Dan Froomkin and Mark Jacob have argued, it is actually a willful refusal to understand how racism and authoritarianism intersect and amplify the other’s power to erode human freedom, dignity, agency and flourishing across racial lines.\n\nThe normalization of Trump and the MAGA Republicans’ authoritarianism (if not naked fascism), racism and general hostility towards Black and brown people is not abstract. Such values and policies have significant negative health, emotional, material and other detrimental outcomes. This is not a coincidence or accident. It is the predictable and de facto desired outcome and goal.\n\nPhilosopher and public intellectual Cornel West has described Black Americans as historically existing in a state of being “unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, and hated for who they are.” Psychologists and other experts described the sum effect of these forces as causing “racial battle fatigue” — a form of collective post-traumatic stress disorder — among Black people and other non-whites in America and across the West. For example, public health and other experts have demonstrated how racial fatigue shortens the lives of people of color because of how chronic stress from navigating a society where racial discrimination profoundly shapes life outcomes. To that point, racial battle fatigue has been shown to lead to premature aging through epigenetic processes.\n\nHow much longer will Black Americans and the heirs to other great freedom struggles keep sacrificing for a country that is choosing self-destruction — for a nation accelerating toward fascism? What will happen then if those who are the conscience of the nation decide to turn their backs on it? \n\nWhat is the cost of loving a country that does not love you back?\n\nI don’t pretend to have an answer. But I do know this: If those Americans who are the conscience of the nation turn away from it, the consequences for the country’s future will be nothing short of existential.\n\nThe post Trump escalates his racist attacks on Black Americans appeared first on Salon.com.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-escalates-racist-attacks-black-104546873.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_bt1iD6R1T9bkJXOLfLh3w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwNDg7aD0xMzY0O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/salon_articles_879/a041dffed92db09570b5b2340848da08","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 10:45:46","author":"Chauncey Devega","authors":["Chauncey Devega"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.436},{"id":349576292,"title":"Trump escalates his racist attacks on Black Americans","text":"Donald Trump is not a subtle man.

On Tuesday, he escalated his racist appeals, telling CNBC in a phone interview that “inner city” people — a not-so-subtle code for Black Americans — are lazy. “Illegal aliens” — meaning Hispanics and Latinos — are strong and have a natural talent for physical labor, he said. “[P]eople that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They’re just not doing that work, and they’ve tried, we’ve tried, everybody tried, they don’t do it…These people do it naturally, naturally.”\n\nThese are all — Trump’s slur that Winfrey, Beyoncé and other Black celebrities are basically crooks, and that Black people are inherently lazy — are centuries-old white supremacist tropes. His comments are part of a much larger pattern of behavior where he has repeatedly insulted Black people, specifically Black women, as being dumb or stupid or “low IQ.”\n\nThis is the same white racist “logic” used to justify Black chattel slavery and over 100 years of American apartheid and racial tyranny in the South, and other parts of the country, under the period of Jim Crow and into the post-civil rights era and beyond. \n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture explains the origins of the stereotype that Black people are somehow inherently “lazy” as compared to white people and other “races” as:\n\nMany of the stereotypes created during the height of the trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and were used to help commodify black bodies and justify the business of slavery. For instance, an enslaved person, forced under violence to work from sunrise to sunset, could hardly be described as lazy. Yet laziness, as well as characteristics of submissiveness, backwardness, lewdness, treachery, and dishonesty, historically became stereotypes assigned to African Americans.\n\nTrump’s racist tirade merited media attention. But it did not receive the in-depth coverage it deserved. As Bill Kristol, Andrew Egger and Jim Swift of The Bulwark observed of this chilling trend, “You might expect it to be big news. And yet it faded into the background almost at once. How far through the looking glass are we, that this sort of thing reads to so many as a ‘dog bites man’ story?…”\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nIn a searing essay, former MSNBC host and author Joy Reid captured the moment:\n\nI guess we Blacks can just hang it up, at this point. Companies have effectively been told they’re not allowed to hire us anywhere…Presumably, the regime envisions whatever Black people, brown people, women and LGBTQ people who aren’t deported, working as maids in white Christian homes, like in the ‘good old days’ when America was great…\n\nFilmmaker Kevin Willmott put it another way in The Nation: “The Confederacy has gobbled up the Union…The entire nation is capitulating to the new Confederate States of America.”\n\nThe mainstream media’s failure to consistently connect Trump’s racism and authoritarianism to the nation’s worsening democratic crisis is not a mere “failure of imagination.” It is an act of complicity that further normalizes racism and authoritarianism in the Age of Trump. Further, as media critics like Dan Froomkin and Mark Jacob have argued, it is actually a willful refusal to understand how racism and authoritarianism intersect and amplify the other’s power to erode human freedom, dignity, agency and flourishing across racial lines.\n\nThe normalization of Trump and the MAGA Republicans’ authoritarianism (if not naked fascism), racism and general hostility towards Black and brown people is not abstract. Such values and policies have significant negative health, emotional, material and other detrimental outcomes. This is not a coincidence or accident. It is the predictable and de facto desired outcome and goal.\n\nPhilosopher and public intellectual Cornel West has described Black Americans as historically existing in a state of being “unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, and hated for who they are.” Psychologists and other experts described the sum effect of these forces as causing “racial battle fatigue” — a form of collective post-traumatic stress disorder — among Black people and other non-whites in America and across the West. For example, public health and other experts have demonstrated how racial fatigue shortens the lives of people of color because of how chronic stress from navigating a society where racial discrimination profoundly shapes life outcomes. To that point, racial battle fatigue has been shown to lead to premature aging through epigenetic processes.\n\nHow much longer will Black Americans and the heirs to other great freedom struggles keep sacrificing for a country that is choosing self-destruction — for a nation accelerating toward fascism? What will happen then if those who are the conscience of the nation decide to turn their backs on it? \n\nWhat is the cost of loving a country that does not love you back?\n\nI don’t pretend to have an answer. But I do know this: If those Americans who are the conscience of the nation turn away from it, the consequences for the country’s future will be nothing short of existential.","summary":"Failure to connect his comments to our worsening democratic crisis is an act of complicity","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/08/09/trump-escalates-his-racist-attacks-on-black-americans/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2220598276-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 10:45:46","author":"Chauncey Devega","authors":["Chauncey Devega"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.448},{"id":349579186,"title":"Walters: Deepfakes pose obvious political peril, but state’s bans amount to censorship","text":"A few weeks ago, a video popped up on YouTube, purporting to be a verbal clash between Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, and Gov. Gavin Newsom during a congressional hearing.\n\nThe video claimed that Hawley cleaned Newsom’s clock in their debate over a lawsuit that Newsom had filed. The problem is it was fake, created with video snippets of both politicians and a voiceover describing what supposedly happened.\n\nThe video, which has since vanished from YouTube, is a fairly crude example of how technology can be manipulated to depict seemingly real events.\n\nMore sophisticated examples of artificial intelligence, known as deepfakes, can literally put words in political figures’ mouths or even create seemingly real persons.\n\nLast year, Christopher Kohls, going by the name “Mr. Reagan” on social media, posted a video in which Kamala Harris seemingly acknowledged that she had been the “ultimate diversity hire” when Joe Biden chose her as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nKohls said it was a parody, but Elon Musk posted it on his social media platform X, drawing criticism from Newsom and a vow to outlaw such material. It was one of many clashes with Musk, the billionaire electric car and rocket tycoon, after he became a Donald Trump ally.\n\nWithin weeks, Newsom signed two bills aimed at either regulating or banning AI-generated political videos. Kohl, later joined by other content creators, sued, contending that they violate free speech.\n\nThis week John Mendez, a federal judge in Sacramento, struck down one of the measures, Assembly Bill 2655, carried by Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Palo Alto Democrat. He ruled that the federal Communications Decency Act protects X and other sites from liability for material posted by third parties, such as Kohl or Musk.\n\nAB 2655 would have barred internet sites from posting deceptive political material during campaign seasons. “They don’t have anything to do with these videos that the state is objecting to,” Mendez said.\n\nNotably, Mendez indicated that he will also reject the second measure, Assembly Bill 2839, carried by Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin, a Santa Cruz Democrat. It would prohibit anyone from “knowingly distributing an advertisement or other election communication … that contains certain materially deceptive content.”\n\n“I think the statute just fails miserably in accomplishing what it would like to do,” Mendez said, adding “It’s become a censorship law and there is no way that is going to survive.”\n\nAs the country’s political polarization deepens, voters become more willing to believe allegations that those on the other side of the divide are evil, corrupt and power hungry. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence makes political deepfakes ever more sophisticated and capable of fooling gullible voters into believing their lies.\n\nExaggeration, selective facts and downright lies have always been evident in political campaigns, but historically held in check, at least partially, by newspapers and other political media.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the mainstream media have fallen on economic hard times and have become less capable of policing political discourse. Meanwhile, X, YouTube, podcasts and other digital media have exploded as alternative sources but they tend to drive polarization rather than counteract it.\n\nThe bills that Democratic legislators and a Democratic governor enacted last year were clearly aimed at crippling media on the other side of the ideological divide but, as Judge Mendez ruled, violate free speech.\n\nCensorship cannot be the answer. The approach that Newsom and legislators took is a slippery slope that would invite retaliation from their political rivals, thus deepening the already yawning political divide.\n\nIt is, however, a genuine quandary. Unfettered use of AI-driven deepfakes in political campaigns present an obvious peril, but so does any effort to prohibit free speech, no matter how distasteful.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"California legislators' AI regulations are a slippery slope, risking retaliation from their political rivals and heightened polarization.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/09/walters-deepfakes-pose-obvious-political-peril-but-states-bans-amount-to-censorship/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SJM-L-SCHOOLZONES-0328-4.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 10:15:27","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":349722442,"title":"Vance is right to call out warped partisan representation","text":"Believe it or not, Vice President JD Vance has said a number of things over the years that I agree with. For example, when he suggested “the American people will not tolerate another endless war\" with regards to sending aid to Ukraine, I felt seen. When Vance told podcaster Theo Von “we need to release the Epstein list; that is an important thing,” I could not have agreed more. The sex trafficker received over $1.5 billion and 4,000 wire transfers to help pay for his operation. The American people should know who among us gave that monster money. Recently Vance took to social media to point out that Republicans average 40% of the vote in California but under one redistricting scenario would be represented by only 9% of the state’s House seats. “How can this possibly be allowed?” He pondered. It’s a really good question — especially for Texas. After Texas gained two spots because of population growth in 2021 — 95% of which is attributable to people of color — Gov. Greg Abbott signed off on a map that actually increased the number of districts in which most voters are white. In fact, 60% of the new state Senate districts were majority white despite white residents making up less than 40% of the population. Today Republicans are suggesting the new map is their way of making space for Latino voters. The timeline suggests those seats belonged to Latino voters years ago. Vance is correct to point out there’s a dearth of Republican representation in California politics. But while Democrats have controlled the governor’s mansion and both state chambers for 11 consecutive years in the Golden State, in Texas the Republicans have held all three for 22 consecutive years — in large part because of the type of gerrymandering Vance denounced. (In California, it’s hard to fault partisan redistricting for the current mix of representation … because the state does not have partisan redistricting. Voters established an independent commission 14 years ago.) Texas’ current map already seems to tilt in Republicans’ favor. Last year, the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, won more than 40% of the vote in the Lone Star State, and yet today Republicans hold nearly 70% of the state’s House seats. And Abbott and his MAGA cohorts in office want even more. In one sense it is a full circle moment for Vance to complain about gerrymandering considering it was a former vice president — Elbridge Gerry — who started it. One of the nation’s founding fathers, Gerry was governor of Massachusetts when he approved a Senate seat map that the Boston Gazette lampooned as being shaped like a salamander. That’s because it was drawn in an odd way to rig the system so that it bent toward Republicans. What Vance is complaining about was started by his party and has been the country’s reality since 1812. That’s not to suggest Democrats are not also guilty. Between 2010 and 2020, Illinois lost roughly 18,000 people. That reduction cost the state a House seat and required a new congressional map. For more than a decade, Republican Adam Kinzinger represented the 16th district — a swath of land that included moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats. However, after the new map was drawn by Democrats, the 16th district was erased and Kinzinger was without a district. That is the same Kinzinger who proved to be a crucial member of the Jan. 6 committee because the war vet put his country over party. So, while Illinois Democrats were busy grabbing more power with the new map in 2021, they unknowingly forced out a moderate Republican who would prove to be one of the few conservatives in Congress to stand up for democracy. He proved not only to be an ally of democracy-oriented Democrats, but to be one of the speakers at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, a move that he and they hoped would bring out more moderates to vote against Donald Trump. Had the Democrats kept his district intact, perhaps they would have had an ally in the House fighting President Trump’s overreach. Remember in May when Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” passed the House by a single vote? Therein lies the true danger of gerrymandering. It’s not about what is snuffed out today but what is prevented from happening in an unforeseen future. Kinzinger voted with Trump 90% of the time, including against the first impeachment. Looking at that, I don’t blame Democrats for seeing him as a political foe back when they eliminated his district. However, when it mattered most, he was a democracy ally. Yet by then, he was seen as a doomed political figure because of gerrymandering. Sophocles himself couldn’t have written a more tragic tale of self-defeating hubris. So yes, JD Vance has said a number of things over the years that I agree with: no endless wars, release the Epstein files, stop the gerrymandering. I agreed with the Vance who was interested in fighting for democracy. But to appease his boss, he’s retreated from principled stances. How the world has changed, and he with it.

All the rights taken away from women. The stuff with ICE,” Zamora said, ticking off her frustrations as she stopped outside the post office in the Central Valley community of Los Banos. “Why are they going after people working on farms when they’re supposed to be chasing violent criminals?”\n\nMedeiros, by contrast, is delighted Trump replaced Joe Biden. “He wasn’t mentally fit,” Medeiros said of the elderly ex-president. “There was something wrong with him from the very beginning.”\n\nDespite all that, the two do share one belief: Both say the government should cough up every last bit of information it has on Jeffrey Epstein, his sordid misdeeds and the powerful associates who moved in his aberrant orbit.\n\nChange the subject\n\nTrump “did his whole campaign on releasing the Epstein files,” Zamora said. “And now he’s trying to change the subject. ‘Oh, it’s a ‘hoax’ … ‘Oh, you guys are still talking about that creep?’ And yet there’s pictures throughout the years of him with that creep.”\n\nMedeiros, 56, echoed the sentiment.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans “put themselves into this predicament because they kept talking constantly” about the urgency of unsealing records in Epstein’s sex-trafficking case — until they took control of the Justice Department and the rest of Washington. “Now,” she said, “they’re backpedaling.”\n\nMedeiros paused outside the engineering firm where she works in the Central Valley, in Newman, on a tree-lined street adorned with star-spangled banners honoring local servicemen and women.\n\n“Obviously there were minors involved” in Epstein’s crimes, she said, and if Trump is somehow implicated “then he needs to go down as well.”\n\nYears after being found dead in a Manhattan prison cell — killed by his own hand, according to authorities — Epstein appears to have done the near-impossible in this deeply riven nation. He’s united Democrats, Republicans and independents around a call to reveal, once and for all, everything that’s known about his case.\n\n“He’s dead now, but if people were involved they should be prosecuted,” said Joe Toscano, a 69-year-old Los Banos retiree and unaffiliated voter who last year supported Trump’s return to the White House.\n\n“Bring it all out there. Make it public.”\n\nCalifornia’s 13th Congressional District, where Zamora, Medeiros and Toscano all live, is arguably the most closely fought political terrain in America. Sprawling through California’s midriff, from the far reaches of the San Francisco Bay Area to the southern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, it’s farm country: flat, fertile and crossed-hatched with canals, rail lines and thruways with utilitarian names such as Road No. 32 and Avenue 18½.\n\nThe myriad small towns are brief interludes amid the dairy and poultry farms and lush carpeting of vegetables, fruit and nut trees that stretch to the hazy-brown horizon. The most populous city, Merced, has fewer than 100,000 residents. (Modesto, with a population of around 220,000, is split between the 5th and 13th districts.)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Gray was elected in November in the closest House race in the country, beating the Republican incumbent, John Duarte, by 187 votes out of nearly 211,000 cast. The squeaker was a rematch and nearly a rerun. Two years prior, Duarte defeated Gray by fewer than 600 votes out of nearly 134,000 cast.\n\nNot surprisingly, both parties have made the 13th District a top target in 2026; handicappers rate the contest a toss-up, even as the field sorts itself out. (Duarte has said he would not run again.)\n\nThe midterm election is a long way off, so it’s impossible to say how the Epstein controversy will play out politically. But there is, at the least, a baseline expectation of transparency, a view that was repeatedly expressed in conversations with three dozen voters across the district.\n\nZachery Ramos, a 25-year-old independent, is the founder of the Gustine Traveling Library, which promotes learning and literacy throughout the Central Valley. Its storefront, painted with polka dots and decorated with giant butterflies, sits like a cheery oasis in Gustine’s four-block downtown, a riot of green spilling from the planter boxes out front.\n\nInside, the walls were filled with commendations and newspaper clippings celebrating Ramos’ good works. As a nonprofit, he said, “we have to have everything out there. All the books. Everything.”\nEpstein, he suggested, should be treated no differently.\n\n“When it comes to something as serious as that, with what may or may not have taken place on his private island, with his girlfriend” — convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell — “I do think it should all be out in the open,” Ramos said. “If you’re not afraid of your name being in (the files), especially when you’re dealing with minors being assaulted, it should 100% be made public.”\n\nEd, a 42-year-old Democrat who manages a warehouse operation in Patterson, noted that Trump released the government’s long-secret files on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., even though King’s family objected. (Like several of those interviewed, he declined to give his last name, to avoid being hassled by readers who don’t like what he had to say.)\n\nWhy, Ed wondered, shouldn’t the Epstein files come to light? “It wasn’t just Trump,” he said. “It was a lot of Republicans in Congress that said, ‘Hey, we want to get these files out there.’ And I believe if Kamala (Harris) had won, they would be beating her down, demanding she do so.”\n\nHe smacked a fist in his palm, to emphasize the point.\n\n‘Release it all’\n\nSue, a Madera Republican and no fan of Trump, expressed her feelings in staccato bursts of fury.\n\n“Apparently the women years ago said who was doing what, but nobody listens to the women,” said the 75-year-old retiree. “Release it all! Absolutely! You play, you pay, buddy.”\n\nEven those who dismissed the importance of Epstein and his crimes said the government should hold nothing back — if only to erase doubts and lay the issue to rest.\n\nEpstein “is gone and I don’t really care if they release the files or not,” said Diane Nunes, a 74-year-old Republican who keeps the books for her family farm, which lies halfway between Los Banos and Gustine. “But they probably should, because a lot of people are waiting for that.”\n\nPatrick, a construction contractor, was more worked up about “pretty boy” Gavin Newsom and “Nazi Pelosi” — “yes, that’s what I call her” — than anything that might be lurking in the Epstein files. “When the cat is dead, you don’t pick it up and pet it. Right?” He motioned to the pavement, baking as the temperature in Patterson climbed into the low 90s.\n\n“It’s over with,” the 61-year-old Republican said of Epstein and his villainy. “Move on.”\n\nAt least, that would be his preference. But to “shut everybody up, absolutely, yeah, they should release them,” Patrick said. “Otherwise, we’re all going to be speculating forever.”\n\nOr at least until the polls close in November 2026.\n\nMark Barabak is a Los Angeles Times columnist. ©2025 Los Angeles Times.

The audience laughed its way through the performance I attended last month, and I’m pretty sure I wasn’t the only one who left humming the song “Better Keep Away.”\n\nThe plot’s transposing was par for the course for Northern Sky Theater, in Fish Creek, Wisconsin. At a time when many companies are undergoing identity crises or struggling to connect with audiences, this one endures by programming original musicals anchored in local history, institutions, archetypes and customs.\n\nFor regional audience members, the company’s artistic director Molly Rhode said, a Northern Sky show “is not just sort of about me — it’s really about me.”\n\nDespite being decidedly not from the area, I very much enjoyed this summer’s three offerings, which are running in repertory through Aug. 23. Along with “No Bones About It,” the company is presenting “Something in the Water,” set in early-20th-century Waukesha, when that city was ending an unlikely run as a tourist hot spot popularized by mineral springs, and “Dairy Heirs,” which has a subplot involving a soothing hybrid of provolone and pepper jack called projack.\n\n“The joy and silliness that perfumes the entire air of Northern Sky is something that I think a lot of theater is missing right now,” said Ava Giorgione, a rising junior at New York University who is playing Julie in the Shakespeare spoof.\n\nTechnically speaking, Northern Sky, located in scenic Door County, was born in 2015. But its story goes back to 1970. More on that later, so please keep reading for a tale so ingrained in Badger State lore that it deserves its own musical.\n\nA certain kind of storytelling\n\nIn the summer, the company presents its productions in a 748-seat outdoor amphitheater in the heart of Peninsula State Park, which juts out into Lake Michigan. In the fall it moves indoors to the 248-seat Gould Theater, which opened in 2019. (This year, “The Bachelors,” about a pair of immature Madison men, runs from Aug. 29-Oct. 25; there’s usually also a holiday show.) Encouragingly, attendance has almost recovered from the pandemic, when Northern Sky was limited to a virtual season. “Prior to 2020 we hovered between 25,000 and 30,000 attendees in the park,” the managing director Holly Feldman said. “This year we are projecting closer to 23,000 in the park and 10,000 in the Gould.”\n\nWith a budget of just $2 million, the company leans on mutually beneficial relationships with local donors and businesses. Its staff of eight swells to 56 in the summer, and is supplemented by a pool of about 200 volunteers.\n\nAnd when it comes to finding playwrights, Northern Sky has long recruited contributions from its very audiences. For example, consider the journey of Matt Zembrowski, a Milwaukee native who wrote “Something in the Water.”\n\nAs a kid, Zembrowski and his family used to camp in Peninsula State Park, and in 1995, they saw “Bone Dance.” He was only 12, but was instantly hooked. As his love for musicals expanded, he remained enthralled by the company’s productions. “There’s kind of an ownership because you saw shows about people that you know, Midwesterners,” Zembrowski said. “I connected to that far more than I did a lot of the Broadway shows I was listening to.”\n\nAt a postshow gathering around a fire ring, a gregarious patron named Jerry Pomprowitz told Zembrowski that he loved another of his musicals, “Dad’s Season Tickets.” In that “King Lear” riff, three daughters vie for their father’s Green Bay Packers tickets — “and in the end it worked out that everybody gets to share them,” Pomprowitz said. Unlike Shakespeare, Northern Sky believes in happy endings.\n\nPomprowitz and his wife, Lynn, both in their early 70s, regularly drive about an hour to the theater from their home in Green Bay. Fish Creek has other theater companies, including Peninsula Players (“America’s oldest resident summer theater,” it boasts), but the couple especially enjoy Northern Sky. “The shows are funny, they have character, they have heart and they are family friendly,” Jerry Pomprowitz said. “It’s very nice that they do it that way.”\n\nIndeed, the audience is filled with multigenerational groups. It’s also not rare for multiple family members to be involved with the company. Rhode’s sister Alissa wrote the music for “Dairy Heirs,” for example, and when I went to the White Gull Inn for a fish boil, the owner mentioned her years as a house manager at the theater. Her sister acted in “Northern Lights” in 1997. Another sister cowrote the musical “Victory Farm” (2012), about German POWs working in one of the area’s cherry orchards in 1944.\n\nIt’s in their DNA\n\nHistory-inspired shows are popular at Northern Sky, which loves good yarns. And one happens to be attached to its birth. The company’s ethos can be traced back to Robert E. Gard, a Madison professor who promoted the interconnection of local roots and culture. (With research financed by the National Endowment for the Arts, he published a 1966 study-cum-call to arms, “The Arts in the Small Community: A National Plan,” that deserves to be rediscovered today.) One of Gard’s colleagues, Dave Peterson, spotted the amphitheater while camping and thought it would be a perfect place to present his revue “Song of the Inland Seas.” It ended up kick-starting the Heritage Ensemble, in 1970.\n\nAn early fan was Fred Heide, currently Northern Sky’s artistic adviser. “It was songs of the Great Lakes sailors, the lumberjacks, the early immigrant farmers,” he said of the show. “They were authentic folk songs, but Dave arranged them with complex Broadway harmonies. And he combined them with interesting bits of our history and humorous things he had pulled out of books. There was a tremendous depth to these songs, and power and universality to the stories they were telling.”\n\nHeide joined the Heritage Ensemble in 1972, and performed in and wrote many shows. In 1990, he rebooted the troupe as American Folklore Theater with Gerald Pelrine and Fred Alley — the latter a tireless director, performer and writer whose hits with James Kaplan, “Lumberjacks in Love” (1996) and “Guys on Ice” (1998), have been produced around the country and are regularly revived at Northern Sky.\n\nBeing multi-hyphenate is as much a part of the company’s DNA as the shows’ subject matter. As production interns (they are paid and receive housing), Giorgione and her “No Bones About It” co-star Owen Foulds, who plays Ronny, also help put up and take down sets, prep for meals and more. Giorgione said she found internships “to be very invaluable when it comes to learning the tricks of the trade and what I need to know outside of acting.”\nFoulds said he loved the need to “commit to everything 110 percent.”\n\nAnother busy multitasker, Jeff Herbst, started collaborating with the company in the 1980s and became artistic director in 1993. He would preside over the Northern Sky rebranding in 2015.\n\n“All of the musicals that we were writing were really not folklore,” said Herbst, who stepped down from the artistic directorship last year but continues to direct and appear in the company’s productions. “So I wanted a name that I could pitch to people around the country and would also resonate more fully with the demographic that was starting to come to Door County — a lot more affluent people have found their way up here for second homes.”\n\nThe population changes may explain why Door County, which had been a bellwether in presidential elections since 1996, went for Kamala Harris by a slim margin last year. Northern Sky navigates political waters gingerly, and by gingerly I mean it avoids them. Besides localism, the throughline is that the shows are, as Pomprowitz said, “family friendly,” though Feldman, the theater’s managing director, appeared chagrined that to some the term translates to a specific type of “family values.” (“What keeps us up at night is not the occasional email about something we had on our stage,” she said, “but our outdoor season being impacted by erratic weather from climate change.”)\n\nThis does not mean the company is stuck in place, either. A key program is NOVA (Nurturing Original Voices and Artists), which since 2021 has welcomed 62 playwrights from around the country to workshops and writing circles, both physically and virtually. Its director, Lachrisa Grandberry, was in the original production of “Dairy Heirs,” in 2018, for which she also learned to play the stand-up bass. (“People collect skills when they come to us,” Molly Rhode said, laughing.)\n\nGrandberry and two others set out to write “Sunflowered,” a musical about a camping trip to Peninsula State Park that premiered in 2022 at Northern Sky. In parallel, she developed initiatives inspired by a workshop for writers of color, and those led to NOVA.\n\n“Northern Sky is a very unique theater that only produces new works so it felt like there should be a place or a program within it that cultivates them,” Grandberry said. As a Black woman in a predominately white area, she said, “I know for a fact that I would not have been able to write for Northern Sky without first working there. I would not have understood the culture of Door County and of this theater. The challenge we have as a company is trying to cultivate new voices and make room for them in our space.”\n\nAll told, Northern Sky has about a dozen shows in various stages of development. Looking at the slate, one feels that the company will evolve while holding on to its identity and values in a world roiled by uncertainty. After all, Grandberry said, “Northern Sky is really good at creating stories that feel like home.”","summary":"FISH CREEK, Wis. — Here they are again, those enamored youths hiding their passion from their feuding families in Verona.

In the months since, their admonitions have grown only more pointed.\n\nTheir calculus is simple. Despite campaign promises to improve working people’s lives, and Mr. Trump’s appeal among the rank and file, top union officials do not view the president, whose signature policy law benefits the wealthy, as a true ally of organized labor. And if Democrats regain the ground they’ve lost with blue-collar voters, many of whom are union members, it could help leaders with their own struggles, including flagging membership and criticism that they are losing touch with everyday workers.\n\nBut it is not likely to be easy.\n\nThe shift toward Mr. Trump among blue-collar voters last year was the culmination of a trend in recent elections: Democrats gained votes in wealthy, white enclaves, while Republicans earned new support in working-class regions and among Hispanic and Black voters, raising questions about Democrats’ longstanding identity as the defender of working people.\n\nUnion leaders, who mostly endorsed Kamala Harris even as many of their members scoffed at her candidacy, now find themselves trying to strike a delicate balance, maintaining support for Democratic candidates while not alienating members who voted for Mr. Trump.

Maura Healey warmly welcomed them as though they were illegal immigrants.\n\nBut if politicians really want to know about gerrymandering congressional districts to gain power, they all should study Massachusetts.\n\nWe invented it.\n\nOr, I should say, Gov. Elbridge Gerry did. He was governor of Massachusetts when he signed a bill in 1812 that created a partisan state Senate district that looked like a mythological salamander (lizard) to benefit his party.\n\nAn enterprising reporter from the Boston Gazette took Gerry’s name and fused it with “mander” from salamander and, hence, the word gerrymander, with all its negative implications, was born.\n\nIt has been with us ever since. It also has given Gov. Gerry a bad rap. While he is credited, or discredited, for the practice of gerrymandering, all his other accomplishments have been forgotten.\n\nHe was a Founding Father, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a diplomat, a governor and vice president under President James Madison.\n\nBut he is remembered for gerrymandering. That’s history for you.\n\nRedistricting of the states’ 435 U.S. House seats follows the once-in-a-decade population count by the U.S. Census Bureau. States with growing populations (illegal immigrants) gain seats at the expense of states with declining populations.\n\nThere is no stipulation that prevents states from redrawing districts in the middle of the decade, like Texas is doing now.\n\nAt President Donald Trump behest, the Republican controlled state Legislature in Texas is withdrawing its district lines to better enhance the election of five more Republicans since Trump carried the state in 2024 by 56 per cent over 42 per cent over Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump got 36 per cent of the vote in Massachusetts but that is not going to make any difference to the state’s Democrat controlled political makeup.\n\nMassachusetts is such a gerrymandered Democratic one-party state that it just as well put up signs at the state border warning Republicans to stay away or reading NRA —No Republicans Allowed.\n\nIt is a state that is more welcoming of illegal immigrants than it is of Republicans.\n\nAnd if there is any doubt of that, just check the more than $1 billion a year progressive Democrat Gov. Maura Healey is shelling out to pay for the care and well-being of illegal immigrants from around the world who have flocked to Massachusetts to partake of its overly generous welfare benefits.\n\nDemocrats have gerrymandered the state’s congressional districts to the point that all nine Massachusetts members of the U.S. House are Democrats.\n\nExcluding the fluke election of Republican Scott Brown to the U.S. Senate in 2010 — who was quickly ousted by radical leftist Democrat Elizabeth Warren–there has not been a Republican elected to the U.S. House from Massachusetts in almost thirty years.\n\nThe last Republicans to hold a congressional seat in Massachusetts were Peter Blute of Worcester and Peter Torkildsen of Danvers. Both were elected in 1992, defeating a pair of troubled Democrats—Joe Early and Nick Mavroules.\n\nAnd then both were ousted in 1996 by Democrats James McGovern, who still hold the seat, and John Tierney, who was later defeated by fellow Democrat Seth Mouton.\n\nThere has not been a Republican elected since.

It is easy to see the upheaval as unprecedented and unexpected. It is also easy to see it as largely serendipitous. Rather than Trump being the result of entirely novel historical forces that he has unleashed into the world, it could well be that he stumbled into the presidency for a second time simply because woke sentiments appalled decent people, Joe Biden was faltering, and Kamala Harris arrived too late to the race. Likewise, if Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor of New York in autumn, it might well be not so much because left populism has come into its moment, but because his rivals, Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams, are even more inadequate than Harris was. To paraphrase a Russian proverb, for a hungry electorate, even a half-baked loaf tastes good.\n\nThe same might apply to what appears a sea change among the right with regards to Israel. For generations, the standard perception goes, the right has stood behind Israel through thick and thin. Today, more and more Democrats, appalled by the war crimes in Gaza, seem to have turned against Israel. Meanwhile, the right, in a weird convergence of usually polarised sentiment, is doing the same. Most recently, the prominent political scientist, John Mearsheimer, appeared on Tucker Carlson’s podcast, declaring that the Zionist project was racist and about ethnic cleansing from the beginning.\n\nLeave aside that the Zionist project, which has now, in the hands of Benjamin Netanyahu and his executioners, arrived at a racist and potentially genocidal dead end, was not racist and potentially genocidal from the beginning. There was absolutely nothing surprising about Mearsheimer’s assertion, or about Carlson’s openness to it. Mearsheimer was merely reprising one of the themes of The Israel Lobby, a sensationally controversial book that he published with Stephen Walt in 2007, and which grew out of an essay by both men that had appeared in the London Review of Books the previous year.\n\nThis is not the place to examine that book’s thesis and the reaction to it, though my own belief is that the book was factually impoverished and inaccurate in its argument that pro-Israel factions in Washington were responsible for what Mearsheimer and Walt saw as the US’s self-defeating allegiance to the Jewish state. The Cold War had been the cause of America’s allegiance to Israel. (Just as the greed of American oil men pushed America to invade Iraq, not, as Mearsheimer and Walt maintained, the far less remunerative Israel lobby.) Now though, 18 years further along in the post-Cold War period, and nearly two years into the slow extermination of the Palestinians from Gaza, the two authors’ fundamental premise seems correct.\n\nMearsheimer and Walt took particular aim at the neoconservatives, whom they accused of an attachment to Israel’s interests that undercut American ones. But the neoconservatives were one branch of the conservative movement, the one that happened to prevail among and draw closest to power. But there were also, as they were known at the time, the “paleoconservatives”, on the hard right of US politics. That term now seems quaint, for the simple reason that the extreme right wing of the party that it represented has become its dominant wing. Compared to their Dick Cheney-era pomp, the neocons have to share office space with the kind of Tea Party figures they once arrogantly dismissed as fruitcakes.\n\nUnlike the mostly Jewish neoconservatives, the hard right hailed The Israel Lobby as “an extraordinary accomplishment”. At least that was the judgement of the American Conservative, a paleoconservative magazine founded by one of the fathers of American right populism, Pat Buchanan. It was Buchanan who made the once notorious remark about “the Israeli Defence Ministry and its amen corner in the United States”, which was attacked as anti-Semitic, though his perception was accurate. It might still have been anti-Semitic. No one could say for certain. What has always haunted modern Jews is that no one can say for sure whether, in any given instance, an anti-Zionist is also an anti-Semite. “Everybody hates the Jews,” as the late, great Tom Lehrer once sang. Is it true? Is it more true now than it was pre-Gaza?\n\nThe hard right’s enthusiasm for The Israel Lobby seemed less grounded in conscientious agreement with the book’s premises – which, of course, was possible – than in an instinctive expression of an animosity towards Jews on the right that dated back to the anti-Semitic Catholic priest (later defrocked) Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s. Afterward, Senator Joseph McCarthy continued the hard right’s anti-Semitism, with the large majority of his victims in the anti-communist hearings of the 1950s being Jewish. Indeed, McCarthy seems to have created the template for Trump’s own simultaneous courting of anti-Semitism on the right and his disingenuous “defence” of Jewish university students. Even as McCarthy was winking at the Jew-hating right in his persecution of mostly Jews, he was vociferously accusing critics of his hatchet man – the Jewish Roy Cohn, later Donald Trump’s mentor – of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe radical right, especially the Catholics among them, had always been rife with anti-Semitism. The so-called father of modern conservatism, William F Buckley, spent years associating with virulent anti-Semites, even as he gradually distanced himself from them – a ritualistic radical right double motion – as well as opposing Israel, until he later very publicly denounced anti-Semitism in 1991. In light of America’s conflict with the Soviet Union, he became an ardent supporter of Israel.\n\nThese days, the fractured feelings on the right with regard to Jews are no less intense. Tucker Carlson invites Nazi apologists on his podcast, Laura Loomer lashes out at Muslims in the name of Jews, Candace Owens calls Israel a “demonic nation”, the National Review defends Israel’s actions in Gaza, Joe Rogan denounces Israeli actions in Gaza and calls Jews “greedy”. In my home state of New Jersey, the Maga candidate for governor, Jack Ciattarelli, is an ardent defender of Israel, while his Democratic rival, Mikie Sherrill, called what Israel is doing in Gaza “genocide”, then played her remarks down.\n\nWhat is clear is that, because the radical right has become mainstreamed and has all but engulfed conservatism’s moderate strains, it should not come as a surprise that the anti-Semitism that was always a central element of the radical right should also be in the process of being mainstreamed. This is accompanied by a whole new set of phenomena. One is that, despite Trump’s occasional gestures of impatience, he will keep America behind Netanyahu whatever the Israeli leader does in Gaza, merely nudging him from time to time to appear moderate in order to soften Israel’s critics. The other is that, as Trump well knows, such criticism of Israel as he occasionally emits will gratify those anti-Semites on the hard right whose anti-Zionism is seamless with their anti-Semitism.\n\nAnother feature of this new status of Jews is the right’s manipulation of what they pretend is the pro-Palestinian fervour sweeping the left and constituting a basis for a left populism. That is a red herring. Palestine, even the atrocity and torment of Gaza, plays little role in Americans’ moral imagination. Vietnam unified the left 60 years ago; Americans are not dying in Gaza, and American liberals will not be drawn away from their differences by a foreign conflict that has no real consequences for them. What the right does achieve, though, by pretending that the pro-Palestinian passion on the progressive left is a threat to its own populist success, is two-pronged. The first is to saddle the left with the appearance of anti-Semitism. The second is to feed the growing anti-Semitic wing of Maga the red meat of making Jews seem at the heart of every foreign and domestic turbulence. No Israeli war crimes in Gaza, no pro-Palestinian outrage unifying the right.\n\nThe Jews are slowly being positioned by the right as a kind of Skinnerian stimulus meant to provoke one sort of reaction or another among the electorate. The most dangerous aspect of Trump to Jews, and to Israel, is his seeming philo-Semitism. He will not abandon Netanyahu. He will abet Netanyahu in his atrocities and then use him to titillate the Jew-hatred on the right, all while protesting undying love for Israel and for the Jews. It is hardly a coincidence that Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is Trump’s ambassador to Israel. Many evangelicals are in thrall to “dispensational millenarianism”, in which, simply put, Jews who do not accept Christ in the end time will be destroyed during a seven-year “tribulation”. A new book, Antisemitism in the End Times by Olivier Melnick, coming out this autumn, makes this very case. As the dispensationalists would have it, fighting anti-Semitism is vital as a path to either the mass conversion, or the collective destruction, of the Jews, which is a precondition for the arrival of the messiah.\n\nIn this sense, both the attachment to Israel and the anti-Zionism on the right are the perfect complements to the rising anti-Semitism on the right. This complicated right-wing death hug of Israel is lightyears away from the neoconservatives’ unrealpolitik embrace of Israel. As with so much else, Trump is not inventing anything new. He is taking what was once unspeakable – witness his public support of Poland’s new president, a Holocaust revisionist – tossing it into the chaotic maelstrom he has created, and making it central, and vital.\n\n[See also: Letter from Gaza: “What I feel isn’t just hunger.

In 2020, 13% of extremist demonstrations and violent acts involved white nationalists, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project, as reported by Reuters. That has grown every year since, and by 2024, almost 80% of those events involved white supremacists.\n\nIn the future, it will be more difficult to obtain data on white supremacist violence because the Trump administration has cut or scaled back federal programs collecting such data and countering such domestic terrorism. Naturally, that is a boon to the movement.\n\nIt probably isn’t a coincidence that the most visible instance of political violence with white supremacist overtones was the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. That insurrection was led by pro-Trump forces and initiated by Trump as a way to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. At the beginning of his second term, Trump pardoned many of the offenders, thereby sanctioning their violent acts.\n\nEchoing the white supremacist movement, Trump has repeatedly sought to erase gains made during the historic Civil Rights movement. His administration has purged acknowledgement of milestone accomplishments by Black, Latino, and LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nAs part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s attack on government agencies, racists loyal to Trump benefactor Elon Musk were installed and supported in the administration. Most notably, as part of Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been deployed to engage in street-level thuggery to harass, manhandle, and abuse migrant populations and the communities that support them.\n\nIn one of the more open endorsements of the type of white supremacy that groups like Aryan Freedom Network espouse, Trump has gone about restoring statues and military base names meant to honor pro-slavery Confederates.\n\nThe administration’s allies are on a neo-Nazi kick as well. Musk has allowed pro-Nazi content to flourish and thrive on his social media site, X, formerly Twitter. Musk has expressed support for Nazi-affiliated parties around the world, including the extremist Alternative for Germany party.\n\nOn Fox News, host Greg Gutfeld recently argued that conservatives should tell each other “What up, my Nazi? Hey, what up, my Nazi?” to mock Americans’ sensitivities to racism. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, one of the biggest Trump backers in media, posted a meme on Wednesday that argued “We Are ALL Hitler” after Musk and Trump were criticized for making Nazi-style salutes.\n\nThe affiliation between Trump and the neo-Nazi right was a topic of concern raised by then-Vice President Kamala Harris during her presidential campaign last year.\n\n“I think it’s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people,” Harris said last September.\n\nNow the tragedy has come to pass.","summary":"Neo-Nazi groups are praising President Donald Trump for bringing their bigoted ideas and rhetoric into the mainstream of American politics.

The state swung back into the Democrat camp in 2020, then went Republican again in 2024.\n\nDemocrat Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., are both up for reelection—the former next year; the latter in 2028.\n\nShapiro will be campaigning in a state that went for Trump in 2024 by 120,000 votes over Democrat Kamala Harris. The Pennsylvania Democrat won his first term in 2022 by more than 14 points, although that double-digit landslide win was likely due at least in part to a less than stellar GOP opponent.\n\nShapiro may find himself in a bind if state Republicans succeed in passing a bill that would ban males from participating in girls and women’s sports in Pennsylvania public high schools and public universities. The legislation passed the state Senate with bipartisan support, but is currently languishing in the Democrat-controlled state House. \n\nShapiro drew sharp criticism this week after joining a lawsuit to block Trump from placing prohibitions on juvenile gender surgeries and for criticizing supporters of that state Senate bill that would ban men and boys from competing in female sports, Fox News reported.\n\nShapiro is widely seen as having 2028 presidential ambitions, but has faced criticism in the Philadelphia Inquirer in recent weeks for bolstering his communications staff at Pennsylvania taxpayer expense. The governor has also been scrutinized over how he handled a sexual harassment claim against one of his aides. The governor’s office used $295,000 of taxpayer funding to settle the claim.\n\nShapiro also vetoed school choice legislation, despite having endorsed the concept on the campaign trail. \n\nFetterman could face a Democrat primary in 2028. Conor Lamb, the former Pennsylvania congressman who unsuccessfully challenged Fetterman back in 2022 for the Democrat nomination in the Senate race, was profiled in Politico on Thursday about his recent tour around the state listening to voters’ concerns. Fetterman has received praise from the right for his stalwart support of Israel at the same time that some left-wing Democrat activists have criticized him for being insufficiently critical of President Trump.\n\nLamb also criticized his former Democrat primary opponent in the Politico piece. \n\n“But [a 2028 Senate bid is] three years away, and to be honest, when I started this, I thought John would maybe adjust and start acting like a better senator, and start speaking up for the people that he used to promise he was going to fight for, raising the minimum wage and all sorts of issues,” the former congressman was quoted as saying. \n\nThe 2026 midterms will also see the entire Pennsylvania delegation in the House of Representatives up for reelection. Some Republicans, among them Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Brian Fitzpatrick, are in vulnerable districts. Fitzpatrick voted against the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” that the Trump administration used as a vehicle to pass his Make America Great Again priorities, including more funding for the border and defense and a no tax on tips provision. Bresnahan received good news in June: His 2024 Democrat rival, now-former Rep. Matt Cartwright, would not seek to reclaim Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District seat.","summary":"The 2026 election year is set to be a big one for Pennsylvania with significant races at the gubernatorial and congressional level, and two years...

Her suit was the most militant lawfare I encountered during my year of investigative research for the book.\n\nAs I noted earlier this week:\n\nLetitia “Tish” James is a partisan Democrat who ran and won her race for New York Attorney General specifically to try to destroy Trump. She is one of the most open and public practitioners of lawfare featured in the book. She once told a group of New York Democrats that “I look forward to going into the office of the Attorney General every day, suing [Trump], and then going home.” She uses the law to advance political goals, and she doesn’t hide that fact. Despite rising crime in New York during her tenure as state AG, she seems entirely fixated on getting Trump.\n\nHere are eight clear examples that prove James had no intention of ever affording President Trump equal protection under the law.\n\n1. Targeted Prosecution\n\n“We’re going to definitely sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass. He’s going to know my name personally.” That’s what James said when assuming office, on video. She didn’t take long to make good on that promise. “We will use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family as well,” she stated a month after the election. This is the definition of a witch hunt.\n\nIn fact, James barely even paid lip service to addressing the rising criminality in New York so that she could stay narrowly focused on Trump (and hosting drag story hour read-a-thons).\n\n“The number one issue in this country is defeating Donald Trump. Nothing else matters,” James said.\n\nThat’s saying the quiet part out loud.\n\n2. She Prosecuted a Victimless (Non-)Crime\n\nThe crux of James’s suit against the Trumps was that they undervalued properties to gain better rates on loans, insurance policies, and tax rates. Who was the victim here of the evil Trump Organization? Apparently, it was corporations, specifically multibillion-dollar financial institutions that loaned money to the Trump family.\n\nSo, what did these corporations say when they filed complaints about Trump? Ah! But there were no complaints. The supposedly victimized banks and lenders liked working with the Trump Organization, so far as I can tell. It was James who brought the case on behalf of financial institutions that never claimed for a moment to be harmed.\n\nThe only harm in a business transaction is financial harm, and representatives of these institutions got onto the witness stand and under oath said they were not harmed and did not suffer.\n\nThis was literally unprecedented. It was the first time in state history that someone was accused of fraud even though no one believed that they had been harmed.\n\n3. Blatantly Undervaluing Mar-a-Lago to Justify Abuse\n\nMuch of the case hinged on the valuation of Trump’s legendary Mar- a-Lago property in Florida. The resort and club, which is a National Historic Landmark and has been Trump’s primary residence since 2019, was assessed a value in the range of $18 million to $28 million between 2011 and 2021. The court insisted these weren’t his figures, but the valuation of a basic Palm Beach assessment. The appraiser’s office is tasked with assessing property value for taxation purpose. Trump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million, according to the suit, which the judge declared was “an overvaluation of at least 2,300%, compared to the assessor’s appraisal.” Trump, on the other hand, testified that he believed the property is worth between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\nOne-acre properties in the area routinely hit the real estate market in the $40 million price range, and two-acre homes in the area often are priced between $150 million and $200 million. Mar-a-Lago isn’t merely a unique historic landmark; it is 17 acres of beachfront property. Despite the sheer magnitude and the historical significance of the location, James and company advanced the opinion it was worth only a fraction of properties a tenth its size.\n\nThe court’s valuation of Mar-a-Lago was perhaps 1/50th its actual worth. This is “criminal” in the figurative sense, perhaps the literal sense too.\n\n4. Illicit White House Visits\n\nPublicly available records show that Tish James visited the Biden White House several times during the investigation and trial. First, on April 8, 2022, for a celebration of Ketanji Brown Jackson; then on July 18, 2022, to meet with Kamala Harris along with other attorneys general; and then on August 31, 2023, for an event honoring black women. It is possible but unknown at this time if she discussed Trump’s trial during these visits.\n\nI spoke to President Trump about these visits, and he is of the belief that she was coordinating with the Biden White House about the case.\n\nThis ought to be a major focus of the DOJ’s investigation.\n\n5. A Criminal Trial in Civil Court\n\nOne of the dead giveaways that Tish James was not even attempting to play fair was that she carried out the case as if it were taking place in a criminal court and the Trump family were crooks—despite the fact that the case was filed in civil court.\n\nThere are several distinctions between civil and criminal law, but the most relevant here is that most criminal cases are prosecuted by officials who represent a state, country, or some other jurisdiction. Civil cases are typically brought by an aggrieved party who believes that they are the victim of some wrongdoing. In this instance, the chief law enforcement officer for New York brought a civil case, not a criminal one, against Trump.\n\nShe did that because there was no criminal wrongdoing alleged.\n\nThe banks regarded Trump as a “whale,” an ideal business partner. He made every payment on time. He paid every dollar owed. The financial institutions made every nickel they expected to make from their dealings with him. Trump told me he even had a tendency to pay back loans early, even if he incurred penalties, ensuring that banks were happy with their relationship.\n\nYet Tish James took the position that Trump had conned them. The tenor of the suit suggested that he was an evildoer and needed to be punished.\n\n6. Creating a New Crime to Get Trump\n\nTish James was essentially creating a law out of whole cloth. She relied on New York Executive Law §63(12), which gives the authority broad power to investigate and prosecute civil fraud against consumers. It was typically used to go after con men who swindled sweet little grannies out of their savings, not real estate developers who sign agreements with sophisticated banks — banks who then told the court that they received every dime they were due on time and that they would do business with Trump again.\n\n“They tried me on a statute like it was consumer fraud, like I stole a refrigerator,” Trump told me in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe law was applied uniquely—and more harshly—than ever before.\n\n7. Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\nTrump was initially assessed a $464 million fine for this victimless (non-)crime. This is not just confiscatory, it’s appallingly excessive.\n\nThe New York Supreme Court Appellate Division—the intermediate court in New York— reduced his bond to $175 million. As of March 2025 (when I last interviewed President Trump), they still had his money.\n\nTrump ought to pursue the appeal all the way to our nation’s top court. At a minimum, I expect the Supreme Court to rule that penalizing him half a billion dollars for a victimless violation violates the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause. “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted,” the amendment reads. Notice how the language does not specify whether the excessive fine is related to a criminal or a civil matter, so Trump’s attorneys can certainly use this argument.\n\nNo other president in U.S. history could have survived this type of penalty. It is the definition of cruel and unusual.\n\n8. Election Interference\n\nThe fact that this case was allowed to go on is outrageous. The fact that it took place during the middle of a presidential election is a national disgrace.\n\nThis New York attorney general has always sought to destroy Trump and is clearly abusing her power to do so. (The judge in this juryless case does not seem to be operating on a rational plane. More on that in my book.)\n\nAs I concluded in Breaking the Law:\n\nThe most powerful law enforcement officer in a massively powerful state used her power to target and attempt to character-assassinate one of the state’s most successful residents on naked political grounds. It wasn’t merely excessive; this was a low moment for our country.\nJustice must be served, and Trump must win his appeal.\nThen Tish James ought to be prosecuted for conspiracy against rights.\n\nI’m heartened to learn that the DOJ intends to hold James accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nThe investigations should then extend far beyond James and Jack Smith. Only then can we begin to dismantle the lawfare superstructure.\n\nAs Tish James is fond of saying herself, “[N]o one is above the law.”\n\nThis article was adapted from portions of Breaking the Law.\n\nBreaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, which has been hailed by President Trump as a “must read” book, is available in hardcover, eReader format, and as an audiobook read by the author himself.\n\nAlex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, and the host of “The Alex Marlow Show” podcast produced weekdays by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

It is collapsing right in front of you.”\n\nAbrams brought up the subject by playing a clip of Carville on his show in February, where he declared that the Trump administration was “collapsing” and would be falling apart within 30 days.\n\nAbrams asked the strategist Thursday if he still stood by the prediction. \n\nCarville replied, saying he was “a pretty smart guy in February.”\n\nHe defended the months-old prediction, stating, “You look at what’s happening, and you look at the current stuff that’s coming in – the public has revulsions against this.”\n\nHe pointed to Democratic candidates leading in upcoming elections, like the governor’s race in Virginia, saying that proves Trump’s demise is underway.\n\n“Do you know how much we’re going to win by in Virginia?” he asked. \n\n“Do you have any idea?”\n\n“No, I don’t,” Abrams responded. \n\n“It’s gonna be a lot,” Carville declared. \n\n“It’s not going to be close.”\n\nA recent Virginia Commonwealth Poll from July has Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears at 37% and Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger at 49%. \n\nStill, Abrams wasn’t convinced. \n\n“But you said that you thought that this administration was in the midst of a collapse.”\n\n“I think it is. Yes, I do,” Carville shot back.\n\n“And you think you were right?” Abrams asked. \n\nCarville didn’t back down, stating, “Yes. I think there are — they’re somewhere about 37% or 40% approval. Their economic numbers are terrible, are just terrible. And I think we’re running away with every election we’ve had. We’re going to run away with Virginia. We’re going to win New Jersey. We’re starting to recruit every candidate that we want.”\n\nAbrams continued pushing, mentioning polling showing that Trump isn’t exactly in the midst of collapsing.\n\n“I pulled up the recent approval polling from The New York Times and Real Clear Politics, and the aggregation puts Trump’s approval between 44 and 45.8, with 53 and 51.4 disapproval, as of August the 6th. That’s not a collapse. That’s basically a little bit above where he was.”\n\nCarville dismissed the numbers, saying the polling for upcoming elections “in no way reflect that.” \n\n“I don’t want to get into saying this poll, that poll, this aggregate poll; but I look at like the UMass Amherst poll, I look at Gallup, I look at people like that. I see something completely different. I’m very, very, very confident that this administration is going to be widely rejected in the elections coming up; and they’re gonna be particularly widely rejected in the elections in 2026,” he said.\n\nOne of Carville’s more recent predictions didn’t go so well. \n\nIn the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, the political veteran was so convinced that Kamala Harris would win, he wrote a column for the New York Times titled, “Three Reasons I’m Certain Kamala Harris Will Win.”\n\nCarville’s column slammed Trump as a “repeat electoral loser” and claimed “This time will be no different,” while heaping praise on the Democratic nominee.","summary":"Democratic strategist James Carville claims he was right in predicting that the Trump administration would collapse within 30 days of President Donald Trump’s second term.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/08/media/james-carville-doubles-down-for-predicting-trump-admin-collapse-says-its-happening-now/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/109372306.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7JUYqxS7-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-08 21:35:42","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":349701598,"title":"In America's hardest-fought congressional district, voters agree — Release the Epstein files","text":"LOS BANOS, Calif. — When it comes to President Donald Trump, Angie Zamora and Phaidra Medeiros agree on very little.\n\nZamora, a 36-year-old Army veteran, has nothing good to say.\n\n“The laws. All the rights taken away from women. The stuff with ICE,” Zamora said, ticking off her frustrations as she stopped outside the post office in the Central Valley community of Los Banos. “Why are they going after people working on farms when they’re supposed to be chasing violent criminals?”\n\nMedeiros, by contrast, is delighted Trump replaced Joe Biden. “He wasn’t mentally fit,” Medeiros said of the elderly ex-president. “There was something wrong with him from the very beginning.”\n\nDespite all that, the two do share one belief: Both say the government should cough up every last bit of information it has on Jeffrey Epstein, his sordid misdeeds and the powerful associates who moved in his aberrant orbit.\n\nTrump “did his whole campaign on releasing the Epstein files,” Zamora said. “And now he’s trying to change the subject. ‘Oh, it’s a ‘hoax’ ... ‘Oh, you guys are still talking about that creep?’ And yet there’s pictures throughout the years of him with that creep.”\n\nMedeiros, 56, echoed the sentiment.\n\nTrump and his fellow Republicans “put themselves into this predicament because they kept talking constantly” about the urgency of unsealing records in Epstein’s sex-trafficking case — until they took control of the Justice Department and the rest of Washington. “Now,” she said, “they’re backpedaling.”\n\nMedeiros paused outside the engineering firm where she works in the Central Valley, in Newman, on a tree-lined street adorned with star-spangled banners honoring local servicemen and women.\n\n“Obviously there were minors involved” in Epstein’s crimes, she said, and if Trump is somehow implicated “then he needs to go down as well.”\n\nYears after being found dead in a Manhattan prison cell — killed by his own hand, according to authorities — Epstein appears to have done the near-impossible in this deeply riven nation. He’s united Democrats, Republicans and independents around a call to reveal, once and for all, everything that’s known about his case.\n\n“He’s dead now, but if people were involved they should be prosecuted,” said Joe Toscano, a 69-year-old Los Banos retiree and unaffiliated voter who last year supported Trump’s return to the White House. “Bring it all out there. Make it public.”\n\nCalifornia’s 13th Congressional District, where Zamora, Medeiros and Toscano all live, is arguably the most closely fought political terrain in America. Sprawling through California’s midriff, from the far reaches of the San Francisco Bay Area to the southern edge of the San Joaquin Valley, it’s farm country: flat, fertile and crossed-hatched with canals, rail lines and thruways with utilitarian names such as Road No. 32 and Avenue 18½.\n\nThe myriad small towns are brief interludes amid the dairy and poultry farms and lush carpeting of vegetables, fruit and nut trees that stretch to the hazy-brown horizon. The most populous city, Merced, has fewer than 100,000 residents. Democratic Rep. Adam Gray was elected in November in the closest House race in the country, beating the Republican incumbent, John Duarte, by 187 votes out of nearly 211,000 cast. The squeaker was a rematch and nearly a rerun. Two years prior, Duarte defeated Gray by fewer than 600 votes out of nearly 134,000 cast.\n\nNot surprisingly, both parties have made the 13th District a top target in 2026; handicappers rate the contest a toss-up, even as the field sorts itself out. (Duarte has said he would not run again.)\n\nThe midterm election is a long way off, so it’s impossible to say how the Epstein controversy will play out politically. But there is, at the least, a baseline expectation of transparency, a view that was repeatedly expressed in conversations with three dozen voters across the district.\n\nZachery Ramos, a 25-year-old independent, is the founder of the Gustine Traveling Library, which promotes learning and literacy throughout the Central Valley. Its storefront, painted with polka dots and decorated with giant butterflies, sits like a cheery oasis in Gustine’s four-block downtown.\n\nInside, the walls were filled with commendations and newspaper clippings celebrating Ramos’ good works. As a nonprofit, he said, “we have to have everything out there. All the books. Everything.”\n\nEpstein, he suggested, should be treated no differently.\n\n“When it comes to something as serious as that, with what may or may not have taken place on his private island, with his girlfriend” — convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell — “I do think it should all be out in the open,” Ramos said. “If you’re not afraid of your name being in (the files), especially when you’re dealing with minors being assaulted, it should 100 percent be made public.”\n\nEd, a 42-year-old Democrat who manages a warehouse operation in Patterson, noted that Trump released the government’s long-secret files on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., even though King’s family objected. (Like several of those interviewed, he declined to give his last name, to avoid being hassled by readers who don’t like what he had to say.)\n\nWhy, Ed wondered, shouldn’t the Epstein files come to light? “It wasn’t just Trump,” he said. “It was a lot of Republicans in Congress that said, ‘Hey, we want to get these files out there.’ And I believe if Kamala (Harris) had won, they would be beating her down, demanding she do so.”\n\nHe smacked a fist in his palm, to emphasize the point.\n\nSue, a Madera Republican and no fan of Trump, expressed her feelings in staccato bursts of fury.\n\n“Apparently the women years ago said who was doing what, but nobody listens to the women,” said the 75-year-old retiree. “Release it all! Absolutely! You play, you pay, buddy.”\n\nEven those who dismissed the importance of Epstein and his crimes said the government should hold nothing back — if only to erase doubts and lay the issue to rest.\n\nEpstein “is gone and I don’t really care if they release the files or not,” said Diane Nunes, a 74-year-old Republican who keeps the books for her family farm, which lies halfway between Los Banos and Gustine. “But they probably should, because a lot of people are waiting for that.”\n\nPatrick, a construction contractor, was more worked up about “pretty boy” Gavin Newsom and “Nazi Pelosi” — “yes, that’s what I call her” — than anything that might be lurking in the Epstein files. “When the cat is dead, you don’t pick it up and pet it. Right?” He motioned to the pavement, baking as the temperature in Patterson climbed into the low 90s.\n\n“It’s over with,” the 61-year-old Republican said of Epstein and his villainy. “Move on.”\n\nAt least, that would be his preference. But to “shut everybody up, absolutely, yeah, they should release them,” Patrick said. “Otherwise, we’re all going to be speculating forever.”\n\nOr at least until the polls close in November 2026.\n\nMark Z.

That effort is on pause as Democratic legislators left the state to deny a quorum for a vote. But other states, led by Democrats and Republicans, could follow suit.What To KnowSome Republicans have criticized states like California and New York mulling redraws but have not commented on Texas. But at least three Republican members of Congress have voiced opposition to Texas' redistricting efforts while also criticizing Democratic states' efforts to redraw their maps.Representative Kevin Kiley, CaliforniaKiley has introduced a bill that would prohibit any state from engaging in mid-decade redistricting.During an interview with WBUR, Boston's NPR affiliate, on Friday, Kiley voiced opposition to the Texas efforts.\"I don't think gerrymandering is a good thing. I think it's a problem wherever it occurs, whether it's in a Republican state or a Democrat state, and I especially think it's bad when it's happening in an unscheduled way, as we're seeing right now,\" Kiley said.When asked about whether it is appropriate for Texas Democrats to be pressured to return—whether by threats to remove the lawmakers who left the state from office or have the FBI locate them—Kiley said people watching the redistricting battle are thinking, \"This is nuts.\"\"This is not the way that the process is supposed to work,\" he said. \"This is not the way politics and representative government is supposed to work, and I think the whole spectacle just underscores the need to have a return to sanity here.\"If California redraws its map, Kiley's district could be redrawn to take in more Democratic areas. Trump carried the district by about four points last year, though Kiley won reelection by about 11 points.Representative Mike Lawler, New YorkLawler is another Republican whose district could be at risk of becoming more Democratic if New York redraws its map. He already represents a district won by former Vice President Kamala Harris last November and is a top target for Democrats as they try to reclaim a House majority.He has introduced a bill to end partisan gerrymandering nationwide as well as mid-decade redistricting.He told CNN this week that he believes what Texas is doing is \"wrong.\"\"The problem is that across the country, gerrymandering has been happening after each successive census, and it's created less competitive districts,\" he said. \"There's very little room in terms of trying to pick up seats.\"Representative Blake Moore, UtahMoore has also spoken out against the redistricting efforts by Texas.\"I do not agree with state efforts to redistrict mid-decade. It undermines established norms and gives blue states a glaring green light to do the same,\" he told local news station KSL. \"Partisan gerrymandering is clearly done by both sides, but to allow this wildfire to spread mid-decade is a step too far.\"When reached by Newsweek, a Moore spokesperson referred to that statement.Newsweek also reached out to Kiley's and Lawler's offices for comment via email.Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, shared a meme about the redistricting battle, comparing Texas Democrats leaving the state to Republicans leaving Washington to avoid a vote on legislation to compel the release of the Epstein files.What People Are SayingHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told Fox News: \"California has a problem. They've got to amend the state Constitution, as I understand the law out there, to do it. We have to fight for every inch of ground in the country. We are in an era of very small margins, as you said, because of gerrymandering and redistricting. But they have to follow the law. I'm convinced the red states will, and we will probably have a few more seats out of that, of course, and that's good news for me.\"New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said during a press conference on Monday: \"If Republicans are willing to rewrite these rules to give themselves an advantage, then they're leaving us no choice; we must do the same. There's a phrase, 'You have to fight fire with fire.' That is a true statement of how we're feeling right now. And as I've said, another overused but applicable phrase, 'All is fair in love and war'— that's why I'm exploring with our leaders every option to redraw our state congressional lines as soon as possible.\"What Happens NextOn Friday, Republicans in Texas were again denied a quorum to pass their redistricting effort. GOP leaders in the state have been considering expulsion of members who left the state, and the FBI could locate the lawmakers. How other states' redistricting efforts play out remains to be seen.","summary":"Some GOP lawmakers have criticized the mid-decade effort by Texas Republicans to redraw the state's congressional boundaries.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-lawmakers-speaking-out-redistricting-battle-2111089","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699466/rep-kevin-kiley-redistricting.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e8e0a1b39573ad2d7ed3f4fe788fdcad","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 21:24:39","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":349446198,"title":"Three years after Mar-a-Lago raid, a powerful Trump looks to settle scores","text":"“This is a stark reminder of a dark time in our country’s history when political enemies of President Trump disgustingly weaponized the justice system to go after him,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said as the anniversary arrived. “The American people saw right through the lies and President Trump was completely vindicated as he overwhelmingly won the 2024 election in historic fashion.”\n\nThe Aug. 8, 2022, raid of Mar-a-Lago was one of many events that Trump described as lawfare in between his first and second terms, including the prosecution of hundreds of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot participants, numerous court cases in multiple states against Trump himself, and even a conviction on 34 felony counts in New York.\n\nWhile some of those later events, in particular Trump’s first indictment in Manhattan in April 2023, were credited with fueling his comeback over GOP rivals such as Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), the raid came before he announced he was running again.\n\nRepublican strategist Dave Carney said that Trump was going to be a force to be reckoned with, no matter what, in the 2024 election cycle, but the raid jump-started his incredible comeback.\n\n“It was a catalyst for the validation of the entire argument that Trump had been making up to that point about criminalization, politicization, and lawfare,” Carney said. “It just proved how desperate [President Joe] Biden’s team was.”\n\nTrump had already returned some records to the National Archives in January of 2022, after the agency identified records from his first term that were not in its possession.\n\nBut the raid came unannounced, while Trump was in another state, leading to outrage among the then-former president and his supporters.\n\n“These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents,” Trump said in a statement that night, claiming agents even “broke into [his] safe.”\n\n“Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before,” Trump continued. “After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024.”\n\nRequests for comment sent to the FBI and Justice Department were not returned. \n\nThree months after the raid, Trump announced his third run for president at the same Mar-a-Lago mansion where the FBI executed its search warrant. Initially, there was some doubt about Trump’s viability against younger upstarts, but he quickly showed his strength and was boosted by the continuation of various court cases against him.\n\n“The decline of America is being forced upon us by Biden and the radical left lunatics running our government right into the ground,” Trump said the night he announced his third run. “This decline is not a fate we must accept.”\n\nAccording to the FBI’s search warrant, agents were directed to seize from the resort “any government and/or Presidential Records created between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021,” as well as “any evidence of the knowing alteration, destruction, or concealment of any government and/or Presidential Records, or of any documents with classification markings.”\n\nAmong the items that the FBI reportedly obtained were Trump’s executive grant of clemency for Roger Stone, information pertaining to the “President of France,” two binders of photos, a handwritten note, and other documents marked confidential, secret, or top secret.\n\nBiden’s staff insisted that he was not aware of the raid and “not briefed” beforehand, but that didn’t stop Trump from attacking him over the issue, especially when classified documents were later foundat Biden’s own Delaware home.\n\n“[The raid] was a hugely gigantic political blunder by the Democrats,” Carney said.\n\nTrump later sued the Justice Department for $100 million in damages in August of 2024, arguing that the search was an “intrusion upon seclusion, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.”\n\nIn the end, the raid was not enough to keep Trump from re-entering the White House, while Biden was forced to drop out of his own reelection bid in favor of then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter retaking office, Trump had all of the documents flown back to Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 28, 2025, the same day as his famous blowup with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. \n\nThe boxes were loaded onto Air Force One that evening in full view of reporters ahead of a flight from Washington to Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump spent the weekend playing golf.\n\nDuring the flight, Counselor to the President Alina Habba told reporters that the search was never justified and that items were taken from Barron Trump’s closet and from first lady Melania Trump’s closet.\n\n“It is truly an honor and full circle to be on this trip,” Habba said. “The boxes are going back, and frankly, this was a hoax, as we knew. … They went into drawers they shouldn’t have. They made a mockery of our justice system, and this is a perfect example.”\n\nHabba said the raid looked like something from a “third world country,” adding that, “In America, you do not get to go to somebody’s home, raid their children’s, their wife’s, their personal belongings… we don’t operate that way in this country.”\n\nNow, with Kash Patel installed as FBI director, many agents involved in the raid have been let go as Trump reworks the federal bureaucracy to fit his vision. \n\nThe Mar-a-Lago raid also led to the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who led the investigation into the Trump classified documents case and into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. But Smith himself is now under investigation, with the tables of power now turned against him and Trump ready to bring what he sees as accountability to the people who engaged in lawfare between his presidential terms. \n\nOther examples of that phenomenon include the Biden autopen investigation, a grand jury investigation to weigh “Russiagate” conspiracy charges against former Obama administration officials, and even subpoenas for Bill and Hillary Clinton as part of an investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIronically, Trump’s own court victories could now help shield Clinton and Obama, as the Supreme Court ruled that presidents enjoy some immunity from prosecution related to their official acts, a fact now weighing in favor of Trump’s Democratic predecessors. \n\nIn any case, the Mar-a-Lago boxes are back in Florida, and Trump now says that they will eventually be displayed in his presidential library. And while it appears that Trump will have the last laugh in the matter, that doesn’t mean that Trump and his team will ever let it go lightly.\n\nTrump to appoint adviser Stephen Miran as Fed governor\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said that the raiders themselves were trying to cover up evidence of their own wrongdoing.\n\n“The Mar-a-Lago raid was a perpetuation and continuation of this same conspiracy,” Miller said. “They went and searched in hopes of trying to recover the documents that would implicate their own criminal conduct. The entire raid was a perpetuation of this same criminal scheme.”","summary":"Three years ago, the FBI raided former President Donald Trump&#8216;s Mar-a-Lago home, taking away 26 boxes that officials said included documents with classified markings.

Gavin Newsom.\n\nPorter, a favorite among progressives who represented Orange County in the U.S. House of Representatives until this year, leads with 18% of voters, up from 12% in April, according to the poll by Emerson College.\n\nThe poll comes as Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, the first woman elected to the office, announced Friday she is dropping out of the race and launching a campaign for state treasurer. She had just 3% support in the poll.\n\nConservative political commentator Steve Hilton, the leading Republican candidate, came in second with 12%. He’s followed by Republican Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 7%, former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5% and billionaire Los Angeles real estate developer Rick Caruso, a Republican-turned-Democrat who has yet to officially jump into the race, at 4%.\n\nThe poll, taken earlier this month, found 38% were undecided, down from 54% in April.\n\nJack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College, said that while the early results are good news for Porter, who lost to Adam Schiff in a bid for U.S. Senate last year, he expected the numbers to move significantly between now and Election Day.\n\n“If I were running one of the campaigns in the low single digits, I’d say we have a lot of room to grow,” he said.\n\nIn a fundraising email Friday, the Porter campaign said the poll showed she is the “clear Democratic frontrunner, with a 13-point lead over the next closest Democrat.”\n\nOn the social media platform X, meanwhile, the Hilton campaign sought to frame the results as confirming a “two-horse race for California governor: Katie Porter v. Steve Hilton.” The state’s last Republican governor was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who held the position from 2003 to 2011.\n\nCalifornia will hold a gubernatorial primary election, including candidates from all parties, on June 2, 2026. The top two vote-getters from the primary will then face off in the general election on November 3, 2026. Newsom, a likely contender for president in 2028, is termed out.\n\n“At this moment, I believe I can make the greatest impact by focusing on California’s financial future,” Kounalakis said in a statement.\n\nPitney said her departure may free up donors who would have backed Kounalakis, a former real estate developer, to support more conservative candidates.\n\n“She had a reputation as a more centrist, business-friendly Democrat,” he said.\n\nThe poll also found that Newsom leads California’s possible contenders in a Democratic presidential primary with 23%. He’s followed by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg at 17%, former Vice President Kamala Harris at 11% and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 9%.\n\nOn the Republican side, 40% support Vice President JD Vance, 10% support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy and 9% support Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nNewsom holds a 44% job approval rating, with 38% disapproving, according to the poll.\n\nOn Friday, the governor hosted Texas Democrats who fled the state in an effort to block redistricting efforts there aimed at electing more Republicans to Congress in next year’s midterm elections. To counter Republicans in Texas, Newsom has floated putting a measure on the statewide ballot allowing California to update its congressional map to benefit Democrats.\n\nThe Emerson poll found 33% support Newsom’s proposal, while 25% oppose and 42% are unsure.\n\n“Support to redraw the state’s congressional map ahead of the Midterm Elections is strongest among Democrats by a 23-point margin, 42% to 19%, and opposed by an eight-point margin among Republicans, 36% to 28%. A majority of independent voters are unsure, while 25% oppose and 23% support,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a statement.\n\nThe poll also found the economy remains the top issue for 30% of California voters, though down from 40% in April. Next came housing affordability at 19%, immigration at 15%, threats to democracy at 13% and health care at 8%.","summary":"The poll comes after former Vice President Kamala Harris announced she would not launch a bid.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/08/california-governor-porter-newsom/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OCR-L-PORTERGOV-0312-10.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 20:14:03","author":"Ethan Varian","authors":["Ethan Varian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005}]}
