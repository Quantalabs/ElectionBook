And in a head-to-head test with Trump, the vice president is 2 points down; she was dead even with the Donald last month.\n\nA deeper dive reveals the changes in the dynamic. Trump is, his campaign says, +13 with independents compared with his 2020 level. He leads Harris by 5 with that pivotal group.\n\nAnd while he’s still down 61 points with black voters, that’s better than the 81-point loss with the cohort he experienced four years ago — and a good reason for Barack Obama’s recent lecturing of black males to support Harris despite qualms supported by this and other data.\n\nTrump is +7 with Hispanics, a group he lost by 25 points in 2020. And he’s just 4 points behind Harris with voters under the age of 45.\n\nPart of that seismic shift in the race can be explained by Harris being seen as an agent of the status quo, despite her best efforts to distance herself from the administration for which she’s worked for nearly four years, says the Trump camp. She can’t “convince the voters that she is ‘the change agent’ in the race, that she will be better on the economy, inflation, immigration, crime, or improving people’s financial situation.”\n\nThese major topics are meaningful, given public polling that delves into these issues in a single battleground or multiples thereof finds Trump with the advantage on all of them — sometimes a double-digit lead.\n\nPer Team Trump’s data, he’s seen as likely to do a better job than Harris as president (49% to 45%) and more likely to bring change (47% to 43%), create jobs (47% to 42%), fight inflation (50% to 40%), improve the economy (50% to 41%) and improve respondents’ personal financial positions (52% to 40%).\n\nBut, as the saying goes, it’s not “just the economy, stupid.”\n\nIt’s also about public safety, and the Trump data say voters don’t trust Harris to guard against menaces, whether they are foreign or domestic.\n\nWhen it comes to fighting crime and keeping neighborhoods safe, an anemic 38% of respondents believe Harris can accomplish that.\n\nAnd on the issue of repelling hostile immigrants and securing the border, a pitiful 28% of those polled think Harris is the one. Trump has a nearly 2-to-1 advantage on this critical matter.\n\nBeyond the issues, Team Trump thinks Harris’ flip-flops on cashless bail, fracking and electric vehicles are tough to square for voters who take in the full context of her radical career notwithstanding a media apparatus that’s facilitated the glow-up.\n\n“She’s tried to re-invent herself at every level. And despite once being dubbed the ‘worst Vice President in the modern era’ by many in the media, they gave her a free pass (much like Harris did with hardened criminals on her watch) as she tried to pull a fast one on the voters. However, as has been reported by a few courageous members of the media, voters in focus group after focus group aren’t buying it and are uncertain about who Kamala really is,” Team Trump says.","summary":"Top operatives from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign are very confident in their ability to close strong in swing states, contending Kamala Harris’ metrics have collapsed in the seven battlegrounds likely to decide the presidential election in just over three weeks.

Referring to Harris as the “border czar” for her role under President Joe Biden to address the root causes of migration, Trump painted a dire picture of an illegal immigration “occupation” in the United States.\n\n“I think the No. 1 issue is the destruction of our country, what’s happened at the border,” Trump said.\n\nAs a result, the rally was heavy on immigration which remains a top concern for voters and one that polls show Trump has an edge over Harris. Trump brought up members of the National Border Patrol Council who endorsed Trump and the former president said he’d back legislation to give them a 10% pay raise. \n\nHarris has campaigned on the bipartisan border legislation that failed the Senate and blamed Trump for tanking the legislation to avoid a solution before Election Day. The Border Patrol union backed that deal despite Trump’s opposition, saying it would be an improvement of the status quo. \n\nSince Biden implemented an asylum executive order this summer, border crossings have fallen to the lowest levels of his presidency.\n\nThe rally featured news footage of citizens frightened by Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua occupying an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, though officials there have pushed back on Trump’s characterization that gangs have taken over the city. \n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced “Operation Aurora” to deport immigrant gang members, using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nTrump reiterated his call for the death penalty for any illegal immigrant who kills an American citizen or law enforcement officer. He also praised former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an originator of tough-on-immigrant policies.\n\n“I will rescue Arizona and every town across America that has been invaded and conquered,” Trump said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nTrump’s Sunday rally caps off a lively campaign week in the Grand Canyon State, which saw visits from Harris in Chandler on Thursday, Sen.

It's also a state with a law that prevents the early processing of mail-in ballots, which dragged out the state's count in 2020. The anticipated lag this year has election officials bracing for conspiracy theories, protests and violence.\"That window of time between the polls closing and races being called, I think, has shown to be a real vulnerability, where people seeking to undermine confidence in those results if they're going to lose have really exploited,\" Schmidt said. Pennsylvania's mail-in ballot processUnlike many other states, Pennsylvania can only begin processing mail-in ballots on the morning of Election Day. It took four days to call the election in Pennsylvania in 2020. As those days passed, leaving the 2020 election results hanging in the balance, all eyes were on the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia. Police and protesters were outside while Schmidt and his fellow members of the Board of Elections oversaw the counting of a record 375,000 mail-in ballots, most of them from Democratic voters.\"When you have half of your voters vote by mail, like we did in 2020, counting those votes takes time,\" Schmidt said.At a ballot intake center in Chester County, elections administrator Karen Barsoum showed the two different envelopes each mail-in ballot arrives in.\"So, hypothetically speaking, if we have 100,000 mail-in ballots, we have to deal with double the amount of the envelopes, which is a long process,\" Barsoum said. Then the ballot comes out and it needs to be unfolded and flattened out to remove creases. In all, it takes several minutes to process each mail-in ballot. Conspiracy theories take off Hours after the polls closed in 2020, then President Trump demanded the counting stop. Schmidt happened to be passing by a TV and heard Trump's speech.\"We don't want them to find any ballots at 4 o'clock in the morning and add them to the list, OK?\" Trump said at the time.Schmidt brought together his communications team so they could reassure voters that the count would continue. Allegations of fraud spread as the mail-in ballots were counted.\"That's when you start hearing about truckloads of ballots. And that's when you start hearing about, you know, zombie voters,\" Schmidt said. \"That's when all this other stuff really starts pouring in.\"At the end of Pennsylvania's days-long count, the state was called for Joe Biden and, with that, he won the White House. But Trump continues to say that he won Pennsylvania in both 2016 — when he won by about 44,000 votes — and in 2020, when he lost by about 80,000 votes. \"I understand that he's a sore loser,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said. \"I understand that he wished he would have won in 2020. But attacking this system made up of our neighbors from communities all across Pennsylvania, Republican and Democrat alike, is not the answer.\"Calls for reform, patience and faith In the wake of those four days in 2020, there were widespread calls to bring Pennsylvania in line with the majority of other states, where election workers get a head start on opening envelopes and flattening mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day. \"Pennsylvania's unique in that we have a divided legislature. We have a Democratic House and a Republican Senate,\" Schmidt said. \"So getting anything done related to election reform has certainly been a challenge.\"He has urged people to be patient with Pennsylvania. \"Our counties are working night and day to count their voters' votes,\" Schmidt said. \"They're doing so as quickly as they can, and with integrity.\"In the leadup to Election Day, Schmidt is doing everything he can to take on the fears Trump continues to spread about Pennsylvania and to assure residents their votes will count.\"Elections in Pennsylvania have never been more safe and secure with a voter verified paper ballot record of every vote that's cast, whether you vote in person on Election Day or you vote by mail,\" Schmidt said.Shapiro appointed Schmidt, who previously worked for a decade on Philadelphia's Board of Elections, to the role of secretary of state last year. The governor was succinct when asked what Schmidt's marching orders were.\"Do your job,\" Shapiro said he told Schmidt. \"Make it so legal, eligible voters have access to the ballot box and that we again have a free and fair, safe and secure election.\"Schmidt is now visiting each of Pennsylvania's 67 counties and meeting with voters. At a fair in deep red Columbia County, Schmidt spent more than 35 minutes trying to convince local Republicans that they can trust the voting system.\"Everything is on the line\"A recent poll found around a third of Americans – and nearly 70% of Republicans – still believe Biden didn't legitimately win the 2020 election. Trump has refused to commit to accepting the results if he loses in November. If that happens, it could cause violence in the state, Shapiro said. It could also mean election officials face threats from Trump supporters.\"Am I worried about that? Am I concerned about that? Of course I am,\" Shapiro said. Schmidt was threatened by Trump supporters after the 2020 vote when Trump called him out by name in a Twitter post. \"There were threats early on that were pretty generic in nature,\" Schmidt said. \"As days went on, they became a lot more specific.\"Those threatening him put out his address and graphically described what they would do to his family, Schmidt said. A picture of his home was shared and his children's names were listed repeatedly. Schmidt temporarily moved his family for their safety. There was round-the-clock security for months. Still, Schmidt is sticking with his job. \"Everything is on the line,\" he said. \"Our entire system of government, our country as it was founded, is on the line.\"","summary":"Voters in Pennsylvania will likely need to wait until after Election Day to find out which presidential candidate won the state's 19 electoral votes.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pennsylvania-election-mail-in-ballot-processing-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/10/842e2017-ba13-4514-adec-37077b8d5a79/thumbnail/1200x630/e4f76907f236b45487a46ba0031fc62f/pa-vote-article.jpg?v=29b5ccc4d237d9b284ce95a42effd073","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/10/13/2379935299740/3262672_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-13 23:00:26","author":"Aliza Chasan,Cecilia Vega","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Cecilia Vega"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":259560832,"title":"Kamala Harris dips in key states, making US election contest a toss-up","text":"The United States presidential election will be held on November 5. In analyst Nate Silver’s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.3–46.5, a slight gain for Trump since last Monday, when Harris led by 49.3–46.2.\n\nJoe Biden’s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2–41.2.\n\nThe US president isn’t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner-takes-all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total).\n\nRelative to the national popular vote, the Electoral College is biased to Trump, with Harris needing at least a two-point popular vote win to be the Electoral College favourite in Silver’s model.\n\nLast Monday, Harris led by one to two points in Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Michigan (15), Wisconsin (ten) and Nevada (six). In the last week, Trump has gained in all these states in Silver’s aggregates, reducing Harris’ lead to about one point in these states.\n\nIf Harris wins these four states, she probably wins the Electoral College by at least a 276–262 margin. Trump leads by less than one point in Georgia and North Carolina, which both have 16 electoral votes.\n\nWhile Harris is still barely ahead in the Electoral College, her margins have been reduced in the states where she’s leading. As a result, Silver’s model now gives Harris a 52% chance to win the Electoral College, down from 56% last Monday. \n\nThis means the presidential election is effectively a 50–50 toss-up. There’s a 23% chance that Harris wins the popular vote but loses the Electoral College. The FiveThirtyEight model\nis giving similar results to Silver’s model, with Harris a 53% favourite.\n\nThere’s still over three weeks until the election, and polls could change in that time. The polls could also be biased against either Trump or Harris, and in this case that candidate could win easily. With the polls across the swing states so close, either candidate could sweep all these states.\n\nI wrote about the US election for The Poll Bludger last Thursday, and also covered the UK Conservative leadership election, the far-right winning the most seats at the September 29 Austrian election and Japan’s October 27 election.\n\nFavourability ratings and economic data\n\nHarris’ net favourability peaked about two weeks ago at +1.4 in the FiveThirtyEight national poll aggregate, but it has now dropped back to net zero, with 46.8% favourable and 46.8% unfavourable. Harris’ net favourability had surged from about -16 after becoming the Democratic nominee, and she gained further ground after the September 10 debate with Trump.\n\nTrump’s net favourability has been steady in the last two months, and he’s now at -9.4, with 52.6% unfavourable and 43.2% favourable. Harris’ running mate Tim Walz is at +4.2 net favourable and Trump’s running mate JD Vance is at -9.6 net favourable. Biden’s net approval remains poor at -14.0.\n\nUS headline inflation rose 0.2% in September, the same increase as in August. In the 12 months to September, inflation was up 2.4%, the smallest increase since 2021. Core inflation increased 0.3% in September, the same as in August, and is up 3.3% in the 12 months to September.\n\nReal (inflation-adjusted) hourly earnings were up 0.2% in September after a 0.3% increase in August, while real weekly earnings slid 0.1% after a 0.6% increase in August owing to changes in hours worked. In the 12 months to September, real hourly earnings were up 1.5% and weekly earnings up 0.9%.\n\nCongressional elections\n\nI wrote about the elections for the House of Representatives and Senate that will be held concurrently with the presidential election three weeks ago. The House has 435 single-member seats that are apportioned to states on a population basis, while there are two senators for each of the 50 states.\n\nThe House only has a two-year term, so the last House election was at the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans won the House by 222–213 over Democrats. The FiveThirtyEight aggregate of polls of the national House race gives Democrats a 47.1–45.9 lead over Republicans, a gain for Republican from a 46.7–44.5 Democratic lead three weeks ago.\n\nSenators have six-year terms, with one-third up for election every two years. Democrats and aligned independents currently have a 51–49 Senate majority, but they are defending 23 of the 33 regular seats up, including seats in three states Trump won easily in both 2016 and 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio.\n\nWest Virginia is a certain Republican gain after the retirement of former Democratic (now independent) Senator Joe Manchin at this election. Republicans have taken a 5.4-point lead in Montana in the FiveThirtyEight poll aggregate, while Democrats are just 2.3 points ahead in Ohio.\n\nRepublicans are being challenged by independent Dan Osborn in Nebraska, and he trails Republican Deb Fischer by just 1.5 points. Democrats did not contest to avoid splitting the vote. In other Senate contests, the incumbent party is at least four points ahead.\n\nIf Republicans gain West Virginia and Montana, but lose Nebraska to Osborn, and no other seats change hands, Republicans would have a 50–49 lead in the Senate. If Harris wins the presidency, Osborn would be the decisive vote as a Senate tie can be broken by the vice president, who would be Walz. This is the rosiest plausible scenario for Democrats.\n\nAdrian Beaumont does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.","summary":"The US election will come down to the results in a handful of key states - and polling indicates it will be very close.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/kamala-harris-dips-in-key-states-making-us-election-contest-a-toss-up-279884.html","image":"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/241216/count.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 23:00:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":259560052,"title":"Iran warns of possible changes to its nuclear weapons program","text":"Iran has threatened to recalculate its nuclear weapons programme if Israel launches a revenge strike as Biden has insisted Tehran is not building nukes. Since Hamas’s October 7 attack last year on Israel triggered a wave of regional hostilities between Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants, officials in Tehran have warned the Islamic republic could change its nuclear doctrine if it faced an existential threat. But they have been deliberately vague about what that might entail.\n\nSanaei-Rad, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, told the Financial Times : ‘Nuclear facilities have their own protocols that both parties must consider during wartime. Any potential response from Iran would undoubtedly reflect on this and have an impact, just as attacks on oil and gas facilities could affect regional energy security and global energy prices,’ he said, hinting that Iran could retaliate by targeting Israel’s nuclear facilities.\n\nIn the past weeks, Israel’s military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group’s setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself.\n\nBeth Sanner, a former US deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is ‘higher now than it has been’ and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon. That would still take time, however. ‘They can’t get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months,’ said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund.\n\nIran threatening to change its nuclear weapons doctrine in the event of an Israeli revenge strike against its key facilities comes after Biden officials in the US said they still believe Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon. The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran’s leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program.\n\n‘We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,’ said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran’s leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The intelligence assessment could help explain US opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion.\n\nHis remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump. US officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran’s nuclear weapons program might only delay the country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran’s resolve to do so. ‘We’re all watching this space very carefully,’ the Biden administration official said. Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program.\n\nIt comes after Tehran has secretly threatened to strike America’s oil-rich allies in the Middle East if their territory or airspace is used for an Israeli attack on Iran. Israeli officials are pushing for damaging strikes on nuclear facilities or oil infrastructure after Tehran fired 180 ballistic missiles at Israel earlier this month. But Iran has now warned that it will respond with ‘devastating hits’ on Israel’s civilian infrastructure and against any Arab states that helped facilitate the attacks, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIran has reportedly threatened several countries hosting American troops, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These states told the Biden Administration that they do not want the US or Israel to use their military infrastructure or airspace in offensive operations against Iran, the officials added. Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60 per cent fissile purity, close to the 90 per cent of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN watchdog.\n\nThe expansion in Iran’s enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to ‘a week or a little more,’ according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate. Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran’s attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the US military. The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran’s energy infrastructure. Israel, however, views Iran’s nuclear program as an existential threat.\n\nThe conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the November 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel. Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, saying: ‘That’s the thing you wanna hit, right?’ Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead. ‘The Iranians have to recalculate what’s next. I don’t think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity,’ he said. ‘They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in.’\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

In analyst Nate Silver’s aggregate of national polls, Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 49.3–46.5, a slight gain for Trump since last Monday, when Harris led by 49.3–46.2.\n\nJoe Biden’s final position before his withdrawal as Democratic candidate on July 21 was a national poll deficit against Trump of 45.2–41.2.\n\nThe US president isn’t elected by the national popular vote, but by the Electoral College, in which each state receives electoral votes equal to its federal House seats (population based) and senators (always two). Almost all states award their electoral votes as winner-takes-all, and it takes 270 electoral votes to win (out of 538 total).\n\nRelative to the national popular vote, the Electoral College is biased to Trump, with Harris needing at least a two-point popular vote win to be the Electoral College favourite in Silver’s model.\n\nLast Monday, Harris led by one to two points in Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Michigan (15), Wisconsin (ten) and Nevada (six). In the last week, Trump has gained in all these states in Silver’s aggregates, reducing Harris’ lead to about one point in these states.\n\nIf Harris wins these four states, she probably wins the Electoral College by at least a 276–262 margin. Trump leads by less than one point in Georgia and North Carolina, which both have 16 electoral votes.\n\nWhile Harris is still barely ahead in the Electoral College, her margins have been reduced in the states where she’s leading. As a result, Silver’s model now gives Harris a 52% chance to win the Electoral College, down from 56% last Monday. \n\nThis means the presidential election is effectively a 50–50 toss-up. There’s a 23% chance that Harris wins the popular vote but loses the Electoral College. The FiveThirtyEight model\nis giving similar results to Silver’s model, with Harris a 53% favourite.\n\nThere’s still over three weeks until the election, and polls could change in that time. The polls could also be biased against either Trump or Harris, and in this case that candidate could win easily. With the polls across the swing states so close, either candidate could sweep all these states.\n\nI wrote about the US election for The Poll Bludger last Thursday, and also covered the UK Conservative leadership election, the far-right winning the most seats at the September 29 Austrian election and Japan’s October 27 election.\n\nFavourability ratings and economic data\n\nHarris’ net favourability peaked about two weeks ago at +1.4 in the FiveThirtyEight national poll aggregate, but it has now dropped back to net zero, with 46.8% favourable and 46.8% unfavourable. Harris’ net favourability had surged from about -16 after becoming the Democratic nominee, and she gained further ground after the September 10 debate with Trump.\n\nTrump’s net favourability has been steady in the last two months, and he’s now at -9.4, with 52.6% unfavourable and 43.2% favourable. Harris’ running mate Tim Walz is at +4.2 net favourable and Trump’s running mate JD Vance is at -9.6 net favourable. Biden’s net approval remains poor at -14.0.\n\nUS headline inflation rose 0.2% in September, the same increase as in August. In the 12 months to September, inflation was up 2.4%, the smallest increase since 2021. Core inflation increased 0.3% in September, the same as in August, and is up 3.3% in the 12 months to September.\n\nReal (inflation-adjusted) hourly earnings were up 0.2% in September after a 0.3% increase in August, while real weekly earnings slid 0.1% after a 0.6% increase in August owing to changes in hours worked. In the 12 months to September, real hourly earnings were up 1.5% and weekly earnings up 0.9%.\n\nCongressional elections\n\nI wrote about the elections for the House of Representatives and Senate that will be held concurrently with the presidential election three weeks ago. The House has 435 single-member seats that are apportioned to states on a population basis, while there are two senators for each of the 50 states.\n\nThe House only has a two-year term, so the last House election was at the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans won the House by 222–213 over Democrats. The FiveThirtyEight aggregate of polls of the national House race gives Democrats a 47.1–45.9 lead over Republicans, a gain for Republican from a 46.7–44.5 Democratic lead three weeks ago.\n\nSenators have six-year terms, with one-third up for election every two years. Democrats and aligned independents currently have a 51–49 Senate majority, but they are defending 23 of the 33 regular seats up, including seats in three states Trump won easily in both 2016 and 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio.\n\nWest Virginia is a certain Republican gain after the retirement of former Democratic (now independent) Senator Joe Manchin at this election. Republicans have taken a 5.4-point lead in Montana in the FiveThirtyEight poll aggregate, while Democrats are just 2.3 points ahead in Ohio.\n\nRepublicans are being challenged by independent Dan Osborn in Nebraska, and he trails Republican Deb Fischer by just 1.5 points. Democrats did not contest to avoid splitting the vote. In other Senate contests, the incumbent party is at least four points ahead.\n\nIf Republicans gain West Virginia and Montana, but lose Nebraska to Osborn, and no other seats change hands, Republicans would have a 50–49 lead in the Senate. If Harris wins the presidency, Osborn would be the decisive vote as a Senate tie can be broken by the vice president, who would be Walz. This is the rosiest plausible scenario for Democrats.","summary":"The US election will come down to the results in a handful of key states - and polling indicates it will be very close.","url":"https://theconversation.com/kamala-harris-dips-in-key-states-making-us-election-contest-a-toss-up-241216","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/625395/original/file-20241013-21-4j3qu4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=11%2C0%2C7708%2C3854&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:43:36","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":259559090,"title":"Trump hears at a Latino campaign event from someone who lived in the US illegally","text":"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Minutes after Donald Trump delivered his standard warnings about drug dealers and criminals illegally crossing the border during a Saturday campaign event, the former president heard from someone who was once in the country illegally but now plans to vote for him.\n\nElias Trujillo was one of several people who spoke Saturday at a Latino roundtable in Las Vegas intended to spotlight Trump’s economic ideas. After Trump finished addressing a small crowd inside the warehouse of a women’s cosmetics company, members of the roundtable spoke. Trujillo began by telling his personal story, how his mother brought him and his brothers from northern Mexico to Utah in 1995 to rejoin their father, who was working in construction.\n\n“We came here legally, but you know, we overstayed, and we were able to make life here in the United States,” Trujillo said, referring to the action of entering the U.S. on a legal visa but not departing when that visa expires.\n\nAt least one person in the audience began laughing and applauding, leading Trujillo to laugh and acknowledge, “It is funny.” Trump smiled as he looked at Trujillo.\n\nThe moment highlighted the contradictory ways the facts and rhetoric of immigration play in the campaign. \n\nThe paradoxes are sharper as Trump has simultaneously counted on increased support from Latinos returning him to the White House even as he has centered his campaign on a dark view of immigration.\n\nTrump has said migrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country, called the recent influx across the southern border an “invasion” and pledged to launch mass deportations if he returns to the White House.\n\nThe day before his Las Vegas roundtable, Trump was in Aurora, Colorado, darkly warning that a Venezuelan gang is terrorizing a city of 400,000 that has become a magnet for migrants from that country. The city’s Republican mayor said Trump is distorting an isolated problem in the city.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump launched his usual criticisms of border policy before pivoting to general praises of the demographic he was courting.\n\n“Hispanic people — they say you can’t generalize, but I think you can — they have wonderful entrepreneurship and they have — oh, do you have such energy. Just ease up a little bit, OK? Ease up,” Trump said. “You have great ambition, you have great energy, very smart, and you really do, like natural entrepreneurs.”\n\nAfter the Las Vegas event, Trump headed to Coachella, California, and accused Harris of having “imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World.” There is no evidence to support Trump’s claims.\n\nTrump has usually smoothed over any apparent conflict between his warnings on immigration and his support from Latino voters since 2016, when he kicked off his first run by warning of “rapists” crossing the southern border. Many Hispanic voters entered the country legally — or have roots in the U.S. going back generations — and oppose illegal immigration.\n\nThe former president and Republican nominee has argued his economic and immigration policies would help Latinos and other minorities, often suggesting contrary to economic data that immigrants are taking what he calls “Black jobs” and “Hispanic jobs.” Around 8 in 10 Hispanic voters say the economy is “one of the most important issues” during this election season, according to a recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Opinion Research poll.\n\nOverall, Hispanic voters are about equally likely to say they have a favorable view of Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent. Trujillo said during his speech that he was initially wary of Trump but has grown to support the former president.\n\nTrujillo described how his lack of legal status made him feel uncertain about what he could accomplish, but how he “had to make the best of my life.” He said he graduated from high school, got married and had two children, now 12 and 5.\n\nHe opened a restaurant that he said is struggling due to the high cost of labor and goods, and said he was hopeful Trump would usher in better economic times.\n\n“I’m happy with the opportunity that Trump has again to run and hopefully get us back on track,” Trujillo said. “I think there’s room to make America greater.”\n\nAfterward, Trujillo said in an interview that though his parents overstayed their visas, they achieved legal status. Likewise, Trujillo has been a U.S. citizen since 2011.\n\nHe said he has come to understand Trump’s vocal opposition to those entering the country illegally due to concerns about drug and sex trafficking.\n\nBut, unprompted, Trujillo said he supports a way for people in the country illegally to obtain legal status, specifically people who have been working and following the law.\n\n“I mean, not an easy pathway, perhaps,” he said. “But there should be a pathway for the ones that are already here illegally, but who have created a life.”\n\nThat proposal has been a hallmark of immigration reform policies for decades. Labeled as “amnesty” by immigration hardliners, opposition to letting people who lived in the country illegally become citizens is part of what led to Trump’s political rise.\n\nRiccardi reported from Denver.","summary":"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Minutes after Donald Trump delivered his standard warnings about drug dealers and criminals illegally crossing the border during a Saturday campaign event, the former president heard from someone who was once in the country illegally...","url":"https://nation.lk/online/trump-hears-at-a-latino-campaign-event-from-someone-who-lived-in-the-us-illegally-279882.html","image":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:30:06","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.017},{"id":259560826,"title":"Coalition seizes Newspoll lead, but other polls have Labor improving","text":"A national Newspoll, conducted October 7–11 from a sample of 1,258, gave the Coalition a 51–49 lead, a one-point gain for the Coalition since the previous Newspoll, three weeks ago. After three 50–50 ties in a row, this is the first time this term the Coalition has led in Newspoll.\n\nPrimary votes were 38% Coalition (steady), 31% Labor (steady), 12% Greens (down one), 7% One Nation (up one) and 12% for all Others (steady). By 2022 election preference flows, these primary votes would normally give a 50–50 tie, so rounding probably contributed to the Coalition’s lead.\n\nAnthony Albanese’s net approval slumped six points to -14, his worst this term in Newspoll, with 54% dissatisfied and 40% satisfied. Peter Dutton’s net approval improved one point to -14. Albanese led Dutton as better PM by 45–37 (46–37 previously).\n\nThe graph below shows Albanese’s Newspoll net approval ratings this term. The data points are marked with plus signs and a smoothed line has been fitted. Albanese’s net approval has been below -10 in two of the last three Newspolls, causing the trend line to turn down.\n\nOther federal polls last week had improvements for Labor, and Essential and Resolve last week both suggest the Middle East conflict has had virtually no impact on Australian party support. It’s possible this Newspoll is a pro-Coalition outlier.\n\nLabor’s primary improves in Resolve poll\n\nA national Resolve poll for Nine newspapers, conducted October 1–5 from a sample of 1,606, gave the Coalition 38% of the primary vote (up one since September), Labor 30% (up two), the Greens 12% (down one), One Nation 5% (down one), independents 12% (steady) and others 3% (down one).\n\nResolve doesn’t usually give a two-party estimate, but applying 2022 preference flows to the primary votes would give Labor about a 51–49 lead, unchanged from September.\n\nAlbanese’s net approval was unchanged at -18, with 53% giving him a poor rating and 35% a good rating. Dutton’s net approval improved one point to -1. Albanese led Dutton by 38–35 as preferred PM, a slight increase from 35–34 in September.\n\nThe Liberals led Labor by 38–26 on economic management (37–26 in September). On keeping the cost of living low, the Liberals led by 31–24 (32–25 previously).\n\nBy 58–29, respondents said they would struggle to afford an expense of a few thousand dollars (57–31 in May). This is the highest “struggle to afford” since Resolve started tracking this question in February 2023, but Labor can take some comfort from the little change since May.\n\nAsked who was most responsible for rising living costs, 36% selected the federal government, 13% global factors, 13% businesses, 12% the Reserve Bank and 8% state and territory governments. Labor incumbent Jim Chalmers led the Liberals’ Angus Taylor as preferred treasurer by 24–18.\n\nIf Australians could vote in the US presidential election, Kamala Harris would lead Donald Trump by 52–21 (50–25 in September). Before Joe Biden’s withdrawal in July, he led Trump by just 26–22 with Australians with 31% for “someone else”. Harris’ net likeability is +24, Trump’s is -47 and Biden’s is -25.\n\nLabor gains lead in Essential poll\n\nA national Essential poll, conducted October 2–6 from a sample of 1,139, gave Labor a 49–47 lead including undecided (48–47 to the Coalition in late September). Primary votes were 34% Coalition (down one), 32% Labor (up three), 12% Greens (steady), 8% One Nation (steady), 1% UAP (down one), 9% for all Others (steady) and 5% undecided (steady).\n\nOn Israel’s military action, 32% said Israel should permanently withdraw from Gaza (down seven since August), 19% said Israel is justified (up two), 18% said Israel should agree to a temporary ceasefire (down three) and 32% were unsure (up eight). \n\nOn the Australian government’s response, 56% were satisfied (up five since August), 30% thought the government too supportive of Israel (down two) and 14% too harsh on Israel (down two).\n\nBy 40–27, voters would support a road user tax for electric vehicle drivers. Just 2% thought the gap between the rich and poor was decreasing, 71% thought it was increasing and 27% staying the same. On Australia’s political system, 48% thought it needs reform but is fundamentally sound, 40% said it needs fundamental change and just 12% said it’s working well.\n\nMorgan poll tied\n\nA national Morgan poll, conducted September 30 to October 6 from a sample of 1,697, had a 50–50 tie, a one-point gain for Labor since the September 23–29 poll.\n\nPrimary votes were 37.5% Coalition (down 0.5), 31.5% Labor (up 1.5), 12.5% Greens (down one), 5.5% One Nation (up one), 9% independents (down 0.5) and 4% others (down 0.5).\n\nThe headline figure uses respondent preferences. By 2022 election preference flows, Labor led by 52–48, a 0.5-point gain for Labor.\n\nACT election and NSW byelections this Saturday\n\nThe ACT uses the Hare Clark proportional method with five five-member electorates to elect its 25-member parliament, so a quota for election is one-sixth of the vote or 16.7%. The ACT is easily Australia’s most left-wing jurisdiction, and Labor has governed since 2001, often in coalition with the Greens. In 2020, Labor won ten seats, the Liberals nine and the Greens six.\n\nThere will also be three NSW state byelections this Saturday in the Liberal-held seats of Epping, Hornsby and Pittwater. Labor won’t be contesting any of these byelections. In Pittwater, Liberal Rory Amon defeated independent Jacqui Scruby by 50.7–49.3 at the 2023 state election. Amon resigned after being charged with child sex offences and Scruby will contest the byelection.\n\nNSW and Victorian state polls\n\nA NSW state Resolve poll for The Sydney Morning Herald, conducted with the federal September and October Resolve polls from a sample of 1,111, gave the Coalition 37% of the primary vote (down one since August), Labor 32% (up two), the Greens 11% (down one), independents 14% (steady) and others 6% (steady).\n\nThe Poll Bludger said the primary votes suggested a “slight two-party advantage to Labor”. Labor incumbent Chris Minns led the Liberals’ Mark Speakman as preferred premier by 37–14 (38–13 in August).\n\nBy 61–23, voters thought the NSW government is not doing enough to help renters. By 53–19, they thought the government should put aside money towards future metro rail projects.\n\nA Victorian state Redbridge poll, conducted September 26 to October 3 from a sample of 1,516, gave the Coalition a 51–49 lead, a one-point gain for the Coalition since a late July Redbridge poll. Primary votes were 40% Coalition (steady), 30% Labor (down one), 12% Greens (steady) and 18% for all Others (up one).","summary":"The latest Newspoll has bad news for the Labor government, but it is out of step with other recent polls.","url":"https://theconversation.com/coalition-seizes-newspoll-lead-but-other-polls-have-labor-improving-240785","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/625393/original/file-20241013-16-2gc3cd.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=21%2C75%2C7106%2C3553&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 22:29:55","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":259558374,"title":"JD Vance Doubles Down Defending Donald Trump's False FEMA Claims","text":"On Sunday, Ohio Senator JD Vance doubled down on defending his running mate former President Donald Trump's false claims about the federal response to Hurricane Helene.After Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane late last month, leaving a trail of destruction along the southeastern United States, Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, began spreading falsehoods about recovery efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).While appearing on ABC News' This Week on Sunday morning, the network's chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz confronted Vance about the claims.\"During Hurricane Helene, as we heard, former President Trump suggested the federal government was not only sending FEMA aid meant for the hurricane to migrants but 'going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.' Do you think that is true?\" she asked.During a campaign rally in Michigan on October 3, Trump said that his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, \"spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants, many of whom should not be in our country.\"The former president also wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform, on September 30 that he didn't \"like the reports that I'm getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,\" referring to North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.In response, FEMA had to make a webpage dedicated to debunking the false claims. On its webpage, the agency writes, \"No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.\"The agency also wrote that it \"provides assistance to survivors regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, English proficiency or economic status.\"In response to Raddatz's question, Vance said, \"What the [former] president said is that fundamentally FEMA aid is distracted by going to illegal migrants...we've got Republican congressmen who are on the ground who represent that area, saying that they have to call the White House to get food and water to [sic] FEMA.\"He added: \"I don't frankly think there's anything malicious going on here Martha, but I do think that we've had an incompetent response to this particular crisis, particularly in Western North Carolina, which to be fair was hit harder than a lot of us expected it...\"Raddatz later interjected and said, \"I want to go back to what former President Trump said. He said, they're 'going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.' There is no truth to that.\"She added: \"Pentagon officials say that active duty troops were staged and ready to go before being called upon and were instantly out the door. So former President Trump is saying things that aren't true about that money being withheld from Republican areas.\"\"I think you're actually confusing staging of resources from the rapid response of the U.S. military,\" Vance responded. \"And I think all the [former] president has said is frankly, what some of Kamala Harris' surrogates have said, which is that if these areas were a little bit more Democratic, maybe Kamala Harris would have focused on them more. That acknowledgment is not to attack, frankly, the good folks of FEMA, it's to suggest that Americans are feeling left behind by their government, which they are Martha...\"Newsweek reached out to Harris' and Trump's campaigns as well as Vance's office via email for comment late Sunday afternoon.Last Monday Harris criticized Trump to reporters for pushing \"disinformation\" about \"what is available, in particular to the survivors of Helene\" from FEMA.\"It's extraordinarily irresponsible.

He is a professor at Columbia University and a former chief economist at the World Bank.\nStiglitz spoke to the Post about the US-China trade war, the economic ramifications of next month’s presidential election in the United States and the future of globalisation. This interview first appeared in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here.\nThe US Federal Reserve announced a half a percentage point rate cut last month, the first in more than four years. What is your view of the US’ economic situation right now and what do Fed rate cuts mean for the US economy and the world?\nI thought that the Fed increased interest rates too far and too fast, because it made a fundamental error of judgment that the inflation we were experiencing was due to excess demand but, in fact, it was a result of the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. I thought that the higher interest rates might actually worsen the problems, not improve them.\nSo, for instance, if we have supply side interruptions, you want to make investments to alleviate them, and the higher interest rates make those investments more difficult. A significant contributor to inflation has been the price of housing, and raising interest rates exacerbates the shortage of housing. So it was exactly the wrong medicine. It was a medicine that hurt the economy. So I am very pleased that they’re lowering interest rates, and I think it will be good for the economy.\nI think the US economy has been very robust. The data says it’s slowing, so the rate cut was a little late. I think they have made a double mistake in that sense, because I didn’t think they should have increased it as much or as fast. I think their rates should have been lower, and we will pay a price for their mistake. I don’t think it’s going to be too high of a price, it’s just that I think they should have cut it earlier.\nLet’s talk about the impact of the US presidential election. What are the respective prospects for the US economy when either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins the November election?\nI think it’s unambiguous that Harris will be much, much better for the economy than Trump. I think Trump’s policy will result in higher inflation and a weaker GDP and more inequality and poorer health. Just to go over them very quickly, the higher inflation is going to be a result of his extremely high increases in the tariffs on China, which particularly hurt ordinary Americans with increased prices of apparel and appliances and so forth.\nHarris may increase the tariffs, but it will be much more moderate. [Trump’s] threat to reduce or eliminate the independence of the Fed will create more uncertainty, which will weaken the economy. The higher inflation will result in the Fed raising interest rates wrongly, but they will do it anyway … and that will weaken the economy. The tax cuts for the rich, if he gets them, won’t stimulate the economy much, but will create more inequality. And of course, if he has his way, he’ll eliminate Obamacare, which will worsen the health status of ordinary Americans. So in every dimension, he’s a danger to our economy.\nWhat will the outcome of the US presidential election mean for trade and economic ties with China?\nI think, quite frankly, both [candidates] are pushing for weaker economic ties, but I think the difference is that Harris will be de-risking, making the US less dependent on China, and in particular making the West, more generally, less dependent on China in certain areas of technology.\nWhereas Trump has a mistaken zero-sum view of the world, and he has no sense of the capacity of economies to adjust. So raising tariffs very rapidly will be a major distortion to the economy, a major disturbance to the economy, both in China and the US, but more in the US, which we will have a hard time adjusting. Tariffs of 10 per cent is one thing, 50 or 60 per cent is another.\n\nApart from China, how do you see the outcome of the election playing out when it comes to the US’ economic ties and cooperation with other countries?\nThe Harris administration will believe in multilateralism, and will be engaged very strongly with promoting good relations with most economies around the world. Not with Russia, obviously, and we’ve already talked about China, but with most other countries a Harris administration will be working very hard to improve relations. There’s often a tension in a country like the US, where money has such an influence in our political system, so that special interests prevail over the national interest. So, for instance, the US has not, I think, pushed for global policies with respect to intellectual property or multinational taxation that would be supported by most countries in the world. So that is going to be a problem. It has been a problem in the Biden administration.\nSome people argue that the Biden administration turned out to be not so different from the Trump one when it came to policies on China. What is your view?\nWell, I think the distinction, as I said before, is that the US wants de-risking and the current administration does not see the world in the same zero-sum way. But it has been, you might say, equally strong, aggressive, in certain areas where they have contended that China has unfairly subsidised, areas which are of particular importance, like electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.\nThere is a big debate in the US. There are two arguments going on. One is the allegation that China’s advantage in EVs and solar panels is because of government subsidies. Many people believe that is not true. The advantage China has in EVs is a result of a process that began 25 years ago of moving in that direction, the larger EV market in China, and the commitment of so much more resources. So it is not that it has been subsidised, but that there has just been more momentum in China.\nThe second is that even if China subsidised solar panels, the need for a green transition is more important than the need to create solar panel jobs, and that we should accept a gift from China of cheap solar panels, because it is very important for the rapid green transition. So my own view is very much that we need to have the capacity to produce both EVs and solar panels, but that the imperative of making a green transition rapidly means that we should not exclude cheap EVs and solar panels from our market, and we should find other ways of developing our capacity.\nWhat I think is, we really are behind in addressing climate change, and so it is really important to use every cheap thing we can, including cheap EVs and cheap solar panels, to make the green transition. But we have to also have our capacity. That is the point of de-risking. We have to have our production capacity.\nSo my view would be, we accept the cheap goods from China and subsidise, if necessary, the production of solar panels and EVs to develop the capacity ourselves. Maybe China will continue being the cheapest producer. We will just have to develop our own capacities, in case something happens.\n\nThe US-China trade war has entered its seventh year. Did you expect it to last this long when it started in 2018?\nWhen it started, I thought of it as mostly a Trump phenomenon, but to be frank, I did hear rumblings from the national security people and bipartisan concerns about excessive exposure to China and that we needed to de-risk. So I think I did [expect it to last]. And one more thing. Trump politicised relations with China in a way that would make it difficult for a Democratic administration to alter the course too much.\nWhat I mean is, you never know the direction of politics, but Trump has, I think, falsely sold the notion that America’s political economic problems were due to China. There was evidence that the rapid increase of imports from China after the accession of China to the [World Trade Organization] did have a very negative effect on the American economy. There is evidence that those places in the country where there was a surge of imports have lower wages, more unemployment and lower property values. So that view is pretty well established now.\nThe question is, do you blame China, or do you blame the US government for not having provided education and help for adjustment to that? We said globalisation was good, but rapid globalisation was a shock. And we didn’t help the people who were hurt by the shock to adjust. It is always much easier to blame others than to accept your responsibility for not having done what you could have done to help adjust to the changing global economic situation.\nWhile the trade war has certainly lasted beyond Trump and does not have a clear end in sight, what do you expect down the road?\nI have three strategic concerns. If we were engaged in a new cold war, including a strategic trade war, I am disappointed that we have not managed our global policies better.\nThe first is we imposed restrictions on sales to China, for instance, of the very nano chips, the most advanced semiconductors. That only motivated China to work faster to develop its own capacity. So I think we were a little bit myopic in not understanding that that was actually helping China. We had a short-term advantage. But by imposing those sanctions, we are actually encouraging China to develop its own capacity faster.\nThe second thing is, we passed a very important bill, the Chips and Science Act in 2022.\nBut at least from my discussions with several people in the industry, and at least in Europe, their view is that as big as that bill was, it was not going to really be able to develop America’s capacity to make chips on its own, at least to the extent necessary for adequate de-risking. So it is naive thinking that we could, in this way, very rapidly increase our own competence in this area.\nAnd the third is if you were waging a new cold war, I would have put more emphasis on winning the hearts and minds of those in the rest of the world, in the emerging markets and developing countries. And I think what we have done there has been a disaster. Just to name a few issues: vaccine apartheid, the position that we have taken in multinational taxation and many arenas where we’ve not been as helpful in the debt crisis. So I think overall, we have failed to win the hearts and minds of the people in the Third World. And you see that in some of the votes at the United Nations.\nThe US government has said these tariffs will benefit and protect the US economy, do you share that view?\nI think I would say it has benefited, but I think we paid a cost, a price, for it. But I think we made a mistake, beginning in 1980 with then-president Ronald Reagan, in weakening our industrial capacity too far, and [the tariffs] are beginning to restore our industrial capacity.\n\nEconomic protectionism appears to have re-emerged around the world. A recent example would be Canada announcing the imposition of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese EVs on August 26. What do you think the impact of this trend has been, and do you see an end to it?\nI think yes, there will be an end to it. I think we’re not going to go to autarky. I think [economic protectionism] has remained very selective so far. I think we may wind up moving towards more regional trade groups, and also political trade groups.\nI could easily see a weakening of trade between China and the West, but a strengthening of trade between the West and other countries in the emerging markets.\nThat is what you would expect, because part of the basis of trade is differences in costs, like the cost of labour. And still with the US, we will want to import goods produced where labour is less expensive.\nBut one of the things that the data has showed so far is that it seems as if China is exporting a lot of goods to countries in Southeast Asia, and those countries are exporting them to the US. So there is indeed a change in the overall patterns of trade, but I am not sure that there is a significant reduction in overall trade, so that we’re not moving into autarky, with every country on its own.\nYou mentioned there will be a rise in regional and political trade groups. Can you give some examples of how you’ve seen this already happening?\nI think this is true. I have not looked at the data that closely, but for example, there has been an increase in trade between the US and Mexico. And I think if China manages its politics correctly, there could be an increase in trade within Asia.\nOne of the problems is that, for a reason that I don’t fully understand, China has been very aggressive in the South China Sea, and that of course is alienating, is a source of concern, for all the countries in the region, and that may be counterproductive for China’s economic relations with those countries. So for very little benefit in security, China seems to be risking its very deep economic integration with the countries in the region. I don’t understand why they are doing it.\nGlobal supply chains appear to be undergoing a shift, with countries such as Vietnam, India and Mexico seemingly becoming increasingly attractive manufacturing hubs in comparison to China. What has been the impact of this?\nI have not studied that closely enough to really make a judgment now, but one of the important things I would emphasise here is that the pandemic showed that our supply chains were not very resilient, and so there is going to be a lot of re-examination of our supply chains in order to make sure that they’re more resilient. And that means, to some extent, having our supply chains closer to home, but also a move away from just-in-time for inventory [management] and other practices that made our supply chains insufficiently resilient.\nHas the world come to the end of globalisation?\nSome people describe the era before 2008 as the era of “hyper-globalisation”. I think that era is over. And actually, in some of the financial flows, you see a decrease, even beginning with the global financial crisis of 2008. I think Trump and the new cold war have accelerated that. But as I said before, it’s not the end of the era of globalisation. It’s the end of “hyper-globalisation”, and it is a restructuring of the patterns of globalisation.\nWhat keeps me up at night, really, is the war in Ukraine, Russia’s aggression\n\nWith trade relations changing, do you think there is hope that economic protectionism can be overcome and will countries be able to find ways to cooperate again?\nI think there will be lots of cooperation, as I mentioned before, in regional groups and politically aligned groups. I think tensions will remain, but I hope that there will be a lot of cooperation in many areas as well. We need to cooperate on the area of climate change. And so the need for cooperation on climate change may itself motivate more cooperation in trade.\nOne thing I could imagine is countries signing on to narrower trade agreements, like green trade agreements. So the next rounds of trade discussion probably may not be of the comprehensive kind, and it has been 30 years since we’ve had a successful comprehensive trade negotiation. It will be more towards a particular sector, and green is the sector that I am the most optimistic about.\nI think the political reality is that the old regime didn’t work out well for a lot of people. It worked out very well for some people, but for many people it did not work out well. And we have to accept where we are and figure out how to work best within the current reality.\nWhat is the thing about the global economy that keeps you up at night?\nWhat keeps me up at night, really, is the war in Ukraine, Russia’s aggression, its attempt to annex an independent country, and what would happen if it were successful to the international rule of law and democracy.\nIf Russia were to prevail – and I worry that if Trump were to win, he might force a settlement that would be a victory, even if only a partial one, for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin – that would undermine the international rule of law, democracy, and would only lead to more problems down the line.

He was talking to men who we're talking about sitting on the sidelines.”\n\nWarnock may well be correct in his prediction; a CBS News national poll released on Sunday found that the percentage of Black voters who said they planned to vote Democratic on the presidential ticket this year matched the 2020 total percentage won by Joe Biden.\n\nBiden remains an enigma, too; while some polling had shown Harris behind her ex-running mate’s 2020 totals among Black men, the incumbent president’s age had already contributed to a falling-off of his support from Black voters from which Harris has already at least partially rebounded.\n\nPolling continues to show the race deadlocked at both the national level and in several swing states. The two candidates are separated by margins in the low single digits in more than a half dozen states, according to surveys.","summary":"Obama, nation’s first Black president, suggested Black men were uncomfortable supporting a woman for the White House","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/barack-obama-black-voters-harris-trump-election-warnock-b2628594.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/13/22/warnock_cnn_oct2024.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/WpKV6b9l-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-13 21:55:56","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":259557782,"title":"Cheney says Mike Johnson ‘knew’ Trump’s election fraud claims were false","text":"Cheney, who has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and is supporting her on the campaign trail, pointed to how Johnson has supported former President Donald Trump’s repeated claims of not legitimately losing the 2020 presidential election.

Taylor at The New York Times.\n\n“The last time the United States tried to secure NATO membership for Ukraine” in 2008 we failed, as Germany and France “were immovable in their opposition.”\n\nBoth “believed they could shape Russian actions by forging closer ties with Moscow — mistakenly, as it turned out.”\n\nAnd “NATO’s failure to offer Ukraine” a path to membership likely gave Vladimir Putin confidence the West wouldn’t act if he invaded.\n\n“The lessons from 2008 for today” include: 1) “NATO membership is necessary to deter Russian aggression.” 2) “To achieve NATO membership for Ukraine, the United States must start early, making it a clear priority for the next NATO summit.”\n\n“Europe will not be secure — and will not be whole and free — until Ukraine is in NATO.”\n\nLiberal: Let Kyiv Be Aggressive\n\nWhile the “Biden administration’s steadfast support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression has been laudable,” Peter Juul argues at the Hill, “the administration persists in setting too many constraints on when and where Kyiv can use U.S. weapons for fear of antagonizing Vladimir Putin.”\n\nThat the fear is unwarranted: “Anything below the threshold of direct NATO involvement will likely not provoke a significant response against the United States or its allies.”\n\nAnd “with new long-range munitions on the way to Ukraine, it’s well past time for the U.S. to remove remaining restrictions on Kyiv’s use of American-supplied weapons.”\n\nThat “can reduce the pressure on Ukrainian forces fighting on the frontlines” as well as erode “Moscow’s capacity for terror attacks against Ukrainian civilians.”\n\nLibertarian: Milei Wins in Rent-Control Rollback\n\n“Argentina has seen enormous benefits from one [Javier] Milei policy: removing rent control,” cheers Steven Greenhut at Reason.\n\nCritics have long “pointed to reams of economic evidence proving that rent control reduces the amount of overall housing and reduces the quality of housing.”\n\nThough “it reduces rent for some tenants,” it “creates scarcity in the housing market and dramatically increases prices for available units.”\n\nNow that “Milei eliminated what The Wall Street Journal termed one of the world’s ‘strictest’ rent-control laws,” Buenos Aires “is undergoing a rental-market boom.”\n\nLandlords are “rushing to put their properties back on the market, with Buenos Aires rental supplies increasing” over 170%. Though “rents are still up in nominal terms,” renters “are getting better deals than ever, with a 40 percent decline in the real price of rental properties” when “adjusted for inflation.”\n\nConservative: Chicago Mayor Johnson Is a Disaster\n\n“Brandon Johnson is rapidly establishing himself as one of the worst mayors in Chicago’s history,” groans City Journal’s John Q. McGinnis.\n\nHis approval rating stands at “an abysmal” 25%, thanks to “a troubling blend of cronyism and incompetence.”\n\nThe ex-teachers-union organizer is pushing the Chicago Public Schools CEO “to secure a $300 million, high-interest loan” to finance a “staggering” 9% pay raise and to hire “nearly 5,000 new teachers, despite declining public school enrollment.”\n\nJohnson also eliminated “the ShotSpotter system” that “aided law enforcement in solving crimes” and is “grappling with a looming $1 billion budget deficit.” \n\nFrom the right: Empress Kamala’s New Clothes\n\nJust as with President Biden, Democrats and the media are “now discovering that even unrelenting hagiography can’t make up” for Kamala Harris’ “enormous liabilities.”\n\nLast week she “embarked on a ‘media blitz,’ and in doing so confirmed the wisdom of all those advisers who fought never to let that happen,” as her “answer to every question is canned, memorized, substance-free.”\n\nAnd the real “problem is bad policies — engineered by Mr. Biden and the progressive left, doubled-down on by Ms. Harris, rejected by voters” — on everything from inflation and immigration to crime, national security and “radical cultural shifts.”\n\nFact is, “even media spin can’t make it appear the empress has clothes.”\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Once the Ukraine war ends, Kyiv “must join NATO,” argues William B.

Vance continue to thrust the federal disaster response squarely into the presidential race.Asked on ABC Sunday talk show \"This Week\" whether Trump has been accurate in describing the federal response as incompetent, Vance said \"it's to suggest that Americans are feeling left behind by their government, which they are.\"Biden took an aerial tour of the devastation in Tampa Bay and nearby St. Petersburg, and received a briefing of storm response efforts.While he described the impact as \"cataclysmic\" in some neighborhoods, Biden said Florida was fortunate it was not worse.Recent polling shows Harris has so far failed to stanch the flow of Latinos from the Democratic fold toward Trump, even as he pushes his sharply anti-immigration message.Data from the latest New York Times/Siena College poll show Harris underperforming other recent Democratic nominees among likely Latino voters, currently earning just 56 percent of the demographic compared to Trump's 37 percent, a margin of 19 points.Biden's 2020 advantage among Latinos was 26 points, while Hillary Clinton's was 39 points in 2016.And while Harris has large advantages with women, particularly women of color, she is struggling to gain traction with Black male voters, a growing number of whom are leaning toward the brash Republican.Polling shows Harris and Trump neck-and-neck, including in the seven swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the election.An NBC News national poll released Sunday shows a 48-48 percent tie. \"As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,\" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted the survey with a Republican pollster Bill McInturff. Speaking at a rally in Greenville later on Sunday, Harris accused Trump of \"not being transparent with the voters,\" pointing to his refusal to release his medical records, or sit down for an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes news program. \"It makes you wonder, why does his staff want him to hide away?\" she said. \"Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?\"A Harris heavyweight surrogate, Democratic ex-president Bill Clinton, was also on the trail Sunday in battleground Georgia, where he spoke at Mount Zion Baptist Church, a historically Black congregation.Both candidates hold campaign events in the biggest swing state prize of all, Pennsylvania, on Monday.","summary":"Kamala Harris and rival Donald Trump are campaigning in

presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to bring back U.S. manufacturing and lower costs, relying on tariffs to boost U.S. coffers and exert pressure on other countries -- but the reality is less straightforward.\n\nAhead of November's election, economists warn his policies could raise consumer prices and shake up global trade -- with unclear benefits to U.S. production.\n\nThe pitch is for tariffs to add billions in revenue and take aim at countries like China which have been \"ripping us off,\" while pushing businesses to bring production back on U.S. shores.\n\n\"Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world,\" Trump said in his September debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nHe told a rally in Michigan last week: \"Tariffs, to me, are the most beautiful word.\"\n\nThe former president has vowed a 10 percent to 20 percent across-the-board tariff on imports and a 60 percent rate on Chinese goods -- more recently threatening a 200 percent levy on automobiles made in Mexico.\n\nIt is U.S. businesses -- not foreign governments, as Trump often asserts -- that pay import taxes on overseas purchases when there are tariffs on such goods, and they can pass on the higher costs, which could add to inflation.\n\nAlongside his tariff plans, Trump wants to extend expiring tax cuts and lower corporate income tax further.\n\nBut proposed tariffs could counteract the benefits from his tax policy \"while falling short of offsetting the tax revenue losses,\" said the Tax Foundation think tank.\n\nU.S. inflation could rise 1.3 percentage points above baseline next year if Trump imposed a 10 percent universal tariff and other governments retaliate, said the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE).\n\nSharp hikes on Chinese goods would also fuel inflation, the institute added.\n\nOthers, like Bernard Yaros of Oxford Economics, estimates a Trump presidency could raise inflation by 0.6 percentage points at its peak.\n\nPreviously, businesses bore the brunt as imported components got more expensive, said Kyle Handley, professor at UC San Diego.\n\nBut he noted: \"If they do an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent to 20 percent, there's no way we're not going to see that on store shelves.\"\n\nAnd it is unlikely that manufacturing can return to the United States in short order.\n\n\"We haven't made TVs in the U.S. in decades,\" Handley said, adding that U.S. factories are not producing at the scale needed to satisfy consumption either.\n\nTrump claims earlier tariff hikes on China and others brought no inflation.\n\nBut Handley estimates the supply chain frictions exporters faced were equivalent to a two to four percent tariff hit -- and companies tell AFP they have had to pass on some costs.\n\nA 2019 paper in the Journal of Economic Perspectives found that by end-2018, import tariffs were costing U.S. consumers and importers an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax costs.\n\nTrump's tariff plans could also slash bilateral U.S.-China trade by 70 percent, redirecting or eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of exchanges, said Oxford Economics.\n\nU.S. trade volumes could be cut by 10 percent, becoming more centered on North American and other free trade agreement partners, the advisory firm added.\n\nWhile the added tariffs would raise some $500 billion in revenue annually, rerouted trade from China could slash this figure closer to $200 billion per year eventually, Yaros said.\n\nOther proposals like revoking a status that shields China from various U.S. levies -- \"permanent normal trade relations\" -- could also raise inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025, PIIE added.\n\nAlthough Trump wants a \"reciprocal trade act\" where \"countries that make us pay a tax to do business with them will be charged the same tax when they send their product into the United States,\" Yaros believes this is less likely as it requires bipartisan Congressional support.\n\nTrump regularly promises to eliminate inflation, too -- a critical voter concern -- saying he would slash energy bills in half within a year.\n\nAnalysts expect that this refers to more deregulation in the domestic oil and gas sector.\n\nBut Yaros expressed skepticism that this would \"unleash significantly greater production\" given that it depends on major energy producers, who in turn have shareholders to answer to.\n\nWhile Trump wants to lower food costs by allowing less foreign agricultural products into the country, economists have noted that import barriers could trigger retaliation.\n\nThis could harm U.S. farmers who export significantly.","summary":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to bring back U.S. manufacturing

guess, second time’s the charm?\" \n\nGrande, who first hosted in 2014, was doing it for the first time without also serving as musical guest — a role that fell to Stevie Nicks — and promised not to sing, before breaking into a song. \n\nThe theme continued as she vowed during the tune not to do her signature impressions of Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus and Gwen Stefani, before throwing out a bit of each. She would do a much longer version of Celine Dion in a sketch later in the show.\n\nGrande hosted in promotion of her movie musical “Wicked,” the “Wizard of Oz” prequel set to be released next month. \n\nShe said playing the good witch Glinda as she does in the film is the dream of every theater kid like her, after “losing their virginity.” \n\nGrande's episode comes amid a ratings spike for the sketch institution, likely brought on by its 50th season, and election season. Last month's season premiere brought in the most viewers since 2020. \n\nJust as in the first two episodes of the new season, Maya Rudolph played Vice President Kamala Harris in the night's cold open, leading a group of former cast members returning as guest stars, including Andy Samberg as Harris' husband Doug Emhoff and Dana Carvey as President Joe Biden. \n\nThey teamed up for an election edition of “The Family Feud,\" taking on team Trump. \n\nKenan Thompson, the longest-tenured cast member in the show's history who began in 2003, reprised his long-running role as “Feud” host Steve Harvey and asked Rudolph-as-Harris about her recent media blitz. \n\n“It’s been a hell of a week,\" she said. \"I went on Howard Stern to reach the horny cab drivers, I went on ‘The View’ for the horny moms, and I also went on the podcast ‘Call Her Daddy’ because I have a message for young women: You need to go to the ballot box if you want the government out of your ballot box.”\n\nCurrent cast member James Austin Johnson returned as Donald Trump, saying his opponent is \"going to be horrible at this game. She’s a very low IQ person. The whole world is laughing at her because they don’t respect her.”\n\nThe 76-year-old Nicks was the “SNL” musical guest for the first time in more than 40 years. She opened with her brand new single, “The Lighthouse,” but the look of the performance was classic Stevie, with an abundance of rings and scarves and the singer draped in black. For her second song, she reached back with “Edge of Seventeen” from 1981. \n\nMichael Keaton is set to host next week with musical guest Billie Eilish. John Mulaney and Chappell Roan are set for the following Saturday.\n\nThe onset of season 50 already has brought reflection and nostalgia in many forms, including “Saturday Night,” a movie comedy dramatizing the minutes before the first episode of the Lorne Michaels-helmed sketch institution on Oct. 11, 1975. \n\nA three-hour primetime special on Feb. 16 is set to serve as the official 50th season celebration.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

President Joe Biden visited Florida for the second time this month to survey storm damage.\n\nHarris, the Democratic presidential nominee, did not speak Trump's name, but he is most prominent among those promoting false claims about the Biden administration's response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Florida was in the path of both storms, with Helene also hitting North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, while Milton headed for the open Atlantic.\n\nThe vice president spoke at Koinonia Christian Center about the “heroes” all around who are helping residents without regard to political affiliation.\n\n“Yet, church, there are some who are not acting in the spirit of community, and I am speaking of these who have been literally not telling the truth, lying about people who are working hard to help the folks in need, spreading disinformation when the truth and facts are required,” Harris said.\n\n“The problem with this, beyond the obvious, is it's making it harder, then, to get people life-saving information if they're led to believe they cannot trust,” she said. “And that's the pain of it all, which is the idea that those who are in need have somehow been convinced that the forces are working against them in a way that they would not seek aid.”\n\nHarris said they are trying “to gain some advantage for themselves, to play politics with other people's heart break, and it is unconscionable,” she said. “Now is not a time to incite fear. It is not right to make people feel alone.”\n\n“That is not what leaders, as we know, do in crisis,” she said.\n\nTrump made a series of false claims after Helene struck in late September, including saying that Washington was intentionally withholding aid from Republicans in need across the Southeast. The former president falsely claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency had run out of money to help them because it was spent on programs to help immigrants who are in the United States illegally.\n\nHe pressed that argument on Fox News Channel, saying the White House response was “absolutely terrible” and repeating the claim about FEMA's dollars. “It came out from there and everybody knew it,” Trump said in an interview that was taped Thursday and broadcast Sunday.\n\nBefore Harris spoke in church, Biden was surveying hurricane damage on a helicopter flight between Tampa and St. Pete Beach on the Gulf Coast. From the air, he saw the torn-up roof of Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team. On the ground, the president saw waterlogged household furnishings piled up outside flooded homes. Some houses had collapsed.\n\nThe president said he was thankful that Milton was not as bad as officials had anticipated, but that it still was a “cataclysmic” event for many people, including those who lost irreplaceable personal items. He also praised the first responders, some of whom had come from Canada.\n\n\"It's in moments like this we come together to take care of each other, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans,\" Biden said after he was briefed by federal, state and local officials, and met some residents and responders. “We are one United States, one United States.”\n\nHarris opened her second day in North Carolina by speaking Koinonia Christian Center in Greenville, part of her campaign's “Souls to the Polls” effort to help turn out Black churchgoers before the Nov. 5 election. She planned a rally later Sunday to talk about her economic plans and highlight Thursday’s start of early voting in the state, her campaign said.\n\nThe North Carolina appearances mark the start of a week that will find Harris working to shore up support among Black voters, a key constituency for the Democratic Party. She is counting on Black turnout in competitive states such as North Carolina to help her defeat Trump, who has focused on energizing men of all races and has tried to make inroads with Black men in particular.\n\nOn Tuesday, she will appear in Detroit for a live conversation with Charlamagne tha God, a prominent Black media personality.\n\nBlack registered voters have overwhelmingly favorable views of Harris and negative views of Trump despite his attempts to appeal to nonwhite voters, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. But the poll also shows that many Black voters aren’t sure whether Harris would improve the country overall or better their own lives.\n\nIn Florida, which Biden had visited the Big Bend region on Oct. 3 after Helene struck, the president announced $612 million for six Department of Energy projects in hurricane-affected areas to bolster the region’s electric grid. The money includes $47 million for Gainesville Regional Utilities and $47 million for Switched Source to partner with Florida Power and Light.\n\nWith a little more than three weeks before the election, the hurricanes have added another dimension to the closely contested presidential race.\n\nTrump has said the Biden administration’s storm response was lacking, particularly in western North Carolina after Helene. Biden and Harris have hammered Trump for promoting falsehoods about the federal response.\n\nBiden said Trump was “not singularly\" to blame for the spread of misinformation but that he has the \"biggest mouth.”\n\n“They blame me for everything. It's OK,” Trump told Fox.\n\nBiden has pressed for Congress to act quickly to make sure the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get through hurricane season, which ends Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. He said Friday that Milton alone had caused an estimated $50 billion in damages.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose department oversees FEMA, said the hurricane season is far from over and there are other natural disasters for which the agency must ready.\n\n“We don’t know what’s coming tomorrow, whether it’s another hurricane, a tornado, a fire, an earthquake. We have to be ready. And it is not good government to be dependent on a day-to-day existence as opposed to appropriate planning,” Mayorkas said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said there was plenty of time and that lawmakers would address the funding issue when Congress comes back into session after the Nov. 5 election.\n\n“We’ll provide the additional resources,” Johnson told CBS.\n\nMilton made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday evening. At least 10 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of residents remain without power. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for widespread evacuations.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

One photo album still lay scattered in the street.\n\n“I know you’re concerned about the debris removal and it’s obvious why,” he said during the news conference in St Pete Beach. “There’s much more to do. We’re doing everything we can.”\n\nFlooding is expected to continue around Tampa Bay as well as in the Sanford area northeast of Orlando as river waters continue to rise, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAbout 75 percent of Florida’s power is back online, with full restoration expected by Tuesday evening, said Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who travelled with Biden.\n\nMore gasoline distribution sites are also scheduled to open on Sunday, according to the state’s emergency operations centre.\n\nBut five days after the storm hit, about 927,000 customers still do not have power, according to the online tracker PowerOutage.us.\n\n“It’s still a mess,” Liz Alpert, the mayor of Sarasota, a city south of Tampa, told ABC News’s This Week programme.\n\nAlpert added, however, that “it’s been heartening to see all of the outpouring of support and help that people have been offering”.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden announced $612m in funding for six Department of Energy projects in hurricane-affected areas to bolster the region’s electric grid.\n\nThe Democratic president also reiterated his call for US lawmakers – on recess until after the November 5 presidential election – to return to Washington, DC to approve more federal support for post-hurricane relief.\n\nSt Pete Beach Mayor Adrian Petrila, speaking alongside Biden, echoed the call for help.\n\n“We’re concerned about the future of our town,” Petrila said.\n\n“We need continued federal resources and we need a path forward to ensure that our community and all other communities, all other cities who were devastated just like this town, can emerge stronger than ever before.”\n\nThe Biden administration’s response to the hurricanes has become a political issue just weeks before the election, which is set to pit Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris against her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has accused Biden and Harris of not doing enough to respond to the storms.\n\n“A lot of governors have done a good job but the response from the White House has been absolutely terrible.

According to ABC 7, two children were in the home where drugs were allegedly being processed and stamped “COVID-19.”\n\nThe Fox article continued:\n\nAccording to district attorney Ray Tierney, the amount of fentanyl recovered is enough to kill every man, woman and child on Long Island.\n“Gone are the days of cocaine and heroin, although they’re still out there, they’re now being mixed with these more lethal types of lab created drugs,” Tierney said. “We’re looking at taking out these major traffickers and disincentivizing what’s otherwise a lucrative trade.”\n\nAuthorities also seized eight kilograms of cocaine, over a pound of xylazine, and $80,000 cash.\n\n“This bust follows another recent Suffolk County seizure of carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer that is about 100 times more potent than fentanyl and is known on the streets as ‘Super Mario.’ Authorities warn of the increasing danger these drugs pose as they continue to flood the streets,” the outlet stated.\n\nIn March, Peter Schweizer, who is the author of Blood Money: Why the Powerful Turn a Blind Eye While China Kills Americans, said during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday that fentanyl is a “Chinese operation much more than it is a Mexican drug cartel operation.”\n\nThe article continued:\n\nSchweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) and senior contributor at Breitbart News, explained how the Chinese are using fentanyl as a weapon against the United States.\n“A lot of the people involved in the fentanyl trade actually have senior positions in the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] or they’re advisers to the CCP government, but the links in this chain of fentanyl that is poisoning 100,000 Americans, every link in that chain is a Chinese operation,” Schweizer said, explaining that the Mexican cartels are “really the junior partners.”\n\nIt is important to note that Vice President Kamala Harris (D), who is campaigning against former President Donald Trump (R) for the White House in 2024, has said she will “stop the flow of illegal fentanyl” into the United States, Breitbart News reported in September.\n\nHowever, the article noted that “drug-related deaths hit a record high on Harris and President Joe Biden’s watch.”","summary":"Authorities in New York have reportedly seized enough fentanyl to kill every person on Long Island from a home in Bellport.\n\n\nThe post VIDEO: NY District Attorney Says Drug Bust Yielded Enough Fentanyl to Kill Every Person on Long Island appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2024/10/13/video-ny-district-attorney-says-drug-bust-yielded-enough-fentanyl-kill-every-person-long-island/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/10/suffolk-county-district-attorney-raymond-91435954-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 21:13:12","author":"Amy Furr","authors":["Amy Furr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":259553876,"title":"Armed man arrested near Trump campaign rally in California","text":"A man found illegally in possession of shotgun and a loaded handgun was arrested by sheriff’s deputies assigned to protect a Donald Trump rally in Coachella, California, the Riverside County sheriff’s office said on Sunday.\nIt said the deputies, manning a checkpoint near the rally, arrested 49-year-old Vem Miller of Las Vegas as he drove up in a black SUV.\nThey later charged him at a local detention centre on charges of possessing a loaded firearm and a high-capacity magazine.\n“This incident did not impact the safety of former president Trump or attendees of the event,” the statement said.\n\nThe sheriff’s office offered no immediate information on Miller’s intentions. He was released on bail and faces a court hearing on January 2.\nBut coming on the heels of two assassination attempts – one in Pennsylvania in which a bullet grazed Trump’s ear, and a second, aborted attempt at his Florida golf course – the arrest raised concerns.\nThere was no immediate comment from either the Trump campaign or the US Secret Service, which is charged with protecting top officials and candidates.\nThe sheriff’s office said it would provide additional details at a briefing later on Sunday.

Six more fuel distribution sites were scheduled to open on Sunday, according to the state’s emergency operations center.

While Milton was less destructive than officials initially forecast, analysts have estimated insured losses of between $30 billion and $60 billion.\n\nBiden has approved federal aid to help residents and local governments cover expenses and on Sunday announced $612 million for six new utility projects in affected communities. But while the Federal Emergency Management Agency has funding to meet immediate needs, his administration is seeking more money from Congress given the potential for more disasters and seven more weeks until the hurricane season ends. Biden, a Democrat, reiterated his call for U.S. lawmakers — on recess until after the Nov. 5 presidential election — to return to Washington to approve more FEMA money, telling reporters as he left the state Congress needs to move quickly: “It’s important.”\n\nBut Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson resisted White House and state lawmakers appeals to approve more disaster assistance, telling NBC News’ “Meet the Press” program: “The states have to go and calculate and assess the need and then they submit that to Congress, and that takes some time.” Relief efforts have also been hampered by a trail of misinformation, including by Republican lawmakers and former President Donald Trump, who is challenging U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris for the White House, as politics infiltrates the storm recovery with just three weeks before the election.\n\nA number of local officials greeted or accompanied Biden on his tour, including Florida Republican U.S. Representative Anna Luna.

He said the state would remove as much debris as possible within the next three months to take advantage of federal aid.\n\nFloridians and others in the eastern U.S. may get a reprieve as clean up continues.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday the agency has enough funding for “immediate” needs but stressed that Congress will need to act swiftly to sufficiently fund the agency when it returns after the election.\n\nThe $612 million in funding Biden announced Sunday, which comes as almost 1.5 million customers struggle with power outages, includes $94 million for projects specifically in Florida, a White House official said, with $47 million going to Gainesville Regional Utilities and $47 million for Switched Source to partner with Florida Power and Light.\n\n“These investments are part of the President’s commitment to making long-term investments that protect, enhance, and upgrade our nation’s electric grid, especially in the face of extreme weather events,” the official said in a statement Saturday.\n\nThe funds will be disbursed through the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships Program.\n\nBiden’s visit to St. Petersburg to survey damage from Hurricane Milton came after separate trips the president made earlier this month to Florida, along with visits in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina to tour areas ravaged by Hurricane Helene.\n\nWhile presidential visits to disaster areas are almost always nonpartisan affairs that serve to demonstrate federal and state governments transcending politics to work together, that effect is amplified now that Biden is no longer a candidate for president in the 2024 election.\n\nBiden has frequently been in touch with Republican leaders, including the governors of Florida and Georgia and conservative members of Congress throughout Southeast areas hit by the hurricanes – and praise is frequently swapped between the state and local levels.\n\nThe president held the event Sunday alongside staunch Florida Republicans Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna. However, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did not appear alongside the president.\n\nBiden turned to bipartisanship when asked about DeSantis, admitting he hadn’t talked to the Florida governor Sunday but adding that “Republicans and Democrats are happy” with the federal response to the storm.\n\nIn moments like this, Biden said, “we come together to take care of each other, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. … We are one United States.”\n\nThe president has been especially complimentary toward state and local officials’ efforts to discourage their constituents from spreading false rumors and misinformation – as leaders say they have led to threats against relief workers on the ground and caused residents to avoid seeking the aid that they need. During this trip, Biden did not mention misinformation being spread by some of his critics after the hurricane.\n\n“Conservative, hardcore” Republicans in impacted areas, he said on Friday, “are standing up and saying, ‘It’s got to stop.’”\n\nBut the veneer of bipartisanship has been slower to translate to Vice President Kamala Harris, who has also been touring disaster sites and in touch with state and local officials. DeSantis and Harris both accused each other of playing politics after reports that DeSantis ignored calls from Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. In response, DeSantis pointed out that he’s been in touch with Biden and that Harris as vice president has no role in the federal government’s response.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

During a \"White Dudes for Harris\" livestream in July, a fundraising initiative aimed at helping spark Harris support among white males, the Minnesota governor touted his \"progressive values\" and condemned critics who refer to them as socialism.\"Don't ever shy away from our progressive values,\" he said during the livestream. \"One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.\"Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, responded in August to the socialism remark and shared a compilation of various clips featuring Walz, on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote, \"This is the most radical ticket in American history.\"In an interview on Fox News Sunday, host Shannon Bream asked Walz about his use of the word \"socialism\" during that livestream in which she cited Merriam-Webster's definition of socialism, which the dictionary defines it as \"a system of society or group living in which there is no private property,\" adding that \"means of production are owned and controlled by the state.\"\"Did you mean to advocate for that here in the U.S.?\" Bream asked.Walz responded \"no,\" and explained that there are things society must do collectively.\"Republicans oftentimes talk about socialism, and what I would make the case of is we build our roads collectively together. I don't think anybody's arguing that you should have to build your own road from your house to your business place or whatever. So, I said this definition that the right uses about these things that we collectively do together, that look I believe in moral capitalism. I believe capitalism works and it lifts everyone up, but I also believe you have to make sure there's things we collectively do together.\"He added: \"The point being on this is trying to divide that, but you certainly can't have capitalism that says billionaires get everything and the middle class gets nothing, and I think Kamala Harris' point on this is lifting up the middle class.\"Newsweek has reached out to Walz's spokesperson via email for comment.During a campaign rally in New Hampshire last month, Harris proposed a billionaire tax if she's elected president.\"Billionaires and big corporations must pay their fair share in taxes,\" she said. \"It's just not right that those who can most afford it are often paying a lower tax rate than our teachers and our nurses and our firefighters.\"When pushed by Bream on Sunday as to whether the use of the word was a \"knucklehead thing,\" Walz continued to defend using the term, saying it is \"what the right uses.\"\"Donald Trump [the GOP nominee] says that this is a socialist or Marxist government, Kamala Harris is actually doing just the opposite of that, creating a free economy that works and people can grow into the middle class,\" the governor added.The interaction between Bream and Walz has since been posted to X by journalist Aaron Rupar, which garnered as of Sunday afternoon more than 517,000 views.During the presidential debate between Trump and Harris in early September, the former president claimed that Harris was a \"Marxist.\"\"She's a Marxist. Everybody knows she's a Marxist. Her father is a Marxist professor in economics, and he taught her well,\" he said during the debate.Trump previously dubbed Harris \"Comrade Kamala\" on social media and said his opponent is \"a communist\" during a recent podcast interview with former Navy SEAL Shawn Ryan.Meanwhile, Walz also previously defended himself making a similar comment on MSNBC in late July, claiming socialism is a buzzword for GOP critics.\"I have to tell you, they scream socialism, we just build roads, and we build schools and we build prosperity into this,\" the governor said.","summary":"\"Don't ever shy away from our progressive values,\" Walz previously said. \"One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tim-walzs-response-socialism-criticism-takes-off-online-1968325","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2494268/tim-walz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 20:59:19","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":259553102,"title":"Harris Blasts Trump For Urging Military Crackdown On ‘Radical Left’ On Election Day: ‘Enemy From Within’","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said Sunday he believes “the enemy from within” is the biggest threat for “chaos” on Election Day and suggested the National Guard or military be used against them—a comment that immediately drew criticism from Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris’ campaign said former President Donald Trump’s words “should alarm ... [+] every American who cares about their freedom and security.”\nGetty Images\n\nWhen Trump was asked by Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo whether he was concerned about “chaos on Election Day” from “outside agitators,” Trump said he thinks the “bigger problem is the enemy from within, not even the people that have come in destroying our country.”\n\nTrump went on to say the “bad people” from within include “radical left lunatics,” and that “it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary by the military.”\n\nHarris' campaign released a statement Sunday afternoon saying Trump’s comments suggesting “his fellow Americans are worse ‘enemies’ than foreign adversaries”—along with his past comments about being “a dictator on ‘day one’” and terminating the Constitution—“should alarm every American who cares about their freedom and security.”\n\nHarris’ running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to criticize Trump’s comment, saying “His own advisors have warned that he’s unfit to ever step foot inside the Oval Office again … Trump is too risky for us to take a chance on.”\n\nSteven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, stood by the comments in a statement to Forbes, saying Trump “is 100% correct—those who seek to undermine democracy by sowing chaos in our elections are a direct threat, just like the terrorist from Afghanistan that was arrested for plotting multiple attacks on Election Day within the United States” (an Afghan national was charged last week with allegedly plotting Election Day attacks).\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Throughout his campaign, Trump has toyed with the idea of using the U.S. military on American soil rather than overseas, the Associated Press reported, suggesting he could station troops at the U.S. borders and use them more for confronting civil unrest. He has made removing undocumented immigrants from the country a key campaign message of his and has suggested military or National Guard personnel could assist with deportations, saying as recently as Friday in Colorado, “we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them out of our country.” Democrats have criticized Trump’s extreme language and anti-immigration rhetoric. When Trump was spreading false claims about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said “spreading this kind of hateful conspiracy theories is indeed very dangerous.” Harris similarly denounced Trump’s “hateful” rhetoric, saying in September, “when you have that kind of microphone in front of you, you really ought to understand at a very deep level how much your words have meaning.”\n\n2.4 points. That’s how much Harris is leading Trump by as of Sunday at 4 p.m. EDT, according to FiveThirtyEight’s national average. RealClearPolitics’ polling center shows the race slightly closer, with Harris leading Trump by an average of 1.7 points.\n\nTrump also used the phrase “enemy from within” on Saturday to refer to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a longtime Trump foe who is running for Senate. Trump said at a rally in Coachella, California, that Schiff “conceived of the Russia hoax” and is “a sick person.” Schiff responded to the comments on X, saying: “Yet another nonsensical rant about me filled with tired insults, lies about voting booths, and more … Seriously, Donald. Why are you so obsessed with me?”\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesHarris Denounces ‘Hateful’ Springfield Rhetoric: ‘A Crying Shame’By Molly BohannonFox NewsTrump: The 'enemy from within' is more dangerous than any foreign country | Fox News VideoAP NewsTrump tested the limits on using the military at home.

I put free speech in quotations because we're not talking about the kind of free speech people fight and die for under dictatorships or theocracies.\n\nMusk's idea of \"freedom\" is amplifying hate speech, sowing misinformation, stoking conspiracies, propping up nationalists in places like India and Argentina, and complying with censorship requests from authoritarian regimes like Turkey's.\n\nAs for our presidential race here at home, Musk's misleading election claims on X were viewed 1.2 billion times between January and July of this year, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\n\nThen there's the creepy posts, like the one aimed at Taylor Swift after she endorsed Kamala Harris on Instagram, and signed off as \"Childless Cat Lady.\" \"Fine Taylor … you win,\" Musk wrote on X last month. \"I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.\" Gross.\n\nMusk recently amplified the false claims and conspiracy theories that Federal Emergency Management Agency officials were \"actively blocking\" relief shipments to victims of Hurricane Helene, \"seizing goods … and locking them away to state they are their own.\"\n\nMusk also propagated the politically motivated MAGA-verse lie that FEMA was short on funds because it had spent too much on undocumented migrants. He accused the agency of \"treason\" and wrote incorrectly that the agency \"used up its budget ferrying illegals into the country instead of saving American lives.\" So much for helping fellow Americans in their time of need.\n\nThe richest man in the world instead used his megaphone to lie to disaster victims, telling them that help was not on the way. The false information dovetailed with election propaganda benefiting the Trump campaign.\n\nMusk's propensity to align himself with chaos monkeys on the far right would still be unfortunate, but far less damaging if his leanings weren't also dictating policy for the nearly 200 million daily X users worldwide.\n\nSince Musk's purchase of Twitter, he's made it harder to identify which accounts are trustworthy thanks to selling the blue \"verified\" check mark rather than vetting users to see whether they truly are who they claim to be.\n\nX subsequently began sharing ad revenue with its \"premium\" users, so users get paid by advertisers for their engagement. And guess which posts garner the most attention? Sensational fabricated news, troll attacks and hateful racist/sexist/homophobic rhetoric.\n\nHe also reinstated formerly banned accounts, such as that of professional misogynist Andrew Tate, rapper Kanye West, who was deplatformed for his antisemitic tirades, and Donald Trump.\n\nPre-Musk, when X was Twitter, the social media platform was often referred to as a \"global town square.\" It was a place to check for the latest on a fast-moving news cycle, and much of the media used the platform to push out breaking stories or circulate their work because Twitter was often faster than news platforms and gave their stories more exposure.\n\nIf X is a town square, it's inundated with a right-wing mob marching unpoliced through otherwise crowded streets. And Musk is their cheering benefactor.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk declared that the super PAC he created is offering $47 to anyone who registers as a swing-state voter and signs a petition supporting the 1st and 2nd Amendments to the Constitution. \"Easy money!\" he posted.\n\nMusk showed up at Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last weekend clad in a black MAGA hat, and declared, \"I'm not just MAGA; I'm Dark MAGA.\" It was a reference to a \"Terminator\" meme embraced by the far right. He then encouraged people to vote, saying that if they don't, \"this will be the last election.\"\n\nAlso wearing a too-small T-shirt that read \"Occupy Mars,\" Musk began hopping up and down -- thus launching countless memes -- to show his enthusiasm for the man he's backing in the election. It was awkward, to say the least.\n\nEven Trump looked annoyed.\n\nLorraine Ali\n\nLorraine Ali is news and culture critic of the Los Angeles Times.

She later exalted the way communities – especially in the western part of the state – were coming together after damage from Hurricane Helene in late September, especially the way “people who have the least give the most”.\n\nHer Republican opponent, meanwhile, was in Arizona – looking for Black and Latino support as he seeks a second presidency, after a rally in California a day earlier.\n\nBoth candidates are attempting to get a decisive edge among votes who have not yet decided who to support. Surveys show that early voting, which tends to favor Democrats, is down 45% from previous election years – a sign that there may be millions of undecided voters.\n\nTrump has now switched from condemning early voting as a Democrat plot to engineer his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020 to urging people to vote early and by mail.\n\nA recent ABC News-Ipsos poll showed that support was split down gender lines, with women voting 60-40 to Harris and men breaking for Trump by a similar margin.\n\nTrump needs white women, who supported him in a greater numbers in 2020 than in 2016 – but also Black men. On Sunday, he argued that his fellow former president Barack Obama’s call last week for Black men to support Harris based “solely on her skin color, rather than her policies” as “deeply insulting”.\n\nDemocratic Georgia senator Ralph Warnock on Sunday told CNN, “Black men are not going to vote for Donald Trump in any significant numbers.” But his fellow Black Democrat Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina congressman, told CNN, “Yes, I am concerned,” about Black men voting for Trump. Separately, former president Bill Clinton was urging voters in rural Georgia to get behind the Democratic ticket.\n\nA New York Times poll published Sunday found that Harris is underperforming the last three Democratic candidates for the White House among Latino voters.\n\nThe election may come down to fractional increases in support for each. An NBC News poll released Sunday showed the candidates in a “dead heat” nationally at 48% support. The poll found that voters are reassessing Trump’s first term more favorably – but also that voters view reproductive rights as a top motivating issue, which could hurt the former president after three of his US supreme court appointees eliminated the federal right to abortion.\n\nA CBS News poll, also released Sunday, found that the presidential race is more than just two conflicting ideologies – but about a fundamental disconnection.\n\nFor instance, most Trump supporters said relief for victims of Hurricanes Helene and Milton wasn’t reaching affected people – while Harris supporters indicated it was. Trump supporters said the economy was bad; Harris supporters said it was good. Trump’s voters said US-Mexico border crossings were increasing; Harris’s voters said they were down.\n\nTrump’s voters, especially the men, said gender equality efforts had gone too far; Harris voters said not far enough. But both agreed that social media was untrustworthy and had made it harder to find things to agree on and to tell fact from fiction.\n\nEach poll contained positive signs for Harris, including a five-point advantage on “looking out for middle class” (ABC); abortion being “#1 motivating issue” (NBC), with Democrat up 19 points on the issue over Trump (New York Times); Trump’s Latino support at the same level from 2020 (CBS), and also Harris matching Biden in 2020 with Black voters.\n\nBut the response to the two hurricanes that the south-eastern US recently continued to dominate Democrats’ campaign. On Sunday, Biden was scheduled to survey damage inflicted on Florida’s Gulf coast by Milton, where he would announce $600m in funding for damaged electrical grids.\n\nResponse to hurricanes remains Democrats’ political preoccupation. Harris’s rally Sunday came amid the intense politicization of the speed of federal disaster response to Helene.\n\nIn North Carolina, Harris appeared to be looking to defuse hurricane politics while also calling out false information that spread after Helene.\n\nCrises, she said, “have a way of revealing the heroes among us, the angels among us, and of showing us all the best of who we are ... heroes who do not ask the injured or stranded whether they are a Republican or a Democrat, but who simply ask: ‘Are you OK?’”\n\nAnd yet, Harris said: “There are some who are not acting in the spirit of community, and I am speaking of these who have been literally not telling the truth, lying about people who are working hard to help the folks in need, spreading disinformation when the truth and facts are required.”\n\nThat came as the Wall Street Journal reported that some of the earlier response to Helene had come in the form of Patriot Front, an organization that the Anti-Defamation League has concluded is a white-supremacist group – and that was using misinformation as a recruiting tool.\n\nWith Arizona, Nevada and Georgia potentially leaning for Trump, and Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin potentially leaning for Harris, the loss of North Carolina would cost Trump 16 electoral college votes needed to reach the winning threshold of 270. The state narrowly voted for Trump in 2020.\n\nThe Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday that he would deny Harris and Biden’s call to bring Congress back to Washington to approve more disaster relief funding after the hurricane.\n\n“It can wait,” Johnson said, pointing to $20bn in additional disaster funding that had recently been approved. He claimed only 2% of that funding had been distributed. As soon as states have assessed and calculate their “actual needs”, and submitted them, “Congress will meet and in bipartisan fashion, we will address those needs.”\n\nJohnson accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) of being “slow to respond”. He said: “They did not do the job that we all expect and hope that they will do, and there’s going to be a lot of assessment about that as well in the days ahead.”\n\nBut with Harris’s support appearing to slip in recent weeks, including after a series of TV appearances, there are reports of growing tensions between her campaign and Biden’s White House. The president cancelled a trip to Germany to concentrate on the hurricane response. But he is now reported to have rescheduled the trip for Friday.\n\nAccording to Axios, Biden aides remain wounded by the president being pushed out of his re-election bid amid questions about his age. He is 81 – only three years older than Trump.\n\nHarris’s team believed Biden upstaged her by holding an impromptu press briefing while she held a rally in Michigan.\n\nBiden on Sunday was expected to meet with Florida governor Ron DeSantis, with whom Harris was feuding earlier in the week. An aide to Harris, 59, told the outlet that the president’s team are “too much in their feelings”.","summary":"Presidential candidates spend Sunday trying to shore up support among must-have voting blocs\n\nKamala Harris and Donald Trump spent Sunday trying to shore up political support among what they perceived to be must-have voting blocs with polls showing them locked in a tight 5 November presidential race.\n\nWith election day less than a month away, the Democratic vice-president attended a Black church in Greenville, North Carolina, as part of her campaign’s “souls to the polls” push.

It is absurd that the border wall remains incomplete.","text":"IN the shadow of the US’s 30ft border wall, John Ladd gestures at a white helicopter coming fast and low over his ranch’s terrain.\n\n“It’s Border Patrol,” the cattleman in a straw cowboy hat and denims declared. “They’re on to something.”\n\nStarting his Ford truck, we quickly encounter two officers arresting an immigrant who had reportedly crossed the tall barrier dividing the United States from Mexico.\n\n“It’s a daily occurrence,” the fourth- generation rancher says.\n\n“The only time it wasn’t daily was during Trump’s four years as President because far fewer were coming over.\n\n“We’d go two or three days without them catching anyone then. Under Joe Biden it’s around the clock.”\n\nThe daily battle played out between law enforcement and the smuggling cartels has political ramifications far beyond this remote corner of Arizona.\n\nThe chaos at this border in the south, akin to the small boat predicament in my hometown, is a critical topic during elections and could influence the outcome of who becomes the next President.\n\n﻿The border will be sealed. The invasion will be stoppedDonald Trump\n\nDonald Trump has placed his border policy front and centre of his latest campaign for the White House.\n\nThe former President promised last week: “The border will be sealed. The invasion will be stopped.”\n\nDemocrat rival Kamala Harris, who once called the border wall “un- American”, has pledged millions to fill gaps in the fence.\n\nJohn’s 16,000-acre spread close to the one-horse border town of Naco has been labelled the Ground Zero of America’s migrant crisis.\n\nThe farmer, with a long, grey mustache that hangs down, approximates that around half a million immigrants have attempted to cross his farmland in the past thirty years.\n\n‘No money to pay cartel’\n\nAs John gives us a tour of his land, abutting the giant border fence, he gestures to a spot where a young migrant recently breathed his last.\n\nAs the sun beat down, the cattleman told me: “They found him there on Tuesday. He was just 21. He’d climbed the border wall, walked two miles then keeled over.\n\n“That makes 18 who have been found dead on my ranch in the last 30 years. That’s unheard of.”\n\nJohn says the smuggling route over his land is favoured by “getaways” who want to sneak into America illegally rather than claim asylum.\n\nDetection technology that would not be out of place on a modern battlefield is in place to stop them.\n\nAs well as helicopters and drones, getaways have to run the gauntlet of radar ground sensors that can detect their movements, and infrared cameras dotted around the ranch.\n\nGiving The Sun a tour of the smuggling zone, John discovers what he calls a “carpet shoe booty”.\n\nIt is a padded slipper pulled over footwear that ensures migrants do not leave tracks for Border Patrol to follow.\n\nAs well as the booties, John says the getaways wear full camouflage gear and balaclavas.\n\nThe cross-border trade in humanity is controlled by Mexican cartels, with the going rate to be smuggled into America around £6,000.\n\n“The majority don’t have the money to pay the cartel for trafficking them,” Trump supporter John, 70, explained.\n\n“So they basically become indentured servants, working for the cartel the rest of their life.”\n\nJohn, whose family have farmed this land for 128 years, shows me photos he has taken of how the smugglers traffic their human cargo through or over the wall.\n\nOne showed how sections of the giant steel fence — started here by President George W Bush and updated by first Barack Obama and then Trump — are sometimes cut away by the cartels with acetylene torches.\n\n“It takes about ten minutes,” says John.\n\nAnother features a 30ft ladder leant against the Mexico side of the fence for migrants to climb before shimmying down a rope on to US territory.\n\nThe gangs also reach through the wall’s steel beams to cut barbed wire.\n\nAnother image reveals a migrant with torn clothes clambering over the wall and through the wire in daylight.\n\nAs we reached a bridge over the dried-up San Pedro river on publicly owned land, the floodgates in the border wall were wide open.\n\nVisible footprints\n\nThe authorities had unlocked them to prevent seasonal flash floods damaging the wall, a policy that predates the Biden administration, and no one had yet closed them.\n\nJust four strands of barbed wire now stood between Mexico and a new life in the US.\n\nFootprints were visible in the sand passing through the wire and along a dried-up river bed into the US.\n\nShaking his head in disgust, dad-of-three John said: “It’s just a joke. We’re in a drought, there’s no reason the gates should be open.”\n\nDrugs, including fentanyl and crystal meth, are shipped through the sieve-like border to US cities.\n\nA record haul of four million blue fentanyl pills were seized at Arizona’s Lukeville border crossing in July.\n\nTownsfolk in border town Naco have their own stories of drug smuggling in the locality.\n\nAt the Gay 90s bar a few strides from Naco’s legal border, many remember when a “marijuana missile” bounced off its corrugated-iron roof.\n\nBartender Theras Avant, 65, said: “This huge package of marijuana had been fired from Mexico from a pumpkin cannon.”\n\nRetired travel agent Ron Krinker tells how law enforcement found a drug tunnel dug beneath the border by smugglers, emerging in the US inside an outhouse.\n\nSitting on his porch beneath a Stars and Stripes flag, Ron, 69, said: “I try to keep my mouth shut because you don’t know what side people are on.”\n\nJust west of John’s ranch, the wall climbs a steep boulder-strewn hill towards the Huachuca Mountains then stops midway up the slope.\n\nMigrants can walk to the end of the wall and stroll into the US.\n\nSteel girders that should have finished the job lie rusting as a stark and expensive monument to the Biden policy of halting border wall construction.\n\nA lot of people don’t realise that President Obama built the wallCaptain Tim Williams\n\nThe site has proved irresistible to Trump and running mate JD Vance, who have both visited the spot in the election campaign.\n\nCaptain Tim Williams, who oversees border operations for the Cochise County Sheriff’s Office, escorts me and Sun photographer Paul Edwards to where the girders are stacked up.\n\nTim, 46, says: “What you’re looking at right here is millions of dollars sitting on the ground. It was purchased during the Trump administration but the Biden administration decided not to put it up.”\n\nBut he dispels suggestions that the fence that slices through the desert landscape is “Trump’s Wall”.\n\n“A lot of people don’t realise that President Obama built the wall,” he added.\n\nThe captain said the sector was currently experiencing “a very high influx of illegal crossings from not only Mexico but Guatemala, El Salvador and Venezuela”.\n\n﻿We have a lot of fatalities, people die in the desert from exposure or snake bitesRancher John Ladd\n\nAn officer with the Sheriff’s Office for 21 years, he said of the border fence petering out: “The wall doesn’t start again for 40 to 50 miles. So there’s a huge gap in this corridor.\n\n“We do have a lot of fatalities, people that die in the desert from exposure or get bitten by snakes.”\n\nWith the US entering the final weeks of the election race, the southern border chaos could tip the balance.\n\nArizona itself is one of seven swing states which will decide who takes the White House.\n\nSince January 2021, when Biden came to office with Harris as his Vice President, there have been around eight million migrant “encounters” on the southwest land border with Mexico.\n\nNumbers have dropped significantly this year. Under the Trump administration, there were 2.4million encounters there.\n\nLast month Harris visited the border wall at Douglas, Cochise County.\n\nShe has used her time as California’s Attorney General to bolster her border security credentials.\n\n“I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally,” she said.\n\nTrump is promising mass deportation of undocumented migrants.\n\nBack at the border fence, Captain Williams implores whoever wins to complete the wall.\n\n“If your house has been burglarized, you’re going to put up a fence to give another layer of protection for you and law enforcement,” he insisted.\n\n“That’s exactly what the wall is.\n\n“It’s not going to stop everybody, but it’s going to give another barrier of protection to help us do our job.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIN the shadow of the US’s 30ft border wall, John Ladd gestures&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Living on the US/Mexico border, I have witnessed 500,000 migrants being apprehended or perishing on my property.

In a CBS poll, Harris was ahead by one point nationally, 51%-50%, and behind 49%-48% in a consolidation of battleground states; both results well within the margin of error. And in an ABC News poll of registered voters, Harris was ahead 49%-47%.\n\nThe polls hint at the same picture which a slew of swing-state voter surveys drew this past week: Harris likely remains in a slight lead among all voters nationwide, but is seeing key battleground states apparently in danger of falling into Donald Trump’s grasp.\n\nSunday’s batch of national polls follows releases from several polling outfits this past week. A new Quinnipiac poll of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan this week showed him leading in the latter two; RealClearPolitics’s polling average now has him ahead for the first time in months in the state of Michigan, a state which spurned Hillary Clinton in 2016 but flipped back to Democratic control in 2020.\n\nThe issue-based polling in the three surveys released on Sunday was a series of warning flags for the vice president on its own. CBS’s poll found wide disparities between supporters of the two candidates regarding whether the Biden-Harris administration was steering hurricane relief away from conservative areas of the country in the wake of damage wrought by storms Helene and Milton.\n\nABC’s, meanwhile, revealed that almost twice as many Americans believe the state of the economy is getting worse than believe it is getting better. It also showed the extent of the Democratic Party’s failure to articulate a positive and effective immigration policy, with voters now more likely to support large-scale deportation plans.\n\nBut none of the swing state polls — even the ones that have projected real movement in Donald Trump’s favor, or vice versa — are showing too many major battleground states seriously out of range for either candidate. That has expanded the map both candidates are traversing, along with their assorted surrogates, in the final month of the race.\n\nAmong those states now suddenly in deep contention is North Carolina, where top Trump and Harris surrogates have been campaigning for weeks. JD Vance is set to visit the state on Wednesday.\n\nThe Harris campaign, meanwhile, is deploying Tim Walz to Wisconsin and western Pennsylvania to shore up support from voters there.\n\nWith the polls still deadlocked nationally, a key factor to observe over the next few weeks will be whether Harris can transform her sizable cash advantage into a tangible lead in the polls, or on Election Day itself. The Harris campaign has continuously outraised the former president, and quadrupled his fundraising totals in August. The Trump campaign has not been shy in terms of spending its own cash, though the former president’s ability to match Harris’s burn rate in the next few weeks may falter.","summary":"Rivals enter

appearance at a Donald Trump campaign event in Coachella, California on Saturday.

Thompson met her now-husband, Howard Deutch, on the set of “Some Kind of Wonderful” in 1986. Thompson has gone on to become a prolific TV director, while Quaid recently starred as Ronald Reagan in the poorly reviewed “Reagan” biopic.\n\nWhile speaking at the campaign rally, Quaid told the crowd of Trump supporters that the time had come to “pick a side.” Pointing to the liberal tilt of the viral video platform, he asked, “Are we going to be a nation that stands for the Constitution or for TikTok?”\n\nThe actor also spoke about his housekeeper Josie, who he said was “here illegally for over a decade using her sister’s identification.” Despite the fact that Josie “worked for us” and “lived in fear” that she would be deported that entire time, Quaid continued, the actor only volunteered to sponsor her to become a U.S. citizen after Trump was elected.\n\nQuaid insisted that the “fairy tale called Harris and Biden now just doesn’t work. Four years ago, peace in the world was not just some kind of fairy tale either. Peace in the Middle East — Trump actually was right on the verge of accomplishing the Abraham Accords, that would have recognized Israel by Saudi Arabia and other Middle East nations, and would have had us on the road to peace that we have been so trying to get to since the Biblical times of Ishmael and Isaac.”","summary":"The actors were in a relationship from 1982 until 1987\n\n\nThe post Lea Thompson Cringes at Almost-Husband Dennis Quaid&#8217;s Trump Rally Speech: ‘I Was Engaged to Him’ appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/lea-thompson-cringes-at-almost-husband-dennis-quaids-trump-rally-speech-i-was-engaged-to-him/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-103128162.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 20:01:39","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":259550318,"title":"I live on US/Mexico border & 500k migrants have been caught or died on my land – it’s a joke the wall is not finished","text":"IN the shadow of the US’s 30ft border wall, John Ladd gestures at a white helicopter coming fast and low over his ranch’s terrain.\n\n“It’s Border Patrol,” the cattleman in a straw cowboy hat and denims declared. “They’re on to something.”\n\nFiring up his Ford pick-up, we soon come across two officers detaining a migrant who had apparently breached the imposing fence separating the US from Mexico.\n\n“It’s a daily occurrence,” the fourth- generation rancher says.\n\n“The only time it wasn’t daily was during Trump’s four years as President because far fewer were coming over.\n\n“We’d go two or three days without them catching anyone then.

Izraz “nacionalni dug” upotrebljava samo jednom. U ovomjesečnoj predsjedničkoj debati u SAD-u riječ “dug” nije spomenuta niti jednom. Kao ni riječi “prihod”, “potrošnja” i “proračun”.\n\nIskreno, Harris je spomenula proračunski deficit u svom programu i dva puta tijekom rasprave, tvrdeći da bi porezni plan bivšeg predsjednika Donalda Trumpa tome pridonio i da su njezine politike fiskalno odgovornije. No, osim kratkog spominjanja tu i tamo, nijedan kandidat ne upušta se u ozbiljnu raspravu o katastrofalnoj fiskalnoj putanji zemlje.\n\nPutanja američkog duga mogla bi dovesti do pogubnih ishoda, a šutnja nije rješenje. U 1980-ima i 1990-ima omjer državnog duga u odnosu na BDP u SAD-u iznosio je oko 39 posto, a do 2010. narastao je na 60,6 posto.\n\nNestranački Kongresni ured za proračun (CBO) predviđa da će nacionalni dug postojano rasti desetljećima, dosegnuvši ukupnu ekonomsku proizvodnju do 2025. i porasti na 122,4 posto BDP-a do 2034. godine.\n\nPrevelika potrošnjaNeki bi mogli tvrditi da je pripisivanje krivnje za strukturni deficit potrošnji ili prihodima zbunjujuća računovodstvena ili politički motivirana ekonomska analiza, jer je deficit jaz (prihodi minus potrošnja). Ne slažem se. Američka fiskalna neravnoteža potaknuta je prevelikom državnom potrošnjom, a ne premalim poreznim prihodima.\n\nIzmeđu 1974. i 2023. porezni prihodi u prosjeku su iznosili 17,3 posto BDP-a, dok je državna potrošnja u prosjeku iznosila 21 posto. Nestranački Kongresni ured za proračun predviđa da će do 2034. porezni prihodi biti nešto iznad ovog prosjeka, na 18 posto BDP-a, ali da će državna potrošnja biti mnogo veća, na 24,9 posto. Rastući dug vlade stoga se može pripisati izdacima, za koje se očekuje da će rasti brže od prihoda.\n\nŠtoviše, predviđa se da će samo tri kategorije potrošnje rasti tijekom sljedećeg desetljeća: socijalno osiguranje, Medicare (program zdravstvenog osiguranja američke vlade za osobe iznad 65 godina i mlađe s nekim oblicima invalidnosti) i plaćanje kamata na nepodmireni dug (za koje se procjenjuje da će ove godine premašiti proračun za obranu).\n\nOčekuje se da će se vladini izdaci za sve ostalo, od vojske i obrazovanja do znanstvenih istraživanja i nacionalnih parkova, smanjiti. Rješavanje američkog fiskalnog problema stoga iziskuje snažno oslanjanje na rezove u socijalnom osiguranju i zdravstvenoj skrbi.\n\nNaravno, povećanje poreznih prihoda smanjilo bi deficit. Ali čak ni odluka da porezne olakšice uvedene 2017. u potpunosti isteknu, a takvu politiku ni Trump ni Harris ne podržavaju, ne bi bila dovoljna da se zaustavi dugoročni rast duga na neodržive razine, s obzirom na predviđeno povećanje potrošnje.\n\nPrema modelu duga Odbora za odgovoran savezni proračun, potpuno ukidanje poreznih rezova iz 2017., zajedno s oporezivanjem kapitalnih dobitaka i dividendi kao redovnog dohotka, smanjilo bi očekivani omjer duga i BDP-a u 2050. za samo četiri postotna boda, sa 155 posto na 151 posto.\n\nS nekoliko fiskalno važnih događaja na pomolu, Trumpa i Harris treba pritisnuti da se pozabave ovim pitanjem. Za početak, mnoge odredbe smanjenja poreza iz 2017. isteći će sljedeće godine. Kako kandidati razmišljaju o reformi poreznog zakona s obzirom na fiskalne izazove s kojima se nacija suočava?\n\nUzajamni fond socijalnog osiguranja bit će nesolventan 2035. godine, a Medicareov fond za osiguranje za pokrivanje troškova bolničkog liječenja bit će iscrpljen sljedeće godine. Te procjene, od povjerenika programa, variraju tijekom vremena ovisno o nizu čimbenika, ali novac bi mogao ponestati ranije nego što se trenutno predviđa.\n\nProtivljenje rezovimaI Trump i Harris izrazili su svoje protivljenje rezovima u socijalnom osiguranju i zdravstvenoj skrbi, ali nijedno od njih nije odgovorilo na očita dodatna pitanja: S obzirom na sve veći dug nacije, kako se takvi rezovi mogu izbjeći?\n\n I zašto bi njihovo izbjegavanje bio bolji izbor? Vjerojatno je da će Harris, ako pobijedi u studenom i bude ponovno izabrana 2028., predsjedati masovnim restrukturiranjem ovih programa ako uzajamni fondovi propadnu tijekom njezina mandata, zbog čega je ključno pitati kako bi pristupila takvom zadatku.\n\nNacionalni dug jedan je od gorućih problema s kojima se suočava SAD i, ako se ne kontrolira, mogao bi izazvati fiskalnu krizu u kojoj će erozija povjerenja ulagača ubrzati veliko povećanje kamatnih stopa. To bi dovelo do nestabilnih tržišta dionica i još većih kamata za saveznu vladu. Isto tako, rastući deficit mogao bi dovesti do naglog porasta očekivane inflacije, stvarajući pritisak na američke Federalne rezerve da povećaju kamatne stope.\n\nTakva kriza mogla bi se dogoditi u budućnosti, ali dug već desetljećima šteti gospodarstvu. Prema Nestranačkom Kongresnom uredu za proračun, svako povećanje saveznog deficita u dolarima smanjuje privatna ulaganja za otprilike 33 centa. Kao posljedica toga, Amerika ima manju zalihu kapitala, što radnike čini manje produktivnima, snižava plaće i vjerojatno smanjuje sudjelovanje u radnoj snazi. Rastući dug tako postupno i postojano nagriza temelje prosperiteta.\n\nOsim ovih izravnih šteta, rastući deficit ima oportunitetne troškove. Veliki izdaci za servisiranje duga smanjuju fiskalni prostor potreban za ulaganje u nacionalnu obranu, znanstvena istraživanja i politike za proširenje ekonomskih mogućnosti. Razuman promatrač predsjedničke utrke 2024. zaključio bi da se Harris i Trump slažu oko malo pitanja.\n\nNo, čini se da se slažu da jedno od najvažnijih pitanja s kojima se suočava SAD treba zanemariti tijekom kampanje i ostaviti neriješeno tijekom sljedećeg predsjedničkog mandata. O američkoj ekonomskoj budućnosti slažu se mnogo više nego što se to na prvi pogled čini.\n\n© Project Syndicate 2024.","summary":"Kamate na nepodmireni dug ove godine mogle bi premašiti proračun za obranu.","url":"https://www.poslovni.hr/kolumne/dug-koji-se-ne-spominje-ili-katastrofalna-fiskalna-putanja-sad-a-4458022","image":"https://www.poslovni.hr/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/13kolumna-5-1600x1000.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-13 20:00:00","author":"Michael R.
