The Hill reported that the Republican National Committee raised a grand total of $16.2 million in the month of June, far outstripping the Democratic National Committee’s $8.6 million during the same period. The RNC currently has a war chest totaling $80.78 million, while the DNC has $15.22 million on hand, according to the outlet. This comes as the Democratic Party had to deal with internal turmoil in June, including drama over former vice-chair David Hogg, a progressive activist, who decided to not seek reelection just months after being elevated to the role. Hogg had sparked considerable internal rifts with his push to primary older incumbent Democrats. ONE YEAR AFTER BIDEN'S UNPRECEDENTED EXIT FROM 2024 RACE, DEMOCRATS POLL NUMBERS AT ROCK BOTTOM At the time, DNC vice-chair Malcolm Kenyatta told Fox News Digital the process was \"frustrating\" and felt like a \"slap in the face.\" \"We haven't been able to be singularly focused,\" Kenyatta said. \"We've spent a lot of time talking about procedural nonsense within the DNC. I promise you nobody cares about that, and nobody wants to talk about it as little as I do. I want us to get refocused.\" This comes after Vice President Kamala Harris spent a whopping $1.5 billion during her 15-week campaign that ended in defeat to President Donald Trump, including burning through millions of dollars on star-studded events on the eve of the election, according to a report. Despite this seemingly dire situation, Democratic Party leadership is taking an optimistic tone, saying in a Monday statement that this June was the \"best-ever\" for grassroots donations in an off-year in the committee’s history. DEMOCRATIC PARTY CATAPULTED INTO 'NEW PHASE OF A COLD WAR' IN ONE-YEAR WAKE OF BIDEN’S UNPRECEDENTED DROPOUT The statement said the party has raised a total of over $50 million since the start of the year. DNC Chair Ken Martin commented that \"around the country, people are energized, ready to fight back, and empowering Democrats to win elections.\" \"The DNC is breaking grassroots fundraising records, bringing on more volunteers than ever, and raising record-setting funds to beat Republicans,\" said Martin. \"Democrats are back in the ring thanks to grassroots energy across all 50 states, and together, we’re going to defeat the toxic Republican agenda and put this country back on track for hard-working families.\" Meanwhile, The Hill also reported the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) outraised its counterpart, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, $32.3 million to $29.1 million in the second quarter of the year and $18.1 million to $12.7 million in June. The outlet noted that despite the fundraising, the DCCC reported having $39.7 million on hand, while the NRCC has $37.6 million. However, this is the first time in four years that the NRCC outraised the DCCC in the first six months of an election cycle. WATCH: NANCY PELOSI SILENT ON WHY BIDEN DID NOT RELEASE EPSTEIN FILES A Fox News Digital review of NRCC fundraising numbers found that on average, Republican congressional candidates in swing districts outraised vulnerable House Democrats in the second quarter $1.1 million to $661,000 and have more money on hand by over $848,000. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a statement emailed to Fox News Digital, NRCC Spokesman Mike Marinella said the committee was building a \"historic\" war chest. \"While House Republicans build a historic war chest to grow the majority, House Democrats are broke, divided, and hijacked by socialists,\" said Marinella. \"Donors are slamming the brakes because they know this party is pathetic, aimless, and has no chance of taking back the majority.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the RNC, DNC and DCCC for comment but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"As the Democratic Party continues to reel from its 2024 losses and deals with internal strife, Republican fundraising nearly doubled that of the Democratic Party in June.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-fundraising-outpaces-democrats-nearly-double-june-numbers-show","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/931/523/trump-johnson-schumer-aoc.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 00:31:00","author":"Peter Pinedo","authors":["Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":343919000,"title":"World News | Banishing a Reporter: Trump Escalates Battle with Wall Street Journal over Epstein Story","text":"Washington, Jul 22 (AP) President Donald Trump on Monday followed up his lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over last week's Jeffrey Epstein story by banishing one of the newspaper's reporters from Air Force One for an upcoming Scotland trip. The moves reflect Trump's aggressiveness toward media who displease him — even a media magnate, Rupert Murdoch, with outlets that have been friendly to him in the past.

Trump filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Journal and Murdoch on Friday because of the newspaper's article about a sexually suggestive letter bearing Trump's name that was included in a 2003 album compiled for alleged sex trafficker Epstein's birthday. The president has denied having anything to do with it. On Monday, the White House said it was removing a Journal reporter from the pool covering the president's trip this weekend to his golf courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen in Scotland. The Journal's Tarini Parti had been scheduled to cover him on the trip.

The Journal declined comment on the action. Aggressiveness with the press is in the Trump playbook It's a tactic the Trump White House has used before. It restricted the access of journalists from The Associated Press to press events when the news outlet would not change its style guidelines to reflect Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. That launched a legal battle that is wending its way through the courts. The defamation lawsuit is another tool Trump has used against media outlets. He has sued CBS News for its editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with former opponent Kamala Harris; ABC News for a false statement made by George Stephanopoulos in a story regarding a New York writer who had accused Trump of sexual abuse; and Meta after it removed Trump's social media accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. In each of those cases, Trump won multimillion-dollar settlements. But in those instances, news was only one part of a major corporation's business. In the case of Murdoch and News Corp., news is the chief part of his business. The Journal has vowed to fight. It's also the first time Trump has sued for defamation as a sitting president, and it's not clear whether any president has done that in the past. “There's nothing inherently wrong with a president bringing a libel suit,” said noted free speech attorney Floyd Abrams. “But this claim certainly seems like nothing more or less than an effort to suppress speech that our president finds discomforting. That's not why we have libel law. It's why we have a First Amendment.” News organisations have reacted in varied ways It's all part of a broader pattern of trying to intimidate news organizations that report stories Trump does not like, said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “These are lawsuits that have no hope of actually succeeding as lawsuits, but nevertheless have the potential to chill media organizations from doing what all of us need them to do,” Jaffer said. Not every news organization has bowed down; “60 Minutes,” in fact, did some notably tough stories about the early days of Trump's second administration. But it's impossible to quantify stories that weren't done because of fear of a fight with the White House, he said. The Wall Street Journal leans conservative editorially, but hasn't been afraid to take Trump on in both its opinion and news sections. Other Murdoch outlets — Fox News Channel and the New York Post — are much friendlier to him. Ever since the administration announced that it would not be releasing additional government files from the case against Epstein, factions of Trump's base supporters have turned on him. That has put some normally supportive news outlets in a difficult position. Fox News largely avoided the story after Trump suggested his allies stop wasting time on it. But Fox's Howard Kurtz reported on The Wall Street Journal lawsuit on his “Media Buzz” show Sunday, saying that by doing so, “the president has drawn extra attention to the Journal's reporting.” The president's battle with the press has taken on several dimensions. He has been fighting to take away government support for news organizations like Voice of America, and last week the Republican-controlled Congress voted to take away federal funding from NPR and PBS because the president says their news programming is biased against conservatives.

Hunter says Joe Biden was on Ambien during the debate against Trump \n\nHunter Biden suggested in his interview with Callaghan that Joe Biden was on Ambien during his campaign-ending debate performance against President Donald Trump last year.\n\n“I know exactly what happened in that debate. He flew around the world basically, and the mileage that he could have flown around the world three times. He’s 81 years old. He’s tired as sh**,” Hunter Biden said during his interview with Callaghan.\n\nHe continued, “They give him Ambien to be able to sleep. He gets up on the stage, and he looks like he’s a deer in the headlights. And it feeds into every f****** story that anybody wants to tell.”\n\nThe younger Biden talked about the debate between Joe Biden and Trump several times throughout his interviews with Callaghan and Harrison.\n\nDuring his interview with Harrison, Hunter Biden claimed he was not in favor of the June 2024 debate against Trump held in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n“Look, I was opposed to the debate,” he said. “I didn’t understand why we were rushing into a debate with somebody who had just been convicted on 34 felony counts, and why we weren’t just going to wait to see how this played out.”\n\nThe June 27, 2024, debate was the earliest-ever debate between presidential candidates. Biden’s aides had pushed for it to stave off doubts about Biden’s mental acuity.\n\nBut ultimately, Biden’s fumbling and ramblings hastened his exit from the race.\n\n“That debate was awful when my dad walked out, I knew that he had an off night, you know what I mean. He wasn’t drooling, but he had an off night,” the younger Biden said.\n\n2. Hunter blames Pelosi for making the ‘decision’ on his father dropping out\n\nHunter Biden suggested that Nancy Pelosi was the one to drive the former president out of the race in an “At Our Table” podcast, hosted by former DNC chair Jamie Harrison. \n\n“They already made a decision. They clearly made a decision. When I say ‘they,’ I mean the speaker,” he said when asked about his father’s decision to drop out of the race.\n\nPelosi, who remains a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, was the House speaker during the Biden administration.\n\nHowever, shortly before Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, Pelosi told the New Yorker that she had concerns about the election and Biden’s chances of winning, putting pressure on Biden to drop out.\n\nThe younger Biden recalls Alexandra Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi’s daughter, calling Jill Biden out for not pushing the former president to drop out of the 2024 race.\n\n“And I heard Alexandra Pelosi say something like ‘put your big girl pants on’ to my mom, and I kind of feel like saying who the f*** do you think you are,” he said. “I’d never speak about your mom that way. I would never speak about your father that way. I would never insult your parents that way.”\n\n3. Takes special shots at George Clooney\n\nHunter Biden’s disdain for celebrity actor George Clooney was on full display during the podcast interview with former DNC chairman Jaime Harrison.\n\n“I love George Clooney’s movies, but I don’t really give a sh** what he thinks about who should be the nominee for the Democratic Party,” Biden said bluntly.\n\nClooney was among the loudest voices last year calling for the elder Biden to exit the 2024 race after the disastrous debate against President Donald Trump, even writing an op-ed piece in the New York Times.\n\nThe younger Biden criticized Clooney over his behavior during a June 2024 fundraiser. CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’s Alex Thompson wrote in their book Original Sin that Biden didn’t recognize the Hollywood actor.\n\n“I’ll be honest, I really don’t like George Clooney as an actor or as a person,” Biden said to Harrison.\n\nIn the interview with Andrew Callaghan, Hunter unleashed even more: “F*** him! F*** him and f*** everybody around him,” he said. \n\nBiden claimed Clooney threatened to pull out of an event because the president refused to recognize the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n4. Gushes on Wes Moore and the future of the party\n\nIn an interview with Andrew Callaghan on Channel 5, Hunter Biden gushes over the Maryland governor, seeing him as the future of the Democratic Party.\n\n“I don’t think the Democratic Party’s dead. I think that there’s some really incredible leaders in the Democratic Party,” he said. “Wes Moore gives me an incredible amount of hope. He’s incredibly dynamic. He’s so goddamn smart, and he’s truly a genuinely decent human being. I love Governor Moore.”\n\nBiden continued to say that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and former Vice President Kamala Harris are also “incredible leaders,” but questions whether they can run again and if they even want to run again. He also thinks the Democratic Party is always claimed to be in “disarray” before every election, saying there’s no leadership and nothing’s getting done. However, Biden believes “someone will emerge.”\n\n“There will be a leader that will emerge. The stakes are too high,” he said. “Whether they’ll succeed in this environment, I don’t know. And that’s the question: How far are people willing to go?”\n\nThe younger Biden said there needs to be a leader who puts “themselves in jeopardy on behalf of the American people,” using Sen. Alex Padilla’s (D-CA) notable moment of interrupting Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s press conference as an example.\n\nHarrison, the former DNC chairman, claimed during the podcast that Biden’s decision to exit the 2024 race was “the most selfless act that I’ve ever seen in American politics,” to which the younger Biden concurred.\n\n“Do you think your dad stepping out was a mistake?” Harrison asked Biden.\n\n“No,” he responded.\n\n“I know that it wasn’t a mistake in that moment, because what he did is, I think, that he made the only choice that was left to him, which was either save the party or save himself. And he chose to save the party,” he continued. “And in so doing, I think, did one of the most selfless acts of anybody that I know, as a student of history.”\n\nThe younger Biden also claimed that had his father remained, he would have secured a second term.\n\n“Do I think that he could have won? I think that he could have won, yeah,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that I don’t respect other people’s opinion, because nobody can actually answer that question.”\n\n5. Denies responsibility for the cocaine bag found at the White House\n\nHunter Biden denied any responsibility for the bag of cocaine found inside the White House in July 2023, asking Callaghan rhetorically during his interview why he would bring the drug to the residence and “stick it into a cubby outside the situation room in the West Wing.”\n\n“I have been clean and sober since June of 2019, and I have not touched a drop of alcohol or a drug, and I’m incredibly, incredibly proud of that,” Hunter Biden said. \n\nThe bag of cocaine found at the White House during the Biden administration has been the subject of much controversy, as speculation mounted that the bag belonged to Hunter Biden, whose struggles with drug and alcohol addiction had been widely known. \n\nThe denial comes after FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino announced earlier this year that the agency would reopen its investigation into several cases of “potential public corruption” that have held public interest, including the cocaine discovery.\n\n6. Claims to be in the White House for ’12 days’ during his father’s presidency \n\nAs Republicans investigate Joe Biden’s mental acuity during his time in the White House, Hunter Biden forcefully denied allegations that he was the “acting Chief of Staff” for his father.\n\n“You think Joe Biden was involved in some cover-up? You think Jake Tapper is telling the truth when he says that I was the acting Chief of Staff [of President Joe Biden’s White House]?” Hunter Biden questioned while speaking with Harrison. \n\nBIDEN AUTOPEN USE: WHAT TO KNOW AS TRUMP ORDERS AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS PREDECESSOR\n\nCNN’s Jake Tapper, alongside Thompson, said during an interview with Katie Couric that he thought Hunter Biden was “driving the decision-making for the family,” and was “almost like a chief of staff” for the Biden family. \n\n“I was in that White House 12 days over the last two years of the administration,” Hunter Biden claimed. “I stayed as far away as I possibly could, which by the way broke my heart.”\n\n7. Hunter Biden calls Netanyahu a ‘monster’\n\nHunter Biden touched on Israel’s war against Hamas and attacks on Iran and called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “monster,” after the prime minister went on TV talking about the “awful sacrifices he’s had to make,” most notably regarding his family.\n\n“Bibi Netanyahu went on TV and said about the awful sacrifices that he’s had to go to because his son has had to cancel his scheduled wedding twice now,” he said. “He said that on TV, and he said and his wife has gone through so much pain because she’s had to put her life on hold these last two years, since October 7, and he hadn’t said one f***ing thing about how many people that are still hostages, that he refuses to negotiate for? That to me is a monster.”\n\nThe younger Biden also noted that this isn’t the first time Israel has warned the United States about potential Iranian nuclear weapons.\n\n“Netanyahu has been promising us that Iran was on the verge of a nuclear weapon for 22 years now,” he said. “And then he did it a few months ago, and then he did it a few weeks ago, and then he dropped it, and then he dropped bombs.”\n\n“He’s been wrong every time, but he’s the boy who cried wolf, and one day the wolf is going to be pushed,” he said about Iran’s ability to get a nuclear weapon.\n\nBiden then claimed that Netanyahu bombed Iran to “save his own a** so that he doesn’t end up in jail, because he has a favorability rating inside of Israel of about 22%.”\n\n8. Accused Trump of sending illegal immigrants to death camps\n\nWading into domestic politics, Hunter Biden forcefully rebuked Trump’s decision to send illegal immigrants to prisons in El Salvador and South Sudan, calling the latter a “death camp.”\n\n“If you think that the prison in El Salvador is not a f***ing concentration camp, you’re out of your f***ing mind,” Hunter Biden said. “Tell me, anybody that’s returning from there. You saw those pictures. Do you think anybody’s getting out of there?” \n\nHe continued, “You think anybody’s getting out of those South Sudan prisons ever? Ever? Out of your fucking mind. That’s a f****** – That’s a death camp. They’re done. They’re over. And if you’re not dead, you would want to be dead if you were in that prison.”\n\nThe Trump administration has conducted several deportation flights since he returned to the Oval Office, despite questions over the legality of some deportations the White House has carried out. \n\nAt times, the White House has fought the court system, with federal judges halting deportation plans or ordering the return of specific individuals, such as the mistakenly deported Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was brought back to the U.S. after a lengthy battle. \n\n9. Downplays the significance of his laptop \n\nThe embattled Biden minimized the importance of the laptop scandal that roiled his family in 2020 after the New York Post published the contents of a hard drive he left at a repair shop in 2019. \n\nDuring his Channel 5 sit-down, Hunter Biden said that none of his legal issues have stemmed from the discovery of the hard drive. He said that “not one single person has ever accused me of a crime based upon anything that was in or discovered as it relates to my laptop.”\n\n“So this whole idea that there was some conspiracy to cover up the laptop — they uncovered 20 years unvarnished, of every single communication that I have ever had over a phone or by text or over email or computer in any digital way,” he said. “There’s not one communication that you can even remotely say is evidence of a crime. Not one.”\n\nHowever, in the final days of his presidency, President Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon for his son, preventing him from ever serving prison time for his convictions on tax and gun felonies. President Joe Biden had pledged not to pardon his son, but he reversed course in December, just days before Hunter was to be sentenced on three gun felonies and faced a second sentencing for failing to pay income taxes on millions of dollars worth of income.\n\nThe complete and unconditional pardon covers any crimes the younger Biden may have committed starting in 2014, before the laptop was discovered, and runs through 2024.\n\n10. Joe Biden’s prostate cancer ‘not curable’\n\nIn his interview with Callaghan, Hunter Biden addressed his father’s recent prostate cancer diagnosis that revived questions about the former president’s health while in office. \n\nHunter Biden explained that his father was not tested for the disease during his time in office because it is not a standard test for men older than 70. \n\n“And he went in and got tested, and he had prostate cancer, and it had spread to his bones,” Hunter Biden said. “He’s in great health otherwise, and they can treat it, but it’s not curable.”\n\nHe continued, “And so that’s all the public knowledge of it. But I think that that is literally everything that there is to know about it. They do this thing called hormone therapy, and it makes you tired and stuff like that. But seeing him day-to-day, he’s doing well.”\n\nJoe Biden was diagnosed with prostate cancer after getting a biopsy to follow up on “increasing urinary symptoms,” his office said in a statement at the time. The older Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, or Grade Group 5, with metastasis to the bone.","summary":"Hunter Biden, the son of former President Joe Biden, sat down for two lengthy interviews in which he discussed his past drug abuse, denied that a bag of cocaine found at the White House during his father’s administration was his, and discussed his father’s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential election.  The younger [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3477980/takeaways-hunter-biden-interviews-drug-use-laptop-joe-dropout/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hunter_biden_court_2024.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 00:13:22","author":"Hailey Bullis","authors":["Hailey Bullis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.475},{"id":343916546,"title":"Hunter Biden Criticizes George Clooney and Democrats Who Oppose Joe","text":"Hunter Biden remains quite upset with actor George Clooney, due to a New York Times opinion piece he wrote last July urging then-President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nThe younger Biden sat down for a three-hour-long, very foul-mouthed interview with YouTuber Andrew Callaghan, hosting him in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nBiden used explicit language when talking about Clooney and other Democrats who had been critical of his father or had a hand in facilitating the president’s departure from the 2024 election.\n\nThe anniversary of the senior Biden bowing out of the race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris was Monday. \n\nExpressing his sentiments about Clooney’s decision to write the op-ed that implied the Democratic president was losing touch, the former first son harshly remarked, ‘F*** him, f*** him and everybody around him.’\n\n‘I agree with Quentin Tarantino, F***ing George Clooney is not a f***ing actor. He is a f***ing, like, I don’t know what he is. He’s a brand,’ Biden continued. ‘And by the way, and God bless him you know what, he supposedly treats his friends really well, you know what I mean, buys them things. And he’s got a really great place in Lake Como and he’s great friends with Barack Obama. F*** you, what do you have to do with fucking anything?’\n\n‘Why do I have to f***ing listen to you?’ Biden asked. \n\nIn the op-ed, Clooney said of the president that ‘the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.’ \n\nThe actor had seen Biden at a June 15, 2024 fundraiser in Los Angeles ahead of Biden’s disastrous June 27 debate in Atlanta. In the op-ed, Clooney divulged that the Biden he saw at the fundraiser was the same one who appalled Democratic voters on the debate stage. \n\n‘This is about age. Nothing more,’ Clooney wrote. ‘We are not going to win in November with this president.’ \n\nThe president’s debate performance against President Donald Trump had heightened calls for the 81-year-old to drop out, with Clooney’s op-ed published less than two weeks later. \n\nBehind-the-scenes, CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson wrote in their book Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again that President Biden didn’t recognize Clooney when he arrived at the LA fundraiser. \n\nThe younger Biden countered that Monday saying that Tapper and Thompson’s sources misinterpreted presidential protocol. \n\nBiden said Clooney was introduced to the president at the fundraiser because that is the customary part of presidential photo lines. \n\n‘And he may know George for the last 30 years and he may have met him 15 times but the guy on his shoulder, who’s usually a military officer, has one job, to say the name of the person who’s walking up,’ Biden said. \n\nHe added: ‘I was there. I watched George Clooney be introduced to my dad with 30 other people in line and the guy said, “Mr. President, George Clooney and Julia Roberts.” That’s it, that’s the story.’ \n\nBiden claimed that Clooney used that incident to undercut his father. \n\n‘What right do you have to step on a man who’s given 52 years of his f***ing life to the service of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are gonna take out basically a full-page ad in the f***ing New York Times to undermine the president at a time in which, by the way, what do people care about the most?’ Biden said. ‘Why do you think that the Republicans have an advantage over us? Because they’re unified.’\n\nRepresentatives for Clooney did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail’s request for comment. \n\nBiden also bristled that Clooney had almost skipped the fundraiser over his father and the actor’s wife Amal not seeing eye-to-eye on an issue having to do with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n\nBiden went after authors Tapper and Thompson by name as well. \n\nThe former first son called the book a ‘money grab’ on Tapper’s part and mocked the cable news host’s ratings. \n\n‘Jesus Christ Jake, grow the f*** up,’ Biden said, noting how he’s known the CNN newsman for 30 years. \n\nHe objected to Tapper suggesting he was acting as some sort of ‘chief of staff’ who helped hide President Biden’s declining condition. \n\nIn an interview with Katie Couric, Tapper had referred to Hunter Biden not as a faux White House chief of staff, but serving that role in the Biden family. \n\n‘What they’re also doing,’ he continued. ‘Is that they’ve started a congressional investigation and now I have to deal with another f***ing subpoena because Jake Tapper has decided that he’s – through anonymous sources – create some kind of conspiracy of a crime and here we are, to what end? To what end?’ \n\n‘As the world falls apart around us, why do I have to f***ing spend my time worrying or thinking about or even talking about someone as irrelevant of Jake Tapper,’ Biden added. \n\nHe continued to discuss the pressure campaign that followed his father until the president announced on July 21, 2024 that he would end his reelection bid. \n\nSeveral hours later, Biden endorsed Harris. \n\nBiden complained that his father and Trump – who at 79 will become the nation’s oldest president should he serve all four years – are being measured differently, pointing to a gaffe Trump made at the G7 last month, when he mistakenly announced a trade deal with the ‘EU’ while standing alongside the U.K. prime minister. \n\n‘Can you imagine if he opened up that treaty with Prime Minister Starmer at the G7 in Canada and all the pages fell out and then he said he just signed a treaty with the European Union,’ Biden said. ‘And then he got on a plane and said the reason he was going home early from the G7 is because he had a major announcement the next day and the next day he put up a flagpole. Can you imagine?’ \n\nTrump had rushed home from the summit in Canada to deal with Israel and Iran warring. \n\n‘Where the f*** is Jake Tapper?’ Biden asked. ‘Where the f*** is George Clooney.’ \n\nCNN defended Tapper in a statement to the Daily Mail. \n\n‘Jake Tapper is one of the most influential political journalists of his time. His award-winning programs The Lead with Jake Tapper and State of the Union with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash reach broad global audiences across CNN, CNN International and HBO Max with significant digital extensions across CNN.com and social platforms,’ said spokesperson Dylan Rose Geerlings. ‘No single metric can capture the true reach and impact of a journalist driving the national conversation, but Jake’s work and his outsized influence speak for themselves.’\n\nThroughout the three-hour-long sit-down, Biden also slammed David Axelrod several times. \n\nAxelrod was former President Barack Obama’s longtime political adviser who suggested early in the 2024 cycle that Biden should consider dropping out and allowing the Democrats to have a primary instead. \n\n‘David Axelrod had one success in his political life and that was Barack Obama and that was because of Barack Obama not because of f***in’ David Axelrod.,’ Biden said. \n\nObama chose Joe Biden to be his running mate during the 2008 election cycle – but there have long been reports about there being rifts between the Obama and the Biden camps. \n\nThat was on full display during the interview, when Biden went after the Pod Save America podcasters too. \n\nHe mocked the group – made up of four former Obama aides – Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor.\n\nBiden called them ‘four white millionaires that are dining out on their association with him from 16 years ago, living in Beverly f***ing Hills, telling the rest of the world what black voters in South Carolina really want.’ \n\n‘The Anita Dunns of the world, who’s made 40, 50 million dollars off the Democratic party, they’re all gonna insert their judgment over a man who has figured out, unlike anybody else, how to get elected to the United States Senate over seven times,’ Biden added. \n\nDunn served in his father’s administration but also worked for Obama. \n\nBiden also mocked Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s former White House chief of staff, for having presidential ambitions. \n\n‘What a f***ing …,’ Biden said trailing off. ‘David Axelrod’s going to run his campaign for him,’ he said, rolling his eyes.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHunter Biden remains quite upset with actor George Clooney, due to a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hunter Biden Criticizes George Clooney and Democrats Who Oppose Joe first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/hunter-biden-criticizes-george-clooney-and-democrats-who-oppose-joe/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hunter-Biden-unleashes-on-George-Clooney-and-Democrats-critical-of.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 00:07:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":343914684,"title":"Hunter Biden says Joe's use of Ambien fueled his disastrous Trump debate as he explains how to COOK crack in wild interview","text":"Hunter Biden blamed the sleep aid Ambien for his father's disastrous presidential debate performance, which became a turning point in the 2024 campaign. \n\nThe younger Biden sat down for a three-hour-long interview with YouTuber Andrew Callaghan, which was released Monday - the anniversary of former President Biden's decision to quit his reelection campaign and endorse his Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nBiden also talked extensively about his own drug use in the sit-down, including how he learned how to make his own crack cocaine.\n\n'I know exactly what happened in that debate,' Biden said. 'He flew around the world. He's 81 years old. He's tired. They gave him Ambien to be able to sleep and he gets up on the stage and looks like a deer in the headlights.' \n\nThe then president blamed his lousy June 27, 2024 performance on a cold, though had spent several days at Camp David resting up ahead of the Atlanta showdown with now President Donald Trump. \n\nIt wasn't enough to quiet the calls for him to drop out. \n\nThe former first son remained bitter about what happened to his father, though told Callaghan he was able to remain sober the whole time. \n\nBiden said he was just over six years sober after spending about three years, after the 2015 death of his brother Beau, in the pits of addiction to alcohol and crack cocaine.\n\n'This is like a PSA - if you want to completely, utterly f*** up your life,' Biden said, crack cocaine would do the job. \n\n'The only difference between crack cocaine and cocaine is sodium bicarbonate and water and heat,' he explained. 'You can go to a your neighborhood convenience store and just get - anyway, I don't want to tell people how to make, how to make crack cocaine, but it literally is a mayonnaise jar of cocaine and baking soda.' \n\nBiden said the high is extremely intense on crack cocaine. \n\n'It's vastly, vastly different,' the recovering addict admitted. \n\n'I feel really reluctant to kind of have some euphoric discussion, I know you're not asking me to do that, have some euphoric discussion about crack cocaine,' he continued, with Callaghan saying that he was not. \n\n'I don't want to have the experience of some euphoric recall - that's how powerful crack cocaine is,' Biden admitted. \n\nThe former first son said that crack had a dirty reputation but 'it's the exact opposite.' \n\n'When you make crack, what you're doing is you're burning off all the impurities,' he explained. \n\nBiden said his addiction in earnest started in 2016, when he left an alcohol recovery program over a row with staff and found his former dealer 'Bicycles' in a downtown Washington, D.C. park who sold him crack. \n\n'Now there are periods where I would stop. I would try and get help or half try and get help or appease people in my life and say that I was getting help. And so I did a whole host of things to try and pull myself out of it. I did try,' he remembered. \n\n'And people would come in and out of my web and try and help me, and my level of toxicity would drag them down until they would disappear. And then people that would come into my life that were nothing but blood sucking leeches that would literally saw vulnerability and latch on and drain me literally of everything that I had, from emotional well-being to my physical well-being to my bank account and that was the ebb and flow for almost three years until I met Melissa,' he continued, referencing his wife Melissa Cohen. \n\nCohen and Biden had a whirlwind romance in 2019, marrying shortly after they met, with the South African filmmaker helping him get sober. \n\nPrior to that, Biden recalled a particularly scary moment when he was found in a hotel swimming pool floating face down. \n\n'Someone had given me something,' he recalled. 'And this person saved me and I woke up after about 12 hours where they just held me.' \n\n'My whole point of this story is that this person put themselves at an enormous risk,' he continued, explaining that if he had overdosed and died, the individual could have been blamed. \n\n'They saved my life for nothing other than to be human, because every single other person that was there, literally, they stole my shoes, they stole my clothes,' the former first son recalled. \n\nHe added that he thought it was hypocritical that Republicans have used his struggle with addiction to score political points when so many of them have been touched by it too. \n\n'I've gotten over the fact that [former Rep.] Matt Gaetz or Eric Trump is going to like use this story as another, you know, data point for like how f***ed up Hunter Biden is. But I don't give a s*** anymore,' Biden said.","summary":"Hunter Biden blamed the sleep aid Ambien for his father's disastrous presidential debate performance, which became a turning point in the 2024 campaign.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14926567/hunter-biden-joe-biden-ambien-debate-crack.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/22/00/100508661-0-image-m-10_1753139877572.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/21/8943455764409499954/1024x576_MP4_8943455764409499954.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-22 00:00:40","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":343903968,"title":"Banishing a reporter: Trump escalates battle with Wall Street Journal over Epstein story","text":"By DAVID BAUDER\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday followed up his lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over last week’s Jeffrey Epstein story by banishing one of the newspaper’s reporters from Air Force One for an upcoming Scotland trip.\n\nThe moves reflect Trump’s aggressiveness toward media who displease him — even a media magnate, Rupert Murdoch, with outlets that have been friendly to him in the past.\n\nTrump filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Journal and Murdoch on Friday because of the newspaper’s article about a sexually suggestive letter bearing Trump’s name that was included in a 2003 album compiled for alleged sex trafficker Epstein’s birthday.

It's necessary to have it. It's even more necessary to delay it.\"Carville noted a fissure within the party along both generational and ideological lines and highlighted Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City Democratic primary as an example.\"Candidates like Mr. Mamdani are impatient for an economic future that folks my age are skeptical can be delivered,\" Carville said.The strategist said that a leader will emerge the day after the 2026 midterm elections, adding, \"No new party or candidate has a chance for a breakthrough until that day.\"As Democrats and Republicans alike ramp up midterm efforts, Carville suggests the Democratic Party run on the phrase \"We demand a repeal.\"Carville said the phrase can be used to emphasize the Democrats' desire to repeal President Trump's spending law, a repeal to protest Medicaid, a repeal to save the deficit, and a repeal \"to end the endless wars.\"\"We've never had a simpler, more unifying oppositional message,\" Carville concluded. \"Soon it will no longer be possible to avoid a brawl between the factions ignited back in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. But for now, whether you're the progressive Mr. Mamdani, the centrist former Representative Abigail Spanberger running for the Virginia governorship or even Elon Musk, we can all agree on one thing: We demand a repeal. Onward to the midterms.\"According to recent polling, potential contenders for the Democratic 2028 presidential primary ticket include former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.What People Are SayingFormer George W. Bush adviser Scott Jennings on X in June: \"Dems have blown their credibility with the working class on illegal immigration, insane cultural issues, and identity politics. And now they expect people to believe their attacks on Trump's economic policies?\"Carville, in part, in the op-ed: \"Our midterm march starts with a simple phrase every candidate can blast on every screen and stage: We demand a repeal. A repeal of Mr. Trump's spending law is the one word that should define the midterms. It is clear, forceful and full-throated. It must be slathered across every poster, every ad, every social media post from now until November 2026. That single word is our core message. Every Democrat can run on it, with outrage directed not at the president or a person but at this disastrous bill. And the reasons are countless, each one a venom-tipped political dagger.\"Brendan Buck, MSNBC political analyst, on X on Monday: \"Oh dear. A midterm pledge to repeal a major law you have almost no chance of repealing.

What do you have to do with f***ing anything? Hunter Biden seethed about the ER star.\n\n“Why do I have to f***ing listen to you? What right do you have to step on a man who’s given 52 years of his f***ing life to the service of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are going to take out basically a full page ad in the fucking New York Times to undermine the president at a time in which, by the way, what do people care about the most?”\n\nBiden claimed that the division within the Democratic Party led to Republicans having an insurmountable advantage ahead of November. \n\nHe also claimed that the disastrous performance of his father at his one and only debate with Trump was due to his father taking Ambien in order to sleep on foreign trips.\n\n\"I know exactly what happened in that debate. He flew around the world, basically mileage that he could have flown around the world three times, he’s 81 years old, he’s tired as s---, they give him Ambien to be able to sleep, he’s gets up on the stage and he looks like he’s a deer in the headlights,\" Hunter told Callaghan, adding: “[I]t feeds into every f***ing story that anybody wants to tell.\"\n\nOf Clooney’s acting, he said of the From Dusk Till Dawn star: \"I agree with Quentin Tarantino. F***ing George Clooney is not a f***ing actor. He is f***ing like… I don’t know what he is. He’s a brand.”\n\nBiden’s rant was nearly duplicated in a second podcast appearance — this time, a buttoned-up conversation with Jaime Harrison, former chair of the Democratic Party. Even here, Biden told the At Our Table host he didn’t give a “s***” about Clooney’s political opinions.\n\n“We lost the last election because we did not remain loyal to the leader of the party,” he said during that appearance.\n\n“That’s my position. We had the advantage of incumbency, we had the advantage of an incredibly successful administration, and the Democratic Party literally melted down.” \n\nHis father’s performance at a June presidential debate with Donald Trump alarmed voters on all sides of the political spectrum and drew immediate fears from Democrats that the party was preparing to hand the election over to Republicans. \n\nClooney was a prominent part of that avalanche, penning an op-ed for the New York Times titled, “I Love Joe Biden, But We Need a New Nominee”.\n\nPod Save America co-host Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama, said that internal polling conducted by the Biden campaign showed the former president losing by a landslide were he to remain in the race.\n\nThe elder Biden dropped out of the race a month later, after an agonizing few weeks of calls for him to step down by backbencher Democrats and the less-than-delicate hinting from the likes of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others seemingly urging the same.\n\nKamala Harris, his vice president and running mate, ascended to the top of the ticked after party officials shot down the idea of a last-minute primary election playing out at the Democratic National Convention. Democrats had already blown their own chance to hold a real primary earlier in the year. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, was drafted as her running mate after a short candidate search.\n\nHunter Biden’s own shenanigans were a major weight around his father’s neck for the entirety of 2024. The recovering crack addict’s prosecution on tax and gun charges led to speculation that Joe Biden would pardon his son, which he denied — then did anyway. Many of the Democratic president’s detractors argued that Hunter’s treatment by law enforcement was far lighter than others accused of the same crimes, including drug offenses for which he was never charged, would have faced.\n\nAccording to 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, Joe Biden was mentally preoccupied with his son’s federal gun trial, and the possibility of Hunter going to prison, at the height of election campaigning last summer.\n\nHunter was convicted on three federal gun charges for unlawfully purchasing and possessing a firearm in 2018 while battling substance use disorder. Despite claiming he would not pardon Hunter if found guilty, Joe Biden granted his son a full pardon shortly before leaving office.\n\nHe became a de facto senior adviser to his father’s re-election campaign early in the year, which according to news reports complicated efforts by the president’s allies to communicate with him directly as his son shielded him from criticism.","summary":"‘F*** you.

Introducing Rachel Aviv’s report on one woman’s stunning recovery from psychosis. Plus:\n• Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” told the truth\n• The baseball coach who stood up to ICE\n• Fragrances of Presidents past\nDear Reader,\nFor decades, a woman named Mary suffered from consuming delusions. Long-lost professional colleagues\nwere meddling with her life; someone was spying on her through a camera in the showerhead; her eldest daughter was conspiring against her and putting poison on her pizza. She took to barricading herself inside her house, and would spend years in and out of psychiatric inpatient care. And then, suddenly, just months after she began chemotherapy treatment for lymphoma, her symptoms of psychosis disappeared.\nIn this week’s issue, Rachel Aviv tells the story of Mary’s illness and astonishing recovery. Aviv, who has been writing about psychology in one way or another for The New Yorker for years, investigates a relatively new phenomenon: researchers and physicians are beginning to ask how many patients who present with what are typically considered psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, may actually be suffering from autoimmune conditions. One scientist at the National Institute of Mental Health tells Aviv that the figure may be between one and five per cent of schizophrenia patients. “Even one per cent ends up being almost a million people in the world who should be treated with a different kind of medicine,” he explains.\nMary’s story is inseparable from the experiences of her two daughters, Christine and Angie, whose lives were, for years, dominated by their mother’s impenetrable view of the world around her. They both speak with uncanny poise and insight about the struggles they faced in getting Mary the help she needed, the bonds they have formed, and the difficulty of reconciling the woman they know now with the person who raised them.

In total, according to the latest figures from the C.D.C., more than thirteen hundred people have had a confirmed case of measles this year; more than ninety per cent of those people were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.\nHow dangerous is this resurgence of the disease?\nWe reached out to Dhruv Khullar, a physician and a contributing writer. “It’s needlessly, frustratingly bad,” he told us via e-mail. “Not only is the virus circulating again but we’ve had more cases than in any year since the turn of the century—and the year is only half over!” Khullar points out that measles is one of the most contagious pathogens on the planet—even more so than chicken pox or COVID. “In unvaccinated communities, every infected person might pass the virus on to fifteen or more people,” he explained. “The current outbreak, which began in West Texas, has spread to dozens of states, and three people, including two children, have died—the country’s first measles deaths in a decade.\n“It’s important to state plainly: virtually every case of measles is preventable through vaccination,” he continued. “But, instead of issuing forthright endorsements of the importance of immunization, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has offered mealy-mouthed guidance, muddying the waters with talk of vitamins and cod-liver oil. This outbreak is the logical endpoint of decades of anti-vaccine propaganda.”\n\nSubmit your best caption for this cartoon.

He is a f***ing, like, I don’t know what he is. He's a brand,' Biden continued. 'And by the way, and God bless him you know what, he supposedly treats his friends really well, you know what I mean, buys them things. And he's got a really great place in Lake Como and he’s great friends with Barack Obama. F*** you, what do you have to do with fucking anything?'\n\n'Why do I have to f***ing listen to you?' Biden asked. \n\nClooney said of the president that 'the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.' \n\nThe actor had seen Biden at a June 15 fundraiser in Los Angeles ahead of Biden's disastrous June 27 debate in Atlanta. \n\nIn the op-ed, Clooney divulged that the Biden he saw at the fundraiser was the same one who appalled Democratic voters on the debate stage. \n\n'This is about age. Nothing more,' Clooney wrote. 'We are not going to win in November with this president.' \n\nThe president's debate performance against President Donald Trump had heightened calls for the 81-year-old to drop out, with Clooney's op-ed published less than two weeks later. \n\nBehind-the-scenes, CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson wrote in their book Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again that President Biden didn't recognize Clooney when he arrived at the LA fundraiser. \n\nThe younger Biden countered that Monday saying that Tapper and Thompson's sources misinterpreted presidential protocol. \n\nBiden said Clooney was introduced to the president at the fundraiser because that is the customary part of presidential photo lines. \n\n'And he may know George for the last 30 years and he may have met him 15 times but the guy on his shoulder, who's usually a military officer, has one job, to say the name of the person who's walking up,' Biden said. \n\nHe added: 'I was there. I watched George Clooney be introduced to my dad with 30 other people in line and the guy said, \"Mr. President, George Clooney and Julia Roberts.\" That's it, that's the story.' \n\nBiden claimed that Clooney used that incident to undercut his father. \n\n'What right do you have to step on a man who's given 52 years of his f***ing life to the service of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are gonna take out basically a full-page ad in the f***ing New York Times to undermine the president at a time in which, by the way, what do people care about the most?' Biden said. 'Why do you think that the Republicans have an advantage over us? Because they’re unified.'\n\nRepresentatives for Clooney did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment. \n\nBiden also bristled that Clooney had almost skipped the fundraiser over his father and the actor's wife Amal not seeing eye-to-eye on an issue having to do with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n\nBiden went after authors Tapper and Thompson by name as well. \n\nThe former first son called the book a 'money grab' on Tapper's part and mocked the cable news host's ratings. \n\nHe objected to Tapper suggesting he was acting as some sort of 'chief of staff' who helped hide President Biden's declining condition. \n\n'Jesus Christ Jake, grow the f*** up,' Biden said, noting how he's known the CNN newsman for 30 years.\n\n'What they're also doing,' he continued. 'Is that they've started a congressional investigation and now I have to deal with another f***ing subpoena because Jake Tapper has decided that he's - through anonymous sources - create some kind of conspiracy of a crime and here we are, to what end? To what end?' \n\n 'As the world falls apart around us, why do I have to f***ing spend my time worrying or thinking about or even talking about someone as irrelevant of Jake Tapper,' Biden added. \n\nHe continued to discuss the pressure campaign that followed his father until the president announced on July 21, 2024 that he would end his reelection bid. \n\nBiden complained that his father and Trump - who at 79 will become the nation's oldest president should he serve all four years - are being measured differently, pointing to a gaffe Trump made at the G7 last month, when he announced a trade deal with the 'EU' while standing alongside the U.K. prime minister. \n\n'Can you imagine if he opened up that treaty with Prime Minister Starmer at the G7 in Canada and all the pages fell out and then he said he just signed a treaty with the European Union,' Biden said. 'And then he got on a plane and said the reason he was going home early from the G7 is because he had a major announcement the next day and the next day he put up a flagpole? Can you imagine?' \n\n'Where the f*** is Jake Tapper?' Biden asked. 'Where the f*** is George Clooney.' \n\nThroughout the three-hour-long sit-down, Biden also slammed David Axelrod several times. \n\nAxelrod was former President Barack Obama's longtime political adviser who suggested early in the 2024 cycle that Biden should consider dropping out and allowing the Democrats to have a primary instead. \n\n'David Axelrod had one success in his political life and that was Barack Obama and that was because of Barack Obama not because of f***in’ David Axelrod.,' Biden said. \n\nObama chose Joe Biden to be his running mate during the 2008 election cycle - but there have long been reports about there being rifts between the Obama and the Biden camps. \n\nThat was on full display during the interview, when Biden went after the Pod Save America podcasters too. \n\nHe mocked the group - made up of four former Obama aides - Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor.\n\nBiden called them 'four white millionaires that are dining out on their association with him from 16 years ago, living in Beverly f***ing Hills, telling the rest of the world what black voters in South Carolina really want.' \n\n'The Anita Dunns of the world, who's made 40, 50 million dollars off the Democratic party, they’re all gonna insert their judgment over a man who has figured out, unlike anybody else, how to get elected to the United States Senate over seven times,' Biden added. \n\nDunn served in his father's administration but also worked for Obama. \n\nBiden also mocked Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former White House chief of staff, for having presidential ambitions. \n\n'What a f***ing ...,' Biden said trailing off. 'David Axelrod's going to run his campaign for him,' he said, rolling his eyes.","summary":"Hunter Biden is still very angry with actor George Clooney , who wrote a New York Times op-ed last July pushing then President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14926707/hunter-biden-interview-george-clooney-democrats.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/21/22/100506745-0-image-m-9_1753133113531.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/21/3574411524027793713/1024x576_MP4_3574411524027793713.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-21 22:25:57","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":343900448,"title":"Liberals Strain Themselves Trying To Rip Page From Trump’s Playbook","text":"A nickname can immortalize a man as surely as his deeds. Vlad The Impaler. Charles The Fat (or Bald). Bill Clinton, America’s First Black President.\n\nDemocrats are well aware of the power of a good nickname. It’s the execution of a good nickname that escapes them. \n\n“Doodle Don is Dodging,” reads a statement from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The “doodle” in question refers to an alleged drawing attributed to President Donald Trump by The Wall Street Journal. The outlet published a report alleging Trump sent a salacious birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, including a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman. (RELATED: Trump Files Suit Against Murdoch Over WSJ Epstein Story)\n\nTrump claimed Thursday that The Wall Street Journal “printed a FAKE letter.” Among other rebuttals, the president claimed: “I don’t draw pictures.” \n\nVeracity of the alleged letter aside, turn to the critical matter at hand. Nicknames. Alliteration is often a component of a good one, but does not suffice in and of itself. See: “Putin’s puppet,” another pejorative for Trump that hasn’t much stuck. Outside of some easily-amused elder Democrats.\n\n Trump loves belittling nicknames. Here’s a few accurate ones. Cheating Donald. Crybaby Donald. Blame Everybody Else Donald. -R — Ralph Nader (@RalphNader) October 11, 2017\n\n Knowing that nicknames tend to stick with some voters, Trump’s advisors are looking to find the right one for Kamala Harris. Trump’s favorite is “Crazy Kamala” as the press dutifully repeats his negative nicknames year after year for dozens of people. Amazingly, the Democrats do… — Ralph Nader (@RalphNader) August 13, 2024\n\nLawyer and activist Ralph Nader has been trying to give Trump a nickname, in vain, for at least seven years. He offered “Blame Everybody Else Donald” in 2017, took a few years to think, then returned in 2024 to share the fruits of his contemplation: “Law Violator Don.” \n\nDemocrats gave acronyms a spin with “Trump Always Chickens Out” (TACO). One Reddit user insists that the nickname “will stick!!!” \n\nA commenter chimes in with a reasoned defense of the nickname’s applicability: “In the USA, a taco is a form of fast food, and thus inferior to a real meal. Simply by using TACO about Trump, the values that Trump’s cheap, easy to make, and quickly eaten will be attached to him.”\n\nI’d labored under the impression that a “taco” was a dish of Mexican import. Sounds unusually culturally insensitive, if you ask me. \n\nWhen all else fails, return to the well which springs eternal: Adolf Hitler.\n\nDemocratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett referred to Trump as a “wannabe Hitler” in a July 20 spot on MSNBC. Former Vice President Al Gore took a more subtle approach, simply attempting to draw a historical parallel between the Trump administration and Hitler’s Third Reich. The accusation that Trump is literally Hitler is so common Newsweek ran an op-ed titled: “Trump Is Not Hitler.” (RELATED: ‘He Has Revered Hitler’: Dem Strategist Says Trump ‘Would Absolutely Try To Exterminate An Entire Group Of People’)\n\n MSNBC’s Alex Witt hears Rep. Jasmine Crockett call Trump a “wannabe Hitler,” and she lets her talk for another 27 seconds, no objection, and then moves on to another question. The charge is just par for the MSNBC course. @PolitiFact won’t budge. pic.twitter.com/BOwYCbWhrW — Tim Graham (@TimJGraham) July 20, 2025\n\nDemocrats are throwing spaghetti at the wall and praying it sticks. They could use a lesson from Trump in picking more adhesive projectiles. \n\nYou can probably rattle off a handful or two of Trump-patented monikers without breaking a sweat. “Pocahontas” for Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Sleepy Joe” for former President Joe Biden. “Crooked Hillary” for Hillary Clinton. For a more robust list, peruse the Wikipedia page, “List of nicknames used by Donald Trump.” \n\nThe DNC has tried, in vain, to counter some of them. Instead of “Crooked Joe Biden,” they suggested a “better” nickname: “winner.” Whoops.\n\nWhy, exactly, are Democrats so bad at nicknames? They’re trying too hard, yes. Perhaps more saliently, they’re the party of joyless harridans. Each of their nicknames for Trump simmers with barely contained loathing. Trump, meanwhile, hands out nicknames without much provocation. “Little Marco” might become a cabinet member a few years down the line.\n\nThe advice for Democrats is the same as always. Try being a little, tiny, bit less shrill.\n\nFollow Natalie Sandoval on X: @NatSandovalDC","summary":"‘Doodle Don is Dodging‘","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/21/trump-democrats-nicknames-playbook-taco-doodle/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2224965814-1-scaled-e1753132555875.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 22:13:13","author":"Natalie Sandoval","authors":["Natalie Sandoval"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.464},{"id":343894724,"title":"Election Workers Want to Join a Union That Helps Democrats Get Elected. What Could Possibly Go Wrong?","text":"America’s representative system relies on voters trusting that their legal ballots will be counted, but the Left’s push for Big Labor unions in every aspect of American society threatens to erode that firm foundation.\n\nHow can American voters trust the integrity of the system if the election workers who manage it join a hyper-partisan union that endorses, bankrolls, and helps elect Democrats?\n\nYet that is exactly what election workers in Chicago are attempting to do.\n\nEmployees at the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners sought to unionize and join the Service Employees International Union Local 73 in July 2024. The SEIU local said the union would include between 80 and 90 election workers, including clerks, polling place investigators, equipment specialists, and others.\n\nThe board argued that the state’s election code bars employees from engaging in “political activity,” and therefore the employees cannot join the union. The board noted in an August filing that SEIU 73 lobbies legislatively, endorses candidates, and makes political contributions. \n\n“Plainly, these ‘political matters’ are precisely the type of activity in which the Union and its members regularly and effectively engage,” the filing reads, according to the Chicago Tribune. Board workers “strictly cannot, under any circumstances” engage in those activities, the board argued.\n\n An administrative law judge ruled the other way, however, the Tribune more recently reported.\n\nMost private-sector workers (94.1%) do not belong to a union, while about a third of government employees at all levels (32.2%) have joined a union, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As the Left has championed unions, even left-leaning nonprofit workers—who ostensibly work because they believe in a cause—have unionized against management.\n\nAlthough President Donald Trump and Republicans have started to reach out to union members, the superstructure of Big Labor remains vehemently opposed to them.\n\nThe Union’s Political Activity\n\nThe SEIU has a long history of endorsing Democrats, donating to their campaigns, and mobilizing voters to turn out for them. \n\nThe SEIU endorsed Kamala Harris last year (after endorsing Biden for reelection), Biden in 2020, Hillary Clinton in 2015, and Barack Obama in 2011 and 2008. The SEIU gave $6.5 million to Democrats in 2024 cycle and only $4,331 to Republicans. It spent $12.6 million on outside groups, with $10.9 million going to support Democrats and $1.7 million going to oppose Republicans. The SEIU spent only $47,793 (0.38% of its spending) on supporting Republicans. \n\nThe SEIU also teamed up with other major unions—the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees—to launch “a coordinated, multi-state voter outreach initiative to turn out voters in support of Harris-Walz in key battleground states” last October. The presidents of those unions all teamed up to campaign for the Democrats together.\n\nNone of this should be surprising. The SEIU, AFSCME, NEA, and AFT all contributed to the woke left-wing activist groups that staffed and advised the Biden administration. \n\nThe SEIU didn’t just run national efforts, however. SEIU Local 73—the union Chicago’s election workers are aiming to join—touted its effort in “hitting the doors and making phone calls in support of pro-worker candidates as part of ‘Purple Power Day.'” This local union and its allies urged “voters to elect candidates Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin.” The SEIU noted that this formed part of its “$200 million worker-funded campaign” to “mobilize 25,000 SEIU volunteers nationwide.”\n\nIn May 2021, the SEIU’s Illinois State Council endorsed Democrat Alexi Giannoulias for secretary of state. In the press release announcing this endorsement, the state council noted that “SEIU Local 73 represents 2,600 workers, or more than half of all Secretary of State’s office employees.” \n\nWhat Does the Law Say?\n\nThe Municipal Code of Chicago bans employees from engaging in a long list of “prohibited political activity” including “Preparing for, organizing, or participating in any political meeting, political rally, political demonstration, or other political event”; “assisting at the polls on Election Day on behalf of any political organization or candidate for elective office or for or against any referendum question”; and “helping in an effort to get voters to the polls.”\n\nThe code specifically bans employees from engaging in any such activity during “compensated time.”\n\nIllinois law goes further in restricting members of the State Board of Elections. It expressly states that employees shall not “contribute, either financially or in services or goods or any other way, to any political party, candidate or organization engaged in political activity.”\n\nYet that statute may not govern the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, which is local.\n\nBy joining SEIU Local 73, Chicago elections employees would be contributing to an “organization engaged in political activity,” just by paying their union dues. \n\nEven if the city or state’s ethics rules allow it, election workers should not join an explicitly partisan union that shovels money behind Democrats and organizes get-out-the-vote campaigns. \n\nAmericans still harbor doubts about the 2020 presidential election, and polls suggest Democrats are more likely than Republicans and independents to trust delayed election results. \n\nIn a representative government like ours, leaders derive their legitimacy from the voters. But if voters cannot trust the people who manage the election infrastructure to remain neutral, how long will they trust election outcomes?","summary":"America&#8217;s representative system relies on voters trusting that their legal ballots will be counted, but the Left&#8217;s push for Big Labor unions in every aspect...

Emanuel, who is reportedly eyeing a potential 2028 run for the White House, gave conservaitve-sounding responses during a rapid-fire series of questions during a slightly more than two-minute segment on “The Megyn Kelly Show.” (RELATED: ‘This Person Is A Man’: Female Fencer Booted From Tournament After Forfeiting Match Against Male)\n\n“Do you believe boys should be able to play girls’ sports?” Kelly asked the former Obama administration official, who quickly responded, “No.”\n\n“Do you believe that kids under the age of 18 should be able to be put on puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones?” Kelly asked, with Emanuel responding, “I think that parents have to make that decision themselves, I think… the child is too young to make that decision. It has to be made with the family, and that choice. I think that before someone makes that life decision, they have to think twice about that.”\n\nKelly endorsed President Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign, citing child sex changes as her rationale during an interview on “Real Time with Bill Maher” in October 2024. During the 2016 campaign, Kelly, then a host with Fox News, and Trump clashed after she asked him about his treatment of women during a Republican primary debate.\n\n“Do you then disagree with the Tim Walz policy in Minnesota, where a child who doesn’t get affirmed by his parents, can go into Minnesota and get jurisdiction there and get the parental decision overruled?” Kelly asked Emanuel, who responded, “Yeah, look, I think these are life decisions and I’m also slightly both, I have two minds, not two minds, but two strains that influence my opinion.”\n\n“One, this is a life decision, and a child can’t make that decision,” Emanuel continued. “You have to have some moral development and character and judgment and foundation for that. Two, parents have to be involved in that and that’s for them to make. I don’t think the public should be in that space.”\n\nEmanuel also said that biological men who are undergoing sex changes should not be placed into women’s prisons. The Trump campaign ran ads during the 2024 presidential election featuring Vice President Kamala Harris discussing how she pushed “behind the scenes” for transgender prisoners to receive sex changes.\n\nThe issue of biological males who identify as transgender competing in women’s sports became nationally prominent following Thomas’s participation in the 2022 NCAA championships, where the biological male won the 500-yard women’s final. (Click Here To Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Do No Harm”)\n\nSeveral college teams elected to forfeit matches against San Jose State University’s women’s volleyball team in 2024 due to the presence of a biological male on the San Jose State roster, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nEmanuel is considering a 2028 presidential bid, labeling the Democratic Party’s brand as “weak and woke” in a May interview with The Wall Street Journal, adding that the party’s brand had become “toxic.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the secretive tech firm sells software that can crunch colossal troves of data. Depending on the application, that might include GPS data, text messages, social media profiles, legal filings, phone records, and thousands of other information points, which it distills into charts, maps, and other forms of intelligence. Palantir's specialty is detecting connections and patterns: \"the finding of hidden things,\" as CEO Alex Karp puts it. The company was launched in 2003 by Peter Thiel, a tech billionaire and major Trump donor, and Karp, a self-described neo-Marxist with a philosophy Ph.D., and seeded with $2 million from the CIA. The intelligence agency used Palantir's software to track terrorists after 9/11—it is widely believed to have helped the U.S. locate and kill Osama bin Laden—and the firm has helped Ukraine's military identify Russian targets, Los Angeles police track crime patterns, and JPMorgan Chase combat cyberfraud. But most of Palantir's work is for the U.S. government, and business is booming. Since President Trump's January inauguration, it has won more than $900 million in federal contracts, and its share price has more than doubled. \"Palantir is on fire,\" Karp told a May earnings call.\n\nWhich agencies work with the company? \nPalantir's tools are used across many agencies for a wide range of purposes. It has helped the CDC track disease outbreaks, the IRS sniff out tax cheats, the FDA monitor supply chains, and the Department of Homeland Security chase down drug traffickers. Most controversially, during the first Trump administration it helped Homeland Security track undocumented migrants, prompting pushback from employees and protests at Palantir's Palo Alto and Manhattan offices. In April, CNN and Wired reported that Palantir engineers were helping build a master database that will draw data from across federal agencies—including the IRS, Social Security Administration, and Health and Human Services—to target undocumented immigrants. The firm is \"helping build the infrastructure of the police state,\" charged tech investor Paul Graham. Palantir's biggest government client, though, is the Defense Department, with whom it has a $1.3 billion contract running through 2029.\nHow does the military use its tech? \nIn Palantir's early years, the Marine Corps deployed its software in Afghanistan to better predict the locations of roadside bombs and potential insurgent ambushes. The company is now helping the Pentagon develop the Maven Smart System, which uses AI to analyze satellite imagery, drone footage, radar feeds, ground reports, and other data to present commanders with battlefield options. The Pentagon has already used the technology to identify airstrike targets in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq. Palantir has also worked closely with the Ukrainian military, embedding engineers with troops, and recently signed a $91 million deal with Britain's Defense Ministry. \"They are the AI arms dealer of the 21st century,\" said Jacob Helberg, a national security expert and outside adviser to Karp. Palantir's defense work, especially the use of its software by Israel in Gaza, has drawn condemnation from inside and outside the company.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Palantir aims to help \"power the West to its obvious, innate superiority\" and \"bring violence and death to our enemies.\" When it comes to the other key charge leveled at Palantir—that its software is being put to nefarious ends by the government—Karp insists his company can't dictate how its tools are used. But alarm spiked in May, when The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had tapped the firm to compile Americans' personal data.\n\nWhat kind of information? \nThe federal government has copious data on U.S. citizens, ranging from incomes and student debts to criminal histories, charitable contributions, and medical claims. Such data is currently siloed across agencies. But the Times reported that Trump, who in March signed an executive order directing agencies to remove \"unnecessary barriers\" to data consolidation, had drafted Palantir to build a centralized database that pulls all that disparate information together.\nWhy is there alarm over a centralized database?\nPrivacy advocates say that this library of information could be weaponized by the government. Officials could access and release embarrassing details about critics' finances and health conditions, for example, or terminate benefits they receive. \"The creation of a monster uniform database,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), is \"an invitation to fraud and political retaliation against the people.\" It's not just Democrats who are raising warnings. Such data consolidation is \"a power that history says will eventually be abused,\" said Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio). Palantir denies it is building a master database or \"enabling mass surveillance\" of citizens. But even onetime insiders are troubled by the company's growing power. In May, 13 ex-Palantir engineers signed a letter saying the firm's leadership had \"abandoned its founding ideals\" and become complicit in \"normalizing authoritarianism.\" They cited the crystal-ball-like \"seeing stones\" that gave Palantir its name. These magical artifacts were not necessarily a force for good, they noted, but presented \"great dangers when wielded by those without wisdom or a moral compass.\"\nPalantir's unlikely CEO \nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the first Western CEO to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a wiry-haired intellectual who practices tai chi and holds a doctorate in neoclassical social theory. That was Palantir's Karp, who told Zelensky he could help \"David to beat a modern-day Goliath.\" If Zelensky found Karp an unlikely defense contractor, he wasn't alone; \"batshit crazy\" is how Karp recently summed up some investors' view of him. Raised outside Philadelphia by a far-left Jewish father and Black mother, the Kamala Harris donor is also an odd bedfellow for Peter Thiel. But when choosing a chief executive, Thiel turned to his former Stanford Law classmate, who had no tech or business experience. A self-described introvert, when not traveling Karp skis and shoots guns at his cabin in rural New Hampshire, tended by a staff and team of bodyguards. He says his defense work has made him a \"pariah\" in Silicon Valley but dismisses what he calls \"woke, pagan ideology.\" He insists he wants \"less war,\" and the way to achieve that is to \"scare the f--- out of our enemies.\"\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nThe Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nLoyalty tests: The purge at the FBI\n\nKash Patel is conducting polygraph tests on FBI agents to weed out anyone speaking badly about him\n\nEpstein: Why MAGA won’t move on\n\nTrump's supporters are turning on him after he denied the existence of Epstein's client list\n\nArms for Ukraine and an ultimatum for Russia\n\nDonald Trump reverses course, sending weapons to Ukraine and threatening Russia with tariffs\n\nYou might also like\n\nGrok brings to light wider AI antisemitism\n\nIn the Spotlight\nGoogle and OpenAI are among the other creators who have faced problems\n\nIntellectual property: AI gains at creators' expense\n\nTwo federal judges ruled that it is fair use for AI firms to use copyrighted media to train bots\n\nIs AI killing the internet?\n\nTalking Point\nAI-powered browsers and search engines are threatening the death of the open web\n\nNvidia hits $4 trillion milestone\n\nThe success of the chipmaker has been buoyed by demand for artificial intelligence\n\nMusk chatbot Grok praises Hitler on X\n\nGrok made antisemitic comments and referred to itself as 'MechaHitler'\n\nThe first AI job cuts are already here\n\nCompanies are removing entry-level jobs as AI takes over\n\nThe god in the machine\n\nAn AI model with superhuman intelligence could soon become reality.

And we're like, 'We're staying here,'\" the former Ellen DeGeneres Show host told the Everyman Theatre audience in Cheltenham, England, on Sunday. According to NBC, DeGeneres said she and wife Portia de Rossi originally booked flights to England to temporarily wait out the potential chaos of the November election. When the audience asked if Trump's victory over Kamala Harris changed those plans to permanent, she said \"yes.\"\n\n Entertainment Weekly has reached out to a representative for Degeneres for comment.\n\n Unlike O'Donnell, DeGeneres didn't have to fear the personal animus of the newly re-elected president. Trump and O'Donnell have been locked into a bitter feud for decades, beginning when the latter issued biting criticism of the former's description of his personal fortune as \"self-made,\" as well as handling of a 2006 Miss USA scandal, during her time on The View.\n\n But given Trump's track record of seeking retribution against his critics - even the mildest - DeGeneres' wariness to remain stateside isn't unfounded. Months into Trump's first term, DeGeneres told disgraced news anchor Matt Lauer that she wouldn't invite him onto her talk show. \"He's against everything that I stand for. We need to look at someone else who looks different than us and believes in something that we don't believe in and still accept them, and still let them have their rights.\"\n\n Speaking in Cheltenham on Sunday, DeGeneres provided similar reasoning for her move. \"I wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are. I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences,\" she said. \"So until we're there, I think there's a hard place to say we have huge progress.\"\n\n More specifically, DeGeneres cited growing conservative opposition to same sex marriage as a reason to stay in England: \"“They’re trying to literally stop it from happening in the future and possibly reverse it... Portia and I are already looking into it, and if they do that, we’re going to get married here.\"\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n DeGeneres' support for O'Donnell is notable given O'Donnell's recent comments on \"some stuff in the past that we never resolved\" that has kept the trailblazing comedians from being close. \"I don't want to fight against another gay woman... It's not like we're tenaciously opposed to each other. We're just very different people,\" O'Donnell shared in April.\n\n 2020's cascade of allegations regarding the allegedly toxic environment DeGeneres fostered on her talk show, which led to the long-running series' concluding in 2022, and to DeGeneres significantly stepping back from the public eye, may also play some role in her decision to move abroad. In the wake of those allegations, more of her peers detailed their own strained relationships with DeGeneres, including Margaret Cho, who revealed in June that DeGeneres was \"really weird and not nice to me for most of my career.\"","summary":"The controversial former talk show host cited the growing conservative call to repeal the right to same-sex marriage as one reason for her move.","url":"https://ew.com/ellen-degeneres-says-she-moved-to-england-because-of-trump-11776175","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/LCKQZ3OS_dHA2CmBZsH4YVzhvLY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ellen-degeneres-donald-trump-072125-7a7cbf9d445c40a49941485eb9e7c0e5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 21:08:25","author":"Ryan Coleman","authors":["Ryan Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":343881652,"title":"Hunter Biden unloads on actor George Clooney, claims he sabotaged father with 'blessing' of Obama people","text":"Hunter Biden exploded on George Clooney in a profanity-laced tirade during a podcast interview published Monday, accusing the actor of sabotaging his father’s re-election with \"the blessing of the Obama team.\" \"F—k him!

The two were discussing Clooney’s infamous New York Times guest essay that became a key moment in the pressure campaign for Joe Biden to drop out of the race. The \"Ocean's 11\" actor published the essay, which called for Biden to be replaced as the Democratic nominee, less than two weeks after the former president had a disastrous debate performance against President Donald Trump.

Biden ultimately withdrew from the race on July 21, 2024, exactly one year ago Monday, and was replaced on the Democratic ticket by Kamala Harris. Hunter unloaded on the actor, asking \"why do I have to f—king listen to you?\" and accusing him of having lied about his father experiencing memory lapses at a June 2024 fundraiser.

Two Democrats, Reps. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio’s 9th Congressional District and Emilia Sykes of Ohio’s 13th Congressional District, are on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s frontline members list and are also being targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nLast November, Sykes won reelection by 2.2 percentage points against Republican Kevin Coughlin. President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016, 2020, and 2024 and the race for Ohio’s 13th Congressional District was particularly close at the presidential level, with former Vice President Kamala Harris very narrowly winning the district.\n\nSykes has been running to the left, which includes teaming with Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas. According to the Cook Political Report Partisan Voter Index, Crockett’s district, Texas 30, has a D+25 advantage. Ohio 13 is even.\n\nIn April, Sykes and Crockett made headlines for their joint fundraising committee. According to the Washington Free Beacon, that “arrangement will allow Democrats to piggyback off each other’s shared fundraising efforts, potentially collecting larger checks as a result.”\n\nSykes also attended the 65th anniversary celebration of the Akron Alumni Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta alongside Crockett and Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, as Signal Akron covered in May. \n\nCrockett has made headlines as a more liberal and outspoken House member, and for the Federal Election Commission opening an investigation in April into donations made to her 2024 campaign through ActBlue. Crockett’s campaign and office did not respond to The Daily Signal at the time, and her office did not respond to request for comment about her association with Sykes.\n\nWhile many vulnerable House Democrats have voted with Republicans, the same cannot be said for Sykes, who has voted with more liberal members on key bills.\n\nAlthough Sykes was one of 48 Democrats to vote in favor of the Laken Riley Act in January, she has voted for allowing illegal immigrants to vote in U.S. elections. She also voted for upholding an electric vehicle mandate from the Biden administration and against restricting funds for educational institutions aligned with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSykes’ hobnobbing with Crockett is not the only time she’s been relying on those from outside of Ohio. FEC data for this year as of June 30 shows contributions coming from other states, including blue California, New York, and Maryland.\n\nOhio Republicans, including a Super PAC in support of gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, as well as the Ohio GOP, have found an opportunity to use New York City’s upcoming mayoral election to their advantage. In expressing concerns about Democrat Zohran Mamdani, the pro-Ramaswamy Super PAC has urged New York City voters to move to the Buckeye State\n\nSykes, however, has come under fire from the National Republican Congressional Committee for ignoring a request for comment when asked about Mamdani’s concerning views. The Republicans further connected her to Crockett by referencing the Crockett’s support for Mamdani.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee spoke out against Sykes and her connections in a statement for The Daily Signal. “Radical Emilia Sykes continues to push a far-left agenda as she is more focused on joining the socialist squad with Jasmine Crockett than delivering results for Ohioans. While Sykes’ extreme positions may have earned her a spot on the Squad, they’ll also cost her seat next year,” said spokesman Zach Bannon.\n\nNeither the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee nor Sykes’ office responded to requests for comment.\n\nCoughlin is looking to challenge Sykes again for a rematch. In a statement for The Daily Signal, Coughlin pointed to the congresswoman’s liberal record. “If Emilia Sykes is what Democrats are calling a moderate these days, then I’d hate to see who they’re calling extreme,” he said. “She’s been all-in on the far-left’s agenda from day one, voting to raise taxes, give handouts to illegal immigrants, and siding with criminals over the police who keep us safe. She’s not fooling anyone here in Ohio.”\n\nAccording to Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the race is currently considered to be a “toss-up.” Beyond Kaptur and Sykes’ reelection battles, Ohio also remains nationally relevant when it comes to redistricting efforts for the 2026 midterm elections.","summary":"Ohio could help determine which party controls the House of Representatives following the 2026 midterms.

I don’t have to be fucking nice.”\n\nReferring to comments from the well-known film director that Clooney is not a “movie star”, Biden continued: “I agree with Quentin Tarantino. Fucking George Clooney is not a fucking actor. He is fucking like … I don’t know what he is. He’s a brand.”\n\nBiden questioned why anyone had to listen to Clooney despite his friendship with Barack Obama, a former Democratic president, and his “really great place in Lake Como”.\n\n“What do you have to do with fucking anything?” Biden said, speaking rhetorically about Clooney. “What right do you have to step on a man who’s given … his fucking life to the service of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are going to take out basically a full page ad in the fucking New York Times.”\n\nHunter Biden shared with the Channel 5 outlet his belief that Clooney was upset at Joe Biden, 82, because the former president had criticized the international criminal court (ICC)’s decision to obtain an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on war crime charges. The human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who is married to the actor, was one of the legal experts who recommended that the ICC seek that warrant.\n\n“He was bitching to the White House staff, the senior staff that he was so angry that the president would criticize the arrest warrant,” Hunter Biden said. “He was very, very angry that my dad did not pay homage to her or something.”\n\nBiden’s interview to Channel 5, a popular YouTube channel created by Andrew Callaghan, comes as US House Republicans pursue investigations into his father’s presidency. Congressional Republicans have been claiming that the former president’s closest advisers covered up a physical and mental decline during his presidency, and criticizing his pre-emptive pardons of family members, including Hunter, after Trump threatened to prosecute his opponents as he captured the Oval Office again in November.\n\nHunter Biden acknowledged that Joe Biden had an “absolutely horrible” debate against Trump before his father dropped out of the 2024 presidential race exactly a year ago on Monday and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris to succeed him. Hunter Biden said his father had to drop out or see fellow Democrats fight him “every step of the way”.\n\nAmong the reasons for the poor debate performance were that his father – 81 at the time – was “tired as shit”, Hunter Biden said. “They give him Ambien to be able to sleep. He gets up on the stage and looks like he’s a deer in the headlights, and it feeds into every fucking story that anybody wants to tell.”\n\nAfter Trump’s second presidency began in January, the FBI reopened an investigation into who left cocaine in a White House locker in 2023. Suspicions have fallen on Hunter Biden, whose past struggles with substance abuse have been well documented.\n\nBut Hunter Biden denied the cocaine found in the White House was his, asserting he has been clean and sober since June 2019. “Why would I bring cocaine into the White House and stick it into a cubby outside … the situation room in the West Wing?” he asked.\n\nThe 55-year-old’s Channel 5 interview comes weeks after his father embarked on a series of interviews, including with the New York Times, aimed at convincing the public that Harris’s loss to Trump in 2024 was not his fault.\n\nAsked about his business dealings, which resulted in federal tax evasion charges and illegal handgun possession that were later vacated by his father’s pardon, Biden pointed to his work as a board member at the national rail network Amtrak and the US-UN World Food Program.","summary":"In three-hour Channel 5 talk, ex-president’s son says ‘fuck him’ of actor over op-ed calling on Joe Biden to step down\n\nHunter Biden has given a profanity-laced, three-hour interview to the US outlet Channel 5 that is remarkable for its no-holds attack on actor George Clooney, denial that he was the source of cocaine found in the White House and thoughts on why his father bombed in his debate with Donald Trump before dropping out of his presidential re-election run.\n\n“Fuck him!” the younger Biden said of Clooney, whose remarkable New York Times opinion piece last July called on the Democratic party for which the actor is a financial donor to find a new presidential nominee.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/21/hunter-biden-interview-channel-5","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec8d4e9dbf7f58c1cf07dc11f7afd8e3200fdbdf/0_0_1158_926/master/1158.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2l","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 20:17:29","author":"Edward Helmore","authors":["Edward Helmore"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":343882936,"title":"Hunter Biden Claims His Father Was Given Ambien Before Disastrous Debate Against Trump","text":"Exactly one year after Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election, his son Hunter Biden is offering his thoughts on the disastrous debate performance that set the decision in motion.\n\n In a three-hour interview with YouTube personality Andrew Callaghan released on Monday, July 21, Hunter got candid about his personal struggles with addiction, his thoughts on the state of the Democratic Party as a whole, and his father's failed reelection attempt last year.\n\n While there had previously been concern about Joe's viability for another presidential term when he announced his plan to seek reelection at age 81, many saw the debate in Atlanta on June 27, 2024, as the final nail in the coffin for his campaign.\n\n During his one-and-only debate against Donald Trump, the Democratic incumbent spoke slowly, struggled to keep up with Trump's misdirects and appeared to have trouble collecting his thoughts. His supporters struggled to spin the performance afterwards, and it was largely hailed as a victory for Trump.\n\n Joe attempted to salvage the performance at a rally the following evening, telling the crowd, \"I don't walk as easily as I used to.

But I know what I do know, I know how to tell the truth!\"\n\n The president also told reporters that jet lag was to blame for his weak performance, saying he \"nearly fell asleep on stage\" because he \"didn't listen\" to his staff's advice for rest after two European trips in the weeks before the debate — though The New York Times cited sources who claimed that Biden was given ample time to sleep in and take naps during his six days of debate prep in Camp David.\n\n Now, Hunter is adding more context to the story, alleging that his father's debate performance may have also involved a prescription drug reaction.\n\n “I know exactly what happened in that debate,\" Hunter, 55, claimed. \"He flew around the world, the mileage that he could have flown around the world three times. He's 81 years old. He's tired as s---. They give him Ambien to be able to sleep, he gets up on the stage and looks like a deer in the headlights.\"\n\n A representative for President Biden declined PEOPLE's request for comment about Hunter's Ambien remark.\n\n Less than a month after the debate, and following much resistance, Joe announced he was withdrawing from the race, rallying his support behind then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who ultimately topped the Democratic ticket alongside Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n Harris and Walz were defeated by Trump and JD Vance, losing the Electoral College 312-226 and the popular vote by more than 2 million votes.\n\n Some critics have continued to chalk up Trump's victory to the chaos that played out on the Democratic ticket just a few months before the election.\n\n In his new interview with Andrew Callaghan, Hunter offered a particularly scathing takedown of George Clooney, who famously penned an op-ed for The New York Times in July 2024 that publicly urged Biden to drop out of the race.\n\n \"F--- him and everybody around him. I don't have to be f------ nice,\" the former first son said. \"George Clooney is not an actor. He's a... I don't know what he is. He's a brand.\"\n\n \"F--- you,\" Hunter continued, as if speaking to Clooney directly. \"What do you have to do with anything? Why do I have to listen to you? What right do you have to step on a man who's given 52 years of his f------ life to the service of his country and decide that you, George Clooney, are gonna take out basically a full-page ad in The New York Times... and replace their judgment over his?\"\n\n Hunter also slammed other Democratic signatories to Clooney's op-ed, including James Carville, Anita Bryant, \"the Pod Save America guys,\" David Axelrod and more.\n\n \"David Axelrod had one success in his political life, and that was Barack Obama, and that was because of Barack Obama,\" Hunter said of Obama's trusted adviser and campaign strategist.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n As for a mention of CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who recently released his latest book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, Hunter scoffed.\n\n \"What influence does Jake Tapper have over anything? He has the smallest audience on cable news,\" he said.","summary":"One year after Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, his son is sharing several controversial opinions about his father's political downfall","url":"https://people.com/hunter-biden-claims-dad-joe-took-ambien-before-2024-debate-11776101","image":"https://people.com/thmb/NeogXT6L41mmDBgVXyie8NF3_eU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Hunter-Biden-arrives-for-his-trial-at-the-J-Caleb-Boggs-Federal-Building-Joe-Biden-looks-on-as-he-participates-in-the-first-p","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 20:16:04","author":"Meredith Kile","authors":["Meredith Kile"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":343875750,"title":"Village People Reacts After President Trump Shares ‘Offensive’ AI Video of Fake Obama Arrest Set to ‘Y.M.C.A.’","text":"Skip to main content\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a press conference in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on May 12, 2025, in Washington, DC.\n\nAndrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nVillage People previously gave Donald Trump the green flag to use “Y.M.C.A.” in his campaign efforts, but a recent video featuring the song shared by the president may have just crossed a line in the eyes of the disco group.\n\nSheryl Crow Slams ‘Immoral’ President Trump in New Protest Song ‘The New Normal’: Stream…\n\nShortly after the POTUS shared a fake, AI-generated video on Truth Social of former president Barack Obama getting arrested while the band’s iconic 1970s hit plays in the background, Village People shared its thoughts on the matter in a joint statement to People on Monday (July 21). “While we don’t want ‘Y.M.C.A.’ to be used for political endorsements of any kind, President Trump merely sharing a video containing our song does not meet the standard for copyright infringement,” the members said.\n\n“However, we will attempt to find the original person or entity who posted the offensive video featuring President Barack Obama, and have such video taken down as not being endorsed by Village People, nor any of the owners of the copyright,” the group added.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nIn the controversial video, digital renderings of Trump and Obama sit together in the Oval Office. As faux FBI officers suddenly come into view, the twice-impeached chief of state smiles unnaturally while the Democratic politician is handcuffed and carried out of frame.\n\nThe clip — which also features a montage of Democratic party leaders repeating the phrase, “No one is above the law” — then cuts to AI-generated shots of Obama standing behind bars, wearing an orange jumpsuit. The former president has never been arrested, though the sitting POTUS is a convicted felon.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has platformed misleading AI-generated content. Last August, he shared false images that led supporters to believe that Taylor Swift had endorsed him for president, something the pop star later rebuked while throwing her support behind Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nMuch like the AI materials he’s shared, “Y.M.C.A.” has also become a hallmark of Trump’s second term in the White House. The billionaire often used the track at his events and rallies leading up to his 2024 election win, and — despite previously requesting that he stop — Village People has signed off on his affinity for the song.\n\n“The Trump campaign knew they had obtained a political use license from BMI and absent that license being terminated, they had every right to continue using Y.M.C.A.,” founder Victor Willis said in a December statement on Facebook. “The financial benefits have been great as well as ‘Y.M.C.A.’ is estimated to gross several million dollars since the President Elect’s continued use of the song. Therefore, I’m glad I allowed the President Elect’s continued use of Y.M.C.A. And I thank him for choosing to use my song.”\n\nThe following month, Village People performed “Y.M.C.A.” at the president’s pre-inauguration rally in Washington, D.C., where Trump joined the band members and danced along on stage.\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

NPR is not using her last name because she is worried about the stigma of having a criminal record.\n\nShe was charged with possession of marijuana, identity fraud and forgery. Her bail was set at more than $6,000, and she couldn't pay. She ended up in jail for two months, away from her two young daughters.\n\n\"I didn't have any family to bond me out. At that point in my life, I had already kind of burned a lot of bridges,\" she says. \"You feel like nobody out there cares about you. It's something I never want to experience again.\"\n\nAt that point, Jessica had three paths ahead of her. The first: Stay in jail. That outcome is common: Most people in pre-trial detention in the U.S. are there because they can't afford bail.\n\nThe second: Use a commercial bail bond company, which will pay bail in exchange for a nonrefundable fee, often 10 percent of the full bail amount.\n\nThe third: Receive help from a community bail fund. These groups use donations to pay bail, for free, for people who can't.\n\nThat last avenue is how Jessica got out, and began to turn her life around. She moved into a sober living house and reconnected with her daughters. Now, she works at a mental health and substance abuse treatment program.\n\nBail reform rollbacks\n\nCommunity bail funds are part of a larger movement to reform the practice of cash bail across the country. According to a 2024 report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, at least eight states have passed legislation since 2020 aimed at reforming bail — things like requiring judges to impose the least restrictive conditions and eliminating cash bail either entirely or for low-level offenses.\n\nBut as efforts to reform bail increase, so does the backlash against them. New York, for instance, rolled back much of its bail reform efforts just a few years after it passed them. And on Monday, President Trump weighed in on social media, calling bail reform a \"complete disaster\" and asserting that crime in U.S. cities \"started to significantly rise\" when reforms passed.\n\nViolent crime did rise in 2020 and 2021, but it has fallen over the last three years. Regarding Trump's assertions, the White House pointed NPR to a 2022 analysis done by the district attorney's office in Yolo County, Calif., which found that most of the 595 people released there without bail during the study period committed new crimes. However, another 2024 study by the Brennan Center for Justice looked at 33 cities across the country, and found bail reform did not increase crime rates.\n\nCommunity bail funds have also faced increased criticism in recent years – in part because they're more common than they used to be.\n\n\"Following the 2020 protests, there was a lot of momentum around charitable bail payments to support people who were protesting police brutality,\" says Erin George, national director of policy for The Bail Project, a nonprofit that has helped release more than 30,000 people from jails nationwide, including Jessica.\n\nIn 2015, there were only about a dozen community bail funds in the U.S., according to the National Bail Fund Network. After 2020, there were more than 100.\n\nThat surge has led to a backlash from lawmakers — nearly all Republicans — to demand those funds be more closely watched, often citing public safety concerns.\n\nBut proponents of the community funds say the calls for more regulation are a political attack on a lifeline community members can offer one another – and on an alternative to cash bail that, advocates say, prove it doesn't need to exist.\n\nThey say the funds help people who can't otherwise afford it return home as their case plays out in court, without a financial burden.\n\nAdding restrictions to community bail funds\n\nSince 2020, more than a dozen state legislatures and Congress have introduced bills to restrict or regulate community bail funds.\n\nAt least four states — including Texas, Indiana, Georgia and Kentucky — have adopted laws restricting the use of bail funds, like adding more reporting requirements, saying the funds cannot be used for people charged with a violent crime, and limiting how many people a group can bail out in a given year, though that law is being challenged in court.\n\nAlthough many of these laws passed during the Biden administration, Pilar Weiss, who runs the National Bail Fund Network, says it's troubling that this backlash is in full swing at a time when many people are protesting the second Trump administration.\n\n\"Community bail funds work as an expression of human solidarity to free people every day, as well as during moments of mass protest,\" says Weiss who added that the laws introduced and passed in various states to restrict community bail funds feel to her like part of a \"very intentional attack on solidarity across communities.\"\n\nThe impact of community bail funds is small, she says. They can't come close to bailing out everyone around the country who can't afford to pay for their own release. Many are volunteer-run, and increased regulation mandated by states could make it hard for some to function, says Mike Dunn of the Emergency Release Fund, a charitable bail organization in New York.\n\n\"There's these kinds of hurdles you have to jump through now to be able to be a charitable bail organization. You know, they don't make it easy,\" he says.\n\nIf fewer bail funds existed, Dunn says, more people would stay in jail, often in poor conditions, away from work, school and family.\n\nJeff Clayon, executive director of the American Bail Coalition, which represents commercial bail bond companies, says much of the opposition is about safety.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential election, for instance, conservatives criticized Kamala Harris for tweeting support in 2020 for the Minnesota Freedom Fund. Two people the fund bailed out were later convicted of murder. At the time, a spokesperson for the fund, Noble Frank, said the nonprofit had paid bail for nearly 3,000 people and few had committed violent crimes.\n\nStill, Clayton says, given the amount of money flowing through the funds, he believes they should be more heavily regulated.\n\n\"You do it charitable, you do it for profit, you still need to have a bail license in order to do that, and regulatory oversight where they can prohibit you from acting as a bondsman if there's abuses or for some reason you're stealing funds,\" he says.\n\nHe pointed to one criminal case in New York, where the head of a mutual aid group was indicted for allegedly using bail money for personal expenses.\n\n\"If you're going to operate in the criminal justice system, I don't really think it's that onerous,\" Clayton says, of more regulations.\n\nBut Erin George, of the Bail Project, says a key impact bail funds have had is showing that it's safe and effective to release people from pre-trial detention: According to the organization, the people they've helped release show up for more than 90 percent of their court dates.\n\n\"It makes a data-driven, evidence-based case that we should really be looking at our cash bail systems and laws,\" George says. \"And that cuts at the financial bottom line of commercial bail bond companies.\"\n\nSome bail funds are now thinking more broadly about the system as a whole.\n\nFor instance, the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which received an influx of tens of millions of dollars during the 2020 protests against police brutality, announced in May that it is pivoting away from paying bail to instead advocate for an end to cash bail altogether.","summary":"Bail Funds — where community members donate money to help others post bail — exploded in popularity after the 2020 protests against police brutality.

A year after Biden's X post sent shock waves felt across the political spectrum, the Democratic Party is still reeling from the botched campaign cycle and has found itself in a \"cold war,\" according to Democrat Julian Epstein, the former House Judiciary chief counsel. \"The Democratic Party has entered into a new phase of a cold war, whether it realizes it or not,\" Epstein told Fox News Digital. \"On the one hand, we have an increasingly radicalized socialist movement, out of step with mainstream voters, dependent on the pander politics of the welfare state, addicted to a sectarian Neo-racialist identititarian ideology, and aligning with the world's most oppressive movements in the Mideast. And most of this is driven by a delusional worldview that progressives are somehow the liberating oppression in West. The problem is almost no voters agree with this worldview.\" While the other side of the party, he said, is \"a more trad moderate wing\" that is \"glomming on to the new fad known as the 'abundance.'\" BIDEN CAMPAIGN TAPPED 24-YEAR-OLD ‘SOCIAL MEDIA WHIZ’ TO POST PRESIDENT’S DROPOUT LETTER, NEW BOOK REVEALS \"This movement is led by the so-called ‘smarties’ in the center,\" he continued. \"It's not that abundance is not a smart pivot – it is. The problem is it's too small, too technocratic, too inside baseball for a meaningful reset. And those leading this alternative vision seem too easily intimidated by the other wing, and particularly the flying monkeys of the online progressive left, whenever they pop their heads up. As a result, the moderates lack any big bold vision to reset the party to a more viable common-sense center.\" The Democratic Party's current state followed an unprecedented 2024 election cycle that was thrown into a tailspin when Biden officially announced he would not run for re-election in the dead of summer. Biden's White House staff and campaign had for weeks following his disastrous June 27, 2024, debate against President Donald Trump that the 46th president would remain in the race despite mounting concerns over his mental acuity and calls for him to bow out and pass the torch to a younger generation of Democrats. Despite allies urging Democratic voters to \"keep the faith\" and support Biden, the president posted a letter to X that read: \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\" Biden shortly thereafter endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take the reins of the Democratic campaign to secure the White House for another term, leaving her with just 100 days to reinvigorate support for the blue ticket. Harris failed to drum up the support needed to defeat Trump, losing each of the seven swing states, including the key battleground of Pennsylvania that carries 19 electoral votes. In the wake of the election, Democrats played a blame game for the loss, with some pointing to Harris' campaign, arguing the Biden campaign left them in a lurch with just 107 days. Others pointed to Harris' running mate, Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as a weak choice to invigorate voters. Others pinned blame on the apparent behind-the-scenes push from high-profile Democrats to encourage Biden out of the race. DEMOCRATIC PARTY SCRAMBLES TO FIX IMAGE AS MEMBERS ACKNOWLEDGE PARTY 'LOST CREDIBILITY' A handful of former President Barack Obama's allies and former advisors publicly helped lead the charge in calling on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race earlier in the summer, including David Axelrod, who said Biden was \"not winning this race;\" George Clooney, who called on the president to quit in a bombshell op-ed; and Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama. \"There is no singular reason why we lost, but a big reason is because the Obama advisors publicly encouraged Democratic infighting to push Joe Biden out, didn’t even want Kamala Harris as the nominee, and then signed up as the saviors of the campaign, only to run outdated Obama-era playbooks for a candidate that wasn’t Obama,\" one former Biden staffer told Politico in the immediate fallout of the election. Other pundits pointed to how the Obamas took three days before endorsing Harris after allegedly encouraging Biden to drop out. DEM SENATOR SAYS BIDEN SHOULD HAVE DROPPED OUT OF PRESIDENTIAL RACE MUCH SOONER Following the immediate backlash over Harris' election loss, the Democratic Party has grappled with the exodus of the working-class vote to the GOP, with high-profile senators such as John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Bernie Sanders of Vermont arguing Democrats turned their backs on the blue-collar vote. \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\" Sanders posted to X following the election. \"And they’re right.\" Fetterman, who repeatedly has been identified as the Democratic Party's \"voice of reason\" following the 2024 race, argued in February that the party had become \"toxic\" after years of \"shaming and scolding\" voters. DEMOCRATS SEETHE OVER BIDEN'S RETURN TO PUBLIC EYE: REPORT \"I think their primary currency was shaming and scolding and talking down to people and telling them ‘Hey, I know better than you, or you’re dopes, or you’re a bro, or you’re ignorant or, how can you be this dumb?' I can’t imagine it. And then, by the way, they’re fascists. How can you vote for that?\" Fetterman said on a podcast in February. \"And you know, when you’re in a state like Pennsylvania, I know and I love people that voted for Trump, and they’re not fascist. They don’t support insurrection and those things. And if you go to an extreme, and you become a boutique kind of proposition, then you’re going to lose the argument. And we have done that.\" The party's identity crisis has been underscored by claims it has gone too far to the left in recent years, most notably on social issues such as transgender issues, with even the New York Times editorial board chastising the party in a March op-ed. \"Democrats should recognize that the party moved too far left on social issues after Barack Obama left office in 2017. The old video clips of Ms. Harris that the Trump campaign gleefully replayed last year – on decriminalizing the border and government-funded gender-transition surgery for prisoners – highlighted the problem. Yes, she tried to abandon these stances before the election, but she never spoke forthrightly to voters and acknowledged she had changed her position,\" the editorial board wrote at the time. Obama has meanwhile told the party to \"toughen up\" and \"stop looking for a quick fix\" after the election. \"I think it’s going to require a little bit less navel-gazing and a little less whining and being in fetal positions. And it’s going to require Democrats to just toughen up,\" Obama said at a fundraiser earlier in July, according to excerpts obtained by CNN. \"Don’t tell me you’re a Democrat, but you’re kind of disappointed right now, so you’re not doing anything. No, now is exactly the time that you get in there and do something.\" The midterms next year loom large over both political parties. Democrats are embroiled in controversy in New York City's mayoral race, where socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani locked down the Democratic primary in June and has since come under fierce scrutiny for his far-left platform. BIDEN DENIES HE LEFT 2024 RACE TOO LATE TO STOP TRUMP, SAYS IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE Epstein continued that the Democrat Party's current \"cold war\" is also rooted in an \"addiction\" to \"anger.\" \"Undergirding all this is a dangerous culture of anger and negativity that has become the party's public face. The increasingly loud voices seem to be trapped in a permanent primal scream, and at times seem more like an odd street dance troupe or college protesters,\" he said. \"This is what happens when social media influence rather than governance becomes a party's North Star,\" Epstein continued. \"Anger has become the norm on the left, it has become an addiction, a shibboleth. It's a narcotic within the progressive monoculture, but it's toxic outside of it. Until the party can say ‘no’ to the activist groups, get more focused on voters rather than online influencers, and move back to the traditional political center as it was in the 1990s, the toxic ratings for the party, the worst perhaps on record, will continue to decline.\" As Biden notches his one-year anniversary since dropping out of his re-election race, Trump celebrated a milestone of his own Sunday: the six-month anniversary of his second presidency. \"Wow, time flies! Today is that Sixth Month Anniversary of my Second Term. Importantly, it’s being hailed as one of the most consequential periods of any President,\" Trump wrote on social media Sunday. \"In other words, we got a lot of good and great things done, including ending numerous wars of Countries not related to us other than through Trade and/or, in certain cases, friendship,\" he added on TRUTH Social. \"Six months is not a long time to have totally revived a major Country.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"One year ago our Country was DEAD, with almost no hope of revival.

His exit was first reported by Axios on Monday.\n\nCapehart’s final column for the Post, published in May, featured a conversation with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on “countering” the president.\n\nThat same month, Capehart resigned from the newspaper’s editorial board over a dispute with a white colleague about a piece that anazlyed Georgia’s voting laws and their alleged racial implications.\n\nCapehart had previously referred to Trump as “a cancer on the presidency and American society” and compared a rally held by Trump at Madison Square Garden to a Nazi rally at the same venue in 1939.\n\nThe terms of his buyout were not disclosed. \n\nRepresentatives for the Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCapehart will continue co-hosting MSNBC’s “The Weekend” and remain a panelist on PBS’s “NewsHour.”\n\nThe buyout follows comments made by Washington Post CEO Will Lewis, who in recent weeks urged employees who do not “feel aligned” with the company’s editorial direction to resign.\n\nHis departure adds to a string of exits at the paper over the Beltway broadsheet’s shift to the right. In February, Bezos ordered the Post’s opinion section to focus on “personal liberties and free markets.”\n\nThe directive led to the resignation of Opinion Editor David Shipley, followed by the departure of multiple other opinion writers, including longtime columnist Ruth Marcus. \n\nLast month, Adam O’Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Dispatch, was named opinion editor. \n\nWeeks later, popular columnist Joe Davidson announced he was leaving after one of his columns was killed for being “too opinionated.”\n\nDavidson criticized the paper’s ownership, stating that “Bezos’s policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant.”\n\nThe paper faced subscriber backlash after Bezos blocked a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for president shortly before the election. Approximately 250,000 subscribers canceled their subscriptions.\n\nIn January, several top reporters and editors — including Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, Josh Dawsey and Tyler Pager — left the Post for rival outlets such as The Atlantic and the New York Times.\n\nManaging editor Matea Gold joined the Times’ Washington bureau in late 2024.

Biden and \"Channel 5\" podcaster Andrew Callaghan spoke for three hours on a range of topics, from the former first son’s cocaine use, to the former president’s disastrous debate, to theories that he was marketing paintings to assuage overseas interests in favor of his dad. On immigration, Biden began by revisiting the Reconstruction era and the Ku Klux Klan’s early role as a voter suppression organization against Black Americans. He discussed an 1873 incident in Colfax, Louisiana, when former Confederate militiamen and the Klan converged with a cannon on a courthouse where several Black men were defending GOP officeholders following a contested election. Many of those defenders were slaughtered outside the courthouse and Biden said such violence and intimidation continued throughout the country thereafter. Connecting that time to the present, Biden said America gets stuck in a \"permanent Jim Crow loop\" that when the \"more perfect union\" is nearly realized, a \"symbiosis between money and power\" ruins it. \"There is a minority group that those in power, that came into power through democratically elected means, are going to target this minority group because they're stealing all the jobs,\" he said, as clips played of Trump from 2016 speaking about \"Mexico not sending their best\" and claims of migrants \"eating the dogs\" in Ohio. \"And what we're going to do is we're going to send masked men to this marginalized group, and we are going to take them, put them on planes, put them on buses, put them on trains, and send them to a prison camp in a foreign country,\" Biden fumed.

During the forty-minute interview, Daniels raged about politics, waxed poetic over how wonderful a Kamala Harris presidency would have been, cried over the loss of civility, but also called Trump and Republicans names and wished ill-will towards them.\n\nDuring one segment, for instance, the Dumb and Dumber star lamented the lack of civility in political discourse.\n\n“We’ve lost decency. We’ve lost civility. We’ve lost respect for the rule of law. We lost it. We have normalized verbal abuse from the Internet. We’ve normalized bullying. Much as the woke generation tried to, you know, change that. It’s back,” he said noting that the widespread censorship attempted by Europe, Hollywood, Biden and other extremists utterly failed to quash free speech.\n\n“Out the window goes character, integrity. I mean, nobody has great things to say about politicians. We never have. Go back to Mark Twain. But ideally, we’re supposed to elect the best of us, not the worst of us,” Daniels continued, before attacking Trump.\n\n“He’s everything that’s wrong with not just America but being a human being.”\n\nSo, on one hand, we have lost “civility,” Daniels cries, then on the other he calls his political opponent a bad human being. Do these people hear themselves?\n\nThis big supporter of civility also went on to say that he hopes Republicans will lose “tons of money” with Republicans in control of the levers of government.\n\nIn yet another segment, Daniels insisted that Kamala Harris would have governed like Abraham Lincoln if she had won the White House.\n\n“I still think about Kamala,” he said wistfully. “And how I think she would have been a good choice, I don’t care what they say.”\n\n“Because she would have done what Lincoln did,” he astonishingly continued. “Liz Cheney would have been Secretary of State.”\n\n“Team of rivals, [left-wing historian] Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote a book about it. That’s what Lincoln did, surrounded himself with the people who would disagree with him, not the people who would, you know, take a knee and say, ‘yeah, more tariffs sir., More.'”\n\nDaniels’ proclamation was ahistoric, of course. Lincoln did not pick people with radically differing opinions on what America should be. All Lincoln’s cabinet picks agreed that the Civil War needed to be won. There were some details that they differed over on government policy, but most opposed Lincoln because when he first ran, they felt he was a dumb country bumpkin and that they were smarter than him. Yet all of them revered Lincoln and his goals after working closely with him.\n\nIt is also absurd that Daniels would use the tariffs point in that rambling screed. After all, the entire American government was funded by tariffs at that time. It is true that as the war began the Lincoln administration helped implement a new income tax, but it was a temporary measure, because it was only in place for the war effort and was done away with later. Not only that, but Lincoln was once a member of the Whig Party, and the Whigs favored steeper tariffs to fund the government!\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, X at WTHuston, or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston.","summary":"Far left-wing actor Jeff Daniels is lamenting the loss of civility in politics today, but also hopes that Republicans lose \"a lot of money.\"\n\n\nThe post Mean Girls: Jeff Daniels Savages Trump with MSNBC&#8217;s Nicolle Wallace; &#8216;He’s Everything That’s Wrong with America&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/07/21/mean-girls-jeff-daniels-savages-trump-with-msnbcs-nicolle-wallace-hes-everything-thats-wrong-with-america/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/jeffdaniels-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 19:24:13","author":"Warner Todd Huston","authors":["Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":343870064,"title":"‘F*ck Him!’: Hunter Biden Goes Scorched Earth On Almost Anyone You Can Think Of Tied To Democratic Party","text":"Hunter Biden lit into Academy Award-winning actor George Clooney and other figures tied to the Democratic Party in a lengthy interview released Monday.\n\nHunter Biden’s father, then-President Joe Biden, announced that he would decline the Democratic nomination via a post on X on July 21, 2024, with Biden endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement in a follow-up post.

In a New York Times op-ed published in July 2024,Clooney said that the Biden he saw at the fundraising event he “co-hosted” was the same Biden at the June 27, 2024, debate with then-former President Donald Trump, during which the then-sitting president froze several times and repeatedly made verbal gaffes.\n\n“And James Carville who hasn’t run a race in 40 fucking years, and David Axelrod who had one success in his political life, and that was Barack Obama, and that was because of Barack Obama not because of fucking David Axelrod,” Hunter Biden said. “And David Plouffe, and all of these guys, the ‘Pod Save America’ guys who were junior fucking speechwriters in — you know, on Barack Obama’s Senate staff, who have been dining out on the relationship with him for years making millions of dollars.”\n\n“The Anita Dunns of the world, who’s made 40, 50 million dollars off the Democratic Party — they’re all going to insert their judgment over a man who has figured out unlike anybody else how to get elected to the United States Senate over seven times, how to pass more legislation than any president in history, how to have a better midterm election than anybody in history and how to garner more votes than any president that has ever run.

With Green's departure, there are now 431 House members and four vacancies, including those from late Democratic Reps. Sylvester Turner of Texas, Raul Grijalva of Arizona, and Gerry Connolly of Virginia. Green, the Republican from Tennessee, said last month that he would leave Congress for the private sector once the House voted again on President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" in a statement first obtained by Fox News Digital. \"It is with a heavy heart that I announce my retirement from Congress.

Green acknowledged in his statement that he had previously geared up to retire in the last Congress, but reversed course. \"Though I planned to retire at the end of the previous Congress, I stayed to ensure that President Trump’s border security measures and priorities make it through Congress,\" he said. \"By overseeing the border security portion of the reconciliation package, I have done that. After that, I will retire, and there will be a special election to replace me.\" Green is an Army veteran who has served in Congress since 2019. As House Homeland Security Committee chair, he oversaw Republicans' impeachment of former Biden administration DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Even with Green's departure from Congress, it's a safe bet to assume his House seat will stay in Republican hands. The district voted for Trump by more than 20 percentage points over former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. Fox News Digital was first to report last week that Green endorsed Matt Van Epps to replace him in the U.S. House of Representatives. Van Epps is a decorated Army veteran and the former commissioner of Tennessee's Department of General Services (DGS), calling him a \"true warrior.\" \"Matt Van Epps has my complete and total endorsement,\" Green shared in a statement with Fox News Digital. Green revealed that he served in the same Army special operations unit as Van Epps, which he described as \"a brotherhood that cannot be replicated anywhere else.\" In a statement shared first with Fox News Digital, Van Epps said he was \"deeply honored\" to receive Green's endorsement and \"ready to put the people of the 7th District first.\" \"Congressman Green has left some very large shoes to fill, but I’m ready to step in and continue his work on behalf of Tennesseans,\" Van Epps said.

West Virginia, the state that’s voted for the Republican candidate for president since 2000 — and for Donald Trump, not Kamala Harris, by a margin of 70 percent to 28 percent. West Virginia, the state where Republicans just won the governor’s office, retained both House seats and a Senate seat that had been considered safely Democrat.\n\nMeanwhile, in this same survey, Illinois claimed the number three spot in terms of protecting religious liberty.\n\nThe takeaway is that religious persecution knows no political bounds.\n\nRepublican controlled states, while seemingly on the side of religious liberties, aren’t always coming through in the clinch.\n\nThis is why churches need to step up, step out of their comfort zones and get more involved in politics and culture. Just because Donald Trump won the White House and as such, reeled in many of the insanities of the Democrat Party — the transgenderism, the open borders, the taxpayer funding for issues that are contrary to the conscious of Christians and conservatives — doesn’t mean that America is chugging along a smooth and easy path toward long-lasting freedom.\n\nAmerica is only as free as its church community is strong.\n\nAmericans can only retain their liberties so long as their religious leaders are engaged in culture, and teaching their congregations to likewise engage — and fight, fight, fight.\n\nTop ten on this state rankings are, in order, Florida, Montana, Illinois, Ohio, Mississippi, Arkansas, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Tennessee. The bottom ten are, in order, from 41-through-50, Wisconsin, South Dakota, California, North Carolina, New York, Vermont, Nebraska, Michigan, Wyoming and West Virginia.\n\nBut none scored perfectly.\n\nNone ranked above 74.6 percent — Florida’s score — on a list of dozens of criteria used to determine a state’s protection of religious liberty.\n\nThis is subpar. No state has bragging rights.\n\nIn a land of citizens who take their rights and liberties from the Creator, the fact that the best states can offer in terms of protecting religious freedom — which is the basis of God-given individualism — is a 74.6 percent, well then, there’s work to be done. Trump in the political world may be taking care of much that has bothered both conservatives and Christians for years; decades even. But it’s up to churches and up to Christians in the church community to take on more of a role in ensuring the long-lasting protections of individual rights and liberties for all Americans.\n\nGod-given rights and liberties cannot last if those who know God best — the believers — don’t actively fight against the growing secularized culture and ensuing corrupt government. Abandoning politics and failing to engage in culture are not biblical teachings — not truthful ones, anyway. And Christians who say the Bible teaches to live in this world but not of this world as a matter of dismissing any involvement in culture and politics are wrong. Letting the wicked have their way only breeds more wickedness. Who’s left to protect the innocent?\n\nWho’s left to fight for God’s glory?\n\nIf America is supposed to be the shining light on the hill for all the world to see as an example of freedom and justice and liberty — then Americans of faith must get involved in all of society. Christians should take these years of Trump not as a time of rest, but as a time to push harder and for more.\n\nIf it’s not God-given, it’s government-granted. And if it’s government-granted, then freedom certainly falls.\n\n• Cheryl Chumley can be reached at cchumley@washingtontimes.com or on Twitter, @ckchumley.

This was the opposite of what happened in 2018, when revulsion against Trump and a huge upsurge in organizing increased Democratic turnout and flipped 41 House seats. About 67 percent of voters ages 18 to 29 voted Democrat for the House. The surge lasted just long enough to elect Joe Biden and narrowly flip the Senate.\n\nSo why the collapse in 2024? Contrary to a lot of conventional wisdom, the explanation was not voter apathy.\n\nA new poll by Celinda Lake conducted for the group Way to Win finds that a large majority of these disaffected nonvoters hold progressive views on the economy. Forty-nine percent said they would have voted for Kamala Harris, compared to just 25 percent for Donald Trump. But they were not motivated to vote for Harris because they found her views on key pocketbook issues too feeble.\n\nThese findings complement those reported by my colleague Harold Meyerson today. On pocketbook issues, most Americans are economic progressives. What’s missing is compelling leadership.\n\nLake’s poll reached 833 Americans who voted for Biden in 2020 and did not vote at all in 2024. The top reason, cited by 31 percent of such voters, was that Harris “didn’t have a strong enough plan to get the cost of living down” and failed to address “deeper issues like poverty and inequality.” Another 15 percent said she “didn’t have the leadership qualities the country needed.”\n\nInterestingly, this was not a case of these nonvoters being tuned out of politics altogether. Fully 49 percent said they checked the news several times a day. And 75 percent said they closely followed politics. There were just underwhelmed by what the Democrats were offering.\n\nToday, 62 percent would vote for a Democrat for Congress compared with just 19 percent for a Republican—if they voted at all.\n\nWhat leaders did these 2024 nonvoters admire? The top two in the poll were Bernie Sanders, approved by 78 percent, and AOC with 67 percent.\n\nAnd these 2024 nonvoters have a split-screen view of the Democrats. In principle, said 39 percent, “They are more for the people and will fight for all Americans.” But at the same time, 24 percent said “they are weak and won’t stand up for Americans.”\n\nWhen the poll asked what issues would make them more likely to vote in 2026, the top four were secure health insurance, making the rich pay their fair share of taxes while keeping taxes on working families affordable, the cost of living, and affordable housing.\n\nIn battleground states, 77 percent of 2020 Biden voters who stayed home in 2024 felt that the nation’s top problem was the top 1 percent taking too much at the expense of everyone else, but only 13 percent felt the main problems were government spending too much, out-of-control immigration, or “wokeness.”\n\nLake told me that Democrats in 2026 should “offer a populist economic alternative to Trump’s current economics that benefits wealthy corporations and wealthy political donors. Fight for working famiies, and offer specifics that you are willing to be accountable for.”\n\nIn one sense, the program sounds a lot like New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. But a program of making life affordable for working Americans doesn’t have to be expressed in ideological terms. A classic political-science finding is that Americans tend to be philosophical conservatives but operational liberals.\n\nIdentifying the right issues framed by the right narrative is important, but issues by themselves don’t galvanize potential voters.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers then dredges and deposits sand on eroded beaches in states like New Jersey, with state and local governments covering a small share of the cost. The federal government pays most of it — nearly $29 million funded the last replenishment of Avalon and Stone Harbor, New Jersey, in 2023.That project added nearly 700,000 cubic yards of sand to the beaches.This year, however, the Army Corps said its Philadelphia District, which oversees southern New Jersey, will get no funding for 2025, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Monday.What To KnowThe cuts land hardest on some of the same Republican-leaning towns that handed Donald Trump a decisive win in 2024. In Cape May County — home to Avalon, Stone Harbor and Ocean City — Trump won 58.7 percent of the vote against Democrat Kamala Harris's 39.5 percent, flipping the county from Democrat in 2020.Steve Rochette, a spokesman for the Army Corps, said the Philadelphia District had two projects eligible for funding in 2025 — Avalon-Stone Harbor and the north end of Ocean City — but neither will proceed. Projects in Maryland's Ocean City and Delaware's Bethany, Rehoboth and Dewey beaches also received zero funding.\"This is the first time in 29 years this has happened,\" said Scott Wahl, Avalon's business administrator. \"That means Avalon will not get a hydraulic fill. You're looking at tens of millions of dollars.\"Avalon and Stone Harbor have historically relied on federal help for sand replenishment. In 2023, the federal government paid nearly $29 million for a project that placed hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of sand along their beaches. Without that aid this year, Avalon resorted to scraping 39,000 cubic yards from other areas of its own beach at its own expense — a small fraction of what is typically needed.Wahl said the shore communities are willing to contribute but cannot cover the full costs alone. \"Other towns don't even have enough sand to move around,\" he told the Inquirer.Advocates warn that delaying projects only compounds problems. Dan Ginolfi of the American Coastal Coalition said the limited number of dredging contractors and tight environmental windows mean projects need to be precisely timed. \"If we can't get those projects done in a certain amount of time,\" Ginolfi said, \"it increases the demand on the dredgers. The cost of dredging is already sky-high, and that just snowballs.\"Howard Marlowe, the coalition's founder, added: \"New Jersey could afford to do one or two projects, but it can't afford to do all the ones that need to be done.\"What People Are SayingScott Wahl, business administrator of Avalon, to the Inquirer: \"We look at the beach not as an expense, but rather as an investment that pays rich dividends for resiliency, recreation, and fuels the economic engine on both the state and federal levels.\"Dan Ginolfi, executive director of the American Coastal Coalition, to the Inquirer: \"If we can't get those projects done in a certain amount of time, it increases the demand on the dredgers. The cost of dredging is already sky-high, and that just snowballs.\"What Happens NextThe Army Corps and New Jersey officials say they are continuing to monitor conditions and expect more communities — including Cape May, Ocean City, Sea Isle City and Strathmere — to be eligible for funding when the next budget cycle begins October 1.Until then, these coastal towns, many of which strongly supported Republican candidates last fall, remain without the federal dollars they've depended on for decades.","summary":"Some of New Jersey's most reliably Republican towns are now confronting an abrupt loss of federal beach replenishment funding.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jersey-shore-gop-strongholds-lose-federal-beach-aid-after-decades-2101951","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2687406/new-jersey-beach.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3e704974a2cf7266b6599368d02a10da","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 18:53:48","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.501},{"id":343855738,"title":"Washington Post exodus grows as MSNBC host and Pulitzer Prize winner Jonathan Capehart takes Bezos buyout","text":"The flood of high-profile editorial talent fleeing the Washington Post as the storied newspaper revamps its opinion section to focus exclusively on “personal liberties and free markets” continued to grow this week as Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Jonathan Capehart decided to take a buyout.\n\nCapehart’s departure comes just days after longtime Post reporter and writer Philip Bump announced that he had also accepted a buyout and had written his last column, which followed the paper’s beleaguered CEO Will Lewis’ ultimatum to staffers to leave if they “do not feel aligned” with the company’s new direction.\n\nAs first reported by Axios’ Sara Fischer Monday morning, Capehart – who was a member of the Post’s editorial board until 2023 – ended his 18-year run with the paper this week after taking a buyout through the company’s recently implemented voluntary separation program.\n\nCapehart, meanwhile, will continue to co-host MSNBC’s The Weekend, and serve as a political analyst for PBS.\n\nThe Washington Post and Capehart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe paper has been experiencing an exodus of reporters, columnists and editors since late last year when the Post’s owner Jeff Bezos blocked the editorial board’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

F‑‑‑ him. F‑‑‑ him and everybody around him,” Hunter Biden said during the interview released Monday, in response to an anecdote about Clooney’s political involvement. “I don’t have to be f‑‑‑ing nice. No. 1, I agree with Quentin Tarantino. … F‑‑‑ing George Clooney is not a f‑‑‑ing actor. He is a f‑‑‑ing, like … I don’t know what he is. He is a brand.”\n\nClooney was among the first prominent Democrats to call on the then-president to drop out, warning in an op-ed in The New York Times last July that the party would lose the election otherwise.\n\nWithin two weeks, the elder Biden announced he was dropping his reelection bid and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to fill his place. Clooney thanked him “for saving democracy once again” in response and endorsed Harris.\n\nThe former president’s son also lashed out at other high-profile figures in the party.\n\n“What do you have to do with f‑‑‑ing anything?

In a New York Times op-ed published Monday, Carville went nuclear in the opening: “The Democratic Party is in shambles.” \n\n Our party is headed for a civilized civil war.

My latest in @nytimes https://t.co/O56YhvtHKY — James Carville (@JamesCarville) July 21, 2025\n\nI’ll add one more to the list: diseased.\n\nTwo days before Carville’s screed, The New York Times ran a shocking story on the DNC’s ongoing 2024 election autopsy. The DNC’s full report is not yet complete, though according to The Times, it has focused more on the outside groups and Super PACs that spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the Biden and Harris campaigns rather than the poor decisions made by the campaigns themselves.\n\nAnd what decisions might those be?\n\nWhether Joe Biden should have dropped out earlier. Whether he should have dropped out. Whether he should have even run for re-election to begin with. Whether Kamala Harris was the right replacement. Whether the Harris campaign should have framed the election as an existential contest between democracy and fascism.\n\nThese decisions cost the Democrats the election, but the DNC’s autopsy is apparently downplaying all of them. (RELATED: Democrats Made A Mess When They Shoved Biden Into Traffic)\n\n“We are not interested in second-guessing campaign tactics or decisions of campaign operatives,” Jane Kleeb, the Nebraska Democratic chairwoman and head of the association of Democratic state chairs, told the outlet. “We are interested in what voters turned out for Republicans and Democrats, and how we can fix this moving forward.”\n\nHere’s a DNC spokeswoman, Rosemary Boeglin: “The D.N.C.’s post-election review is not a finger-pointing exercise, it’s about bringing together Democrats across the ecosystem to adopt an actionable playbook to win, not just for 2026 and 2028, but to dominate for cycles to come. Democrats are cleareyed about the challenges facing the party — many of which are rooted well before the 2024 cycle — and it requires all of us to make structural changes in how we run campaigns.”\n\nSo, “cleareyed” Democrats need to make “structural changes” in how they run campaigns, but aren’t even willing to examine the clown shows run by Biden and Harris campaign operatives? Maybe some actual finger-pointing would serve the Democrats well.\n\nMaybe it’s because they don’t want to draw any more attention to Biden or Kamala. Discussing the Biden campaign’s decision to run for re-election means addressing Biden’s cognitive decline and the White House’s years-long cover-up. Discussing Kamala is, well, a reminder of how poor of a candidate she was and why the Democrats were foolish not to have an open primary. Maybe it’s because they’re still as arrogant as ever and lack self-awareness.\n\nThey want to cast blame on the Super PACs like Future Forward that burned over half a billion dollars on Biden and Harris, according to The Times, which is well and fair. But there also needs to be accountability for the advisors and staffers on both campaigns. Ignoring the campaigns is like a doctor obsessively focusing on a cancer patient’s ingrown toenail.","summary":"'We are not interested in second-guessing campaign tactics'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/21/dnc-autopsy-report-new-york-times-biden-harris-campaigns/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2154628581-scaled-e1753110598577.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 18:18:46","author":"John Loftus","authors":["John Loftus"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":343846544,"title":"Actor Jeff Daniels laments Kamala Harris’ loss, suggests she would have governed like Abraham Lincoln","text":"Actor Jeff Daniels lamented former Vice President Kamala Harris losing the 2024 presidential election in a new interview, saying she would have governed like President Abraham Lincoln. \"I still think about Kamala, and how I think she would have been a good choice,\" Daniels told MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace in an episode published Monday of her podcast, \"The Best People.\" \"I don't care what they say, because she would have done what Lincoln did.\" \"Liz Cheney would have been secretary of state,\" Daniels said.

It isn’t the ideas of Thomas Jefferson or even of Karl Marx. It’s hatred. They hate the people in this room. They hate the president of the United States. And most of all, they hate the people who voted for [President Donald Trump] in the last election in November.”\n\nThis incisive illustration captures the absurd political moment for Democrats and their untenable coalition. The party not only lacks a coherent, unifying platform; its disparate parts alienate a growing share of the public, especially minority voters. Winning as a Republican today is primarily a matter of highlighting the other team. The mass protests and rallies, from “Tesla Takedown” to “Hands Off” to “No Kings,” have not increased Democratic support one iota or weakened Trump precisely because they’ve made the clown show more visible. \n\nWhat greater gift could the administration receive than leftists waving Mexican flags in Los Angeles or burning American flags on Washington Square Park on the Fourth of July? What could make Republicans more appealing than throngs of middle-aged white people in REI gear dancing the electric slide outside a Tesla factory while brandishing swastika placards?\n\nDemocrats would be better served going dark. A few smart consultants said so after the November election, but they were ignored to the benefit of the GOP. \n\nMoving toward the midterm elections, Republicans would be wise to follow Vance’s lead: push the Democratic agenda, such as it is, to the fore at every moment.\n\nLet them rail against the cishet patriarchy while wearing keffiyehs, recite slam poetry about fighting the oligarchy. Hand Mamdani the microphone and step away slowly. Everything looks reasonable by contrast.\n\nVance’s clarity in exposing the Left’s contradictions is a winning strategy — until it veers into a blood and soil nationalism that will almost certainly alienate more voters than it attracts. The second half of Vance’s Claremont speech is rotten with red flags for a Republican Party hoping to fend off the Left through the 2020s.\n\nOf course, the GOP needs a unifying vision as the Trump era wanes, or it will fall into the trap of only being against things itself. But the vision Vance proposed at Claremont, rooted in rejecting America as a creedal nation while prioritizing ancestry over shared values, will repel moderates, minorities, and even some conservatives who favor a model of national identity rooted in universal ideals. \n\nReflecting on what constitutes an American in 2025, Vance asked, “Is it purely an agreement with the creedal principles of America? … That’s a definition that is way over-inclusive and under-inclusive at the same time. … [That definition] would include hundreds of millions, maybe billions of foreign citizens who agree with the principles of the Declaration of Independence. Must we admit all of them tomorrow?”\n\nMore than a facile hypothetical — no one argues that everyone on Earth who holds to American principles should be considered de facto American — criticism of the declaration as insufficient will rightfully trouble voters beyond New Right online spaces. Vance’s insistence that America is “not just an idea where a particular place with a particular people and a particular set of beliefs and way of life” defies not only commonly held American beliefs but the values extolled by our greatest historical leaders. \n\nIn his 1858 “Electric Cord” speech, President Abraham Lincoln refutes Vance on immigrants and American identity: “If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none … but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence … and then they feel that moral sentiment … they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that declaration, and so they are.” \n\nOne can only imagine how Lincoln might respond to another of Vance’s ideas posed at Claremont: that people whose “ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America” than modern-day liberals.\n\nEither Vance doesn’t realize this sets off alarm bells, which is difficult to believe, or he is in the full grip of hubris. The nation sided with Trump-Vance on immigration in 2024 following years of open borders. But with the border now secure, public sentiment on immigration levels and pathways to citizenship has shifted back to 2021 levels. The nation overwhelmingly concurs with Lincoln over Vance on the definition of an “American.” He and the Republican Party disregard this at their peril. \n\nVance’s rhetoric on American identity is not explicitly ethnonationalist, but he must realize it sounds that way, making it both dangerous and foolish. To be certain, dark forces lurk among the seedier elements of the New Right, and they are hardly below the surface. \n\nThey have their own clown show, and it’s every bit as full of freaks as its counterpart.\n\nConsider highly influential activist and Vance booster Laura Loomer, who received a private White House audience with the vice president only one month ago. She recently posted on “Alligator Alcatraz”: “The good news is, alligators are guaranteed at least 65 million meals if we get started now.” There are currently 65 million Latinos living in the United States, both immigrants and U.S.-born.\n\nThen there’s alt-right podcaster Jack Posobiec, for whom Vance blurbed his most recent book. Posobiec echoed Vance on American identity at last week’s Turning Point USA Conference, saying, “Does commie Zohran Mandani seem like an American? No, he’s not an American. Is Zohran Mandami an American like we are? No. He’s absolutely not.”\n\nMeanwhile, TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk, whom Vance gushed about immediately prior to his Claremont speech, posted after Mamdani’s victory: “24 years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim Socialist is on pace to run New York City,” implying every Muslim is a 9/11 terrorist. A brief scroll through replies shows a majority of Kirk’s followers disliked the post because they believe the Jews did 9/11.\n\nVance’s conscious, ongoing decision to inspire and even partner with this element is the surest way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and return the nation to the Left. The Mamdani Democrats have no hope of winning a battle of ideas, but an identity politics battle featuring two equally odious factions? That’s anyone’s ballgame.\n\nVance’s incisive critique of the Left will leave it in tatters. But his emphasis on ancestry over ideals and his partnership with ethnonationalists are the liberals’ only shot at exploiting divisions and weaseling their way back into power.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance delivered a blistering indictment of the Democrats’ New York City mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, earlier this month.

The two are widely seen as favorites for the 2028 GOP nomination.\n\nMeanwhile, a Democratic presidential bid is up for grabs with no campaign announcements yet.\n\nHere are some of the candidates potentially eyeing a 2028 run and where they are going:\n\nAug. 8-9 — Gallego visits Iowa for state fair and town hall\n\nSen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) announced on July 9 that he is traveling to Iowa in August.\n\nGallego’s campaign said he will meet with voters at the state fair in Des Moines and headline a town hall in the Quad Cities, a region of five cities throughout Iowa and Illinois. The visit will last from Aug. 8 to 9.\n\nGiven his out-of-state trips to key states, the junior senator is speculated to run in the 2028 election. On May 10, he held a town hall in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which Trump flipped by about 500 votes last year.\n\nIn a recent interview, Gallego said that while he’s thought about running in three years, he’s currently focused on serving Arizona.\n\n“Has it ever crossed my mind? F***ing of course, I’m an elected official, it crosses my mind,” he told NBC News ahead of his town hall event in Pennsylvania. “Am I thinking about it right now? Absolutely not.”\n\nJuly 16-18 – Beshear visits South Carolina \n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) said he was visiting South Carolina for his son’s baseball tournament in Charleston, but made many campaign-like stops. He attended private meetings and dinners across the state, from cities like Charleston to towns in conservative Georgetown County. \n\nDuring his visit, he called Trump’s agenda and prized legislation a “punch in the face” to rural communities, and cited his faith as his guidance. \n\n“For me, my ‘why’ is my faith. I’m guided by the golden rule that says I love my neighbor as myself and the parable of The Good Samaritan that says, ‘Everyone is my neighbor.’” He said during an event in Greenville. “And when you explain your ‘why,’ even when you make tough decisions, even in states like mine and yours, it creates the grace and the space for people to disagree.”\n\nJuly 17 and Aug. 9 — Youngkin visits Iowa and South Carolina for GOP dinner events\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) is heading to Iowa, where he will headline the Iowa Republican Party’s annual dinner on July 17. He will also travel to South Carolina to attend the South Carolina Republican Party’s annual fundraising dinner on Aug. 9.\n\nYoungkin previously weighed a 2024 presidential bid but decided against it, saying he wanted to focus on serving Virginia. He was later considered a contender for Trump’s running mate list last year.\n\nThe term-limited governor has not directly said if he will run in 2028. His term expires in January 2026.\n\nIowa is a key primary state, as it traditionally hosts early primary caucuses. South Carolina is generally the third state to vote in presidential primaries.\n\nJuly 16-17 — Beshear visits South Carolina for two-day tour\n\nGov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) visited South Carolina for a two-day tour from July 16 to 17.\n\nThe governor started his travels in Greenville at the state’s annual American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations convention. He also made stops in Columbia, Charleston, and Georgetown County to meet with Democratic Party leaders and labor representatives.\n\nInvited to South Carolina by the AFL-CIO union federation and the Georgetown County Democratic Party, Beshear expressed a desire to “get things done” in politics.\n\n“I’m traveling more because I’m trying to be a common sense, common ground, get-things-done type of voice,” Beshear said. “My focus is on this year.”\n\nBeshear is speculated to run for president in 2028 after saying he may “take a look” at launching a bid.\n\n“I would have never considered this a couple years ago, but I will not leave a broken country to my kids or to anyone else’s,” Beshear told NBC News on July 13. “And so if I’m somebody that, at that point, that I believe that I can heal the country, then I’ll take a look at it.”\n\nJuly 9-12 – Moore visits Idaho for ‘billionaire summer camp’\n\nGov. Wes Moore (D-MD) traveled to an Idaho conference known as “billionaire summer camp.” The Sun Valley Conference, organized by Allen & Company, brings together figures from media, technology, and politics for one week every year. It ran from July 9 through 12.\n\n“This week, Governor Moore will travel to Idaho for both personal and political travel. He will participate in events at the Sun Valley Conference as well as vacationing with his family,” Moore’s press secretary, Carter Elliott IV, announced on July 9. “The governor’s lodging and travel expenses will not be covered by the state.”\n\nMoore last attended the conference in 2023 to raise money for the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nThe conference brings together other high-profile politicians, including Youngkin and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nJuly 8-9 — Newsom visits South Carolina to tour rural counties\n\nAmong the leading Democratic contenders for a 2028 run, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) met with voters and local officials in a strategic two-day trip this week to eight rural South Carolina counties: Marion, Chesterfield, Marlboro, Laurens, Pickens, Oconee, Kershaw, and Florence.\n\nNewsom is hoping to capitalize on the economic hardship and damage from natural disasters these counties have endured and blame their predicament on state Republicans.\n\n“Governor Newsom leads the largest economy in America and the fourth largest in the world, and he’s coming to meet folks in towns that have been hollowed out by decades of Republican control,” South Carolina Democratic Party Chairwoman Christale Spain said in a statement. “This is about building partnerships, uplifting communities, and showing rural voters they aren’t forgotten.”\n\nThe two-day trip, dubbed by state Democrats “On the Road With Governor Newsom,” takes place Tuesday and Wednesday. Six of the eight counties that Newsom plans on visiting supported Trump in 2024, including two counties where he won 75% of the vote.\n\nThe final stop for Newsom’s tour was St. Paul First Baptist, a black church in Laurens. The California governor was met with applause inside the sanctuary Wednesday afternoon, per video footage. There were protesters outside.\n\nNewsom spoke about the need for Democratic voters to turn out for the 2026 midterm elections, telling his religious audience there is hope for them yet.\n\n“St. Paul said, ‘Rejoice in hope.’ And I say that because I’m hopeful, because you’re all here,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina is expected to be a key early primary state for Democrats, as it was for former President Joe Biden in early 2024.\n\nMay 30-31 — Moore visits South Carolina for the Democrats’ Blue Palmetto Dinner\n\nLike Newsom, Moore visited South Carolina for two days in late May to headline the South Carolina Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Dinner in the state capital, Columbia.\n\nDuring the event, he said Democrats must learn to adapt and change under the second Trump administration if they hope to return to power.\n\nMoore also attended Rep. Jim Clyburn’s (D-SC) “World Famous Fish Fry” dinner in Columbia. It is considered to be a must-attend political event for Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nGov. Tim Walz (D-MN), who may have presidential ambitions following his 2024 election loss as former Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, also attended both events.\n\nMoore has insisted he is not running for president in 2028, although his speaking engagements suggest otherwise. In late June, he spoke at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s 70th Annual Fight for Freedom Fund dinner in Detroit, the largest city in a swing state that Democrats will need to flip following Trump’s victory in Michigan.\n\nMay 13 — Buttigieg visits Iowa for town hall\n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg held a town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on May 13 to slam Trump’s handling of veterans’ issues.\n\nThe event, hosted by the Democratic-aligned VoteVets Action Fund, marked the former Cabinet secretary’s first public appearance since leaving the Biden administration — and his first attempt to rebrand himself.\n\nAfter headlining the town hall, Buttigieg distanced himself from Biden, who he says “maybe” should have sat out a 2024 run.\n\nIn response to a question about whether Democrats would have performed better last year if Biden hadn’t initially run for reelection against Trump, he answered, “Right now, with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that that’s the case.”\n\nButtigieg also recently took advantage of podcast appearances, most notably speaking with comedian Andrew Schulz, whose show caters to a young male audience. Trump’s numerous podcast appearances last year are believed to have helped him win the 2024 election.\n\nButtigieg said he is weighing a 2028 campaign. He ran in 2020, narrowly winning the most delegates in Iowa’s Democratic caucuses.\n\nApril 27 — Pritzker visits New Hampshire for Democratic fundraiser\n\nGov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) attended a Democratic fundraiser in New Hampshire, where he delivered the event’s keynote address on April 27.\n\nHe not only criticized Republicans’ “authoritarian tactics” but also “do-nothing” Democrats for failing to stand up to the Trump administration.\n\nNEWSOM TOURS TRUMP-FRIENDLY RURAL SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTIES AMID 2028 BUZZ\n\nThe speech fueled speculation about Pritzker running in 2028, but those rumors were dashed after he announced his run for a third term as the governor of Illinois in the 2026 election. The outcome of the gubernatorial election will likely play a role in whether he reconsiders a 2028 bid.\n\nNew Hampshire has traditionally held the first presidential primary every election cycle for over a century.","summary":"Several possible 2028 presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle are visiting early primary states, signaling their eventual intent to run for the White House.

If you have not already subscribed for free, please consider doing so here. \n\nThis is a tale of two weddings. \n\nThe first … \n\nAlex Soros, George Soros’ nepo baby son, recently got married to Huma Abedin at a ritzy wedding in the Hamptons. There were private jets. There were elite liberals (the Clintons, Kamala, Schumer, Pelosi, to name a few). There was magic in the air. \n\nThe New York Times described the event as a “rare concentration of wealth and power,” and referred to the dashing couple as “liberal royalty” in the write-up’s headline. \n\n Alex Soros (age 39) and Huma Abedin (age 48) kiss after getting married in the Hamptons.

Gay or not gay?pic.twitter.com/eW6FfJume1 — Wall Street Mav (@WallStreetMav) June 17, 2025\n\nIt seemed like a storybook wedding, the ceremony liberal girls dream of on Pinterest, and if you’re gay, the ceremony you dream of as a gay man. \n\nBut it’s also just fake. An arranged marriage of “liberal royalty,” celebrated by a gaggle of politicians as shallow and vain as Kamala Harris. So much flash and glamor on the surface, so little love beneath it, as over-produced as an episode of “The Bachelor.” \n\nAnd the second … \n\nIn the Mr. Right newsletter on May 23, I discussed getting engaged to my girlfriend of a year. \n\nHere’s the latest update: our engagement lasted for all of nine days, and no, we did not break it off. We got married on what is now the happiest day of my life. \n\nLike the proposal, the wedding ceremony was spontaneous. Simple. No frills. Right on the beach house porch. Just our parents, two neighborhood friends, and a Methodist pastor who’s practically a stand-up comedian. The birds were chirping. God was overhead. Its simplicity was beautiful. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nSome people had questions – and can I really blame them? A week-long engagement is almost heresy, an act of war against the marriage industrial complex. People think you have a problem; that there was a scandal. \n\n“Why?” “What’s the rush?” “Is she … pregnant?”\n\nThe answer is simple: we could not wait and cared far more about being married than planning an extraordinary shindig. We didn’t want the hassle. We didn’t want the stress. We just wanted to turn the page to the next chapter. \n\nMany young people, on the other hand, get sucked into the marriage industrial complex. Their weddings must be planned down to the most minute details. If something goes wrong, however trivial, panic ensues. They will even go into debt just to have a wedding that somewhat resembles a ceremony that would be featured in Page Six or Vanity Fair. \n\nIf you want that, all power to you. But I would take our wedding ceremony over any star-studded Hamptons bash – always, every single time. I wouldn’t change anything about it. It was perfect because I was marrying her.","summary":"This is a tale of two weddings...","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/21/mr-right-weddings-alex-soros-huma-abedin/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2216159546-scaled-e1753119096627.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 17:33:29","author":"Mr. Right","authors":["Mr. Right"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.13},{"id":343837630,"title":"Kamala Harris Ranks 6th in 2028 Betting Odds as 3 Rivals Take Early Lead","text":"Polymarket kicked off its betting odds for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary last week, and former Vice President Kamala Harris is trailing five other Democratic candidates as of Monday.Newsweek reached out to Harris' team for comment via her press contact form.Why It MattersIn just a matter of days, more than $600,000 has been bet on Democratic candidates' chances of winning in the 2028 primary. Although the election is still years away, candidates are making moves like traveling to early-voting South Carolina to build support among primary voters or fundraising for potential campaigns.The Democratic Party could be holding the most open primary in years, particularly depending on whether Harris decides to run for president again or seek the governorship in her home state of California, as no other candidate has a clear, consistent lead in polling.What to KnowPolymarket betting odds give California Governor Gavin Newsom the best chance of becoming the party's nominee at 21 percent. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a favorite among progressives, follows at 17 percent.Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose decision not to run for statewide office in Michigan fueled speculation he will run for the White House, has a 13 percent chance of winning the nomination, according to Polymarket.Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has a 6 percent chance, while Maryland Governor Wes Moore and Harris both have a 5 percent chance. As of early Monday afternoon, it cost slightly more to bet on Moore than on Harris.Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear each had a 4 percent chance of becoming the party's nominee in the early betting odds.Although Harris trails Polymarket odds, she still has a polling lead over other candidates in most surveys. However, she has not confirmed she plans to run and is also speculated to be considering a gubernatorial run—it's unclear whether or not her odds would increase if she chooses against that run. A decision is expected to come toward the end of the summer.The latest McLaughlin poll showed Harris with a lead. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they planned to support her, compared to nine percent for Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez and eight percent for Buttigieg. However, that still marked her lowest vote share in a McLaughlin poll. In June, for instance, the pollster found that 30 percent of respondents would support her.The McLaughlin poll surveyed 1,000 general election voters from July 9 to July 14, 2025.On the other hand, a new AtlasIntel poll found that 27 percent of Democrats leaned toward Buttigieg, 19 percent toward Ocasio-Cortez, 16 percent toward Newsom and 15 percent toward Harris.That poll surveyed 1,935 respondents from July 13 to July 18, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.Polymarket also found that Democrats have a 55 percent chance of winning the presidency in 2028 and that Vice President JD Vance has an early lead in the Republican primary. Polymarket correctly predicted Trump as the victor in last November's presidential race.What People Are SayingKamala Harris, speaking about her plans earlier this year while visiting Los Angeles sites impacted by wildfires: \"My plans are to be in touch with my community, to be in touch with the leaders and figure out what I can do to support them...I am here and would be here regardless of the office I hold, because it is the right thing to do, which is to show up in your community and thank the folks who are on the ground.\"Democratic influencer Harry Sisson wrote to X: \"Polymarket just launched their 2028 election and nominee markets and Gavin Newsom is ahead. He would be a terrific nominee and an amazing president. MAGA wouldn't have a chance after Trump's disastrous presidency.\"What Happens NextThe first votes of the primary will not be cast until early 2028, and most candidates are unlikely to announce whether they are running until after the 2026 midterm elections.","summary":"Polymarket launched their 2028 betting odds last week—Here's who has an early lead among traders.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-ranks-sixth-early-2028-betting-odds-2101867","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2687300/vp-kamala-harris-polymarket-odds.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3b85234b47446487d9fe792713eb8e36","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 17:31:47","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.137},{"id":343837702,"title":"Top GOP campaign committees dominate Dems in 2025 fundraising","text":"WASHINGTON — Top Republican campaign committees have mostly dominated their Democratic counterparts in fundraising so far in 2025, according to new Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nThe Republican National Committee — led by Chairman Michael Whatley and finance Chair Vice President JD Vance — racked up $96,419,883 in contributions and has $80,782,884 cash on hand, an FEC filing Sunday shows.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin and finance Chair Chris Korge meanwhile amassed $69,224,921 and recorded a $15,220,609 war chest.\n\nFor upcoming Senate races, the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s donations tally was $48,625,839, while the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pulled down $40,311,986.31 in contributions.\n\nAmong House campaigns, the National Republican Congressional Committee got $68,955,791 in donations, compared with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s 66,009,100 in total fundraising.\n\nBut the NRSC has just $7,801,380 cash on hand, whereas the DSCC has a $13,509,018 war chest. \n\nStill, the GOP committee recorded being exactly $2 million in debt, while the top Senate Democratic campaign arm was $5,250,000 in debt.\n\nThe DCCC meanwhile slightly surged ahead of the NRCC with its total cash on hand: $39,717,727 to $37,575,291, respectively.\n\nThe fundraising totals come as Democrats are still 2.5 percentage points ahead of Republicans on a generic 2026 ballot of congressional races, according to the RealClearPolitics polling aggregator.\n\nThe DNC has been plagued by internal strife since former Vice President Kamala Harris’s disastrous 2024 presidential defeat. The MAGA coalition has likewise been strained by tech billionaire Elon Musk’s explosive split from President Trump.\n\nMusk went ballistic on Trump and congressional Republicans over their tax-and-spending package signed into law July 4, which the Tesla and SpaceX owner called a “disgusting abomination,” even going so far as to float the creation of a new political party, the “America Party.”\n\nAs for the Dems, while also struggling with leadership challenges, their fundraising drought led some party bosses to consider taking out a loan. Martin has said he remains optimistic that they will not have to fall back on that lifeline.\n\nCracks in the blue coalition began to appear with the bitter departure of former DNC Vice Chair David Hogg, who attempted to inject $20 million into primary coups against incumbent moderate Dems.\n\nHogg’s “Leaders We Deserve” group was opposed by Martin, who mounted a pressure campaign on Hogg to force him to bend the knee and sign a neutrality pledge.\n\nThe 25-year-old refused to comply and soon faced a complaint that his election to the post had been a violation of the DNC’s “gender parity” rules. Rather than go through another round of DNC elections, Hogg stepped down from the role due to “fundamental disagreements” with his colleagues.\n\nHogg has not been the only DNC leader to split from the beleaguered institution. A week after his departure, two top union chiefs followed suit.\n\nRandi Weingarten, leader of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lee Saunders, head of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, declined offers to retain at-large memberships with the DNC.\n\n“While I am proud to be a Democrat, I appear to be out of step with the leadership you are forging, and I do not want to be the one who keeps questioning why we are not enlarging our tent and actively trying to engage more and more of our communities,” Weingarten wrote in a letter to Martin.\n\nTo add to the DNC’s predicament, the rise of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has further widened divides in the Democratic coalition.\n\nTop Dem leaders have withheld endorsements of the Democratic Socialist, including prominent figures in blue New York.\n\nEmpire State Democrats Gov. Kathy Hochul, Sen.

Plays — and the Village People Respond (Exclusive)","text":"Donald Trump reposted a fake, AI-generated video to social media over the weekend depicting former President Barack Obama being arrested by federal authorities and put behind bars, all while \"Y.M.C.A.\" plays.\n\n Now, the Village People — the group behind the hit 1978 song — tell PEOPLE they are hoping to have the original upload of the \"offensive\" video \"taken down.\"\n\n On Sunday, July 20, the 79-year-old president shared an AI video to his Truth Social platform that depicted Obama, 63, being taken into custody by FBI officials during a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office. The video was partly soundtracked by Village People's \"Y.M.C.A.\"\n\n The clip, posted without a caption by the president on Sunday evening, begins with several Democrats — including Obama, former President Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Cory Booker — proclaiming that \"no one is above the law.\" That portion of the footage is soundtracked by the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song, before an image of character Pepe the Frog, which over the years has been used as an alt-right symbol, appeared on screen.\n\n The footage then cuts to a doctored clip from Trump's November 2016 visit to the White House with then-President Obama, which depicts FBI agents grabbing Obama out of a chair, placing handcuffs on him and removing him from the Oval Office while Trump smiles and \"Y.M.C.A.\" plays in the background.\n\n Finally, Obama is shown sitting in a jail cell, standing behind bars and wearing an orange jumpsuit in the AI footage.\n\n PEOPLE reached out to Village People on Monday to ask about the viral video.\n\n \"While we don't want Y.M.C.A. to be used for political endorsements of any kind, President Trump merely sharing a video containing our song does not meet the standard for copyright infringement,\" the group acknowledges in a statement.\n\n \"However, we will attempt to find the original person or entity who posted the offensive video featuring President Barack Obama, and have such video taken down as not being endorsed by Village People, nor any of the owners of the copyright,\" they add.\n\n The doctored footage that Trump shared was originally posted by TikTok user \"neo8171,\" an account with less than 8,000 followers that has also been responsible for spreading misinformation about Kamala Harris' identity and sharing an AI image of Biden shaking hands with the devil.\n\n The AI video has a watermark at the bottom that reads \"Phantom Shadow,\" making it unclear whether @neo8171 created the video.\n\n A rep for Obama declined to comment on the AI video.\n\n In addition to the Obama video, Trump also shared AI-generated images on July 20 of fake mugshots for Obama, Susan Rice, James Comey and others wearing prison attire alongside the words “The Shady Bunch.”\n\n The posts about Obama come shortly after Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat who now serves as the director of national intelligence under Trump, claimed she was \"turning over\" evidence of an “Obama Administration Conspiracy to Subvert Trump’s 2016 Victory and Presidency” to the Department of Justice.\n\n Trump's latest posts also arrive amid growing calls for his administration to release more evidence related to late billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 child sex-trafficking case.\n\n U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have backpedaled on unveiling Epstein-related files in recent weeks after a joint memo from the DOJ and FBI stated that an investigation into Epstein's alleged crimes and death in prison was complete.\n\n The memo claimed that Epstein's long-rumored \"client list\" did not exist. The president has since denounced any of his supporters who have fallen for what he's now calling the \"Epstein hoax\" and also snapped at a reporter who asked him for more information on the report.\n\n The latest posts are not the first time Trump has reshared AI-generated images and videos to his social media platform.\n\n The White House's social media channels, since Trump took office in January, have earned a reputation for posting AI photos — including one of Trump holding the lightsaber of a Sith Lord on Star Wars Day and Trump being depicted in papal attire days after Pope Francis' death. In February, Trump himself also notably posted AI video of the Gaza Strip being transformed into a resort-like area, with a song describing a \"Trump Gaza.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Trump later claimed he didn't have anything to do with the AI-generated image of himself as the pope, which was posted to his official @potus social media accounts.\n\n \"I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was AI,\" he said. \"But I know nothing about it. I just saw it last evening.\"\n\n \"The Catholics loved it,\" he added. \"My wife thought it was cute.

(RELATED: ‘I Learned How To Make My Own’: Hunter Biden Details Depths Of Cocaine Addiction)\n\n“I know exactly what happened in that debate. He flew around the world, basically at the mileage that he could have flown around the world three times,” Hunter said. “He’s 81 years old. He’s tired as shit. They give him Ambien to be able to sleep. He gets up on the stage, and he looks like he’s a deer in the headlights.”\n\nAmbien is a prescribed sedative-hypnotic drug used as a short-term treatment for insomnia. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Ambien usage may result in “abnormal thinking and behavioral changes,” which can present itself as “aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character.”\n\nThough these symptoms are not common, the FDA says that sedative-hypnotic drugs like Ambien are a “concern” in the treatment of the elderly, as it may impair “motor and/or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity.”\n\nIt was rumored but unverified that Joe was taking drugs, leading Trump to call for Joe to take a drug test before their big debate.\n\nJoe spent nearly a week between traveling and the debate in preparation at Camp David.\n\nA 2018 article from Politico reported that Ronny Jackson, the White House physician of the Obama-Biden administration, regularly handed out Ambien to West Wing officials, leading him to be labeled as a “candy man.”\n\nInitially, Hunter was looking forward to the debates. He told Callaghan that his father had just come out of beating Trump in the last election, had major success passing bipartisan bills and had just given a vibrant State of the Union address.\n\n“I thought that we had cleared all the hurdles that they had set up for us,” Hunter said.\n\nHowever, Joe’s debate performance “scared the shit out of a lot of people because they were already concerned about his age,” Hunter said.\n\n“My dad grew old in front of everybody’s eyes,” Hunter added.\n\nHunter said that this scene witnessed by the nation posed an important question to society on how to handle the aging of a person and “recognize that they may have lost a physical step, but that does not mean they don’t have the mental capacity to continue to do their job, and whether there still should be to be valued.”\n\nHunter added that George Clooney and members of the Democratic Party led the movement to replace Joe with Former Vice President Kamala Harris following the debate fiasco and the reports that the then-president was struck with COVID-19.","summary":"'My dad grew old in front of everybody's eyes,'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/21/hunter-biden-joe-ambien-president-debate-channel-5-interview-clooney/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2187280340-e1753114146656.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 16:32:11","author":"Derek Vanbuskirk","authors":["Derek Vanbuskirk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":343822144,"title":"John Oliver reacts to ‘Late Show with Stephen Colbert’ being canceled — and why he’s ‘partly excited’","text":"John Oliver is mourning the end of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”\n\nThe “Last Week Tonight” host, 48, spoke about CBS’ decision to cancel Colbert’s late-night show, calling it “terrible news for the world of comedy.”\n\n“Obviously, I love Stephen, I love his staff, I love that show. It’s incredibly sad,” Oliver told the Associated Press on Sunday.\n\n“I’m partly excited to see what they’re gonna do for the next 10 months,” the comedian added. “It’s terrible, terrible news for the world of comedy.”\n\nOliver continued: “Late-night shows mean a lot to me, not just because I work in them, because even growing up in England, I would watch Letterman’s show, which of course was Stephen’s show, and think about what a glamorous world that was. So to have got to have been on Letterman’s show and Stephen’s show was always one of the most fun things.”\n\n“So it’s very, very, very sad news,” he reiterated. “I look forward to seeing what [Colbert is] gonna do next because that man will not stop.”\n\nOliver — who has hosted HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” since 2014 — and Colbert, 61, both previously served as correspondents on “The Daily Show.” Oliver has appeared on Colbert’s “Late Show” many times over the years.\n\nOn Thursday, CBS made the shock announcement that “The Late Show” franchise will end in May 2026 after 33 years on the air.\n\nThe network claimed it was “purely a financial decision.”\n\n“We are proud that Stephen called CBS home,” the statement from CBS executives read. “He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.”\n\nColbert, who has hosted the show since 2015, shared the news himself during the taping of Thursday’s show at NYC’s Ed Sullivan Theatre.\n\n“I’m not being replaced, this is all just going away,” he told the audience.\n\nColbert also called CBS execs “great partners” and said he was “extraordinarily, deeply grateful to the 200 people who work here.”\n\nThe Post learned from sources that CBS shafted “The Late Show” because of financial losses, including a lack of advertisers — and not because of Colbert’s politics.\n\nDays before the cancellation news, Colbert took a dig at Tiffany Network, which is owned by CBS’ parent company Paramount, over its $16 million settlement with Donald Trump over a controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris ahead of the expected Skydance Media-Paramount merger.\n\nSkydance CEO David Ellison is the son of Trump’s pal, tech billionaire Larry Ellison.\n\n“I am offended, and I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company,” Colbert said in his monologue last Monday night. “But just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.”\n\nUltimately, Paramount’s co-CEO George Cheeks pulled the plug on the talk show. \n\n“Colbert gets no advertising and late night is a tough spot,” said a person with direct knowledge of CBS’s decision to The Post. “Colbert might be No. 1, but who watches late night TV anymore?”\n\nTrump celebrated the show’s end via Truth Social on Friday. \n\n“I absolutely love that Colbert got fired,” the president, 79, wrote. “His talent was even less than his ratings.

That may be a problem (World)","text":"It’s been six months since Joe Biden left the Oval Office. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, can’t stop talking about him.\n\nThe House has launched investigations asserting that Biden’s closest advisers covered up a physical and mental decline during the 82-year-old Democrat’s presidency. The Senate has started a series of hearings focused on his mental fitness. And Trump’s White House has opened its own investigation into the Biden administration’s use of the presidential autopen, which Trump has called “one of the biggest scandals in the history of our country.”\n\nIt all fits with Trump’s practice of blaming his predecessors for the nation's ills. Just last week, he tried to deflect criticism of his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case by casting blame on others, including Biden.\n\nTurning the spotlight back on the former president carries risks for both parties heading into the 2026 midterms. The more Republicans or Democrats talk about Biden, the less they can make arguments about the impact of Trump’s presidency — positive or negative — especially his sweeping new tax cut and spending law that is reshaping the federal government.\n\n“Most Americans consider Joe Biden to be yesterday’s news,” Republican pollster Whit Ayres said.\n\nRepublicans want Biden’s autopen to become a flashpoint\n\nSeeking to avenge his 2020 loss to Biden, Trump mocked his rival’s age and fitness incessantly in 2024, even after Biden dropped his reelection bid and yielded to then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe and other Republicans seemed poised to spend the summer touting their new tax, spending and policy package. But Trump, now 79 and facing his own health challenges, has refused to let up on Biden, and his allies in the party have followed suit.\n\nRepublican Rep. Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin called the Biden White House's use of the autopen “a massive scandal,” while Republican Rep. Nick Lalota insists his New York constituents “are curious as to what was happening during President Biden’s days.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt recently confirmed the administration would pursue an investigation of the Biden administration’s use of the presidential autopen. Trump and other Republicans have questioned whether Biden was actually running the country and suggested aides abused a tool that has long been a routine part of signing presidentially approved actions.\n\n“We deserve to get to the bottom of it,” Leavitt said.\n\nBiden has responded to the criticism by issuing a statement saying he was, in fact, making the decisions during his presidency and that any suggestion otherwise \"is ridiculous and false.\"\n\nCongressional committees investigate\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the House Oversight Committee has convened hearings on use of the autopen and Biden’s fitness for office. Van Orden cited the Constitution’s Article II vesting authority solely with the president.\n\n“It doesn’t say chief of staff. It doesn’t say an autopen,” he said.\n\nThe House panel subpoenaed Biden’s physician and a top aide to former first lady Jill Biden. Both invoked Fifth Amendment protections that prevent people from being forced to testify against themselves in government proceedings.\n\n“There was no there there,” said Democratic Rep. Wesley Bell of Missouri, a member of the committee who called the effort “an extraordinary waste of time.”\n\nThe committee's chairman, Rep. James Comer, wants to hear from former White House chiefs of staff Ron Klain and Jeff Zients; former senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn; and other former top aides Bruce Reed, Steve Ricchetti and Annie Tomasini, among others. Republicans confirmed multiple dates for the sessions through late September, ensuring it will remain in the headlines.\n\nInvestigations could crowd out GOP efforts to define Trump positively\n\nThat GOP schedule comes as both parties work feverishly to define Trump’s start to his second term.\n\nHis so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” is a mix of tax cuts, border security measures and cuts to safety net programs such as Medicaid, a joint state-federal insurance program for lower-income Americans. Polls suggest some individual measures are popular while others are not and that the GOP faces headwinds on tilting the public in favor of the overall effort.\n\nA recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about two-thirds of U.S. adults view the bill as a win for the wealthy and another found that only about one-quarter of U.S. adults felt Trump’s policies have helped them. In the policy survey, he failed to earn majority support on any of the major issues, including the economy, immigration, government spending and health care. Immigration, especially, had been considered a major strength for Trump politically.\n\nIt is “rather tone deaf,” said Bell, for Republicans to go after Biden given those circumstances.\n\n“Americans want us to deal with the issues that are plaguing our country now … the high cost of living, cost of food, the cost of housing, health care,” Bell said, as he blasted the GOP for a deliberate “distraction\" from what challenges most U.S. households.\n\nThe effort also comes with Trump battling his own supporters over the Justice Department's decision not to publicly release additional records related to the Epstein case.\n\n“The Epstein saga is more important to his base than whatever happened to Joe Biden,” said Ayres, the GOP pollster.\n\nEven Lalota, the New York congressman, acknowledged a balancing act with the Biden inquiries.\n\n“My constituents care most about affordability and public safety,” Lalota said. “But this is an important issue nonetheless.”\n\nDemocrats don’t want to talk about Biden\n\nWith Republicans protecting a narrow House majority, every hotly contested issue could be seen as determinative in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThat puts added pressure on Republicans to retain Trump’s expanded 2024 coalition, when he increased support among Black and Hispanic voters, especially men, over the usual Republican levels. But that’s considerably harder without Trump himself on the ballot. That could explain Republican efforts to keep going after Biden given how unpopular he is with Trump’s core supporters.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, point to their success in the 2018 midterms during Trump’s first presidency, when they reclaimed the House majority on the strength of moderate voters, including disaffected Republicans. They seem confident that Republicans’ aggressiveness about Biden does not appeal to that swath of the electorate.\n\nBut even as they praise Biden’s accomplishments as president, Democrats quietly admit they don’t want to spend time talking about a figure who left office with lagging approval ratings and forced his party into a late, difficult change at the top of the ticket.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia said Biden was productive while acknowledging he \"was not at the top of his game because of his age.” He said Democrats want to look forward, most immediately on trying to win control of the House and make gains in the Senate.\n\n“And then who’s our standard bearer in 2028?” Beyer said. \"And how do we minimize the Trump damage with what we have right now?”","summary":"It's been six months since Joe Biden left the Oval Office.
