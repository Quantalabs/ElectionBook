Trump had worked closely with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to find a facility that could house the deportees.\n\n“We’re getting them out, and the president is helping us with that—President Bukele,” Trump told Fox News in April. “So, I was very impressed with him, very, very impressed.”\n\n“People go, and they feel very secure and safe. He’s also built one but also other prisons. Very big ones, and we’re using his system because we’re getting rid of our criminals from out of the United States that were allowed to come in by Biden,” he added.\n\nA 60 Minutes investigation found, however, that 75 percent of the 238 men deported had no criminal record. Twenty-two percent did have a criminal history—mostly for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting, and trespassing—and 3 percent had unclear records.\n\nAmong the deported men was Maryland dad Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case stirred uproar after the Trump administration admitted that it wrongfully deported him as a result of an “administrative error.” He was returned to the U.S. in June.\n\n60 Minutes pushed back its CECOT episode after Trump told a North Carolina rally Friday that he “loves” the new owners of CBS—his friends in the powerful Ellison family, who own CBS’s parent company, Paramount.\n\n“CBS, I mean, I love the new owners of CBS. Something happened to them, though; 60 Minutes has treated me worse under the new ownership. They just keep hitting me. It’s crazy,” he said.\n\nTrump has also given his seal of approval to Bari Weiss, the MAGA-curious founder of The Free Press who was named editor-in-chief of CBS News in October.\n\n“I think you have a great, new leader, frankly, ’cause the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise is a great—from what I know. I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person,” Trump told 60 Minutes last month. “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership.”\n\nTrump has long had a fractious relationship with 60 Minutes, largely over an October 2024 episode with Kamala Harris that he claims was unfairly edited to make his opponent appear more favorable. Paramount eventually bent the knee by paying Trump $16 million to settle his lawsuit over the interview.\n\nUnder its new leadership, 60 Minutes aired a 28-minute version and released an extended 73-minute cut of Trump’s November sitdown with Norah O’Donnell. A full transcript, however, revealed that the network left out Trump’s testy exchange with O’Donnell over his pardon of a crypto billionaire.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped Trump from whining about his least-favorite Sunday show.","summary":"Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images60 Minutes abruptly pushed back a segment about a notorious El Salvador megaprison that houses deportees kicked out of the U.S. by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe iconic CBS newsmagazine show announced that the episode covering the Terrorism Confinement Center—dubbed CECOT or Terrorism Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo in Spanish—will be aired at a later date instead.\n\n“The broadcast lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated.

Tim Walz continues to take heat for his handling of the debacle.\n\nBy comparison to the $9 billion figure, Somalia’s entire GDP was under $12 billion last year, according to the World Bank.\n\n“The magnitude cannot be overstated,” First Assistant US Attorney Joe Thompson said Thursday of the tentacles of the fraud. “What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It’s staggering, industrial-scale fraud.\n\n“Every day, we look under a rock and find a new $50 million fraud scheme.”\n\nThe scheme saw dozens of people — the vast majority from Minnesota’s Somali community — setting up businesses and non-profits that claimed to provide services such as housing, food or healthcare assistance and then billing the federally funded state programs for the non-existent services.\n\nThe fraud was so enormous that it went beyond the over-billing tactics typically seen in similar fraud cases and instead saw people setting up entire operations — sometimes coming from out of state — to get in on the goldrush of fraud opportunity, Thompson explained.\n\nCharges for six more people allegedly involved in the scheme were announced Thursday, bringing the total number of defendants up to 92.\n\nAmong the latest defendants were two people who engaged in what Thompson called “fraud tourism” by allegedly travelling from Philadelphia to set up a bogus housing aid program after spotting an opportunity to make “easy money” off Minnesota’s programs.\n\nAnthony Waddell Jefferson, 37, and Lester Brown, 53, allegedly visited Minnesota shelters and affordable housing to establish a reputation as local “housing guys” with an aid business, then hired a network of family members and associates to write up fake client notes and submit them to the state for reimbursement.\n\nIn total, they submitted $3.5 million worth of claims with the state’s Housing Stability Services Program and claimed to help around 230 clients, according to prosecutors.\n\nAnother recently charged suspect was Abdinajib Hassan Yussuf, 27, who allegedly set up a youth autism foundation which claimed to provide therapy for children on the spectrum.\n\nIn reality, Yussuf allegedly paid local parents to sign their kids up for the program regardless of their mental conditions and then billed the state for fake services provided.\n\nYussuf’s program obtained about $6 million in reimbursements, prosecutors alleged.\n\nAnother defendant — 28-year-old Asha Farhan Hassan — allegedly participated in another autism scheme that made off with $14 million in bogus reimbursements while also pocketing just under $500,000 for participating in a separate scam preying on Minnesota’s food program Feeding Our Future.\n\n“Roughly two dozen or so Feeding Our Future defendants were getting money from autism clinics,” Thompson said. “That’s how we learned about the autism fraud.”\n\nThe scandal began unraveling around 2022 when Feeding Our Future came under scrutiny, but it was only in recent months that the full scope of the alleged fraud began to come into focus.\n\nMuch of the funds were sent overseas or else were spent on luxury cars and other lavish items.\n\nSo far, 57 people have been convicted.\n\nThe scheme prompted a White House crackdown on immigration in Minnesota, with President Trump calling Somalis “garbage” and Walz “retarded” in November for the scheme that unfolded largely under his watch.\n\nWalz — who is running for re-election in 2026 and was former VP Kamala Harris’ presidential running mate in 2024 — has defended his handling of the scandal.\n\n“We will not tolerate fraud, and we will continue to work with federal partners to ensure fraud is stopped and fraudsters are caught,” he said Thursday.\n\nWith Post wires","summary":"The enormous new estimate is a nearly nine-fold increase from the swiped $1 billion previously suspected, according to federal prosecutors.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/21/us-news/minn-s-social-services-scammers-may-have-stolen-9-billion/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/comp-minnesota-social-services-fraud-117708884.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UUIts32E-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-21 23:32:05","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":388011330,"title":"JD Vance Calls for GOP Unity, Touts Trump Agenda at AmericaFest 2025","text":"Vice President J.D.

Do you promise to take the country back from the people who took his life?” Vance said. “My friends, commit to these things and I promise you victory.”\n\nCharlie Kirk was the co-founder of Turning Point USA, a massive political group based in Arizona. He was credited with boosting turnout for Trump and Vance during the 2024 election and reached millions through his podcast and viral debate clips online. \n\nHe was assassinated at a Turning Point event on the Utah Valley University campus on Sept. 10. \n\nIn the wake of Charlie Kirk’s death — and as the decade-long Trump era nears its end in 2028 — the GOP grappled with what the future will look like during the Turning Point conference. \n\nIn his speech, Vance promoted the accomplishments of the Trump administration and slammed Democrats on issues including Christianity, transgender rights, the economy and free speech. \n\nHe seemed to wink at a 2028 campaign.\n\n“We are gonna kick their ass next November,” Vance said, referring to the 2026 midterm elections. “And every year after that.” \n\nThe final day of AmericaFest was also a preview of a presidential battle to come, with Vance and Minaj throwing punches at possible Democratic contenders California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTurning Point CEO Erika Kirk has pledged Turning Point’s support for Vance if he runs for president in 2028, saying that it was Charlie Kirk’s plan. She welcomed the vice president on stage and they shared a hug while pyrotechnics blazed.\n\nCharlie Kirk was an early supporter of Vance’s 2022 Ohio Senate bid and encouraged Trump to select him as a running mate last summer. Charlie Kirk, who introduced Vance at an Arizona rally last year, said, “I saw something in him that I’ve been looking for in the political landscape.” \n\nPresident Donald Trump, who headlined AmericaFest last year, called in to the conference during a speech by his son, Donald Trump Jr. “Nobody did more for me than Charlie, and there's nobody better than Erika,” Trump said as Donald Trump Jr. held his phone up to the microphone.\n\nMinaj mistakenly calls Vance an ‘assassin’\n\nSurprise guest Minaj took the stage to her hit “Super Bass,” where Erika Kirk interviewed her about supporting the Trump administration and her activism on behalf of persecuted Christians in Nigeria. \n\nMinaj said she wants her legacy to be that people know “it’s OK to change your mind.\" \n\nAt one point, Minaj mistakenly referred to Vance as an “assassin” while sharing her message for young men. \n\n“Dear young men, you have amazing role models like our handsome, dashing president and you have amazing role models like the assassin JD Vance, our vice president. And when I say that —” Minaj paused and covered her mouth. \n\nErika Kirk told her it was OK, while people in the crowd shouted that they understood what Minaj meant. \n\n“There’s nothing new under the sun that I have not heard, so you’re fine,” Erika Kirk said. “If the internet wants to clip it, who cares. I love this woman; she’s an amazing woman.” \n\nThe flub came as Candace Owens, a right-wing podcaster and former Turning Point contributor, has spread outlandish conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk’s murder. Owens has claimed without evidence that top Turning Point leaders were involved in his killing.\n\nVance also sought to tamp down on the conspiracies in his remarks, telling the crowd that he researched them to make sense of Charlie Kirk's death but eventually accepted reality.\n\nUtah man Tyler Robinson, 22, has been charged with Charlie Kirk’s murder and recently made his first in-person court appearance.\n\nWhen Vance addressed Robinson, the crowd booed.\n\n“He is everything the far left wants from our young men. He rejected the conservatism and the spirituality, the values of a small-town family. He moved into a small apartment. He became addicted to porn. He became addicted to hate and he ended up sleeping with somebody who doesn’t know whether they’re a man or woman,” Vance said. \n\nKirk honored at convention \n\nThree months after he was killed, Kirk was memorialized in nearly every area of the AmericaFest conference. \n\nAs attendees descended an escalator to the main hall, they were welcomed by a wall that read “WE ARE ALL CHARLIE KIRK” with a photo of the late Turning Point co-founder. \n\nA timeline of Kirk’s life covered another wall in the convention center, noting milestones like his marriage to Erika Kirk, the birth of their first child and the start of his popular “The Charlie Kirk Show” podcast. The final date on the timeline was his assassination date, with the words “LEGACY CEMENTED” and a photo of Charlie Kirk the day he was killed. \n\nOne of Turning Point’s “PROVE ME WRONG” debate tents used at the Utah Valley University event was on display for photos in the exhibition hall. The microphone Charlie Kirk was using when he was shot was displayed on stage in a case. \n\nPodcasters, livestreamers and TV networks broadcast from booths all around the convention center. Fox News interviewed Utah high schooler Elle Anderson, who says she was the last person to take a selfie with Charlie Kirk before he died. \n\nHunter Kozak, who asked Charlie Kirk the question he was answering when he was shot and killed, sat at a debate table outside the convention center entrance. Kozak is part of the “Un(expletive) America Tour,” a liberal group that aims to counter Turning Point events. \n\nInside, countless people wore white T-shirts emblazoned with the word “FREEDOM,” replicas of the shirt Charlie Kirk wore when he was shot. More iterations of the T-shirt were on sale at booths inside the convention center and from vendors on the streets.\n\nPlus, House Speaker Mike Johnson received a standing ovation during his speech when he said he’d work with Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, to put up a Charlie Kirk statue in the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMixed opinions on Turning Point’s early Vance endorsement \n\nSuzie Neitzke, 57, is “100%” behind Vance for president in 2028. She attended the conference with her husband and teenage daughter from Waukesha, Wisconsin. \n\n“We want him for the next president, and we're on board,” Neitzke said. “We love him as a person. His humor is very close to Trump's. I just think it's great. I think that he is going to do a great job as president. He will make it.” \n\nNeitzke is a longtime Trump supporter. Before Trump entered the presidential race in 2015, Neitzke said she had a Trump sign in her yard that was handmade by her husband. \n\nJudah Westdorp and Ian Westdorp, teenagers from Fort Collins, Colorado, said they would “absolutely” support Vance in three years. \n\n“I love JD Vance, honestly,” Judah Westdorp said. “I like him more than Donald Trump.” \n\nTrump does a great job of connecting with people, he said, but sees Vance as the person who can sustain the conservative movement and continue uniting people.\n\n“Donald Trump was the businessman and, like, the executive we needed to fix the country. And JD Vance is the leader who can drive this country forward after we get the scale tipped back to normal again,” Ian Westdorp said. \n\nSome Vance fans said they’re keeping their options open because the presidential primaries are still three years away.\n\n“I still kind of think it's too early. I would support the vice president, but it just depends on what other people run and who else is running at that time,” said Bo Miner, an 18-year-old from Bentonville, Arkansas. \n\nMatthew Buchanan, 28, echoed that view. He runs a marketing and consulting company in New Jersey.\n\n“I just believe it's way too early. It's only what, 2025, and the election wouldn't be until 2028,” Buchanan said. “There's so many different things that can happen between now and then. But ultimately, JD Vance has done such a great job with everything that he's done and he speaks so incredibly well,” Buchanan said. \n\nSierra Bass and Jessica Bass, a married couple in their 30s from Wisconsin, woke up before 5 a.m. to get in line for Vance’s speech. \n\nThe couple lives in a liberal area and appreciated being around like-minded people at AmericaFest. It felt especially important to them to come after Charlie Kirk was assassinated, they said.\n\nSierra Bass, 38, said she will “absolutely” support Vance for president in 2028.\n\n“I can't even imagine who would run instead,” Sierra Bass said. \n\nStephanie Murray covers national politics and the Trump administration for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

Experts say it’s a template for protecting rights in 2026.\n\nBy Ethan Bakuli for Capital & Main\n\nWhen Ravina Turner, 53, started working for Michigan’s Home Help Program around 2015, she was just grateful to get paid. For years, she’d missed work to care for her daughter, Davina, who has Crohn’s disease and colitis.\n\nAt first, the Home Help Program, run by the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, paid her about $300 a month for her work, allowing her to scale back her hours as a nursing assistant. By last year, she had become a full-time caregiver for Davina, and her wages had risen to $15.88 an hour. That is still well below the $35.59 per hour living wage for a single parent in Dearborn Heights, outside Detroit, according to the MIT Living Wage Calculator.\n\n“This is a job and we deserve benefits,” said Turner, who’s picked up a gig as a personal care assistant at a nearby assisted living facility. “We deserve health insurance as well as life insurance. We deserve vacation … because if I was punching a clock, I would get all those perks.”\n\nTurner thought she just had to endure low wages, no benefits and no paid time off, she said, until a canvasser knocked on her door and talked to her about how much less Michigan home health aides made compared to aides in states such as Washington, where in 2023 starting rates were set at $21 per hour. She suggested Turner join the Michigan Home Care Workers United campaign, an effort from the Service Employees International Union to get union recognition for home care workers paid through Medicaid. Turner decided to join. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)\n\nThis October, Turner was among 32,000 Michigan home care aides who became union members after 73% of voting home care workers voted to join the union. They are currently working towards negotiating a contract with the state. And their victory, say observers, achieved something politicians increasingly need to pull off: building coalitions across political divides by speaking to material concerns.\n\nMichigan Home Care Workers United launched in March 2024, around the time that the canvasser came to Turner’s door. Their efforts were aimed, initially, at getting care workers the right to form a union — which was successful, with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signing a bill granting Home Help workers state employee status for the purposes of collective bargaining last October.\n\nThen they turned to the difficult work of organizing a union vote across the state. Currently, at least 11 other states, most of them Democratic strongholds like California and New York, have laws that recognize home care workers as public employees for the purposes of forming a union. The Michigan home care worker election was the first under President Donald Trump’s second administration. It was also only the second success in a state that went twice for Trump.\n\nKevin Reuning, a political science professor at Miami University of Ohio who tracks nationwide union elections, said the Michigan home care worker win was a “rare” victory given the feat of workers at that scale.\n\n“It is statewide … that poses such an incredible difficulty because you don’t have all your workers in a single location. It just makes the actual organizing hard,” said Reuning, who is also the creator of UnionElections.org.\n\nAs activists began to talk with care workers across the state, demands emerged: higher wages and benefits, access to training, and a registry to connect workers with clients in need of care.\n\n“Hundreds of home care workers have had boots on the ground for a very long time,” said Gabriella Jones-Casey, executive vice president of home care and staff development for SEIU Healthcare Michigan.\n\nHome care workers are predominantly female, older and racially diverse, and they have long experienced stagnant wages, no benefits and limited access to training. At the federal level, workers are embattled; in July, the Trump administration issued a proposal rolling back federal minimum wage and overtime protections for home care workers.\n\nHome care workers are predominantly female, older and racially diverse, and they have long experienced stagnant wages, no benefits and limited access to training. At the federal level, workers are embattled; in July, the Trump administration issued a proposal rolling back federal minimum wage and overtime protections for home care workers.\n\n“This is a serious rollback, and it’s going to exacerbate shortages,” said Catherine Ruckelshaus, legal director at the National Employment Law Project. “It’s pretty much a disaster.” Locally, home care workers are facing cuts to Medicaid, which funds Michigan’s Home Help Program.\n\nThe rapidly growing profession already battles significant issues with retention. Although long-term home health care is expected to grow by 17% over the next decade, rates of turnover were nearly 75% nationally in 2024.\n\nWhen the election results came in, those were the issues on workers’ minds — wherever they were. That included Michigan’s cities and suburbs, where most of the state’s Black and brown workers live and where voters lean Democratic, as well as its rural areas, which are generally white and voters are heavily Republican.\n\nThe organizers’ success came from the unit’s ability to speak to broad concerns about wages, working conditions, and respect, said Jones-Casey.\n\n“We represent workers all across the state from the UP [Upper Peninsula] down,” said Jones-Casey. “The challenges that arise might be different across the urban areas versus the rural versus suburban, but that’s kind of the beauty of this unit. They are representative of the entirety of Michigan.”\n\nWorkers say there is power in finding common ground between disparate places and political landscapes.\n\nErika LaFountain, a home care worker involved with the union, lives in Jackson County, a conservative stronghold about an hour west of Detroit. It is 82% white, and Trump won it by more than a 20-point margin in 2024. It is just the sort of place SEIU needed to win over.\n\nLaFountain said she’d never thought of herself as an activist. When a canvasser came to her door, she said, “I’m like, I don’t think that’s me,” said LaFountain. “I think you’re talking about nurses and, like, people with degrees.”\n\nLaFountain started in home health care after she helped a wheelchair-bound neighbor, Ricky Johnson, get into his home without a ramp. At first, LaFountain cared for Johnson in her free time, unpaid. When his family said they needed more help, LaFountain joined the Home Help Program. As had been true for Turner, the little bit of state money helped LaFountain — but it wasn’t enough to live on.\n\nIt’s been powerful, said LaFountain, to share her story.\n\n“I started just telling Ricky’s struggles,” LaFountain said, as well as “our story and our struggles, and how if there was health insurance, that I wouldn’t have to be on Medicaid.”\n\nTurner, who lives in deep-blue Wayne County, which Kamala Harris won by almost 30 points in 2024, agreed completely. “I learned that there’s power in numbers … strength in numbers,” she said.\n\nOverall, Turner said, she felt lucky. “I take care of my daughter, and she does have good moments when I’m able to leave for a couple of hours.” But she knows not every caregiver has that freedom. “The ones that can’t leave … those are the ones that I was really fighting for,” she said.","summary":"In October, Michigan home care workers formed a statewide union of 32,000.

Ilhan Omar’s (D-MN) pick for mayor of Minneapolis, jokingly mixing up the Minnesota city with Somalia capital Mogadishu. He also needled Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) and her bid for a Texas Senate seat, saying her “streetgirl persona is about as real as her nails.” \n\nThe vice president said these Democratic lawmakers are all “cogs in a machine” that aim to weaken voters. He contended that while he and Trump are working to “break that machine,” the Democratic Party is still “very powerful.”\n\nVance also addressed the division and in-fighting within the Republican Party, some of which took place at AmericaFest. He said the late Charlie Kirk knew disagreements should be hashed out between people, and they can still “love each other” in spite of their differences.\n\n“But winning demands teamwork, and I am honored to be on Turning Point’s team, I’m honored to be on your team, and I will stay that way,” Vance said, drawing applause from the audience.\n\nThe Washington Examiner’s Ross O’Keefe said Sunday he’s heard one strategy Erika Kirk and Turning Point will pursue in 2028 is winning over young women voters. He added that if Vance does run for president with the help of this voting bloc, it would make him “a very tough opponent.”\n\nLike Vance, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) is speculated to be a 2028 presidential candidate, but has previously said he won’t consider this possibility until after the 2026 elections. A poll from last month put the California governor 3 points above Vance in a possible matchup.\n\nHarris has hinted that she could pursue another White House run, previously declining to run for California governor next year.

Still, two-thirds said they didn’t have a specific person they’d like to see run for president, while one-third named specific candidates. \n\nOn the Republican side, 11 percent said they wanted Vice President JD Vance to launch a bid in 2028, while 2 percent named Secretary of State Marco Rubio and 1 percent named Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nAnother 1 percent also picked Donald Trump — who, despite his flirtations with running for a third term, is barred from running again due to the 22nd Amendment.\n\nAcross the aisle, California Governor Gavin Newsom led the pack with 6 percent mentioning him, followed by former Vice President Kamala Harris with 3 percent, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with 2 percent and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg with 1 percent. \n\nLike Trump, 1 percent also mentioned former President Barack Obama, who equally can’t run again. That same percentage also named his wife, former First Lady Michelle Obama, as well as Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nOverall, 16 percent named a Republican or conservative candidate while 14 percent named a Democratic or liberal candidate. Only one respondent named both a Republican and a Democrat for a potential 2028 run: “Mitt Romney or Mark Kelly,” CNN reported.\n\nThe group that didn’t have a specific candidate in mind was asked what they believed the “most important traits, attributes or views” the next president should have. The responses were open-ended.\n\nHonesty was the top response, with 12 percent saying they hoped the future president is truthful and doesn’t lie. Meanwhile, 9 percent of respondents said they wished the next president were compassionate, empathetic and cared about people.\n\nThe poll also tracked the top issues mentioned by this group. Affordability and cost-of-living ranked at the top of the list, with 6 percent of respondents mentioning it. Then followed “America first” or an interest in the U.S. over foreign affairs, which 3 percent of people said. The topics of healthcare, foreign policy, and federal spending each earned 2 percent of the mentions.\n\nEven before reclaiming the White House, Trump has teased running for president again — even offering “Trump 2028 hats” — and some close to him have insisted he could circumvent the 22nd Amendment.\n\nIn October, Trump refused to rule out another presidential bid. “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever,” he told reporters on Air Force One at the time. The president’s remarks came one week after his ally Steve Bannon claimed there was a “plan” for Trump to be re-elected in 2028.\n\nTwo days after his comments on Air Force One, the president walked back on his remarks, admitting the Constitution is “pretty clear” that he wasn’t allowed to run again.\n\nStill, Bannon doubled down. He said on his War Room show in November that he believed “you can drive a Mack truck through the 22nd Amendment,” citing a \"top constitutional lawyer.\"\n\nThis month, Trump was still muddying the waters. At the White House Christmas party, he conceded has just a \"little more than three years\" left of his term — just days after he posted an AI-generated image of himself on Truth Social holding up a sign that read: “Trump 2028, yes!”\n\nIn an explosive Vanity Fair interview this month, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles explicitly said Trump wouldn’t run again, noting that he understands the 22nd Amendment prohibits him from running for a third term.\n\n“But he sure is having fun with it,” Wiles said, adding that he knows it’s “driving people crazy.”","summary":"Both Donald Trump and Barack Obama were named on Americans’ 2028 candidate wishlists, yet the Constitution prohibits either from running for a third term","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-2028-election-candidates-poll-b2888646.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/21/21/59/President-Donald-Trump-may-have-three-years-left-in-office-but-half-of-Americans-are-already-thinkin.png?crop=1276,850.7,x0,y1.8&trim=1,0,52,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VrcuQaoS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-21 21:20:17","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":388001654,"title":"Is Nicki Minaj A Trump Supporter?

At AmericaFest, she told the crowd, “This administration is full of people with heart and soul. Both the President and Vice President are strong, powerful, smart men. Make us proud to be American,” framing Trump and Vance as leaders she’s proud to stand behind. That rhetoric, paired with her meme‑swapping with Vance and reposting of White House TikToks, firmly places her in the pro‑Trump camp.,She hasn’t rebranded herself as a “Republican” in a formal sense, but her public posture is now unmistakably MAGA‑aligned. Recent reporting notes she’s reposted Trump‑friendly content about “Christian persecution” in Nigeria, reshared clips bragging about deportations and restrictions on trans athletes, and thanked Trump’s team “for this seriously,” signalling agreement with core culture‑war planks. That stands in sharp contrast to earlier years when she called Melania Trump “brainless,” fretted over family separations at the border and celebrated LGBTQ+ fans in her music., ,How Her Politics Flipped,,In 2020, Minaj spoke out against child–parent separations and said she could not support Trump, drawing on her own experience as an immigrant kid from Trinidad coming to the US. Over the past year, though, she began amplifying Trump’s and JD Vance’s messaging—sharing edits of Trump dancing set to her songs, endorsing his Nigeria comments, and engaging directly with Vance online.

Conservative influencers frame her as proof that a Black, Caribbean‑born star can “come home” to MAGA—even as immigration crackdowns intensify.,Why This Is Dividing The Barbz,,Minaj’s fanbase is heavily queer, young and online—demographics that tend to oppose Trump’s policies on immigration, LGBTQ+ rights and policing. Her increasingly anti‑trans comments and embrace of the administration’s line on trans kids in sports have particularly rattled long‑time supporters. Some Barbz accuse her of “reposting transphobic white propaganda” and forgetting her own status as an immigrant woman of color; others defend her as “courageous” and say she’s always spoken her mind, politics included.,Also Read: Charlamagne Tha God Net Worth: What Radio Star’s $200 Million Deal With iHeartMedia Means For His Earnings,Music‑industry peers have largely gone the other way: Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, Lizzo and others campaigned for Kamala Harris in 2024, continuing hip‑hop’s decades‑long tilt toward Democrats. Minaj now sits in the much smaller club of Trump‑friendly rappers—alongside figures like Ye, Lil Wayne and Kodak Black—whose pro‑MAGA turns are as much a spectacle as a policy statement.,Who Is Nicki Minaj In This Moment?,,Nicki Minaj is a Trinidad‑born, Queens‑raised rap superstar often dubbed the “Queen of Rap,” with 80+ songs over 100 million Spotify streams and a decade‑plus run of hit records, pop‑culture impact and crossover brand deals.

They have done it anyway because they believed they couldn't live with themselves if they didn't question this authority.' \n\n'They embody the type of moral courage that my father once called the \"one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change\",' she added in a separate press release. \n\nHarry and Meghan are among a select group of high-profile figures who have won the Ripple of Hope award, with past recipients including former US presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Joe Biden, as well as ex-vice president Kamala Harris. \n\nThe honour is usually bestowed upon those who have shown 'an unwavering commitment to social change and worked to protect and advance equity, justice, and human rights'. \n\nDays before the release of their incendiary Netflix docuseries, Harry and Meghan attended the glitzy gala dinner in New York City where they vowed their war against 'oppression' had just begun.\n\nThe following month, Prince Harry denied ever calling the royal family racist in an astonishing U-turn that drew fierce criticism. \n\nHarry was promoting his memoir Spare in an interview with ITV's Tom Bradby when the broadcaster brought up the Sussexes' interview with Oprah Winfrey. \n\nJoin the debate\n\nWas the distinction between racism and unconscious bias clear enough?\nGo to comments\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex with their baby son, Prince Archie, during a photocall at St George's Hall at Windsor Castle after his birth \n\nHarry and Meghan are among a select group of high-profile figures who have won the Ripple of Hope award, with past recipients including former US presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Joe Biden, as well as ex-vice president Kamala Harris\n\n'You accused members of your family of racism,' Mr Badby, a friend of Harry's began.\n\nBut Harry snapped back: 'No I didn't. The British press said that. Did Meghan ever mention that they're racist?'\n\nDid this award feel justified?\n\nThe duke then insisted the comments made about his son Archie's skin colour were 'unconscious bias'. Mr Bradby appeared taken aback by the answer - while experts said that Harry clearly didn't understand the term he was now using. \n\nAt the time, the BBC's former royal correspondent Jennie Bond said it was 'unforgivable' that Harry 'hung his family out to dry on an accusation of racism' that the duke has since backtracked.\n\nRoyal biographer Robert Jobson said Harry and Meghan should 'give the award back' while ITV News's royal editor Chris Ship pointed out that while the couple did not explicitly use the word 'racist' during their Oprah interview, neither did they 'correct the narrative'. \n\nMr Shop explained: 'Harry is right to say [they] didn't use the word \"racist\" at any point... [but] Harry didn't correct the narrative when this whole racism row then started, and not correcting the narrative is something he accused the Royal Family of not doing, when he criticised Jeremy Clarkson and other things as well.' \n\nDuring the ITV interiew, which aired on January 8, 2023, Mr Bradby asked Harry whether he would describe the comments about Archie's skin colour as 'essentially racist'. \n\nThe duke replied: 'I wouldn't, not having lived within that family.' But he added: 'The difference between racism and unconscious bias… the two things are different.\n\nThe following month, Prince Harry denied ever calling the royal family racist in an astonishing U-turn during his interview with ITV's Tom Bradby while promoting Spare \n\n'But once it's been acknowledged, or pointed out to you as an individual, or as an institution, that you have unconscious bias, you therefore have an opportunity to learn and grow from that so that you are part of the solution rather than part of the problem.'\n\nAnd he accused Buckingham Palace of failing to follow up on promises it made in the wake of the Oprah controversy, including appointing a 'diversity tsar'.\n\nHe also spoke about the royal family's 'unconscious bias' during an appearance on Good Morning America. \n\nAsked if he thinks there is a place for the British monarchy in the 21st century, he said: 'I genuinely believe that there is. Not the way that it is now.'\n\nAsked if they need to modernise and if so in what way, Harry said: 'I think the same process that I went through with regarding my own unconscious bias would be hugely beneficial to them.\n\n'Not racism, but unconscious bias, if not confronted, if not learned and grown from, that can then move into racism.\n\n'But there was an enormous missed opportunity with my wife.'\n\nNetflixTom BradbyITVMeghan Markle\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry received an award for fighting 'structural racism' within the Royal Family... only for him to deny calling them 'racist' after all\n\nAdd comment","summary":"When the Duchess of Sussex, now 44, told Oprah Winfrey there had been concerns about 'how dark' her son Archie might be before his birth, a collective gasp could be heard around the world.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-15173865/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-received-award-fighting-structural-racism-Royal-Family-deny-calling-racist-all.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/18/15/104848301-0-image-m-44_1766071519901.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 18:11:20","author":"Editor,Maanya Sachdeva","authors":["Editor","Maanya Sachdeva"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":387849512,"title":"Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche Says Every Mention Of Trump In Epstein Files Will Be Released","text":"Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche promised Sunday that every mention of President Donald Trump in the files surrounding deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will be released to the public.\n\nFriday’s release of the files contained heavily redacted information, very rarely had any mention of Trump, and provided little-to-no new substantive details about Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. Blanche said on Sunday’s “Meet the Press” the Department of Justice (DOJ) will not redact any information relating to the president because he has committed no wrongdoing.\n\n“Is any information about President Trump redacted in any of the files that have or will be released?” NBC News host Kristen Welker asked. \n\n“No, not unless it’s supposed to be redacted under the law, which means victim information or any sort of privilege like attorney client privilege,” Blanche said. “But I have no reason to believe that the lawyers that were working on this case were talking about President Trump because he had nothing to do with Epstein files. He had nothing to do with the horrific crimes that Mr. Epstein committed. And so I don’t expect there will be anything redacted.”\n\n“But the short answer is we are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein,” Blanche continued. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Goes To Bat For Biden Administration Over Not Releasing Epstein Files)\n\nBlanche added that the DOJ is not protecting Trump because he had nothing to do with Epstein’s crimes.\n\n“But yes, if President Trump is mentioned, if there’s photographs that we have of President Trump or anybody else, they, of course, will be released with the exception of any victims or survivors that we’ve identified, which we will either not release that photograph if it’s just a photograph of a survivor,” Blanche continued. “Or if we do release the photograph because there’s other individuals in the picture, the survivor’s face or her entire body in some cases will be redacted.”\n\nThe administration missed the deadline to release all of the files by 11:59 p.m. Friday. Blanche said during a Friday appearance on “Fox & Friends” the DOJ will continue to release files on a rolling basis as internal reviews proceed and victim protections are applied.\n\nThe release of the files is in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which directs the DOJ to release all of the unclassified files to the public. Although he previously opposed the release, Trump signed the legislation into law Nov. 19 and assured he had “nothing to hide.”\n\nThe files garnered national attention after the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concluded in July that Epstein committed suicide inside his jail cell and that he possessed no client list. The memo was an abrupt end to the investigation after Attorney General Pam Bondi stated in February the client list was sitting on her desk and a group of conservative influencers received a “Phase 1” binder of Epstein files.\n\nWhile the tranche hardly mentioned Trump, the DOJ released photographs showing a shirtless former President Bill Clinton lying in a hot tub and socializing with Epstein. The few photos of Trump that were shown had already been made public for decades.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Rudolph joined \"SNL\" mid-way through the 25th season in 2000 and stayed on until 2007, becoming known for sketches like \"Bronx Beat\" with Amy Poehler as well as her impressions of celebrities like Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the end of her tenure on \"SNL\" neared that Rudolph began showcasing just how powerfully unique she is as a performer. The best example of this is in her last season, in an episode hosted by Hugh Laurie. The sketch, titled \"National Anthem,\" sees Rudolph playing a contest winner singing the titular song at the World Series, though her interpretations and riffs on the melody are... abstract, to put it nicely.

The Democrat, who faced off against the President during the 2024 election, recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nWhile promoting her book, 107 Days, on the late-night show, Harris also touched on a range of political issues, including questions surrounding the current president’s health.\n\n“Do not to normalize what’s happening or surrender your power.”\n🚨 New photos from Kamala Harris’ appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Wednesday, Dec 17.\n📸: Randy Holmes pic.twitter.com/kQqmUpxKx6\n— Kamala’s record (@kamalasnaps) December 19, 2025\n\nSince the beginning of Trump’s second term, experts have pointed to symptoms raising concerns about his well-being, despite the president’s repeated claims of being in perfect shape.\n\nJimmy Kimmel talked about the issue with Harris, specifically pointing out how Trump and his supporters went up in arms against former President Joe Biden when he started showing symptoms of aging.\n\nTrump started calling him ‘Sleepy Joe’ and did not stop even after winning the elections.\n\nHe later replaced Biden’s portrait in the White House with an auto-pen, claiming that he was running his administration in auto-pilot mode while being away due to his health issues.\n\nNow that similar reports are coming out about Trump, Kimmel asked Harris if this shows the Republicans’ hypocrisy.\n\nThe host asked, “Republicans had mercilessly attacked President Biden for his age and his mental faculties, and yet now we see the current president falling asleep at meetings and drooling on paperwork, and they seem to have no problem with that. Does that seem hypocritical to you?”\n\nHarris then simply sneered and said, “Ya think?” While the Democrat spoke only two words, they were enough to signal that she is indeed annoyed with the hypocritical behavior of Trump and his allies.\n\nShe later brought up the topic of the President’s health at another point during the show.\n\nWhen Kimmel noted how Trump keeps on lying, and wondered whether he actually believed those lies, or just wants people to support whatever he says, Harris replied saying, “or he is just unwell.” \n\nMVP @KamalaHarris tells it like it is.\n“Or he’s just unwell.” 🔥 pic.twitter.com/rdxbDhIKNk\n— sky (@skylikeajedi) December 18, 2025\n\nHarris’ statement comes at a time when the internet is abuzz with speculations about Trump’s worsening condition due to his old age. By the end of his second term, Trump would be the oldest president in the US history.\n\nPeople have often noticed bruises on Trump’s hands, which he tries to hide with bandages or makeup.\n\nExperts have also highlighted that the President has significantly reduced his public appearances and does not start his official duties before noon.\n\nHe has also been seen taking naps during important meetings and having difficulty recalling important information.\n\nThe 79-year-old, however, time and again claims that he is in excellent health.\n\nHe also frequently boasts of passing cognitive exams, which experts warn could be a sign of overcompensating.\n\nIn October this year, Trump bragged that he had undergone an MRI scan and the results turned out to be ‘as good as the doctors had ever seen.’\n\nHealth specialists, on the other hand, have argued that we should be more focussed about why the President needed to undergo an MRI.\n\nNow that Harris has reacted to the issue, it may again trigger further concerns about Trump’s condition.","summary":"Kamala Harris seemingly took a jibe at Donald Trump's health on Jimmy Kimmel Live!","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kamala-harris-takes-a-quiet-swipe-at-trumps-health-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-he-is-just-unwell","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-2025-12-21T172651.863.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 15:25:38","author":"Jashandeep Singh","authors":["Jashandeep Singh"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.391},{"id":387938106,"title":"The Minnesota Fraud Scandal Is So Much Worse When You Put It This Way","text":"The scale of the Minnesota fraud scandal keeps getting larger, and the political consequences keep getting closer to “Tampon Tim” Walz.\n\nDuring an interview on Jesse Watters Primetime on Friday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller discussed just how much taxpayer money vanished under Walz and what the consequences could be.\n\nMiller immediately zeroed in on Minnesota and the broader refugee resettlement apparatus that Democrats championed for years. “Well, first of all, regarding the situation in Minnesota, by the way, not just Minnesota — we have Somali refugees that were dumped here by Democrats in Ohio and Massachusetts,” Miller said. He argued that the fraud revelations should surprise no one, given the lack of accountability baked into the system.\n\nMinnesota has already become synonymous with massive pandemic-era fraud, particularly the Feeding Our Future scandal, which siphoned off hundreds of millions of dollars meant to feed low-income children. Federal prosecutors have described it as one of the largest COVID-related fraud cases in the country. Given that Walz was governor the entire time and that his administration approved the programs and contracts that allowed the money to flow with minimal oversight, the situation is quite serious for him.\n\nICYMI: Rob Reiner’s Chilling Final Words at Party Suggest His Murder Was Preventable\n\nWalz, in typical Democrat fashion, blames Republicans and the Trump administration for unfairly singling him out. Watters summarized the governor’s complaint succinctly: “Okay, well, Tampon says you guys are after him, and it’s mean and it’s unfair, Miller.”\n\nMiller went further, hammering Walz directly and tying the scandal to Democratic governance. “So … this corrupt, incompetent loser has presided over the largest theft of American taxpayer dollars in history. It’s never been equal before,” Miller said.\n\nThe numbers are staggering.\n\nProsecutors estimate that more than $250 million was stolen through the Minnesota scheme alone, and additional cases continue to surface, so who knows how much bigger it may get. Miller used a stark comparison to drive home just how large it really is. “The amount of money that’s been stolen is larger than the entire GDP of Somalia,” he said. “In other words, the Somalians they brought here have thefted more than all the Somalians in Somalia have ever created for themselves in all the time that has existed up until now.”\n\nThe scandal is actually so much worse when you put it that way.\n\nHe added, “So there needs to be a lot of people going to jail. And I can promise you, the Department of Justice is launching an investigation that is commensurate in force and in purpose with the scope, scale, size, and magnitude of this controversy.”\n\nWatters responded with biting sarcasm, highlighting how damaging those figures are politically for Walz. “Okay, so they just doubled their GDP, thanks to Tampon. Way to go!” he quipped, using the nickname Republicans have attached to Walz since his embrace of progressive social policies.\n\n🚨 HOLY SMOKES: Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller just called TIM WALZ an “INCOMPETENT LOSER” after SOMALIS STOLE $9 BILLION from HIS STATE 🚨“This CORRUPT, incompetent LOSER has presided over the largest theft of American taxpayer dollars in history.” 🔥“The… pic.twitter.com/KwMiwy6Y5C— Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) December 20, 2025\n\nThat promise of accountability matters here because Walz’s national profile has grown inside Democratic circles thanks to Kamala Harris selecting him as her running mate last year. Walz can complain about being targeted, but over 400 Minnesota Department of Human Services employees have accused Walz of being \"100% responsible\" for the fraud. And accountability is most certainly coming. As investigations widen and court cases proceed, the question is no longer whether this scandal matters. The question is how long Democrats can protect one of their own from the consequences.\n\nGive yourself an ad-free reading experience this holiday season.

It was corporate executives using Trump as an excuse to wrest control of their companies back from their workers. It was the belief that Trump's 2024 coalition — which stretched from Stephen Miller and Laura Loomer to Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joe Rogan and Tulsi Gabbard — was the arrival of something new rather than, as many thought in 2016, the final heave of something old.\"\n\nBut Klein emphasizes that there has been a major shift since then.\n\n\"As 2025 closes, Trump's polling sits in the low 40s, with some surveys showing him tumbling into the 30s,\" the Times columnist observes. \"Democrats routed Republicans across the year's elections, winning governorships in New Jersey and Virginia easily and overperforming in virtually every race they contested. Moderate Republicans broke with Speaker Mike Johnson to bring to the House floor a Democratic bill to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies.\"\n\nKlein continues, \"Marjorie Taylor Greene is retiring. Elon Musk said he regretted joining the administration to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Joe Rogan called Trump's immigration policy 'insane.' The right is at war with itself over the Epstein files and how much antisemitism and anti-Indian racism is too much antisemitism and anti-Indian racism.

In larger strategic terms, Vladimir Putin almost certainly now believes that his “special military operation” has accomplished its most important goals. If he hasn’t conquered or subjugated Ukraine, or at least not yet, he has exposed the fundamental weakness of the so-called Western alliance, and may have fractured it permanently.\n\nTo state the obvious, Donald Trump’s second presidency has been immensely helpful to Putin’s war effort, but no byzantine conspiracy theories involving kompromat videotapes are required. Trump admires Putin and craves his admiration in return, for familiar and pathetic psychological reasons. But there’s no evidence that Putin views Trump as a trustworthy partner, only as a stooge he can easily manipulate. As for Trump’s surrender-lite Ukraine “peace plan,” which may have been crafted by the Russians in the first place, at least it brings the painful contradictions of this war to the surface: There is no exit strategy from the Ukraine quagmire, now or in the foreseeable future, that does not involve giving Putin most of what he wants.\n\nThere is, or at least was, plenty of evidence to support the Western media and political narrative that Russia was losing the war, or was likely to lose it, or at least might. The initial invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was clearly based on major strategic miscalculations and involved enormous tactical blunders, followed by humiliating retreat. If Putin and his generals believed their own propaganda that Ukraine was a wayward province of Mother Russia that would capitulate with little resistance, they quickly learned otherwise.\n\nDespite internal divisions and a largely dysfunctional government, Ukrainians united behind their unlikely president and fought back with immense courage and resourcefulness — as well as countless billions in overt and clandestine assistance from the U.S. and its allies. Under Joe Biden’s administration, the conflict became an unconcealed proxy war between Russia and a seemingly unified Western alliance. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and various military leaders spoke confidently (although largely off the record) about winning back all the Ukrainian territory lost since the first Russian incursions in 2014, and either driving Putin into his corner in defeat or, in their more elaborate fantasies, bringing down his regime altogether.\n\nWell, pride goeth before the fall and all that. If Biden and his advisers believed that they understood their opponent’s weakness and how to exploit it, on the other side of the equation Putin believed exactly the same thing. It’s tough to avoid the conclusion that his analysis was more accurate.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Russia’s military and Russian society have paid a terrible price for this war, worse than outsiders will ever know. Even by conservative estimates, hundreds of thousands of soldiers have been killed or wounded, not to mention the enormous and expensive losses of military hardware and damaged infrastructure. Western leaders assumed that Putin’s regime was too fragile to withstand that level of social and economic damage, which may have been a critical mistake. Russian leaders have a long history of treating their young men as expendable cannon fodder who die in defense of the motherland, and those tales of mass sacrifice are deeply encoded in national mythology.\n\nAs Foreign Policy columnist Michael Hirsh writes,“far more unanimity of opinion exists on the Russian side in support of the invasion than on the Western side against it.” Scholar Maria Snegovaya tells him that Western politicians and policymakers “are deceiving themselves” if they believe that Russian public opinion has turned against Putin or the war, and that even younger Russians “remain ‘unusually united’ in blaming the West for provoking Putin into war.”\n\nSimilarly, analysts tell Hirsh that sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European nations have done only modest damage to Russia’s domestic economy. Indeed, they may have backfired by solidifying Russia’s economic alliances with China and India, which have kept on buying Russian oil and gas, sometimes through intermediaries or by using false-flag tankers. After his Ukraine talks with Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in early December, Putin flew straight to India and “struck a series of economic and military deals” with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the Ukraine conflict is also among the most difficult to grasp: It looks entirely different from the Russian perspective than it does from the so-called West. Both sides are entrenched in ideological narratives that tell some parts of the story and ignore others.\n\nFor many Europeans and Americans, understanding this war as a David-and-Goliath narrative or even an updated Battle of Britain — Ukraine as a lonely democracy, fighting for freedom against a tyrannical invader — carries a powerful historical resonance. But a historic sense of grievance also drives the narrative behind Putin’s war, which is partly about the mythical or mystical connection between Russia and Ukraine, partly about resisting Western decadence and corruption — which are blamed, not entirely without reason, for the poverty and misery of the post-Soviet years — and a lot about reversing several decades of national humiliation.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only by Amanda Marcotte, also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nIt is precisely the collision and contradiction between those narratives, and the extent to which Ukrainians are trapped inside them or between them, almost as supporting characters in other people’s fables, that has led the world into this seemingly unresolvable crisis. I’m not saying that those narratives are morally equivalent, or that some vague sense of historical grievance and perceived hostility is a valid excuse for launching an unprovoked war against a neighboring country. But I am saying that Putin perceived the weakness of the Western narrative, and Western leaders failed to perceive the strength of his.\n\nTrump has been a big help to Putin, as previously stated. There’s no way to know how a Kamala Harris administration might have approached this crisis, but it’s fair to say that Putin’s view of Western liberal democracy was the same, with or without Trump: It was a paper tiger and a failed system, lots of posturing and big words but no action. He saw the U.S., first of all, as a rapidly declining superpower that lacked the political will and self-confidence for any coherent strategic response to the Ukraine invasion. Europe, meanwhile, was a confederation of internally conflicted American client states, plagued by mass immigration and economic stagnation and lacking any unified foreign policy or military force.\n\nUm, yeah. Correct on both counts. No doubt he expected a much easier and less painful military victory, but even as the war unfolded into a gruesome stalemate, Putin came to understand that as long as Russian forces kept grinding away, he held the upper hand. Any possible resolution to the conflict involved unpalatable options for the increasingly divided Western allies: It was almost inconceivable (and is even more so today) that they would launch a unified military response aimed at recapturing all of Ukraine’s lost territory, risking all-out war with Russia over a non-EU, non-NATO nation. The other option, in all likelihood, is a more politely phrased, face-saving version of the current Trump plan, in which Ukraine gives up big chunks of territory in exchange for “security guarantees” that everyone knows are temporary, conditional and not worth much.\n\nUkraine’s people do not seem ready to surrender, at least not yet. Europe’s embattled centrist political leaders seem prepared to help them fight on, with or without American aid, in hopes of a military breakthrough, an internal crisis in Russia or simply a better deal. There is honor in courage and hope, and none of us can see the future. But we can see the recent past, when too many of us who live thousands of miles away and were never touched by this war told ourselves a story about what it meant and how it would go. Like so many of the stories Americans tell about the world, it wasn’t true.","summary":"For three years we've spun fairytales about Russia's inevitable defeat, while the \"West\" was falling apart","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/12/21/how-putin-won-the-war-with-a-little-help-from-his-friends/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2205265141-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 11:45:20","author":"Andrew O'hehir","authors":["Andrew O'hehir"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":387968652,"title":"Initial unveiling of Epstein files focuses Clinton","text":"WASHINGTON -- Former President Bill Clinton featured prominently in the first batch of files released Friday by the Justice Department stemming from its investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as the White House seized the chance to shift the focus of the highly anticipated documents from President Donald Trump.\n\nThere were several photos of Clinton among the thousands of documents made public. Some showed him on a private plane, including one with a woman, whose face is redacted, seated alongside him with her arm around him. Another photo shows him in a pool with Epstein's longtime confidant, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and a person whose face was also redacted.\n\nAnother photo shows Clinton in a hot tub with a woman whose face was redacted. The files do not say when or where the photos were taken and there was little context surrounding them.\n\nThe 79-year-old Clinton's political career has been marred by personal scandals in the past and his impeachment in 1998. His association with Epstein and Maxwell in the late 1990s and early 2000s is well-documented, and the images released Friday are just a slice of the \"several hundred thousand\" documents Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has said are tied to the investigation.\n\nBut the photos depict a web of unsavory relationships and associations that complicate Democratic efforts to keep the focus on Trump and the incumbent president's desire to move on from the issue entirely.\n\nAfter the photos were released, several White House officials, including press secretary Karoline Leavitt and top aide Steven Cheung, made social media posts highlighting them. Trump didn't talk about the issue as he left the White House late Friday on his way to deliver a speech in North Carolina.\n\nClinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone's name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise. In a statement, Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said the White House was \"shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever.\"\n\n\"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton,\" Ureña said. \"Never has been, never will be.\"\n\nLong before Friday's photos, Republicans had zeroed in on the former president and his association with Epstein.\n\nRepublicans on the House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed Bill and Hillary Clinton for depositions earlier this year, but received a response that the Clintons wanted to provide a written statement of what \"little information\" they had on Epstein.\n\nThe Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer, has demanded they appear for in-person testimonies and threatened to initiate contempt of Congress proceedings if they don't.\n\nMultiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before Congress, but none has been compelled to do so.\n\nWhen Clinton was president, Epstein visited the White House multiple times, visitor logs show. After he left office, Epstein assisted with some of the former president's philanthropy. Clinton flew multiple times on Epstein's private jet, including on a humanitarian trip to Africa with actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker in 2002.\n\nClinton, the former Arkansas governor, first ran for president in 1992 as a new type of Democrat, hailing from the South with an appeal that united his party's base along with moderate voters. He became the first Democrat in 16 years to win the White House and remains one of his party's most prominent figures. He had a prime-time speaking slot during last summer's Democratic National Convention in which he made a forceful case for Kamala Harris' candidacy.\n\nBut Clinton's ties to the Epstein case are a reminder of how his political promise has always been tempered by personal indiscretions.\n\nHis 1992 campaign was dogged by rumors of an affair with Gennifer Flowers, which he denied at the time. His presidency was rocked when he was impeached in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice when he denied engaging in a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He ultimately acknowledged a relationship with Lewinsky that was \"not appropriate\" while insisting that \"even presidents have private lives.\"\n\nTrump, whose 2016 campaign was nearly derailed when a tape emerged of him bragging about grabbing women by the genitals, has often deflected accusations of sexual misconduct by pointing to Clinton's behavior. But even Trump's top allies have questioned those claims. In an interview published by Vanity Fair last week, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said Trump \"was wrong\" in frequently suggesting that the Epstein files included incriminating information about Clinton.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Stephen Groves and Gary Fields of The Associated Press.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/dec/21/initial-unveiling-of-epstein-files-focuses-clinton/","image":"https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211817025_211816363-86ca25e2d7014703ba234483bbfc25b4_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 11:37:00","author":"Steven Sloan The Associated Press","authors":["Steven Sloan The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":387857888,"title":"Clarence Page: It&#8217;s hard to hide the dysfunction of the Trump White House","text":"Will someone please tell President Donald Trump that he’s not running against Joe Biden anymore? Almost a year into his second term, he can’t seem to let his former opponent go.\n\n“Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I am fixing it,” Trump said at the start of a televised speech Wednesday intended to reassure Americans with messages he has been pushing through months of sloganeering.\n\nBut happy days are not here again in Trump’s polling numbers. In the latest PBS News/NPR/Marist poll, 57% disapprove of the job he’s doing on the economy. Just 36% of poll respondents approve, a record low for both of his terms.\n\nYet Trump did his best to argue that down was up. \n\n “When I took office, inflation was the worst in 48 years, and some would say in the history of our country,” Trump claimed. “Inflation has stopped, wages are up, prices are down, our nation is strong.”\n\nThat’s how Biden sounded in the spring of last year, as he tried to convince skeptical voters that the struggling economy was something closer to robust. But neither Biden nor his eventual Democratic replacement on the electoral ticket, Kamala Harris, could overcome the lived experience of millions of voters whose strained household budgets told them otherwise.\n\nTrump’s promises of lower prices for American consumers helped him to beat Harris. But now the shoe is on the other foot. Prices rose 3% in the 12 months ending in September, and consumer spending on big-ticket items fell markedly, partly because of Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“We’re the hottest country anywhere in the world, and that’s said by every single leader that I’ve spoken to over the last five months,” he said. Have world leaders told him that in earnest, or are they playing to Trump’s mountainous self-regard?\n\nAs Trump was overselling the fruits of his economic stewardship, another controversy was boiling up, this time within his own administration.\n\nTrump’s savvy chief of staff, Susie Wiles, is generally viewed within Republican circles as a disciplined and effective political operator, a reputation grounded in her decades-long involvement in GOP campaigns and her central role in managing Trump’s 2024 campaign and early White House staff operations. That, in addition to her close proximity to the president, is why the widely talked-about interviews that she gave to Vanity Fair made headlines. In a more conventional administration, such an interview would be viewed as a scandal that would end careers, but of course the Trump White House is anything but conventional.\n\nAmong other fuel for gossip, or worse, she described Trump as having an alcoholic personality, acknowledged that Trump uses prosecutions as a means of “score settling,” described Budget Director Russell Vought as a “right-wing absolute zealot” and described Vice President JD Vance as “a conspiracy theorist for a decade.”\n\nYet, strangely for super-serious Washington, neither the president nor the other parties named by Wiles were eager to treat this flap as anything more serious than business as usual.\n\nWiles defended herself by claiming that Vanity Fair omitted “significant context” in order to create “an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative.” While we can all feel for her, “chaotic” and “negative” are two words a lot of voters would agree do a nice job of summing up the Trump administration. \n\nEmail Clarence Page at cptimee@gmail.com.\n\nSubmit a letter, of no more than 400 words, to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/21/column-donald-trump-kennedy-center-susie-wiles-page/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-l-trump-wiles.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 11:00:54","author":"Clarence Page","authors":["Clarence Page"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.324},{"id":387970474,"title":"The year Trump broke the federal government","text":"A State Department worker watched on television as President Donald Trump, hours into his second term, signed executive orders that halted relocation flights for Afghan refugees — which her office existed to coordinate. She wondered: What would happen now?\n\nA Veterans Affairs staffer in that agency’s equity office watched Trump sign another document, this one outlawing diversity programs, and thought, “It’s over.” And in a Social Security building, a woman wandered over to her co-worker’s desk worried about Russell Vought, Trump’s pick for budget director. Vought said he wanted to put federal workers “in trauma,” she pointed out, and would soon decide which agencies to cut and by how much.\n\n“It isn’t easy to fire federal employees,” her co-worker told her. “We have all these protections. We’ll be okay.”\n\nHe was wrong. The United States’ 2.4 million federal employees were about to get caught up in a once-unthinkable overhaul of the nation’s sprawling bureaucracy, carried out in less than a year by one of the most polarizing presidents in American history.\n\nMissions have shifted or shattered. Entire agencies were deleted. Nearly 300,000 employees were forced out of the federal workforce. The Trump administration froze or shut off billions of dollars in scientific research, gutted or eliminated offices and programs devoted to civil rights and diversity, rewrote the federal hiring system to reward loyalty to the president, and shrank Social Security while installing Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents in hundreds of new offices across the country.\n\nMore changes are coming: Trump officials are planning to cut tens of thousands of open positions from the Department of Veterans Affairs, downgrade performance ratings across the government, and replace the State Department’s traditional condemnation of torture and the persecution of minorities worldwide with scrutiny of abortion and youth gender transitioning in other countries.\n\nReached for comment, White House spokeswoman Liz Huston wrote in an emailed statement: “President Trump was given a clear mandate to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse from federal government. In less than a year in office, he has made significant progress in making the federal government more efficient to better serve the American taxpayer.”\n\nA White House official who declined to give their name also shared 19 bullet points listing Trump’s accomplishments transforming the government in 2025. These included processing a record 2.5 million ratings claims at Veterans Affairs; ending the Biden-era Digital Equity Act, which, the official wrote, “provided billions in handouts based on race”; allowing fossil fuels to be used in federal buildings again; halting operations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; terminating “all federal Fake News media contracts”; requiring that agencies cut 10 existing rules or regulations for every new rule introduced; downsizing the federal bureaucracy; ordering staff back to the office five days a week; and shuttering “radical and wasteful government sponsored” diversity programs.\n\nSeveral federal agencies did not respond to requests for comment, including Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThis account of what happened inside the U.S. government in 2025 is based on a year’s worth of messages and interviews with more than 1,200 current and former federal workers. More than 200 also agreed to fill out a Washington Post survey asking about their experiences. Thirty participated in nearly 60 hours of video and phone interviews, with many speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs or their families.\n\nThis is their story.\n\nGoogle searches for “federal workers return to office” spiked by 600 percent as soon as Trump ended remote work. Then instructions began to go out.\n\nA Department of Health and Human Services staffer in the Southwest was given five days to move to D.C. A Defense Department worker had two months to report to an office in another state. In Pahrump, Nevada, a Bureau of Land Management employee received an email with the address of the nearest federal building: more than 70 miles away. Edward Brandon Beckham looked at his wife, dying of cancer in home hospice, and knew he couldn’t leave her to commute for three hours a day.\n\nWorkers turned a conference room in a Veterans Affairs office in California into desk space for six nurses. Veterans who called to confess thoughts of suicide could hear people speaking in the background. In the Southwest, a woman who conducted background investigations into federal applicants showed up to her new office to find she could hear every word of her co-workers’ conversations — and they could hear hers. She moved into a musty closet, closing the door.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection employee, unable to locate a federal office building, started driving to an international airport that ran flights only on weekends. He walked and shuttled through miles of empty terminals each morning to a desk where he sat, all day, without seeing a single human face. After six months, he quit.\n\nThe FBI instructed janitorial staff in Quantico, Virginia, to paint over a colorful mural bearing the words “FAIRNESS,” “COMPASSION” and “DIVERSITY.” Pete Hegseth, the newly confirmed defense secretary, ordered an end to Black History Month celebrations. IT workers at the Transportation Department scraped every mention of “DEI” from their website.\n\nThe Social Security Administration shuttered its Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity, where 150 people handled civil rights complaints and harassment cases, and made accommodations for those with disabilities, both SSA workers and members of the public. One disabled staffer learned of the closure by reading media reports and, fighting tears, called her supervisor on his personal number. He knew no more than she did, he said.\n\nAt NASA, a worker emailed her office’s equal employment contact with a request. But the automated reply said the recipient “wasn’t found at nasa.gov.”\n\nDozens of Education Department staffers checked their email to find they were on leave “pursuant to the President’s executive order on DEIA.” One of them, Donna Bussell, couldn’t understand why: Her job was helping administer grants to support Native American students. Then she remembered. She’d once served as president of an affinity group for Native Americans and Alaskans at the department.\n\nA Veterans Affairs psychologist heard from a man who ran treatment groups for LGBTQ+ veterans. He was quitting, he said, because VA had become “hostile.” The psychologist’s LGBTQ+ patients stopped showing up to their appointments.\n\nA National Guard employee and former lawyer responded with questions — How could this possibly work? Will the government be bound by it? He was careful not to type the word “resign.” A Veterans Affairs worker texted his wife: “It’s 100% a ‘here’s your chance to get out paid, you might not get that later.’” In Colorado, a Forest Service staffer opened his diary and wrote: “I advised as many people as I could not to take it. … I am coming to the realization that I have to fight back.”\n\nIn D.C., an Education Department staffer waited three weeks, then replied “resign,” because he was sure he’d get fired anyway. In Minnesota, Agriculture Department loan assistant James Barnebee resigned, too. It was an easy decision, even with four children: He had voted for Trump, who campaigned on reducing the size of the government. The president, Barnebee thought, was just doing what he promised.\n\nErica Hagen, 48, hoped it didn’t mean anything when bosses told her not to wear USAID gear to an event with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was touring Latin America.\n\nHagen, a program officer in the Dominican Republic, listened as Rubio promised the audience that foreign aid wasn’t gone, just under review. She thought about all the frozen programs she had helped oversee: One treating and preventing HIV. Another educating children in rural areas. A third reducing plastic in the oceans.\n\nNot long after Rubio’s visit, Hagen and her colleagues were sent home, dismissed from their jobs. Someone staged a goodbye ceremony. “Participants will paint rocks with positive images and messages to commemorate the presence and contributions” of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the invitation read. Hagen wrote “RIP USAID” in red and black on an oval rock. She left it on a picnic table with nearly 100 other rocks, which someone eventually nestled under a tree.\n\nShe flew to D.C. with her three children and husband to find a final set of off-boarding instructions: She had to cancel her diplomatic passport by punching a hole in it. Everything Hagen owned was wrapped in plastic on a cargo ship, so she drove to her local library to borrow a hole punch.\n\nShe closed her eyes as she pressed down, wondering if this was how it felt to dig your grave.\n\nThousands of probationary workers found out they were fired from prerecorded videos. Some were instructed to leave the building in 30 minutes. The Office of Personnel Management’s acting director told probationary staff, “I understand that this may be unexpected and that this is difficult.” One worker asked, “Who is this guy?”\n\nThe Small Business Administration emailed terminated employees a number they could call to appeal. But when one woman phoned, an apartment building answered: “Thank you for calling Westbrooke Place.” A Veterans Affairs supervisor texted a fired subordinate: “It states it’s due to your performance which is not true. … You need to appeal it.”\n\nMore mistakes emerged. The Energy Department laid off hundreds of engineers, technicians and managers who maintain America’s nuclear weapons before scrambling to rehire them. Veterans Affairs had to bring back workers who staff the Veterans Crisis Line. The Department of Health and Human Services reinstated employees who oversee aid to survivors of 9/11 and regulate the nation’s food supply, including a neonatologist who helped oversee the quality of infant formula.\n\nAbout 2 a.m., Elon Musk, the billionaire whom Trump had named to lead a cost-cutting team called the U.S. DOGE Service, shared a picture of himself in gladiator armor and wrote that he was destroying “the woke mind virus.” Later that morning, Forest Service worker Amanda Mae Downey drove to her office in Michigan to sign a letter accepting her firing, unsure how she’d support her three children, sick mother and newly unemployed husband. Above her signature, she wrote in blue: “Received and accepted under duress.”\n\nPuzzled workers spending their Saturdays at dog parks or breweries, or taking their children to Scouting America events, opened a message titled “What did you do last week?” It asked for five bullet points of accomplishments.\n\nA worker at the Food and Drug Administration reported it as spam. An employee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development fed the instructions into ChatGPT, then responded with 20 pages of gibberish. At an airport in the Pacific Northwest, Transportation Security Administration employees who check for weapons were pulled away from their X-ray machines to compose bullet points. Lines swelled.\n\nA Forest Service staffer copied the email verbatim into his diary. “Every week things come more and more into focus,” he wrote beneath it. “We are at war.”\n\nIn Virginia, the family of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services worker Caitlin Cross-Barnet checked her into a mental health facility. She was struggling with despair after a difficult hysterectomy, and because she felt Trump was unraveling the government. In daily calls to her husband, she asked about changes to the federal workforce. Six days after the “What did you do” email, she killed herself.\n\nWithin two months, as Musk fell out with Trump and prepared to leave the government, most agencies reversed course and told employees to ignore the emails.\n\nAcross the government, staff searched for words they hoped would save the work they believed in. NASA employees built a spreadsheet explaining why DOGE shouldn’t cancel the agency’s 13,000 contracts and grants: “Mission essential.” “Worthwhile scientific research.” “Taxpayer dollars … were already spent.”\n\nAt the Energy Department, one worker prepared memos arguing that his projects would cut costs for American homes and businesses. Someone decided to cancel many anyway. So he, like other employees, began deleting: Any mention of “carbon.” “Sustainability.” The word “green.”\n\nState Department staffers scrubbed out the terms “diverse” and “inclusive.” One Environmental Protection Agency employee, tasked with eliminating information about race, gender and religion, confided to her diary: “It’s really difficult to have to erase someone’s existence from the federal government.”\n\nAt the National Institutes of Health, Elizabeth Ginexi was sent a list of grants to review for DOGE, along with words to watch for: “inclusion,” “race,” “ethnicity.” It felt unscientific. Had she really earned a Ph.D. to do this? Breaking the rules, she called one grantee from her personal phone and told them to revise their study abstract — removing the words “gender” and “minorities.”\n\nThen DOGE arrived at her building. They were easy to spot: Silent young men in their 20s and 30s, always wearing backpacks. Some of her colleagues’ cars were searched in the parking lot. Other employees were stopped in the bathroom and asked for their ID cards. Ginexi began having nightmares about getting fired because she voted for Kamala Harris.\n\nNot long before she decided to resign, she texted a friend: “NIH is being killed.”\n\nTen thousand health staff, including biomedical scientists and researchers who studied patient safety, lost their jobs. Senior leaders at the NIH received letters offering new posts in remote areas such as Alaska or Billings, Montana. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those who oversaw chronic disease, HIV and tuberculosis programs were reassigned to the Indian Health Service.\n\nWhen Tony Schlaff arrived at the Health Resources and Services Administration, he was astonished to see hundreds of people queued up outside. “What’s going on?” he asked. “Everybody is going through a full screening,” the person standing next to him said. Schlaff filed into line and, alongside hundreds of colleagues, waited for nearly two hours, shivering in the frigid wind.\n\nOnce indoors, Schlaff watched employees walk through a TSA-style screening machine and undergo badge checks. Some walked back outside, tearful. After half an hour, he got close enough to hear what was happening: “You do not have access to the building,” one security guard told a woman whose badge failed to swipe, which is how she found out she’d been fired. “Leave. Go home.”\n\nIn Texas, Shelley Bain awoke to her phone buzzing. Bain, a 66-year-old program specialist for the Administration for Children and Families, checked her email and saw she’d been fired at 4:30 a.m. She made a cup of coffee and calculated. She was losing half the retirement income she’d counted on. She is legally blind, so it would be hard to find another job.\n\nAt 6:24 a.m., she texted her children. Her daughter swore. When Bain’s grandchildren woke, she made breakfast and walked them to the bus stop. Before they boarded, she pulled the girls, 12 and 14, aside: “I just got fired, but it will be okay.” She watched the bus pull away, thinking about how she’d probably have to sell her home, a farm outside Dallas where she and her husband had hoped to die.\n\nThe spending limits on federal credit cards shrank to $1. Government scientists studying food safety ran short of lab-cleaning fluid. Contractors who help identify U.S. soldiers killed in combat were told to pause their work.\n\nA climate researcher at the U.S. Geological Survey found herself unable to travel for research conferences, restock hydrogen gas or buy Scotch tape. A Food and Drug Administration staffer couldn’t purchase dry ice or environmental swabs, nor pay the highway tolls that safety inspectors incurred driving for work. When colleagues asked what they were supposed to do, she told them to try HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Trump.\n\nIn a Colorado branch of the Forest Service, one man was designated purchaser for the entire office. Anyone who wanted to buy horse fodder or irrigation pipes had to wait until the man returned from weeks-long firefighting trips. The new system meant staff were a week late buying chainsaw fuel, delaying the thinning of flammable forest brush. “In 15 years, I have never seen us so unprepared for fire season,” the local fire management officer told staff at a meeting, according to one worker in attendance.\n\nGeneral Services Administration political appointees imposed a rule mandating they approve project requests, and more than 1,500 built up in an internal tracker, including executed leases and notices saying construction could begin. At NASA, a group of employees wrote several detailed paragraphs, across multiple emails, to justify buying fastening bolts.\n\nSocial Security started requiring that one of fewer than a dozen people sign off on expenses for all 1,300 field offices. Staff ran out of paper, printer cartridges and phone headsets, even as calls poured in from Americans asking what Trump might be doing to their benefits.\n\nIn one Northeastern office, the fridge broke. In late April, a staffer emailed the office seeking donations: “We are going to purchase a new fridge since the funds that would normally be available for Facilities to provide us with one are still frozen. Before we do, I would like to see if anyone else is interested in contributing.”\n\nIt wasn’t Abby McIlraith’s primary job to take calls from survivors — until Texas flooded.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency had long contracted with phone centers to help handle the influx of calls after disasters. But the contracts cost more than $100,000, meaning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem had to approve them, and she was slow to do so, letting some lapse for close to a week.\n\nSo McIlraith was assigned to the phones, taking back-to-back calls. She wrote down what people had lost: homes, cars, furniture, appliances. She asked if they had anywhere to stay, if FEMA could help. She listened to people scream about how long they’d been waiting, demand to know why the government was moving so slowly.\n\nPer her orders, she kept each call to a few minutes. Whenever a conversation ended, she had 40 seconds to finish her notes. She watched the timer on her screen count down to the next call.\n\nA few months later, she heard that other employees were signing a letter of dissent, disagreeing with the direction of FEMA under Trump. She wondered if signing would cost her her job, then recalled her week answering phones. McIlraith signed her name — and was placed on leave.\n\nAsked about McIlraith’s account, FEMA shared a written statement from acting press secretary Daniel Llargues asserting Noem’s tighter control over spending “strengthens oversight, safeguards against fraud, waste and abuse, and ensures funding decisions are well-documented and mission-focused.” Noem’s $100,000 rule has already “saved U.S. taxpayers … $10.7 billion,” Llargues added, stating without offering evidence that Noem reviews every contract within 24 hours.\n\nNew resignation offers rolled out, agency by agency. As the summer waned, people left.\n\nThe NIH lost six directors of institutes focused on infectious disease, child health and the human genome. The Federal Aviation Administration lost its chief air traffic officer, among nearly a dozen other top officials. The Internal Revenue Service lost its chief of staff, chief procurement officer and chief human capital officer — while the Treasury Department lost more than 200 technical experts and experienced managers who helped run the nation’s financial systems.\n\nAt a town hall, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy told staff: “We’re going to lose some knowledge, right? We’re going to lose some expertise as we go through this process.” He asked those staying “to get the best points from those who are leaving.”\n\nIn the Midwest, union leader Colin Smalley watched his Army Corps of Engineers unit dwindle. Among the departed: An employee so knowledgeable about rock blasting that the government brought him back the first time he tried to retire. A staffer who was spearheading a novel project to stun invasive carp with electric shocks. How, Smalley asked his wife, could they ever replace someone who knew how to electrify rivers?\n\nA National Park Service staffer in Colorado tallied her park’s losses: Two people employed for 20 years each. One woman who’d been there even longer. A biologist who’d founded a key program the park ran. Soon, everyone was picking up new responsibilities. Bosses filled out time sheets, biologists signed travel authorizations and the staffer, a land surveyor, began leading park tours. Other days, she cleaned bathrooms.\n\nHearing about a protest against federal cuts, she drew up a poster to carry. “Where have all the rangers gone?” it asked.\n\nIn Lander, Wyoming, three Forest Service retirees noticed fences tilting over, docks slipping into lakes, mountain roads caving inward from water pressure. Barb Gustin, 69, began volunteering to keep open Lander’s Forest Service office. Bill Lee, 73, drove hundreds of miles through the forest weekly, fixing broken fences and fallen signs. And Del Nelson, 81, started wiping down five bathrooms a day. He knew money was short, so he used one paper towel per set of toilets.\n\nMore than 750,000 were sent home without pay as whole departments shuttered. Some National Park Service staffers left without being told if they could put up signs telling visitors their parks had closed. At the State Department, staffers who’d already been fired were surprised to see furlough notices hit their personal inboxes — a painful accident.\n\nAn Agriculture Department employee lined up a second job classifying soils, figuring the shutdown might last for a while. A State Department custodian required to keep working readied herself for another shift cleaning toilets and mopping floors. Education Department employees saw their out-of-office messages altered to blame “Democrat Senators” for the shutdown. On their sixth day working without pay, a skeleton crew of NIH researchers learned a well-liked animal health technician had been taken by ICE to a Louisiana detention center.\n\n“We are going to have to lay some people off if the shutdown continues,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters, even as senior federal officials privately warned such firings would be illegal. An IRS worker wondered whether his disability, which necessitates working from home, meant he would be dismissed first.\n\nIn a year when roughly 300,000 had already gone, 4,000 more lost their jobs — dismissals swiftly entangled in lawsuits. In the Oval Office, Trump said he’d fired “people that the Democrats want.” The reductions in force targeted staff who regulated hazardous waste, checked the quality of federal housing and assisted students with disabilities.\n\nNationwide, flights fell behind schedule. Taxpayer help lines shut down. The president ordered the Pentagon to use research funding to pay service members, while his top deputies claimed they or Trump had found unspecified ways to compensate immigration and law enforcement agents. Workers who’d missed two paychecks in a row, while showing up to the office, watched money flow into gun-carrying colleagues’ accounts.\n\nIn Philadelphia, staff at one of the largest food banks noticed shelves growing bare. In Colorado, service members and veterans flooded the Homefront Military Network, asking for help with mortgages, utilities, car payments. Federal workers paid their bills with credit cards and stocked their kitchens from food pantries. Cynthia Brown, of the Government Publishing Office, lost her car to repossession, sold two iPhones and began subsisting on coffee and protein shakes.\n\nJust before the government reopened, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown would trim as much as $14 billion from the United States’ annual economic output.\n\nFederal workers, grateful to pick up paychecks again, found other worries waiting. Some agencies privately warned staff to expect deep spending cuts in 2026, reflecting Trump’s desired bare-bones budget. Following guidance from a top administration official to stop giving “everyone … an A,” the National Park Service decided to give 80 percent of staff middling performance reviews, which help determine promotions and bonuses. The National Weather Service lagged in hiring hundreds of promised replacement forecasters. And Veterans Affair made plans to slice away as many as 35,000 open jobs.\n\nAt the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an attorney whose job used to be fighting housing discrimination told himself to stop thinking about things he couldn’t control — and dived into yet another internal personnel case. The Trump administration had stalled all his lawsuits and barred officials at his agency from speaking any language that wasn’t English. They’d even ripped down posters written in Spanish. Overnight, the attorney found himself unable to talk to many of his complainants, or even explain why.\n\nHe tried to focus on that day’s assignment — an ethics advisory opinion for a colleague who wanted to sell his house — but kept thinking about what he’d seen in the garage. Months ago, ICE had begun using his New York City federal building as a detention holding center. The evening before, walking to collect his bike, he’d witnessed a family in chains being led into an unmarked van. The attorney could still hear the sound their manacles made, dragging on concrete.\n\nThousands of miles away in Alaska, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biologist stopped by a bush outside her building. She wasn’t eager to start another day of “Section 7 consults”: 500-page reports assessing the environmental impact of docks, airports and cable lines. It wasn’t unimportant, but it wasn’t the science she was hired to do — monitoring beluga whales, analyzing samples of stranded ocean mammals for disease, testing the impacts of pollution on pregnant whales. And it meant hours formatting Word documents.\n\nThe biologist stared at the bush, delaying a few more seconds. There used to be rocks beneath it, and in the spring, she’d painted some with slogans: “Save the Whales.” “NOAA Saves Whales.” Children began adding their own hand-painted contributions. It felt like hope. Then one day she arrived at work to find all the rocks had been removed. “This is what we’re fighting against, and losing,” she told herself now, looking at the bare earth, and walked into the building.\n\nIn D.C., a Defense Department worker looked up from a pile of congressional inquiries to check the clock. Two minutes to 11:30 — his lunch break. Another morning gone with no chance to turn to his studies of rising rates of mental illness among service members. Or his proposals, languishing for almost a year now, on how the government could drive those down.\n\nThis job was all he’d wanted to do since a close family member, a veteran, died by suicide. Then his office shrank by half under Trump. The staffers who were supposed to answer questions from Congress lost or left their jobs, and their work became his. Now, whenever the worker snatched time to resurface one of his ideas, he was told there was no money. He kept having the same thought driving to work, doing the dishes, just before he fell asleep: “You’re failing the American people.”\n\nRather than eat, the worker rose from his desk and walked until he found somewhere secluded. He knelt in prayer.\n\n“If I am supposed to be here, then I am going to keep doing this,” he told God. “But if it’s time for me to go, please open the doors, so I can go.”\n\nHe repeats the prayer almost every day, waiting for a sign.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2025/trump-federal-government-workers-doge/","image":"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTXKP5IHUVEP7FHG4VOZCNXR2M.jpg&high_res=true&w=1600&h=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 10:00:22","author":"Hannah Natanson, Meryl Kornfield","authors":["Hannah Natanson, Meryl Kornfield"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":387938112,"title":"Republicans Face a Defining Choice in 2028","text":"Former White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany made this case in an interview with Fox News host Martha MacCallum, arguing that Republicans need a robust primary process to produce the strongest possible candidate. \"I think it's very important that the Republican party have a competitive primary,\" she said. \"It makes you tougher.\"\n\nShe pointed to the Democrats as a cautionary tale.\n\nWe all remember what happened. Joe Biden was forced out of the 2024 race, he endorsed Kamala Harris, and the party was forced to rally behind her without holding a primary.\n\n\"We see how much weaker, in my opinion, the left was by not having a primary,\" McEnany explained. That lack of competition, she suggested, left Harris unprepared for the general election — and Trump ultimately won. \"I hope we have that competitive primary,\" McEnany added.\n\nICYMI: Rob Reiner’s Chilling Final Words at Party Suggest His Murder Was Preventable\n\nHer comments came just a day after Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, now the executive director of Turning Point USA, publicly endorsed Vance for the White House on Thursday at the organization's AmericaFest conference in Phoenix.\n\nKirk told the crowd, \"We are going to get my husband's friend, JD Vance, elected for [48th president] in the most resounding way possible.\" She also vowed to keep Congress in Republican hands for Trump's entire second term.\n\nMcEnany acknowledged that Kirk's backing gives Vance a significant advantage, calling it a \"leg up\" as the 2028 field starts to take shape. But she stopped short of endorsing him herself. Instead, she emphasized the benefits of a contested primary.\n\nVance, for his part, has downplayed any sense of entitlement to the nomination, and made it clear he knows he'll have to earn the nomination. \"I'm not entitled to it just because I'm vice president,\" he said.\n\nPresident Trump, surprisingly, has stayed out of the fray — at least officially. He said in August that it's too soon to endorse anyone for 2028, though he's described Vance as his \"most likely\" successor.\n\nThe broader GOP field is expected to be crowded. Likely contenders include Rubio, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Each brings a different base of support and governing style, which could make for a contentious primary.\n\nPrimaries can be brutal for a party, but I’ve long felt that the party is better served by having one, and I was highly critical of President Trump for feeling entitled to the 2024 nomination, even though he was obviously the favorite. Now that Trump isn’t a factor at all, the need for Republican voters to have a full say in who takes over the movement is crucial. The question now is whether Republicans will heed that advice or fall in line behind Vance without any meaningful competition. With Trump declining to pick sides and a deep bench of potential candidates waiting in the wings, 2028 is shaping up to be anything but predictable.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/12/20/republicans-face-a-defining-choice-in-2028-n4947340","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/350/f1ec5c9d-b346-430c-b72d-3f8a243eed27.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 01:09:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":387797784,"title":"Vivek Ramaswamy turns to conservative youth to shape the movement’s next phase, analyzes 2026 races","text":"Ohio gubernatorial candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy warned conservatives not to take any political races for granted, including his own – and commented on what AmericaFest means for the future of the right as it draws in thousands of voters and activists, including youth.

We'll do those things.

Cheatle was forced to resign after severe criticism of her testimony to Congress about the Butler failures.\n\nEven though Ellis’ former agency is now led by Trump-appointed Secretary Kristi Noem and Secret Service Director Sean Curran, so far there has been no effort to settle the case out of court.\n\nRuling Preserves Ellis’ Core Allegations\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmit Sullivan ruled in late September that most of the claims in Ellis’ lawsuit could proceed. The decision, which RealClearPolitics is first to report, rejects the government’s motion to dismiss the case, clearing the path for legal discovery into allegations of systemic leadership failings, which Ellis argues enabled bias, stifled innovation, and endangered the agency’s mission.\n\nA graduate of The Citadel who was consistently awarded “exceeds expectations” ratings in his performance reviews, Ellis served on former President Joe Biden’s protective detail, the elite Counter Assault Team, and as an instructor at the Secret Service’s James J. Rowley Training Center on counter-surveillance and the use of drones. His role as the Secret Service point person for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers’ Association, a lobbying entity that offers legal services, retirement benefits, and other support, amplified his advocacy for racial equality. Ellis argues it also made him a target for Secret Service leadership.\n\nMultiple Secret Service shortcomings were evident in Butler on the day Trump was nearly killed, including the failure to detect the shooter’s drone in the air over the rally site. On the one-year anniversary of the Butler assassination attempt, the Secret Service announced reforms, including the creation of an Aviation and Airspace Security division “dedicated to maintaining the agency’s critical aerial monitoring capabilities.”\n\nEllis’ lawsuit detailing his experiences with Cheatle at the helm, which RCP reported on last year, reads like a case study of the agency leaders’ long-running tendency to engage in petty squabbles, favoritism, and retaliation instead of keeping its focus on the big picture – its mission of protecting presidents, vice presidents, Cabinet members, and former presidents.\n\nIn a detailed 63-page opinion, Sullivan determined that Ellis had sufficiently alleged civil rights violations.\n\nThe judge was unpersuaded by DHS attorneys’ arguments, including that Ellis didn’t truly suffer any adverse action because he never lost his salary and that he didn’t exhaust administrative remedies on his charges before filing suit.\n\nDHS attorneys also argued that federal employees are held to a higher standard than those in the private sector when it comes to experiencing adverse actions. Sullivan dismissed this last argument as one that has repeatedly failed in previous court decisions.\n\n“As discussed below,” the judge wrote, “this theory has been rejected by every judge on this court to have considered it.”\n\nEllis’ attorney, David Blum of Alan Lescht & Associates, P.C., told RCP: “We look forward to litigating the merits of this case.”\n\nThe Secret Service has declined comment on Ellis’ case and ignored several separate questions about the agency’s history of resisting efforts to implement an extensive aerial drone program and the readiness level of that program. Prior to the assassination attempts, the Secret Service had an aerial drone program, but it was limited in scope, sources told RCP.\n\n“As a matter of longstanding policy, the U.S. Secret Service does not comment on pending or proposed litigation,” a spokesperson told RCP last year. The agency did not respond to a request for comment on Sullivan’s ruling.\n\nThe lawsuit depicts a corrosive Secret Service culture in which leaders engage in intimidation, and supervisors ignore harassment reports, neglect investigations, and retaliate if personnel complain of mistreatment.\n\nEllis argues that Cheatle, then serving as the head of the Secret Service’s Office of Protective Operations, backed by human resource managers and other bureaucrats, blocked and retaliated against him for trying to transfer jobs to work full-time on a special drone project he was developing, according to three sources in the Secret Service community.\n\nSome of these agency officials, Ellis asserts, also retaliated against him for lodging complaints about personal and inaccurate attacks based on his perceived religion.\n\nCheatle and a group of senior Secret Service officials went to great lengths to prevent Ellis from serving in a key role in the Airspace Security Branch of the Secret Service’s Special Operations Division, which oversees the drone program, according to court records Ellis filed last year.\n\nInstead, the agency wanted to send him to the vice presidential detail to help provide security for Kamala Harris, her husband, and their extended family, and wouldn’t budge when he appealed the decision – even though the agency had formally listed the airspace position as “hard-to-staff.”\n\nEllis, who is black but eschews racial divisions, referring to himself as “American,” filed suit against DHS in April 2024 and amended the complaint in late July to outline a pattern of harassment. The lawsuit accuses agency officials of orchestrating an elaborate scheme, beginning in 2021, to undermine his career in retaliation for his efforts to transfer to an Airspace position. Ellis wanted the position so he could play a direct role in establishing and implementing “a special project involving drones,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nEllis’ lawsuit alleges that those who conspired against him include Cheatle; then-human resources head Susan Yarwood; Elizabeth Lewis, Yarwood’s then-deputy; then-Technical Services Division Assistant Director Darren Giacolleto; then-Human Resources supervisors Danielle Watson and Thomas Hamman; and others.\n\nSpecific Leadership Failures\n\nIncidents of harassment Ellis endured include:\n\nA fellow agent, whom the lawsuit identifies as Michael Hackney, allegedly used a training exercise to physically attack him and pulled a live weapon on him as a joke while he was working a protection detail. Ellis reported the incident to his superior, who took no action, telling him, “The juice isn’t worth the squeeze,” according to the lawsuit. Two years later, Hackney allegedly aggressively drove his SUV toward Ellis and his pregnant wife and one-year-old son as though he was going to run them over.\nAnother agent, who Ellis says witnessed the aggressive driving threat, warned him not to report Hackney because “that’s how some people joke.”\nEllis, a Christian, believes his complaints about Hackney, whom he said also misidentified him as Muslim and called him a “terrorist” based on his Islamic-sounding first name, contributed to his failure to land bids for two hard-to-staff positions in the agency’s Airspace branch, even though he argues he was eligible for both positions.\n\nThe lawsuit further alleges:\n\nA senior official acknowledged agency-wide racism and backed Ellis’ 2021 drone position bid, calling him the “number one selection,” but failed to counter Human Resources’ disqualification. Lewis and Yarwood deemed him ineligible despite his qualifications and the endorsement.\nAfter Ellis appealed that decision, Danielle Watson twisted his frustrated comment about the process “driving him to drink” into cynical claims that he admitted to abusing alcohol. Yarwood, after consulting Lewis, directed Watson to draft a memorandum falsely alleging Ellis admitted to drinking, family disputes, and related issues – proven false by video evidence. The agency then placed Ellis on administrative leave and forced him to surrender his gear while recommending a nine-month sobriety program. Those decisions were overturned shortly afterward, but nonetheless damaged Ellis’ reputation.\nCheatle supported the phony alcoholism narrative, recommending administrative leave and the sobriety program, and allegedly provided misleading statements in an affidavit about the sources of information that informed her decisions.\nGiacoletto denied Ellis’ appeal the day the agency imposed the administrative leave and was involved in the initial disqualification.\n\nA supervisor warned Ellis of “a lot of trouble” for pursuing grievances, while others told him that the real source of his troubles with the agency was his pro-drone advocacy.\n\nThese incidents, Ellis claims, reflect a Secret Service pattern of weaponizing human resources processes against those who complain of mistreatment, a similar refrain among numerous former agents and the lawyers who have represented them.\n\nConnections to Broader Secret Service Challenges\n\nDespite new leadership, the Secret Service has experienced a string of continued lapses and embarrassing incidents. As RCP first reported, two female officers were involved in a physical fight outside former President Obama’s D.C. residence; Secret Service officers also missed a Glock while screening bags at Trump’s Virginia golf course; a Uniformed Division officer fell asleep on the job and left his fully automatic rifle unattended while protecting the United Nations General Assembly in New York; and an agent openly celebrated Charlie Kirk’s assassination in a Facebook post. Trump’s detail also allowed protesters at a D.C. restaurant to get close to Trump and several of his top Cabinet members and taunt them.\n\nEllis’ lawsuit alleges that his blocked transfer to a leadership position in the drone program quite possibly hindered advancements that might have prevented the 2024 Trump assassination attempts. A Senate report on the Butler failures faulted Secret Service leaders for denying counter-drone requests and technical failures. Then-Acting Director Ronald Rowe admitted to lapses during congressional testimony last year.\n\nEllis himself ties the Butler failures to Cheatle and prior leaders’ DEI priorities, arguing they favored quotas over merit, eroding standards and morale and agent retention. As the discovery process proceeds, the case may force DHS to address these leadership decisions.\n\n“The relentless push by Secret Service leadership to meet diversity quotas has compromised our ability to meet our protectees’ needs,” Ellis said in a video posted on the Independent Women’s Forum website. IWF is a nonprofit conservative advocacy organization.\n\nDespite efforts to dismantle DEI under the current administration, Ellis cautions that it will take years for the agency to recover.\n\n“If we do not clean out the rot, our people – and our protectees – will pay the price,” he warned.","summary":"'Retaliation and discrimination' happened under management of Alejandro Mayorkas and Kimberly Cheatle","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/12/christian-secret-service-agents-lawsuit-biden-administration-behaviors/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/secret-service-agent-reflection.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 22:31:53","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":387848408,"title":"Can Josh Shapiro beat Kamala Harris?","text":"Kamala Harris addressed the Democratic National Committee last week with a new message: “Both parties have failed to hold the public’s trust.” When she mentioned “the future,” someone shouted “You!” Her book tour for “107 Days” expands to the critical early primary state South Carolina and cities with large Black populations that could give her an ironclad lead on “Super Tuesday.” Summer of Brat 2.0 approaches.\n\nAdrift in a “stuck culture” that has lost any sense of novelty, Americans willingly settle for reboots. We’ve turned our politics into our entertainment and our entertainment into our politics, and neither industry produces anything new. Harris leads the latest Big Data Poll at 31.1%, far ahead of Gavin Newsom (20.3%), Pete Buttigieg (10%), and Josh Shapiro (6.4%). The woman who lost every swing state remains the frontrunner because primary electorates would rather watch the sequel than risk something original.\n\nThe historical parallel isn’t flattering. Henry Clay ran for president three times and lost three times, earning the nickname “The Great Compromiser” for his willingness to compromise away victory. William Jennings Bryan managed three nominations and three defeats, his revival-tent populist orations no match for electoral math. Both men became “known quantities” for their loser parties (Clay for the Whigs, Bryan for the Democrats) in an era when familiarity bred nomination rather than contempt. Harris is considerably less eloquent than Bryan and considerably less skilled at dealmaking than Clay, but she has what they had and then some: infrastructure. Black voters determine most Democratic primaries, and she will be that coalition’s default standard-bearer.\n\nThis is Pennsylvania’s problem. Josh Shapiro polls at 60% approval in the state and beats JD Vance by ten points in hypothetical matchups. The Trump campaign feared him most among potential VP picks in 2024. A Pennsylvania farm family agreed to host “the governor” for a Harris campaign event, then pulled out when advance teams revealed it was Walz, not Shapiro. The governor who could deliver the Electoral College’s most important battleground sits at 4-6% nationally because he can’t match Harris’s name recognition with primary voters who don’t live here.\n\nShapiro’s strategy depends on engineering a 2026 gubernatorial blowout to prove he can turn Pennsylvania blue. He’s recruiting congressional candidates, clearing primary fields, remaking the state party apparatus. But even a landslide reelection to the state’s highest office – no guarantee in this purplest of places – won’t solve his fundamental problem: Shapiro can win Pennsylvania with the greatest of ease, but he almost certainly can’t win a national primary against someone the base already knows.\n\nHer rivals will cancel each other out anyway. Newsom remains too slick, a man who texts, “Hiking. Will call back,” when Harris phones on the day that Biden drops out. Harris included that anecdote in her memoir. He texted asking why. She replied: “On book tour. Get back to you later.” Two empty-headed Californians who can’t return each other’s calls competing to lose Pennsylvania. Buttigieg offers PowerPoint competence and the killer instincts of Barack Obama (read: none). Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has TikTok charisma in spades. None of them can consolidate what Harris already owns.\n\nSo Harris wins the primary and picks another Tim Walz. She’ll want someone deferential, someone who shows “no interest in himself, only how he could support Harris,” as the book “2024: How Trump Retook The White House And The Democrats Lost America” had described Walz’s interview. She’ll want someone who volunteers reasons not to pick them, who admits they’re “really nervous about the debate” and probably won’t “do well.” She’ll pick from a safe state that doesn’t matter electorally because that’s what she did last time and that’s what known quantities do.\n\nPennsylvanians like us will watch this happen. We’ll watch Harris tour South Carolina and Detroit while our governor, someone who could actually win here because he already has, languishes in single digits nationally. We’ll watch her pick a running mate from Minnesota or Illinois or somewhere else that votes Democratic regardless. We’ll watch her lose the state by two points again because “they/them” branding by the opposition will have her looking like an emissary from a foreign country even as her edited 60 Minutes interview reminds voters why Democrats kept her hidden during Biden’s presidency.\n\nThe promised counterargument is that Trump will leave Republicans in deplorable shape, structurally and financially, by 2028. Perhaps. But Vance actually comes from the Rust Belt and gutted out a tough Senate race in 2022 against center-left Tim Ryan. Harris, meanwhile, lost the Rust Belt and wrote a book about losing. Even against a weakened Republican field, the electoral college math remains unforgiving for someone who couldn’t carry a single swing state with a convicted felon as her opponent.\n\nBryan at least had a message: currency inflation, opposition to empire, defense of the common man. Clay had legislative achievements: the Missouri Compromise, the Compromise of 1850. Harris has coconut tree memes and vibes. These vibes were insufficient in 2024. Three more years of book tours won’t change the fundamentals. Even so, Democrats will nominate the known quantity, skip over the Pennsylvania governor who could actually deliver the state, and watch Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes slip away once more.\n\nAnother tired reboot nobody ordered approaches. The SNL skits and breathless mainstream media coverage will be familiar. So will the ending.","summary":"'The woman who lost every swing state remains the frontrunner because primary electorates would rather watch the sequel than risk something original'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/12/can-josh-shapiro-beat-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/kamala-harris-smiling-flag.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 22:07:36","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":387798954,"title":"Instead of Trump’s ‘A+++++’ economy, even the chamber of commerce in this swing-state city admits it’s not robust ","text":"About three years later, she is deeply disappointed.\n\n“It’s worse than ever,” the 67-year-old retiree, who relies on Social Security, said when asked about the economy. “The prices are high. Everything is going up. You can’t afford food because you can’t afford rent. Utilities are too high. Gas is too expensive. Everything is too expensive.”\n\nBisbal was sipping an afternoon coffee at the Hamilton Family Restaurant not long after Vice President JD Vance rallied Republicans in a nearby suburb. In the Trump administration’s second high-profile trip to Pennsylvania in a week, Vance acknowledged the affordability crisis, blamed it on the Biden administration and insisted better times were ahead. He later served food to men experiencing homelessness in Allentown.\n\nThe visit, on top of several recent speeches from President Donald Trump, reflects an increasingly urgent White House effort to respond to the economic anxiety that is gripping both parties. Those worries are a vulnerability for Republicans in competitive congressional districts like the one that includes Allentown, which could decide control of the U.S. House in next year’s midterms.\n\nBut in confronting the challenge, there are risks of appearing out of touch.\n\nOnly 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 40% in March, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet Trump has called affordability concerns a “ hoax ” and gave the economy under his administration a grade of “A+++++.” Vance reiterated that assessment during his rally, prompting Bisbal to scoff.\n\n“In his world,” Bisbal, a self-described “straight-up Democrat,” responded. “In the rich man’s world. In our world, trust me, it’s not an ‘A.’ To me, it’s an ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F.’”\n\nAgreement that prices are too high\n\nWith a population of roughly 125,000 people, Allentown anchors the Lehigh Valley, which is Pennsylvania’s third-largest metro area. In a dozen interviews this week with local officials, business leaders and residents of both parties, there was agreement on one thing: Prices are too high. Some pointed to gas prices while others said they felt the shock more at the grocery store or in their cost of health care or housing.\n\nFew shared Trump’s unbridled boosterism about the economy.\n\nTony Iannelli, the president and CEO of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, called Trump’s grade a “stretch,” saying “we have a strong economy but I think it’s not yet gone to the next stage of what I would call robust.”\n\nTom Groves, who started a health and benefits consulting firm more than two decades ago, said the economy was at a “B+” as he blamed the Affordable Care Act, widely known as “Obamacare,” for contributing to higher health costs and he noted stock and labor market volatility. Joe Vichot, the chairman of the Lehigh County Republican Committee, referred to Trump’s grade as a “colloquialism.”\n\nFar removed from Washington’s political theater, there was little consensus on who was responsible for the high prices or what should be done about it. There was, however, an acute sense of exhaustion at the seemingly endless political combat.\n\nPat Gallagher was finishing lunch a few booths down from Bisbal as she recalled meeting her late husband when they both worked at Bethlehem Steel, the manufacturing giant that closed in 2003. Now retired, she, too, relies on Social Security benefits and lives with her daughter, which helps keep costs down. She said she noticed the rising price of groceries and was becoming exasperated with the political climate.\n\n“I get so frustrated with hearing about the politics,” she said.\n\nAllentown has a front-row seat to politics\n\nThat feeling is understandable in a place that often gets a front-row seat to the national debate, whether it wants the view or not. Singer Billy Joel’s 1982 song “Allentown” helped elevate the city into the national consciousness, articulating simultaneous feelings of disillusionment and hope as factories shuttered.\n\nIn the decades since, Pennsylvania has become a must-win state in presidential politics and the backdrop for innumerable visits from candidates and the media. Trump and his Democratic rival in 2024, Kamala Harris, made several campaign swings through Allentown, with the then-vice president visiting the city on the eve of the election.\n\n“Every race here, all the time,” Allentown’s mayor, Democrat Matt Tuerk, recalled of the frenzied race last year.\n\nThe pace of those visits — and the attention they garnered — has not faded from many minds. Some businesses and residents declined to talk this week when approached with questions about the economy or politics, recalling blowback from speaking in the past.\n\nBut as attention shifts to next year’s midterms, Allentown cannot escape its place as a political battleground.\n\nTrump’s win last year helped lift other Republicans, like U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, to victory. Mackenzie, who unseated a three-term Democrat, is now one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. To win again, he must turn out the Republicans who voted in 2024 — many of whom were likely more energized by Trump’s candidacy — while appealing to independents.\n\nMackenzie’s balancing act was on display when he spoke to the party faithful on Tuesday, bemoaning the “failures of Bidenomics” before Vance took the stage at the rally. A day later, the congressman was back in Washington, where he joined three other House Republicans to rebel against the party’s leadership and force a vote on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.\n\nVichot, the local GOP chairman, called Mackenzie an “underdog” in his reelection bid and said the health care move was a signal to voters that he is “compassionate for the people who need those services.”\n\nA swing to Trump in 2024\n\nLehigh County, home to Allentown and the most populous county in the congressional district, swung toward Trump last year. Harris’ nearly 2.7 percentage point win in the county was the tightest margin for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2004. But Democrats are feeling confident after a strong performance in this fall’s elections when they handily won a race for county executive.\n\nRetaking the congressional seat is now a top priority for Democrats. Gov. Josh Shapiro, who faces reelection next year and is a potential presidential contender in 2028, endorsed firefighter union head Bob Brooks this week for the May primary.\n\nDemocrats are just a few seats shy of regaining the House majority and the first midterm after a presidential election historically favors the party that’s out of power. If the focus remains on the economy, Democrats are happy.\n\nThe Uline supplies distribution factory where Vance spoke, owned by a family that has made large donations to GOP causes, is a few miles from the Mack Trucks facility where staff was cut by about 200 employees this year. The company said that decision was driven in part by tariffs imposed by Trump. Shapiro eagerly pointed that out in responding to Vance’s visit.\n\nBut the image of Allentown as a purely manufacturing town is outdated. The downtown core is dotted by row homes, trendy hotels and a modern arena that is home to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms hockey team and hosts concerts by major artists. In recent years, Latinos have become a majority of the city’s population, driven by gains in the Puerto Rican, Mexican and Dominican communities.\n\n“This is a place of rapid change,” said Tuerk, the city’s first Latino mayor. “It’s constantly changing and I think over the next three years until that next presidential election, we’re going to see a lot more change. It’s going to be an interesting ride.”","summary":"Only 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 40% in March, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/12/20/trump-economy-cost-of-living-pennsylvania-chamber-of-commerce-affordability-midterms/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25352486430254-e1766251072292.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 17:23:32","author":"Steven Sloan,The Associated Press","authors":["Steven Sloan","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":387881912,"title":"The New New York GOP (Likely) Nominee for Governor Has Potential, but He Needs to Start Raising Money","text":"Friday was a big day in New York politics, as has been reported by RedState. \n\nRepublican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (NY-21) dramatically announced that she was abandoning her race for governor. This leaves Bruce Blakeman, the two-term Nassau County Executive, as the likely nominee for the Republicans. Especially with the decision of the New York Republican Chairman Ed Cox to back Blakeman after Stefanik left the race, and New York’s Conservative Party Chairman, Jerry Kassar, to echo his support. \n\nThe reasons for Rep. Stefanik’s decision seem obvious. The 2025 elections had not gone well for the GOP, including in neighboring New Jersey, as the TDS-afflicted Democrat voters had shown they were willing to climb over broken glass to stick it to President Trump by voting for any particular Democrat, no matter what that Democrat’s personal qualities (e.g., they would vote for a yellow dog over a Republican). And New York is even more solidly Democrat than New Jersey. Also, as Stefanik said, Blakeman’s decision to challenge Stefanik for the nomination meant that even if she won the primary race – as most polling showed she would – this would inevitably distract her, build her negatives, and drain her campaign fund. \n\nThe question now becomes, where does this leave the GOP in the campaign? \n\nRep. Stefanik’s decision certainly may be a net negative for the GOP. As my normally pessimistic conservative buddy Cameron argues, Stefanik was much better known statewide, had charisma, had a big campaign warchest, and was energetically campaigning for the office for the past few months (both unofficially and then officially). She was more conservative and youthful (she is forty and looks younger). \n\nStefanik also had been steadily appealing to the big donors (i.e., those who could afford to create super PACs to support her). \n\nHowever, I tend to think Rep. Stefanik’s decision is a net positive for the GOP IF Bruce Blakeman can raise the necessary funding. Blakeman has executive experience, comes from a more politically critical area, is not tied to Washington, D.C., is less tied to the president, is considered more moderate (he is pro-choice), and at 70 years old is more distinguished (but not too old) to serve as a governor. \n\nAll of this should give him greater appeal to independents and soft Democrats who are disgruntled with incumbent Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul. But let me explain in more depth.\n\n Although Bruce Blakeman spent many years as a perennial candidate, often used to contest elections where the GOP wanted someone on the ballot but didn’t expect to win, he revitalized himself by upsetting the incumbent Democrat Nassau County Executive in 2021. He then won a second term with 56 percent of the vote in 2025, while other Republicans throughout the state and nation were getting badly beaten. His victory had coattails, as the GOP candidates notched an 11-0 record in contested executive branch races in Nassau and held onto the county legislature. \n\nIn 2025, Blakeman campaigned on his fiscal conservatism, his tax cuts, his tough on crime approach, which saw a reduction in the crime rate, and as a foe of the Communist Radical Muslim (CRM), Zohran Mamdani:\n\n“Most of the television commercials that they put up were all about ‘Mamdani, Mamdani, democratic socialists,’” Nassau Democratic Chair Jay Jacobs said. “Their tagline was, in effect, ‘Vote Republican and save Nassau County from becoming a socialist county.’ That plays well with a moderate audience.”\n\nBlakeman also made excellent use of other wedge issues by taking a tough stance to ban biological males from playing on female sports teams, striking a deal with ICE to round up illegals, and signing a mask ban bill that punishes the left-wing rioters attacking Jews and others on college campuses and elsewhere. \n\nBlakeman is a Jewish American, and Jews make up about 10 percent of the state of New York. The Jewish community, which is ancestrally a Democrat voting bloc, is uniquely in play this year. \n\nIn 2024, President Trump won 45 percent of New York Jews, an increase from his 30 percent in 2020. This is due largely to Trump’s unique record as well as the craziness of the Democrats, whose Antifa shock troops are literally rioting on the streets, demanding the globalization of the intifada, and voting for the CRM. \n\nBlakeman also represents the most politically crucial county in New York. Nassau is the sixth most populous county in the state. Already, the GOP does well throughout much of upstate. Stefanik’s district is there, and it is solidly Republican. Meanwhile, the Democrats have a huge edge in New York City, which means that the independent counties of Long Island, Nassau, and Suffolk (the fourth most populous) must be won for any statewide GOP victory. And Nassau is the more diverse and left-wing of the two, with a 70,000-voter edge for the Democrats. \n\nBlakeman has already made clear what issues he plans to campaign on in 2026. As in 2025, he vows to run on fiscal conservatism, lowering taxes, and opposing sanctuary for illegal aliens. He will spotlight the evils of the CRM and Gov. Hochul’s endorsement of him. And he will focus on affordability and quality of life. In his Facebook announcement, Blakeman said:\n\nOur state is struggling under policies that have driven up taxes, utility bills, and crime. It’s time for a proven leader who will Put New York First. New Yorkers deserve leadership that works — not more empty promises. I’m ready to take on Kathy Hochul and get results for our families.\n\nThe Democrats, of course, will follow their game plan from 2025 and run against Trump. However, they tried this against Blakeman in 2025, and it didn’t work for them then, despite Blakeman refusing to distance himself from the president. \n\nBlakeman still faces a steep challenge winning statewide, however. New York voted for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris for president in 2024 by around 13 percentage points - although that marked a rightward shift from 2020. The keys to his winning this race will probably be: \n\n1) Gov. Hochul’s record and political weakness\n\n2) The CRM’s record\n\n3) Blakeman’s fundraising \n\nUnlike in New Jersey and Virginia in 2025, in New York in 2026, the incumbent Democrat governor is seeking reelection and is herself unpopular. She is also facing a challenge from her own Lt. Governor (although I suspect the Democrats will unite around her now). And the CRM has started early with his left-wing communist utopian fiscal buffoonery, and it doesn’t seem to be able to temper his Jew-bating and his fondness for Islamist terrorists. \n\nWhich just leaves the fundraising. \n\nBlakeman needs to raise money, big time. In 2025, he did very well, but that was as the sitting County Executive who was favored to win re-election in that county. Now, he is the underdog, and Blakeman himself is not independently wealthy enough to fund his own campaign. \n\nIf I were Bruce Blakeman, I would be dialing donors nonstop, starting today. \n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Such a contest would also pit two younger figures against each other – with Shapiro at 52 and Vance at 41 — while also potentially reshaping the idea of the \"blue wall\" that Trump shattered in 2024 as Shapiro’s name recognition in Pennsylvania could return the state to the Democrats’ column.

Speaking about the future of post-Trump conservatism, Nick said he expects a lot of competing yet largely ideologically unified voices. \"I think the conservative party will kind of conglomerate over somebody like Trump. I think Trump's going to have a very big hand and who's going to be the nominee in 2028. But I think the conservative [movement] is still going to be alive.

His ability to reach non-partisan voters who felt left behind and ignored with his “alcoholic’s personality” did her in.\n\n“Trump’s victory came from his ability to connect emotionally with these low-partisan voters — speaking to their frustrations, their sense of being left behind, their distrust of institutions,” said Buchanan, the founder of Cygnal polling.\n\nOur weekly White House Report Card graders echoed what America felt about the president’s week.\n\nConservative analyst Jed Babbin graded the week a “B,” and concluded, “All in all, a very good week punctuated by some miserable events.” Democratic pollster John Zogby joked about being in the prone position and dished an “F,” pointing to the president’s statement on Truth Social about the Reiner slaying and the new Kennedy Center name of “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nTRUMP WARNS OF JANUARY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER OBAMACARE DURING NORTH CAROLINA SPEECH\n\nThis was a pretty wild week for President Donald Trump and his crew, with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in a revealing Vanity Fair interview, blocking oil tankers to Venezuela, raiding an Iran-bound freighter, and vague security guarantees for Ukraine. And a lot more.\n\nWiles should have expected a display of Trump Derangement Syndrome from VF, and that’s what she got. Her quotes that Trump has an “alcoholic’s personality,” Vice President JD Vance is a “conspiracy theorist,” and Elon Musk is a drug abuser were startling and newsworthy. She should never have agreed to the series of 11 interviews. It was a rookie error.\n\nTrump’s quarantine — not a blockade — of sanctioned oil tankers going to Venezuela may be a good thing. It might force out Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro eventually but so far he hasn’t budged. It’ll take more to get him out. Trump is thinking about an invasion, but risking U.S. lives in such a venture isn’t worthwhile. It was very strange that Trump made no mention of Venezuela in his prime-time speech on Wednesday night.\n\nThree Americans — two soldiers from the Iowa National Guard and a translator — were killed in Syria by a member of the Syrian security forces. The U.S. struck back Friday with a massive hit on the Islamic State. Why do we still have troops in Syria anyhow?\n\nThe raid on an Iran-bound ship from China (probably by Navy SEALs) seized military equipment, according to several news sources. The Iranians squawked but the Chinese didn’t. It was a good op.\n\nThe U.S. guarantees of Ukrainian security are entirely vague and may not amount to much. Russian President Vladimir Putin won’t buy them anyway, and peace for Ukraine seems very far off. Peace in the Gaza Strip seems equally distant, with Hamas refusing to disarm. For all of Trump’s peace-making successes, these two conflicts seem beyond him. And other peace ventures seem to be very fragile.\n\nInflation was down to 2.7%. Unemployment was up a bit, but it wasn’t significant. All in all, a very good week punctuated by some miserable events. \n\nTRUMP PARDONS AND COMMUTATIONS: NOTABLE ACTS OF CLEMENCY IN HIS SECOND TERM\n\nJust too much going this week, so let’s start with the obvious. President Donald Trump’s grade is an “F.”\n\nWe begin with his reprehensible, inhuman, narcissistic whine in his comments about the horrible tragedy that befell Rob Reiner, his wife, and his family.\n\nSecond, Trump shifted his narcissism all the way over to the other end of the spectrum by welcoming his hand-picked board at the Kennedy Center to rename it the “Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” These honors are normally bestowed after someone leaves office or passes from the scene. By allowing this to happen, it is clear that Trump is collecting his honors upfront. Maybe he doesn’t think he will be in office much longer? Pure speculation on my part. It doesn’t affect his grade at all.\n\nBut perhaps the strangest thing that happened this week was the Vanity Fair interview with chief of staff Susie Wiles. It is not entirely what she said — as in referring to the president’s “alcoholic’s personality,” the vice president as a conspiracist, and Deputy Chief Stephen Miller as a zealot — or how she said it, but why she said it. Wiles is no naive country girl easily manipulated by a reporter. Was she looking for a big book deal? Is she preparing an imminent departure for either herself or Trump? Or was she merely asserting earlier than most that his whole thing is not her fault. I am not usually prone to conspiracy theories (though at times watching this administration, I find myself in a prone position), but, wow, this is all just so weird.\n\nInflation is either going down or going up. The public chooses up. Unemployment is going up, although the entire process of collecting data is simply a mess.\n\nBut this week, it was all about Rob Reiner and his family and a Trump response that was just wrong.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nJed Babbin is a Washington Examiner contributor and former deputy undersecretary of defense in the administration of former President George H.W.

Before the Presidential elections last year, the Republican made the same offensive remark about Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nMore recently, in November, he went on a Truth Social rant and addressed Tim Walz by using the slur.\n\nThe post drew criticism from across the world, as analysts found that use of the offensive term on social media rose following Trump’s statement.\n\nAccording to the researchers at Montclair State University, 1.1 million posts containing the slur were shared on X within a week of the President’s post.\n\nTo make matters worse, many of these promoted the use of the word and did not deem it offensive. But instead of backtracking and apologizing, Trump doubled down on his statement.\n\nDuring an interaction with the press, Trump was asked about his use of the offensive slur for Walz.\n\nIn response, the President said, “Yeah, I think there’s something wrong with him, absolutely, sure. I think there’s something wrong with him.”\n\nHe added, “Anybody that would do what he did, anybody that would allow those people into a state and pay billions of dollars [to] Somalia — we give billions of dollars to Somalia. It’s not even a country, because it doesn’t function like a country. It’s got a name, but it doesn’t function like a country. Yeah, there’s something wrong with Walz.”\n\nAnd it looks like the POTUS still hasn’t learn his lesson. Despite his statement leading to an increase in the use of the R-word on social media, Trump continues to let it slip.\n\nConsidering the influence he has over the world, we can only hope he acts a little more responsibly while choosing his words.","summary":"Donald Trump seemingly blurted out an offensive term during using a recent speech... again!","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-seemingly-corrects-himself-after-uttering-offensive-slur-netizens-call-it-a-system-crash-in-human-form","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-2025-12-20T153935.601.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 14:33:30","author":"Jashandeep Singh","authors":["Jashandeep Singh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.399},{"id":387815596,"title":"Trump’s ‘A+++++' economy collides with reality in a Pennsylvania city critical to the midterms - AP News","text":"ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — When Idalia Bisbal moved to this Pennsylvania city synonymous with America’s working class, she hoped for a cheaper, easier life than the one she was leaving behind in her hometown of New York City.\n\nAbout three years later, she is deeply disappointed. \n\n“It’s worse than ever,” the 67-year-old retiree, who relies on Social Security, said when asked about the economy. “The prices are high. Everything is going up. You can’t afford food because you can’t afford rent. Utilities are too high. Gas is too expensive. Everything is too expensive.” \n\nBisbal was sipping an afternoon coffee at the Hamilton Family Restaurant not long after Vice President JD Vance rallied Republicans in a nearby suburb. In the Trump administration’s second high-profile trip to Pennsylvania in a week, Vance acknowledged the affordability crisis, blamed it on the Biden administration and insisted better times were ahead. He later served food to men experiencing homelessness in Allentown. \n\nThe visit, on top of several recent speeches from President Donald Trump, reflects an increasingly urgent White House effort to respond to the economic anxiety that is gripping both parties. Those worries are a vulnerability for Republicans in competitive congressional districts like the one that includes Allentown, which could decide control of the U.S. House in next year’s midterms.\n\nBut in confronting the challenge, there are risks of appearing out of touch.\n\nOnly 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, down from 40% in March, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet Trump has called affordability concerns a “ hoax ” and gave the economy under his administration a grade of “A+++++.” Vance reiterated that assessment during his rally, prompting Bisbal to scoff.\n\n“In his world,” Bisbal, a self-described “straight-up Democrat,” responded. “In the rich man’s world. In our world, trust me, it’s not an ‘A.’ To me, it’s an ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F,’ ‘F.’”\n\nAgreement that prices are too high\n\nWith a population of roughly 125,000 people, Allentown anchors the Lehigh Valley, which is Pennsylvania’s third-largest metro area. In a dozen interviews this week with local officials, business leaders and residents of both parties, there was agreement on one thing: Prices are too high. Some pointed to gas prices while others said they felt the shock more at the grocery store or in their cost of health care or housing. \n\nFew shared Trump’s unbridled boosterism about the economy. \n\nTony Iannelli, the president and CEO of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, called Trump’s grade a “stretch,” saying “we have a strong economy but I think it’s not yet gone to the next stage of what I would call robust.” \n\nTom Groves, who started a health and benefits consulting firm more than two decades ago, said the economy was at a “B+” as he blamed the Affordable Care Act, widely known as “Obamacare,” for contributing to higher health costs and he noted stock and labor market volatility. Joe Vichot, the chairman of the Lehigh County Republican Committee, referred to Trump’s grade as a “colloquialism.”\n\nFar removed from Washington’s political theater, there was little consensus on who was responsible for the high prices or what should be done about it. There was, however, an acute sense of exhaustion at the seemingly endless political combat. \n\nPat Gallagher was finishing lunch a few booths down from Bisbal as she recalled meeting her late husband when they both worked at Bethlehem Steel, the manufacturing giant that closed in 2003. Now retired, she, too, relies on Social Security benefits and lives with her daughter, which helps keep costs down. She said she noticed the rising price of groceries and was becoming exasperated with the political climate. \n\n“I get so frustrated with hearing about the politics,” she said. \n\nAllentown has a front-row seat to politics \n\nThat feeling is understandable in a place that often gets a front-row seat to the national debate, whether it wants the view or not. Singer Billy Joel’s 1982 song “Allentown” helped elevate the city into the national consciousness, articulating simultaneous feelings of disillusionment and hope as factories shuttered.\n\nIn the decades since, Pennsylvania has become a must-win state in presidential politics and the backdrop for innumerable visits from candidates and the media. Trump and his Democratic rival in 2024, Kamala Harris, made several campaign swings through Allentown, with the then-vice president visiting the city on the eve of the election. \n\n“Every race here, all the time,” Allentown’s mayor, Democrat Matt Tuerk, recalled of the frenzied race last year.\n\nThe pace of those visits — and the attention they garnered — has not faded from many minds. Some businesses and residents declined to talk this week when approached with questions about the economy or politics, recalling blowback from speaking in the past. \n\nBut as attention shifts to next year’s midterms, Allentown cannot escape its place as a political battleground.\n\nTrump’s win last year helped lift other Republicans, like U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, to victory. Mackenzie, who unseated a three-term Democrat, is now one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. To win again, he must turn out the Republicans who voted in 2024 — many of whom were likely more energized by Trump’s candidacy — while appealing to independents.\n\nMackenzie’s balancing act was on display when he spoke to the party faithful on Tuesday, bemoaning the “failures of Bidenomics” before Vance took the stage at the rally. A day later, the congressman was back in Washington, where he joined three other House Republicans to rebel against the party’s leadership and force a vote on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.\n\nVichot, the local GOP chairman, called Mackenzie an “underdog” in his reelection bid and said the health care move was a signal to voters that he is “compassionate for the people who need those services.”\n\nA swing to Trump in 2024\n\nLehigh County, home to Allentown and the most populous county in the congressional district, swung toward Trump last year. Harris’ nearly 2.7 percentage point win in the county was the tightest margin for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2004. But Democrats are feeling confident after a strong performance in this fall’s elections when they handily won a race for county executive. \n\nRetaking the congressional seat is now a top priority for Democrats. Gov. Josh Shapiro, who faces reelection next year and is a potential presidential contender in 2028, endorsed firefighter union head Bob Brooks this week for the May primary.\n\nDemocrats are just a few seats shy of regaining the House majority and the first midterm after a presidential election historically favors the party that’s out of power. If the focus remains on the economy, Democrats are happy. \n\nThe Uline supplies distribution factory where Vance spoke, owned by a family that has made large donations to GOP causes, is a few miles from the Mack Trucks facility where staff was cut by about 200 employees this year. The company said that decision was driven in part by tariffs imposed by Trump. Shapiro eagerly pointed that out in responding to Vance’s visit.\n\nBut the image of Allentown as a purely manufacturing town is outdated. The downtown core is dotted by row homes, trendy hotels and a modern arena that is home to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms hockey team and hosts concerts by major artists. In recent years, Latinos have become a majority of the city’s population, driven by gains in the Puerto Rican, Mexican and Dominican communities. \n\n“This is a place of rapid change,” said Tuerk, the city’s first Latino mayor. “It’s constantly changing and I think over the next three years until that next presidential election, we’re going to see a lot more change. It’s going to be an interesting ride.”","summary":"Trump’s ‘A+++++' economy collides with reality in a Pennsylvania city critical to the midterms  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-economy-2026-election-allentown-republicans-ccfc8351c2c081693ce763c1be34e749","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/2106d16/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4967x3311+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ffd%2Fb7%2F24604efa620ca8741757c0957c30%2Fd32cb36a49624968a90dc72414b0add1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 14:06:00","author":"Steven Sloan","authors":["Steven Sloan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":387808796,"title":"Photos of Bill Clinton feature prominently in first batch of newly released Epstein files","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton featured prominently in the first batch of files released Friday by the Justice Department stemming from its investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as the White House seized the chance to shift the focus of the highly anticipated documents from President Donald Trump.\n\nThere were several photos of Clinton among the thousands of documents made public. Some showed him on a private plane, including one with a woman, whose face is redacted, seated alongside him with her arm around him. Another photo shows him in a pool with Epstein’s longtime confidant, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and a person whose face was also redacted.\n\nAnother photo shows Clinton in a hot tub with a woman whose face was redacted. The files do not say when or where the photos were taken and there was little context surrounding them.\n\nThe 79-year-old Clinton’s political career has been marred by personal scandals in the past and his impeachment in 1998. His association with Epstein and Maxwell in the late 1990s and early 2000s is well documented and the images released Friday are just a slice of the “several hundred thousand” documents Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has said are tied to the investigation.\n\nBut the photos depict a web of unsavory relationships and associations that complicate both Democratic efforts to keep the focus on Trump and the incumbent president’s desire to move on from the issue entirely.\n\nAfter the photos were released, several White House officials, including press secretary Karoline Leavitt and top aide Steven Cheung, made social media posts highlighting them. Trump didn’t talk about the issue as he left the White House late Friday on his way to deliver a speech in North Carolina.\n\nClinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone’s name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise. In a statement, Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said the White House was “shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever.”\n\n“They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton,” Ureña said. “Never has been, never will be.”\n\nRepublicans have zeroed in on Clinton\n\nLong before Friday’s photos, Republicans had zeroed in on the former president and his association with Epstein.\n\nRepublicans on the House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed both Bill and Hillary Clinton for depositions earlier this year, but received a response that the Clintons wanted to provide a written statement of what “little information” they had on Epstein.\n\nThe Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer, has demanded they appear for in-person testimonies and threatened to initiate contempt of Congress proceedings if they don’t.\n\nMultiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before Congress, but none has been compelled to do so.\n\nWhen Clinton was president, Epstein visited the White House multiple times, visitor logs show. After he left office, Epstein assisted with some of the former president’s philanthropy. Clinton flew multiple times on Epstein’s private jet, including on a humanitarian trip to Africa with actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker in 2002.\n\nClinton first ran for president in 1992 as a new type of Democrat, hailing from the South with an appeal that united his party’s base along with moderate voters. He became the first Democrat in 16 years to win the White House and remains one of his party’s most prominent figures. He had a prime-time speaking slot during last summer’s Democratic National Convention in which he made a forceful case for Kamala Harris’ candidacy.\n\nBut Clinton’s ties to the Epstein case are a reminder of how his political promise has always been tempered by personal indiscretions.\n\nHis 1992 campaign was dogged by rumors of an affair with Gennifer Flowers, which he denied at the time. His presidency was rocked when he was impeached in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice when he denied engaging in a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He ultimately acknowledged a relationship with Lewinsky that was “not appropriate” while insisting that “even presidents have private lives.”\n\nTrump, whose 2016 campaign was nearly derailed when a tape emerged of him bragging about grabbing women by the genitals, has often deflected allegations of sexual misconduct by pointing to Clinton’s behavior. But even Trump’s top allies have questioned those claims. In an interview published by Vanity Fair this week, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said Trump “was wrong” in frequently suggesting the Epstein files included incriminating information about Clinton.\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves and Gary Fields in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"There were several photos of Clinton among the thousands of documents made public.\n\n\nThe post Photos of Bill Clinton feature prominently in first batch of newly released Epstein files appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/12/20/photos-of-bill-clinton-feature-prominently-in-first-batch-of-newly-released-epstein-files/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Justice_Department_Jeffrey_Epstein_71674-6945e9eeba7fa-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 14:06:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":387795922,"title":"Trump’s ‘A+++++’ economy collides with the reality in a Pennsylvania city critical to the midterms","text":"ALLENTOWN, Pa.

Some pointed to gas prices while others said they felt the shock more at the grocery store or in their cost of health care or housing.\n\nFew shared Trump’s unbridled boosterism about the economy.\n\nTony Iannelli, the president and CEO of the Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, called Trump’s grade a “stretch,” saying “we have a strong economy but I think it’s not yet gone to the next stage of what I would call robust.”\n\nTom Groves, who started a health and benefits consulting firm more than two decades ago, said the economy was at a “B+” as he blamed the Affordable Care Act, widely known as “Obamacare,” for contributing to higher health costs and he noted stock and labor market volatility. Joe Vichot, the chairman of the Lehigh County Republican Committee, referred to Trump’s grade as a “colloquialism.”\n\nFar removed from Washington’s political theater, there was little consensus on who was responsible for the high prices or what should be done about it. There was, however, an acute sense of exhaustion at the seemingly endless political combat.\n\nPat Gallagher was finishing lunch a few booths down from Bisbal as she recalled meeting her late husband when they both worked at Bethlehem Steel, the manufacturing giant that closed in 2003. Now retired, she, too, relies on Social Security benefits and lives with her daughter, which helps keep costs down. She said she noticed the rising price of groceries and was becoming exasperated with the political climate.\n\n“I get so frustrated with hearing about the politics,” she said.\n\nAllentown has a front-row seat to politics\n\nThat feeling is understandable in a place that often gets a front-row seat to the national debate, whether it wants the view or not. Singer Billy Joel’s 1982 song “Allentown” helped elevate the city into the national consciousness, articulating simultaneous feelings of disillusionment and hope as factories shuttered.\n\nIn the decades since, Pennsylvania has become a must-win state in presidential politics and the backdrop for innumerable visits from candidates and the media. Trump and his Democratic rival in 2024, Kamala Harris, made several campaign swings through Allentown, with the then-vice president visiting the city on the eve of the election.\n\n“Every race here, all the time,” Allentown’s mayor, Democrat Matt Tuerk, recalled of the frenzied race last year.\n\nThe pace of those visits — and the attention they garnered — has not faded from many minds. Some businesses and residents declined to talk this week when approached with questions about the economy or politics, recalling blowback from speaking in the past.\n\nBut as attention shifts to next year’s midterms, Allentown cannot escape its place as a political battleground.\n\nTrump’s win last year helped lift other Republicans, like U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, to victory. Mackenzie, who unseated a three-term Democrat, is now one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress. To win again, he must turn out the Republicans who voted in 2024 — many of whom were likely more energized by Trump’s candidacy — while appealing to independents.\n\nMackenzie’s balancing act was on display when he spoke to the party faithful on Tuesday, bemoaning the “failures of Bidenomics” before Vance took the stage at the rally. A day later, the congressman was back in Washington, where he joined three other House Republicans to rebel against the party’s leadership and force a vote on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.\n\nVichot, the local GOP chairman, called Mackenzie an “underdog” in his reelection bid and said the health care move was a signal to voters that he is “compassionate for the people who need those services.”\n\nA swing to Trump in 2024\n\nLehigh County, home to Allentown and the most populous county in the congressional district, swung toward Trump last year. Harris’ nearly 2.7 percentage point win in the county was the tightest margin for a Democratic presidential candidate since 2004. But Democrats are feeling confident after a strong performance in this fall’s elections when they handily won a race for county executive.\n\nRetaking the congressional seat is now a top priority for Democrats. Gov. Josh Shapiro, who faces reelection next year and is a potential presidential contender in 2028, endorsed firefighter union head Bob Brooks this week for the May primary.\n\nDemocrats are just a few seats shy of regaining the House majority and the first midterm after a presidential election historically favors the party that’s out of power. If the focus remains on the economy, Democrats are happy.\n\nThe Uline supplies distribution factory where Vance spoke, owned by a family that has made large donations to GOP causes, is a few miles from the Mack Trucks facility where staff was cut by about 200 employees this year. The company said that decision was driven in part by tariffs imposed by Trump. Shapiro eagerly pointed that out in responding to Vance’s visit.\n\nBut the image of Allentown as a purely manufacturing town is outdated. The downtown core is dotted by row homes, trendy hotels and a modern arena that is home to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms hockey team and hosts concerts by major artists. In recent years, Latinos have become a majority of the city’s population, driven by gains in the Puerto Rican, Mexican and Dominican communities.\n\n“This is a place of rapid change,” said Tuerk, the city’s first Latino mayor. “It’s constantly changing and I think over the next three years until that next presidential election, we’re going to see a lot more change. It’s going to be an interesting ride.”","url":"https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/12/20/trumps-a-economy-collides-with-reality-in-a-pennsylvania-city-critical-to-the-midterms/","image":"https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Election_2026_Economy_30254-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 13:03:34","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":387883138,"title":"Week in Politics: MAGA activists in Phoenix; Trump's address; Democrats face 2024 loss","text":"SCOTT SIMON, HOST: \n\n Thousands of conservatives meet in Phoenix this weekend for a Turning Point USA conference. It is the group's largest assembly since its founder, Charlie Kirk, was assassinated in September, and the event has highlighted growing divisions in what's called the MAGA movement. NPR senior contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.\n\nSIMON: The podcaster Ben Shapiro took the podium and blasted other speakers to come as, quote, \"frauds and grifters.\" And later, Tucker Carlson said that Shapiro was pompous. Is this contention over what conservatism ought to be post-Trump?\n\nELVING: There's a highly specific leadership vacuum here. Charlie Kirk is gone, and no one has begun to replace him. His wife, Erika, has taken a high-profile role after her husband's death, but she does not yet have the mobilizing power her husband had. Neither does anyone else, which is why we see this leadership struggle between the would-be champions of different elements in the MAGA movement. Charlie Kirk could reach most all of them and provide a point of connection for them. That includes those who are most supportive of Israel and those most suspicious of Israel. The danger for the movement is that this highly visible fighting brings down the big tent. It reduces the appeal for younger voters as well as some Hispanics and African Americans. A squabbling party is a less-inviting party.\n\nSIMON: Of course, all is not amity among Democrats. Reports this week that party leaders will not publicly release the autopsy of why they lost the 2024 presidential election. What are the divisions here?\n\nELVING: The same need for unity applies to Democrats, and it has been historically elusive for Democrats. Tactically speaking, their 2024 was a disaster because when the incumbent Joe Biden pulled out of his own reelection bid, it was far too late for the primary process, and that could have made Kamala Harris a stronger candidate or found a candidate stronger than Kamala Harris. And yes, Democrats have their own policy divisions, especially on the Middle East. Historically, the Democrats have been strong supporters of Israel. But in recent years, younger Democrats and others in the party coalition have shown increasing sympathy for the plight of Palestinians.\n\nStrategically speaking, Democrats are as divided as ever as to whether to seek votes in the center of the American political spectrum or play to their own party's most passionate progressives. The trick is getting enough Democrats to unite the factions or to accept some sort of shared power so as to actually get some national power to share.\n\nSIMON: President Trump addressed the nation in a primetime speech this week, and last night he spoke to supporters in North Carolina. What have you noticed?\n\nELVING: It's notable that he's trying to be both the incumbent and the anti-incumbent, acting as though Joe Biden were still president and responsible for the economy. That's a tough sell right there, but then Trump turns around and insists the economy is great. We did get a hopeful inflation number this past week, but it was somewhat suspect because the government shutdown affected the numbers - only gave us numbers for one month, not two. And whether inflation was 2.7 or actually higher, the most important measure is the way the voters are feeling. And right now, the most trusted measure that we have for consumer confidence shows that confidence is all the way down to where it was in 2009, the start of the Great Recession.\n\nSIMON: The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., was designated by Congress as a living memorial to President Kennedy in 1964, the year after he was assassinated, of course. Yesterday, President Trump put his name on the building too. Why?\n\nELVING: Well, it shouldn't be a shock. We've known for some time that Trump likes seeing his name. Earlier this month, he put it on the U.S. Institute of Peace, now the Trump Institute of Peace. And now the president's hand-picked board members have tacked his name onto the Kennedy Center. We should add that there are still some questions about whether or not that's legal, and members of Congress and the Kennedy family still want to resist.\n\nSIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much for being with us. Talk to you soon.\n\nELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

If victorious, Villegas would add to progressive’s power in Washington while simultaneously reducing the number of representatives amenable to bipartisan compromise.\n\nRedistricting aside, CA-22 figures to be a slightly Republican-leaning district, thus Bains may have a real shot at flipping a seat – whereas Villegas likely does not. Boosting Villegas at the expense of Bains may cost Democrats a potentially winnable seat.\n\nOutside of California, the hole Democrats are digging for themselves by letting progressives drive the party is even more apparent. \n\nIn Texas, former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred was “pressured out of a Senate run, to clear the decks for uber-progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett.”\n\nNever mind that Allred outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 6% in 2024 or that Crockett trails every GOP challenger according to 270toWin. \n\nAlso disregard that Texas hasn’t had a Democratic senator since 1995. For progressives, the point is to make noise, regardless of whether Democrats are putting forward the candidate with the best chance to win.\n\nOf course, in a democracy, whoever gets a majority of the votes in a single state or district is the rightful winner. However, progressive dominance of Democrats’ grassroots organizations means that more often than not, the party is advancing the least electable politicians in a general election.\n\nIn that same vein, progressive dominance ensures that Democrats’ Congressional caucus is populated by far-left ideologues, not the moderate Democrats who are most likely to find common cause with the GOP in bipartisan solutions to the problems we face as a country. \n\nA recent report from center-left group Welcome emphasizes the vulnerability this poses. It cites that seven-in-ten (70%) voters find the Democratic party to be “out of touch” and too focused on progressive issues.\n\nAdditionally, the report states that most voters believe the party does not care enough about securing the border or lowering crime rates – two key issues that significantly contributed to Harris’ 2024 defeat and threaten to reemerge as major vulnerabilities for Democrats, especially in the 2028 presidential election.\n\nPlainly, Welcome’s report should be a deafening alarm to Democrats. \n\nIt makes clear that the voters who decide presidential elections want Democrats to abandon their extreme, progressive ideology in favor of moderate Democrats, with the side effect of reorienting the entire Democratic Party towards the center. \n\nAnd yet, Democrats appear poised to do the opposite. \n\nWhether out of fear of the far-left or unwillingness to confront the most vocal part of their base on issues like DEI, immigration, the economy, and social issues, moderate Democrats are running the risk of ceding the party to the most unelectable major party platform in modern history.\n\nThat being said, some Democrats have already opted to take this centrist approach, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who seemingly has his eye on a 2028 bid for the Oval Office.\n\nNewsom, one of President Trump’s loudest opponents, has moved to the center in the last few years. \n\n on transgender athletes in sports, and – arguably most importantly – \n\n his fellow Democrats to be “more culturally normal” and “less judgmental” earlier this month.\n\nIn bucking progressive orthodoxies, Newsom is attempting to appeal to the national electorate Democrats need to return to the White House, which is much more moderate than the far-left.\n\nRegrettably, as the Welcome report makes clear, the effects of the progressive surge have already begun to eat away at the Democratic brand, making the party seem narrow-minded, less practical, and ineffective at a time when they should be solidifying their platform.\n\nUltimately, if Democrats prove unable to shake off the rise of the progressives, then they will have nobody to blame for their self-sabotage aside from themselves. For the party to be competitive beyond relying on “we’re not Trump,” they will have to find a way to separate themselves from the extremists in their party. \n\nConversely, if Democrats decide to follow the lead of progressives like Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, they will have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and will cost themselves another election.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Heading into 2026, Democrats are on the brink of success  and self-sabotage","url":"https://www.presstelegram.com/2025/12/18/heading-into-2026-democrats-are-on-the-brink-of-success-and-self-sabotage/","image":"https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SUT-Z-Mamdani-AP25325767592712-01.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 11:33:11","author":"Gqlshare","authors":["Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":387856128,"title":"At Turning Point’s annual gathering, young conservatives fret about the future","text":"At 23, Caleb Gasca has checked off several traditional markers of adulthood. He graduated college, found a job in a construction office and got married. But living with his wife’s parents in San Bernardino County, California, he still feels as though his life has yet to fully begin. “It’s really irritating that in the area I grew up in, that my family lives, that I can’t afford to live there,” he said in between speakers at AmericaFest, Turning Point USA’s annual gathering of young conservatives. As a candidate, President Donald Trump harnessed the angst of millions of young Americans like Gasca to win a surprising share of Millennial and Gen Z voters. Their role in his victory was celebrated last December at AmericaFest after Turning Point USA proved instrumental in Trump’s courtship of young people “The golden age of America is upon us,” Trump declared from the stage. But this year, the mood inside AmericaFest is far more unsettled. The loss of Charlie Kirk, the charismatic activist who founded Turning Point USA and was killed in September by a gunman, has cast a grim pall over the event and left an unmistakable void in the movement. Meanwhile, many of the promises Trump made to the group last year — including “lower prices,” an end to foreign wars and “generational change” — have yet to materialize. Prices remain high, foreign entanglements are expanding and young people are deeply pessimistic about their future. In a dozen conversations with CNN, AmericaFest attendees expressed mixed views of Trump’s return to Washington and the world they are just entering. Some remain optimistic that Trump will find a way to improve their lives — that his immigration crackdown will create jobs and lower housing costs, his energy policies will lower gas prices and electric bills and his dismantling of the Department of Education will end the cycle of college debt. “We’re only one year into this administration,” said Chloe Szot, a 27-year-old California teacher. Others are less willing to wait. Gasca told CNN, “Unless something changes, I plan not to vote, at least for president, in 2028.” A tougher road to adulthood For many of AmericaFest’s young attendees, the new realities of American life are setting in. While Szot believes homeownership remains within reach for her generation, it’s with a caveat that previous middle-class generations didn’t always have to consider. “I think 100% I will be able to buy a house, but it also depends on where you live,” she said. Luke Phelps is starting a family soon in the Phoenix area, and the 25-year-old said he and his wife expect to continue working. It’s a reality that couples are increasingly confronting — both spouses now work in about half of households in a country where two-thirds of $100,000 earners told The Harris Poll they’re just getting by. “Nothing’s going to be the same as it always has,” Phelps said. “One income was great. Now you need two, right? Obviously you count it as sad, but every generation deals with something.” The road to adulthood once followed a familiar path: move out of the parental home, find a spouse, get a job and have kids. Today, fewer than a quarter of Americans had reached all four milestones by age 34, according to the US Census Bureau. Homeownership remains elusive as well. Earlier this year, the National Association of Realtors reported that the median age of a first-time homebuyer had reached 40, the highest on record. The generation entering adulthood also faces new pressures their parents did not. More teenagers acknowledge they spend too much time on social media and expressed concern about its effects on their mental health, according to an April Pew Research Center study. The Harvard Kennedy Institute of Politics found in a recent poll that adults under 30 are three times more likely to believe artificial intelligence will take away opportunities from them than create them. “You don’t want to start college and get through it and the job that you wanted isn’t there anymore,” said Tyler Osbon, a 19-year-old college student from West Monroe, Louisiana. “It’s definitely getting harder to see what you want to do with your life, and then, is that going to be enough to support you in the future?” With Kirk’s help, Trump’s campaign appeared far more attuned with how this generation, particularly young men, had internalized their struggles, said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard. Trump tailored his message to those anxieties and promised a way out. The results were undeniable: Trump saw a 7-point jump in support from voters under 30 from 2020 to 2024, according to CNN exit polls, the largest increase of any age group. But one year into Trump’s return to Washington, “doomerism” has become a prevailing sentiment among young people. Just 13 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds believe the country is headed in the right direction, the Harvard poll found. It’s a reality that is increasingly flashing warnings for Trump and Republicans heading into the midterms. “Over the last decade it’s been incredibly challenging for people to feel good about the direction of the country especially among Gen Z, which has never seen America united or at its greatest,” said Della Volpe. ‘Young people are angry’ Kirk, who spent a decade connecting with high school and college-age voters, warned that the status quo was not sustainable and would have electoral ramifications for Republicans. In one of his final interviews, he accused his party and its donors of being “blind to the suffering” of the young people who helped deliver Trump’s victory and a Senate majority. “They should be saying, ‘Thank you, younger voters,’” Kirk said. Will Denton, a 27-year-old working in commercial real estate, agreed with Kirk’s concerns. Standing under a mural of the slain leader at AmericaFest, Denton said it will take “lots of little, little Charlie Kirks that are activated by his” example to enact change. “I don’t think (Republicans) are doing enough,” Denton said. “Young people are angry, young people are frustrated, and young people are succumbing to another scourge on our society, which is a message of systemic conspiracy against you.” The antidote, Kirk contended before he could more widely press the case, was policy aimed at giving young people a path to the American dream. If Republicans continued to apply the “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” philosophy that had guided conservative governance for decades, Kirk predicted that the GOP would squander its hard-won advantage with young voters. “Even if you don’t care about them, you’re not going to like the politics that comes,” he said. There are already signs of a slide back to the left. In governor races in Virginia and New Jersey, young people overwhelmingly backed Democrats, exit polls found. Democrats now hold a 13-point edge over Republicans among young people asked which party should control Congress after 2026, according to the Harvard poll. Many young voters say they plan to express their dissatisfaction by sitting out the next election. While that sentiment is strongest among independents, apathy is more pronounced among Republicans than Democrats. Only half of young people who voted for Trump in 2024 said they definitely plan to vote in 2026, compared to 66 percent of Kamala Harris’ young voters. Divisions remain, though, over whether Trump should attempt to win over the generation with more targeted policies. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro delivered a different message to young people on Thursday: “Get off your ass and go do the thing.” “Finish high school, get a job, get married, have kids, go to church. Those are all in your control,” he said from a studio at AmericaFest. “You pretending those things are not in your control is grievance culture BS.”","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/20/politics/turning-point-young-conservatives-worried","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25353842994441.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 11:00:58","author":"Jeff Simon,Steve Contorno","authors":["Jeff Simon","Steve Contorno"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.075},{"id":387881876,"title":"Jake Tapper on Terrorism, Executive Power, and Venezuelan Boat Bombings","text":"CNN journalist Jake Tapper's latest book, Race Against Terror: Chasing an Al Qaeda Killer at the Dawn of the Forever War, tells the little-known story of an Al Qaeda operative who surrendered to Italian authorities in 2011 and claimed to have carried out attacks that killed American soldiers. With no evidence to prove the murders happened, two assistant U.S. prosecutors traveled around the world to investigate his claims and build a case. The book shows how early counterterrorism decisions shaped the broader global war on terror.\n\nTapper is a longtime reporter and, since 2013, the host of The Lead with Jake Tapper; his other books range from political nonfiction to historical thrillers. In October, he spoke with Reason's Nick Gillespie about Race Against Terror and why the story it tells still matters today. They also discussed threats to free speech, President Donald Trump, the shortcomings of legacy media outlets, and how the industry is adapting to a new era.\n\n: The new book takes us back 25 years almost, to 9/11, Afghanistan, and the beginning of what was called the global war on terror. What brought you back to this topic? You've already written about Afghanistan.\n\nTapper: I heard about it from one of the prosecutors randomly at a birthday party—at my son's birthday party, in fact—and what was interesting to me about it was the detective story, the true crime story. He and his colleagues had to prove a criminal case that would be upheld in court against a terrorist for actions on the battlefield that took place in 2003 and an attempt to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria not long after that. And all of the sleuthing and the detective work that they all had to do—it was just this incredible story about all the stuff I love from police procedurals like CSI or Cold Case.\n\nThe Al Qaeda killer, known as Spin Ghul, showed up in Italy. He was arrested by Italian authorities after bragging, \"I killed American soldiers.\" But then they had to prove it, since that was only his assertion, right?\n\nThey had to prove it because it was the Obama years, and [President Barack] Obama had closed off [Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp] from any new terrorist suspects. Obama wanted to try terrorists in criminal court. That was really controversial at the time.\n\nTrump is trying to do it now. Spin Ghul was the first terrorist tried like this. Trump is trying to do it with a guy named Jafar [a.k.a. Mohammad Sharifullah]. Not controversial at all—no hue and cry. This terrorist is sitting in a cell not far from where you and I are sitting, in Virginia, and nobody's acting afraid about it. But at the time, people acted as though these terrorists had superhuman powers and if you brought them to Manhattan or Brooklyn they would escape and wreak havoc.\n\nWhat was so interesting to me about it was proving a case that was not just cold. People are generally not brought to court for killing people in a war. It generally doesn't happen. The sleuthing was so interesting.\n\nI wasn't trying to give a history of the war on terror, but you had to tell it. You had to describe what was different about [President George W.] Bush to Obama to Trump, because it was part of the hurdles that these prosecutors and FBI agents had to jump over.\n\nAre we really done with the \"global war on terror\" era of foreign policy?\n\nI don't think it's done with us, is the bottom line. I think as long as there are dozens, hundreds, thousands of radicalized Islamists who are willing to kill Americans and target Westerners, the war is not done with us.\n\nTrump, he's a complicated guy and I have a lot of complicated feelings about his foreign policy. There's a ceasefire in Gaza right now. That's empirically a good thing. People might not like what happened with the strikes against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, but I think the fact that they don't have it is a good thing.\n\nHe didn't follow it up. He said, \"This is something we're gonna do but we're not gonna stick around.\"\n\nYeah. We're not. That's it. We're dropping the bombs on their facilities, and then we're out. I think [it's something] to be cautiously optimistic about. I also think he's exercising a mix of hard power and soft power. His hard power is the threats of tariffs, the threats of force.\n\nBlowing up Venezuelan boats.\n\nWell, that's another question. That's a different part of the war on terror powers. This is something that you guys at Reason always know, which is: Once a president establishes for himself that he has a shiny toy, good luck getting that toy ever wrested away from whoever the president is.\n\nBush used drones. Obama multiplied it by 100. And now Trump is using the same arguments to a) label antifa a domestic terrorist group, which I'm not sure he even has the power to do, and b) use these powers to strike terrorists abroad, like going after [Anwar] al-Awlaki or whoever in Yemen.\n\nUsing those same powers and saying, \"We're going to use them against what we're calling narco-terrorists,\" because they're killing 100,000 Americans a year through fentanyl. It's tragic, but it's not really the same thing as terrorists blowing up Americans in embassies. To say, \"We're selling drugs and Americans are overdosing on it.\" I don't shed a tear for any narco-terrorist dying, but I don't know that it's sane.\n\nAs Sen. Rand Paul [R–Ky.] points out, when it comes to those strikes on these boats from Venezuela or Colombia, even if you're wrong only 25 percent of the time, that's 25 percent of the time you're killing innocent people. Also, there's no judicial process for this.\n\nUltimately, as with all presidents, I think it's a mixed bag. I do think it's a positive development that President Trump is using the criminal court system to prosecute Jafar. I don't know that they even remember that it was really controversial to do this in the Obama years. I take it as a positive development that President Trump thinks we can use the criminal courts to prosecute foreign terrorists captured abroad. I think that's a good thing.\n\nIt's only been about a month since Federal Communications Commission [FCC] Chair Brendan Carr, as well as Trump himself, explicitly said that Disney and ABC should fire Jimmy Kimmel because airing him is not in the public interest. You said this was the most direct threat to a free press that you've seen in your lifetime. Do you stand by that? How are you thinking about it now, a month on?\n\nI absolutely stand by it. There have been a lot of egregious examples. I don't like what the Biden administration did with social media companies—a lot of it was confirmed years later. They used a very slippery slope, which is always the argument. If you say, \"Don't put this on the internet because it's going to hurt people,\" and the social media companies comply, [because] we're in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic, etc., then the next thing they're gonna do is start removing stuff that is just politically untenable, like the lab leak theory.\n\nI stood up when the Obama administration was saying that Fox was not a legitimate news organization, when they were declaring that from the White House podium. I said—and I got a lot of shit for it, and I still get shit for it to this day—\"Why is it appropriate for a White House to label a credentialed news organization not legitimate?\"\n\nThis has nothing to do with my feelings about Fox. My feelings about Fox are irrelevant, really. First of all, in 2009, that was a very different Fox than what we have now. And second of all, it's a question about why is it appropriate for the White House to do this. So I do have a history of this. I will say that this was the most direct.\n\nBrendan Carr goes on the podcast of a MAGA right-wing person and says: I don't like this speech, and Disney should act, and the local affiliates that air this garbage should stop airing it. Which was followed by the largest owner of local TV stations, Nexstar—which needs Brendan Carr for some business transactions they want to do. Not just approval, but to lift a limit on how many households they can reach. They need Brendan Carr. It was basically, \"Aye aye, sir, how high do you want us to jump?\" And they did that. And it was awful. I have not seen ever before a direct infringement on the right to free speech like that.\n\nDo you feel like this threat, plus the lawsuit that Trump is bringing against CBS and his actions against other broadcasters and news organizations, is having a chilling effect? Or are people in the regulated media developing a backbone to push back?\n\nBoth is the answer. Anybody has the right to sue anybody in this country. And corporations don't have to acquiesce if they don't want to.\n\nOne of the things that's troubling is that this is coming at the same time that, for want of a better term, the oligarchs are out oligarching. They are very susceptible to what one CBS News employee called \"legalized bribery.\"\n\nThe lawsuit against CBS News was absolute nonsense. The idea that CBS, in making an edit like that, was defaming President Trump in any way—it was an edit to a Kamala Harris interview. She spoke in word salads. They took one clip and used it, and they took another clip and used it.\n\nOn your show, you showed that Fox News had done the same thing for Trump. None of this rises to the level of even a notice, much less legal action.\n\nI'm not crazy about taped interviews to begin with, because I think people get lazy in terms of the talkers. They're not concise. They're long. But generally speaking, most of the time—no, every time—that we're trying to edit an interview, we're just trying to save time. \"OK, here's this 20 minutes of whatever. Can we find a minute that answers the question?\" Because that's the business here. That's what 60 Minutes was doing. That lawsuit was nonsense.\n\nNow President Trump is using this stuff to argue that he's constantly defamed, that he's consistently attacked by the media unfairly. It's not true. I see stuff about him that's not fair, of course. So I think there is a chilling effect.\n\nWhat comes next? What does the White House do next to turn the pressure up even higher?\n\nThey're already doing it to CBS News.\n\nI think the legacy media has work to do. Absolutely. In terms of credibility, in terms of inclusivity of voices. Not just from the right, by the way, but also libertarians, independents, and all the rest.\n\nIt feels as though President Trump feels very empowered. He only insults NBC and ABC when he talks about networks. He always excludes CBS now, ever since the Ellisons took over. He says, \"Larry Ellison is a good friend of mine. He's a good guy, blah blah blah. They're gonna make it fair, da da da da.\" That's not how presidents should be talking about people who cover them. Presidents in general should think we're all pains in the ass. Every president. About every news outlet.\n\nWe're also talking about a president who, in response to the No Kings rallies or marches, released an AI video of himself wearing a crown and literally dumping shit on protesters. What can the media do to push back in any meaningful way?\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton referred to half of Trump supporters in 2016 as fitting in a \"basket of deplorables\" or when Joe Biden said what he said about Donald Trump's supporters being \"garbage\"—or whatever he said, I know that's disputed—those were considered gaffes.\n\nMichael Kinsley's famous saying is \"a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth.\" Those were accidents. Those were mistakes. Them accidentally revealing what they really think about millions of Americans.\n\nBut here's Donald Trump, in a strategic way, showing himself dropping shit not on MS-13 gang members, not on antifa rioters, but on Americans demonstrating peacefully. The No Kings rallies were peaceful, as far as I know. And certainly the ones in the AI were that. If you look closely, you can see he's dropping shit on a woman holding a baby. He's dropping shit on an American flag.\n\nI think it's incumbent upon us to cover the president, including when he does things like that. We don't have to use adjectives. Just use verbs.\n\nThis is the president, as a strategy, attacking millions of Americans and dividing the country. That is what he is doing. And then you ask people for their opinions on it. But I think we can't shy away from covering it.\n\nAt the same time, it's not for us in the news media—unless you're an opinion journalist—to say how you feel about it. You just state the facts of it and let opinion people talk about it. Also, we have to cover everything else he's doing, whether you like it or not: tariffs, Mideast peace. There's a lot going on.\n\nWhat's the big failing of legacy media right now?\n\nFox has its own issues. I don't think I'm spilling any secrets when I say they are commodifying preaching to the choir. That is a channel for Trump supporters. Not for conservatives, not for Republicans—it is for Trump's supporters. Very seldom are there voices that are allowed to criticize Donald Trump or even question what he's doing. Period. Full stop.\n\nThere is another channel on cable that is the exact mirror image of that, and that is commodifying ideology. And that's fine. I think that's a fine supplement for a news diet. I don't think it's a news diet. Ideological media has been part of this country since it was founded.\n\nI think legacy media, as a general rule—and this is difficult to do in an era of cost cutting, etc.—but I think we should be doing more stories outside the Delta Shuttle corridor and Los Angeles. I think we need to be covering the heartland more. I think there should be more voices from all over the country included in coverage. And I do think that the biggest bias is often story selection. It's not necessarily in coverage. It's: Are we covering this? Are we covering that?\n\nIdeologically, we need to expand our aperture in terms of what we think is news. And I don't only mean issues that conservatives are interested in or libertarians are interested in. We could be doing better. That's what I would do.\n\nBut one of the problems is this is happening at a time of media consolidation. It's happening at a time of oligarchs taking over news media. It's also happening at a time where there is this commodification of rage bait, of making people hate each other. I don't just mean Fox or [MSNBC]. I also mean social media driving people away from each other. Villainizing each other.\n\nCNN as a network has flat-to-falling ratings, and the cable system writ large seems to be fading. Most networks peaked in 2020. How much of this is the typical pattern of a sunsetting industry—not experimenting, not trying something new, just doubling down on the very strategies that led to the decline in the first place?\n\nFirst of all, I think everyone's ratings are going down, including Fox. They're just losing viewers at a slower rate than others. The cord cutting is a real thing. But it's not just the cord cutting. There is just a plate tectonic shift in how we are all, as individuals, consuming information.\n\nI've written eight books now, and the difference between how much people factor in e-books and audiobooks today is light-years away from just two years ago. There is a recognition now that people are listening to books and reading them on their phones in a way that just a few years ago people did not recognize—they were only looking at hardcovers.\n\nIt's entertainment. It's news. It's movies. It's everything. And everybody's trying to figure out how to do it.\n\nI don't know what the future is. I know that Mark Thompson, who is our boss at CNN, helped The New York Times get from a newspaper with a website to a website with a newspaper.\n\nIs the decline of the networks—legacy or otherwise—being supplanted by a rush toward independent or alternative journalism? Or has credibility across the media world become so damaged that nothing is taking its place?\n\nI don't know where it's going to land. People can compare the ratings for, let's say, CBS Evening News with Joe Rogan. Well, they're not doing the same thing, right?\n\nPeople might be getting information from both of them, but they're not doing the same thing. I don't think that's a fair comparison. I'm not belittling Rogan—he's created this giant empire based on long-form, authentic conversations. But he's not calling himself an expert on anything. These aren't news reports.\n\nI just think we, as reporters, need to figure out how to get in that space where viewers are. Publishing has figured it out, in the sense of audiobooks and Kindle books. That's basically how I consume books now. I'm listening to them in my car and then I'm reading them on my phone.\n\nHow do we get there? I don't know. CNN has been doing a lot more in terms of the vertical video space. That's different, right? People don't want a highly produced news report in that space. They want—or they seem to want—a much more authentic, produced but Instagram- or TikTok-friendly presentation of information in under 3 minutes. We're all just trying to figure this out.\n\nDoes it feel like you may be one of a dying breed—an old-style newsman whose politics are secondary to the journalism itself?\n\nI don't think so. Because I think there will always be a need for somebody who is not a Democrat, not a Republican, who is able to moderate debates; who is able to perform—or provide, rather—a news service and accounting of the day; who can have on Speaker [of the House Mike] Johnson [R–La.]; who can have on Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries [D–N.Y.]. I think there's always going to be a need for that. I don't know the format for that in five years, 10 years.\n\nWhile you and I are both having success in these short vertical videos—CNN and Reason—there is also simultaneously this explosion of these incredibly long-form podcasts or YouTube podcasts, hourlong conversations, three-hour-long conversations in the case of Rogan sometimes.\n\nI don't know where this lands. I just know that I think we need to experiment, need to get out there, need to try stuff. Hew closely to the brand of nonpartisan, nonideological, trying to get information. Yeah, you stand up for facts. And yeah, you stand up for democracy. But as a general note, I'm not saying that this politician is better than that politician. I just think we're all trying to figure out how to get there.\n\nWhat are the things that the Trump administration is doing now that you don't think are getting enough attention?\n\nI think the way they're hollowing out experts from the Justice Department and the FBI is bad.\n\nOne of the things I've learned from writing this book is how important it is, if you want to put terrorists away forever, to have really good prosecutors who know what they're doing and really good supervision of those prosecutors. And they're firing them for nakedly political reasons.\n\nThere's a guy in the book named George Toscas. One of the toughest guys in the National Security Division of the Justice Department. There since '93. You had to get everything through him before you could get it to the attorney general or the president—indictments, extraditions. He's been sidelined because he approved the Mar-a-Lago classified documents warrant. The guy in charge of the Jafar case in the Eastern District of Virginia, fired because some MAGA person hypothesized that he was against the Comey indictments, which he wasn't.\n\nWe're getting rid of really good people who are there to protect us. That concerns me a lot in the national security space. I was covering it a lot—every day—and we're not doing it as much. And I want to get back to it.\n\nThe effect of tariffs on small businesses is really important. I think we are covering the Mideast peace achievements, such as it is right now. We're covering it plenty, but I think that's important and significant.\n\nAnother thing that I think is important, that we're not covering enough, is—and we'll see what the effects will be—the cuts to Medicaid. Is it reform? That's what Speaker Johnson says: \"It's reform to Medicaid. We're just making able-bodied men have to work,\" etc. Or is it going to actually hurt people? That's to be determined because it's just starting to happen now. But all of that, I think, is important.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for style and clarity.","summary":"\"Once a president establishes for himself that he has a shiny toy, good luck getting that toy ever wrested away from whoever the president is,\" the CNN anchor tells Reason's Nick Gillespie.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/12/20/is-jake-tapper-doomed/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/interview1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 11:00:32","author":"Fiona Harrigan,Nick Gillespie","authors":["Fiona Harrigan","Nick Gillespie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":387785504,"title":"Turning Point USA Has An Erika Kirk Problem","text":"A week after Charlie Kirk was assassinated, Turning Point USA’s chief operating officer made a prediction.\n\n“Charlie Kirk came and converted the young men.

They featured interviews with young conservative women and Republican strategists ― many of them suggesting Turning Point could use Erika Kirk as a conduit to reach Gen Z women.\n\nTurning Point USA didn’t respond when asked if it had seen more interest from young women since Erika Kirk took over. It also did not respond to requests for an interview with her. \n\nThe reality, experts in the young voting bloc say, is that young women really aren’t buying the narrative that Erika Kirk has been peddling: that they’d be happier leaving their careers behind, getting married young, having children and “submitting” to their husbands. \n\n“I certainly think that Erica Kirk could be a strong leader, bringing in more young women than, perhaps, have been a part of the Turning Point movement to date, but I don’t suspect we’re going to see a massive shift right amongst young women anytime soon,” said Rachel Janfaza, founder of the Gen Z research and strategy firm The Up and Up.\n\nDr. Corey Seemiller, a generational expert who’s written six books about Gen Z, agreed, saying she doesn’t expect Erika Kirk to be some kind of “massive draw” to young women, especially “if she continues to put forth the same message that Charlie Kirk did.”\n\n“The messaging that’s resonating with Gen Z women is really different than the messaging that’s resonated with Gen Z men,” she noted, saying the demographic is shaping up to have one of the biggest political gender divides in generations.\n\nThat’s evident from recent elections. In 2024, young women ages 18-29 chose then-Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump by an 18-point margin. Men in that age group swung significantly the other way, choosing Trump over Harris by a 14-point margin.\n\nKey to Charlie Kirk’s success luring young men to MAGA was his “shock appeal,” Seemiller said. “Charlie Kirk didn’t hold back, and young men were like, ‘Yes, finally, someone’s saying something for me. He’s speaking my language.’”\n\n“Can Erica Kirk be that same thing?” she asked. “I don’t think women are looking for that.”\n\nWhat Gen Z women actually care about\n\nAcross the political spectrum, Gen Z women have very different feelings about marriage, children and metrics for success than both Erika Kirk and their male counterparts do. \n\n“This idea of finding that partner because you don’t want to go through life solo is definitely not something women are embracing in bulk, by any stretch,” Seemiller said of Gen Z women.\n\nRecent data she’s gathered showed that while 23% of Gen Z men said they wanted to get married to avoid being alone, just 13% of women in that age group said the same.\n\nAnd among members of Gen Z who said they don’t want to get married, 56% of women cited a desire to be independent, compared to just 41% of men, her data showed. Among that group, 24% of women cited an opposition to combining finances, while just 17% of men said the same.\n\n“We’re not seeing any indicators that these women are leaning on these ‘head of household’ men who would take care of them financially,” Seemiller observed. \n\nEven within Turning Point’s target demographic of young, right-leaning voters, the differences in men and women’s priorities are astounding ― especially when it comes to one of the Kirks’ biggest mandates: have children.\n\nIn September, an NBC News poll that broke down Gen Z’s priorities by both sex and Trump vs. Harris, voters found that while Gen Z men who voted for Trump ranked having children as their No. 1 marker of success, their female counterparts ranked it sixth among their 13 choices. And while those men ranked being married fourth, those female Trump voters ranked it ninth. \n\nIn another twist, Gen Z women who voted for Trump ranked achieving financial independence higher than both groups of men and female Harris voters, placing it at No. 1.\n\nThe findings track with what Janfaza hears in the gatherings she holds with young voters.\n\n“I hear in my listening sessions with Gen Z women a strong focus on financial stability and financial freedom as the top thing that they’re prioritizing when they think about metrics for success in their future,” she said.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like Erika Kirk grasps any of that. In a recent interview, she appeared utterly perplexed that so many young women voted for New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a candidate who ran on affordability and America’s cost-of-living crisis. In remarks that were widely panned on social media, she called the Democrat’s victory “so ironic and so interesting” and mused that young women were asking things of their government they should be seeking from a marriage.\n\n“What I don’t want to have happen is women, young women, in the city look to the government as a solution,” she said. “To put off having a family or a marriage, because you’re relying on the government to support you, instead of being united with a husband, where you can support yourself and your husband can support [you], and you guys can all combine together.”\n\nAuthenticity matters to young people — a lot \n\nThere’s an elephant in the room working against Erika Kirk.\n\nBefore becoming the CEO of a nonprofit with tens of millions of dollars in assets and making multiple media appearances a week, Erika Kirk lectured young women on the importance of being a “helpmate” to their husbands instead of focusing on their own careers. \n\n“Your husband has to be the one that goes out into the world and builds and battles and comes home. Conquers,” she said in an April 2025 episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” while sitting next to her husband. “[He] comes home and is like, ‘This is my nest egg, this is what I worked so hard for,’ and the wife is like, ‘Welcome home, babe, whatever you need, we’re here.’”\n\nEven before becoming CEO, she was a businesswoman with a podcast, a clothing line and multiple degrees.\n\nDuring an appearance onstage at a Turning Point USA event over the summer, she cautioned it wasn’t “ideal” to get married after 30 and that it’s “not probably the best statistical-odd position.”\n\nErika Kirk was 32 when she married Charlie Kirk, who was five years her junior.\n\nThat’s a hypocrisy that may not jive with young women or men. \n\n“Young people as a whole, especially Gen Z, are about authenticity,” Leela Strong, the director of Tufts’ Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, a research organization focused on youth civic engagement, told HuffPost. \n\n“They want candidates and figureheads who can speak to substantive issues,” who understand “those issues they’ve personally experienced,” she said.\n\nSeemiller agreed, saying the weight Gen Z gives to authenticity from leaders is one of the “biggest findings” about the age group.\n\nJanfaza emphasized the same: “Anyone looking to connect with Gen Z needs to be real and clear about their day-to-day, how they spend their time and their own priorities.”\n\nYoung women are also experiencing the creep of “tradwife” content on social media from creators “making millions of dollars by encouraging people to not make money,” Seemiller observed, and it’s not really landing with them.\n\n“Gen Z women are seeing right through that,” she said.\n\nShe expects Turning Point USA will eventually attempt to package the incongruence.\n\n“It’ll be spun to be that she believes in this so much that she has to get other people to do it,” Seemiller said.

But at a recent CBS town hall appearance, she asserted her authenticity.\n\n“We’re fully transparent,” she said when talking about her decision to give a live statement following Charlie Kirk’s shooting.\n\n“What you see,” she promised, “is what you get.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/erika-kirk-turning-point-usa-gen-z_n_6925f13ae4b063285310f023?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6925f1181900007f306a0012.jpg?cache=UCG4evNNhM&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 11:00:17","author":"Lydia O'connor","authors":["Lydia O'connor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.124},{"id":387875472,"title":"How the Lumbee Tribe earned federal recognition after a decadeslong effort","text":"Even through the din of his North Carolina fish market, Joseph Jones’s excitement is palpable. On Dec. 17, Congress recognized his people, the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, as a full-fledged American tribe, eligible for government benefits, health-care assistance and, potentially, a casino.\n\n“It’s been a long time, but we finally made it, man,” says Mr. Jones, whose family owns the Lumbee Fish Market in Pembroke, North Carolina, in a phone interview. “People steady working, steady pushing it, steady going to the White House, steady letting Congress know that we are Native regardless of what people say about us, and we are proud to be Native American.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has long professed his “love” for the Lumbee people, signed the National Defense Authorization Act on Dec. 18. Tucked into that defense funding bill was the Lumbee Fairness Act, making the Lumbee the 575th recognized tribe in the United States. The tribe instantly became one of the nation’s largest. It took the Lumbee more than 30 attempts to earn federal recognition, as its members have fought allegations from other tribes that they have not proved their historical lineage and continuous government.\n\nThe recognition is in part a testament to the Lumbee Tribe’s growing political power, with more than 55,000 members. It highlights how the Lumbee have become a influential voting bloc in North Carolina and quietly exerted influence on the national stage. The pushback their recognition has stirred from other Native American tribes also brings into focus how questions of identity linger as the Lumbee Tribe looks to build upon its new federal recognition.\n\n“It’s a really fascinating window into this moment. Here is a kind of racial justice victory” under a presidency that has attacked the social justice movement on many fronts, says Julian Brave NoiseCat, a writer and filmmaker and member of the Canim Lake Band Tsq̓éscen̓, in California. “The tribe has been an interesting political chameleon as its identity has always been Native but also transforming over time.”\n\nLumbee tribal origins\n\nThe Lumbee call themselves the “people of the dark water.” Though there are outposts of Lumbee in Baltimore and Philadelphia, most today live in and around the Lumber River in Robeson County, North Carolina, where tribal connections are cemented and understood by questions like, “Where do you church?”\n\nThe Lumbee’s founding story, according to some historians and tribal leaders, intermingles with the European-American one. In one theory, the Lumbee emerged after Europeans possibly left the “the Lost Colony at Roanoke” in modern-day North Carolina in the late 16th century to live with local Native Americans on Croatoan Island. The Lumbee Tribe website says some ancestors of the tribe have always lived on the Lumbee River, while others migrated from parts of the Carolinas and Virginia. Lumbee is the name the tribe chose for itself in the 1950s.\n\nA team that included a Harvard University professor traveled to Robeson County in 1934 to assess the tribe’s eligibility for recognition. They found that, though the tribe was doubtlessly Indigenous, it didn’t meet the federal definition, which at that time considered only race – not culture, ancestors, or relatives.\n\nOften, Lumbee don’t look uniquely Indian, including some who have freckles and red hair. Many share “Tuscarora eyes,” a gray shade traced by many to early colonial settlers. Tribal leaders and members say it is a testament to the inclusiveness of the tribe, which weights familial bonds more than blood line percentages.\n\nThe historic struggle for legitimacy makes the Lumbee federal recognition fight partly about who does and doesn’t count as Native, supporters of the Lumbee tribe say.\n\n“The Lumbee are a rich example of how to exercise self-determination against the strongest possible opposition: America’s insistence on their invisibility,” writes Emory University historian and Lumbee Tribe member Malinda Maynor Lowery in “The Lumbee Indians: An American Struggle.”\n\nNorth Carolina has recognized the tribe since the 1880s, but Congress, which oversees federal recognition, has consistently turned down the Lumbee until now. The Lumbee have watched as 23 other tribes have gained recognition since the 1970s. The latest was the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Montana, which were recognized through the defense authorization bill in 2019.\n\nInfluence and money at stake\n\nIn some ways, the Lumbee Tribe’s struggle for recognition might have less to do with proving their historical heritage than with pocketbook issues.\n\nStalwart opposition has come from the 15,000-strong Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nThe Lumbee would be the “first to receive recognition without demonstrating any descent from a historical tribe,” Michell Hicks, the chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, told Congress in November.\n\nNative American tribes can earn federal recognition through several pathways, including by an act of Congress, through a federal court decision, and by recognition from the Office of Federal Acknowledgment within the Department of the Interior. That office evaluates petitions based on “anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods.”\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Hicks criticized the Lumbee Tribe for seeking recognition through Congress “instead of the merit based federal acknowledgement process. Doing so without a verified history, language, traditions, land base and treaty rights sets a dangerous precedent for regulation moving forward and undermines the standards that protect Tribal Nations and federal Indian Law,” he wrote.\n\nAt the same time, the award-winning drum-circle group, War Paint, has Lumbee members and regularly conducts powwows with the Eastern Band. That cultural acceptance, to some, suggests that opposition may also be about gambling markets. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Tribe runs a casino in Cherokee, North Carolina, across the state from Robeson County.\n\nThe Eastern Band “have a history of protecting their gaming market, and this is potentially going to be cutting into that,” says Matthew Fletcher, a University of Michigan Law School professor and author of “The Ghost Road: Anishinaabe Responses to Indian Hating.”\n\n“Another aspect of worry is that the amount of money appropriated by Congress in a given year for governmental services is finite, so there’s a little bit of a cut that Eastern Band may be expecting given that the Lumbee will be one of the largest tribes in the country going forward,” he adds.\n\n“Never giving up”\n\nIn recent years, members of the Lumbee Tribe have increasingly voted Republican.\n\nPresident Trump held a rally in Robeson County in October 2020, during which he promised to support federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe. As candidates in 2024, both Mr. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to support recognition of the Lumbee.\n\nRobeson County, whose population is just over 40% Indigenous, voted for President Barack Obama in two elections before swinging to support Mr. Trump in the past three presidential elections.\n\nNorth Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, first introduced the Lumbee Fairness Act in Congress in 2023. This week, Republicans and Democrats lined up behind the Lumbee Fairness Act’s inclusion in the defense authorization bill.\n\nWearing a native bolo tie on the Senate floor on Dec. 17, Mr. Tillis later credited the tribe’s “resilience, service and dignity” as they fought for “fair treatment.”\n\n“I thank the Lumbee Tribe for never giving up on our nation, and I’m honored that our nation has finally stopped giving up on them,” Senator Tillis said in a video message. North Carolina’s Democratic governor, Josh Stein, also supported the new recognition.\n\nMost immediately for the Lumbee, the tribe now faces what amounts to a nation-building project as federal subsidies ramp up.\n\n“They’re going to have to build up infrastructure, law enforcement, tribal courts, social services, everything you can imagine,” says Professor Fletcher, who also serves as chief justice of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, and the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. “It’s a great opportunity for them. But they are starting from scratch.”\n\nMr. Jones, the fish seller in Pembroke, says his people are up for the challenge, given a long struggle for legitimacy and support in one of the poorest corners of North Carolina.\n\n“We’re not hunting money, we’re hunting for help for our elders,” says Mr. Jones.","summary":"The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, with more than 55,000 members, earned federal recognition from Congress after decades of attempts.

(EPA Images pic)\nNEW YORK: US Representative Elise Stefanik, a House Republican leader and loyal ally of President Donald Trump, said on Friday she was bowing out of politics, including her recently announced bid for governor of New York, to spend more time with family.\nStefanik, 41, the fourth-ranking member of her party in the House of Representatives as House Republican Conference chair, said she was halting the gubernatorial campaign she launched in November and would not seek re-election to Congress.\nWhen her current term representing New York's upstate 21st congressional district expires in January 2027, she will have served 12 years in office on Capitol Hill.\nStefanik's decision last month to challenge the re-election bid of New York Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul was clouded weeks later when Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, also a Trump ally, launched his own campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.\nNassau County, a western Long Island suburb adjacent to New York City's borough of Queens, ranks as the state's leading Republican stronghold.\nStefanik's exit from the race, announced on X, came after Blakeman paid for a series of campaign ads to run on Fox News over the holidays - not in New York, but in West Palm Beach, Florida, home of Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence.\nTrump has previously expressed consternation at having to choose between two allies to endorse in the governor's race next November.\n\"They're two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running, and I hope there's not a lot of damage done,\" the New York Times quoted him as telling reporters recently.\n'Most important title is mom'\nWhile asserting that she would have \"overwhelmingly won\" that race, Stefanik added in her message on Friday, \"it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\"\nStefanik went on to say that throughout her time in Congress, her \"most important title is Mom\".\n\"I believe that being a parent is life's greatest gift and greatest responsibility,\" she wrote. \"I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don't further focus on my young son's safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.\"\nA short time after Stefanik bowed out, Trump acknowledged Stefanik's announcement on his Truth Social online platform, writing: \"Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!\"\nStefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the House in 2014, moved sharply to the right after Trump's first presidential victory in 2016. She has led efforts to expose how elite US colleges, including New York's Columbia University, responded to campus protests over the Gaza war.\nThe president nominated her as ambassador to the UN at the start of his second term in January 2025 but withdrew her name amid concerns about Republicans' narrow House majority.\nWhile Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won New York by a comfortable 12-point margin over Trump in 2024, the state shifted more toward Trump than any other in the nation from 2020 to 2024. But Democrats dominated several high-profile elections in November, including in New York City and nearby New Jersey.\nStefanik's district is not seen as competitive in next year's midterm elections, when Democrats will seek to take control of the House. Incumbent presidents' parties typically lose House seats in midterm elections.\nHochul, 67, was the state's lieutenant governor in 2021 when then-Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, elevating her to the governorship.

He added, “The online comment threads of Twitter might preach that our lineage is our strength. No, I’m sorry, our lineage is not our strength. Our true strength is what unites us across that diversity and through that lineage.” Mr Ramaswamy, who shaped his political identity with a series of books and media appearances denouncing left-wing “woke” ideology, has become perhaps the most visible target of a right-wing ideology — sometimes labelled “blood and soil” nationalism, a Nazi slogan that was used in Germany and has resurfaced among white supremacists globally. It is a worldview shaped by intolerance of immigrants, and those from India are one of the latest targets. “Older Republicans who may doubt the rising prevalence of the blood-and-soil view should think again,” he wrote in an opinion article in The New York Times this week. “My social media feeds are littered with hundreds of slurs, most from accounts that I don’t recognise,” he wrote. He went further on Friday, saying that people who cannot denounce hateful ideas toward any ethnic group “without stuttering” do not have a “place as a leader at any level in the conservative movement.” In recent weeks, mainstream conservatism has been rocked by a series of incidents that have highlighted bigotry within its ranks. In mid-October, flagrantly racist, antisemitic and homophobic texts exchanged by young Republicans came to light. Weeks later, the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, who remains close to President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, sat down for a friendly interview with Nick Fuentes, an openly racist and antisemitic white nationalist. When the president of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, released a video refusing to criticise Mr Carlson, senior officials and board members at the conservative think tank resigned in protest. Now, Mr Ramaswamy is highlighting a new pressure point facing his party, surging intolerance toward Indian Americans. “This is deeply personal to me,” he said in a text to The Times. “It isn’t really about defending Jews, Indians, or any other minority group. It’s about defending the essence of America itself.” Derogatory slurs that were once seen only in extreme, right-wing pockets of the internet are becoming more mainstream, as are claims that Indians are “stealing American jobs,” according to organisations tracking online hate. “The hateful rhetoric we are seeing right now is nothing like we have seen before,” said Raqib Hameed Naik, the executive director of the Washington D.C.-based Centre for the Study of Organised Hate, a nonprofit that tracks online extremism. Mr Ramaswamy spotlighted that surge this week when he revealed the anti-Indian slurs dogging his campaign for governor and argued in The New York Times article that being an American has nothing to do with one’s ancestry. Instead, he said, any U.S. citizen who vows allegiance to the country is an American so long as they “believe in the rule of law, in freedom of conscience and freedom of expression, in colorblind meritocracy, in the U.S. Constitution, in the American dream.” That was a direct challenge to “national conservatism,” whose adherents include prominent Republicans, including Mr Vance, who gave a speech this summer in which he worried that if being an American meant simply adhering to an ideal, “let’s say, of the Declaration of Independence,” American identity “would include hundreds of millions, maybe billions, of foreign citizens.” “At the same time,” the vice president continued, defining citizenship purely as adhering to the principles of the nation’s founding documents would exclude many on the right who don’t subscribe to those principles and whose “own ancestors were here at the time of the Revolutionary War.” In his opinion article, Mr Ramaswamy took what seemed to be a veiled shot at Mr Vance, who responded in October to outrage over the young Republicans’ racist texts by saying, “I refuse to join the pearl clutching.” “The point isn’t to clutch pearls,” Mr Ramaswamy wrote, “but to prevent the gradual legitimisation of this un-American animus,” condemning a “reluctance from my former anti-woke peers to criticise the new identity politics on the right.” Far from sparking introspection, Mr Ramaswamy’s piece flushed out the bigotry he condemned. Mr Fuentes said on social media that “foreigners who have no right to be here don’t get to lecture me about what it is to be American.” Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab, a social media hotbed for intolerance, said in a more-than-2,000-word response that the notion that anyone could become an American is “the most destructive lie ever told about American identity.” Anti-immigrant rhetoric, including against South Asians, is not new. But it surged in 2024, when the presidential cycle for the first time featured two Indian American candidates, Mr Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, and a Black and South Asian Democratic nominee in Kamala Harris. Mr Vance’s wife, Usha, an Indian American and practising Hindu, has become a particular target, said Stephanie Chan, director of data and research for Stop AAPI Hate, a group that monitors and responds to anti-Asian discrimination. A fierce debate within the Trump administration this year over visas for highly skilled immigrant workers sparked still more anti-Indian rhetoric. Posts on X that featured anti-Indian slurs, stereotypes or narratives like “deport Indians” garnered 280 million views over about two months earlier this year, Mr Naik’s group found. Over the last month, he said, another 29,000 mentions of such language has appeared on X, which Elon Musk purchased in 2022. Mr Ramaswamy is among a small contingent of conservatives who say the movement needs to protect itself from fringe ideologies like that of Mr Fuentes’ groypers. Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator, warned in a speech to the Heritage Foundation this week that “if conservatives do not stand up and draw lines, conservatism and the dream of America itself will cease to exist.” According to a recent survey from the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, almost a third of Republicans under the age of 50 openly express racist or antisemitic views, a finding based on a poll of about 2,800 mostly Republican voters. Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of Stop AAPI Hate, said the anti-Indian rhetoric has been driven partly by policies of Mr Trump, such his moves to limit H-1B visas, a program that has historically allowed 85,000 skilled workers, the vast majority of whom are Indian nationals, to work in the United States each year. “It’s essentially about collective punishment against communities based on perceived threats,” she said. Indian Americans have become the largest subgroup within the Asian American population among people who identify with one country of origin, and are on average the wealthiest and most educated. Six members of Congress are of Indian origin as is the newly elected mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, who also faced significant vitriol online targeting his identity as a Uganda-born Muslim of Indian descent. “There’s never been a prouder moment to be an Indian American,” Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, said. Mr Khanna, who said he has been targeted online because of his heritage, applauded Mr Ramaswamy for denouncing the forces of intolerance instead of “pandering” to them. Mr Ramaswamy made the leap from business to politics by denouncing “wokeness” — a vaguely defined term many Republicans use to describe what they see as a liberal policing of speech involving minority groups. With books, media appearances and a presidential campaign, he amplified the issue of “wokeism” and encouraged a backlash. But in his Times essay, he lamented what he called a natural consequence of that backlash: more people celebrating what they see as a historical bond of white people to America’s founding. Earlier this year, Mr Vance delivered a speech at the Claremont Institute, a conservative think-tank, in which he painted America in starkly different terms than Mr Ramaswamy. “I think that people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong,” he said. Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, said she has been a target of anti-immigrant sentiment and that attacks have increased during her nearly nine years in Congress. She recalled conversations from two decades ago with immigrants employed at Microsoft who she said at that time felt somewhat immune from ostracism because of their status. Now, she said, immigrants like them feel vulnerable. “People understand this is an attack on all of us,” she said, “as Indian Americans, as immigrants, as naturalised citizens.”","url":"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/vivek-ramaswamy-challenges-conservatives-on-surging-bigotry-on-the-right-125122000383_1.html","image":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-02/25/full/1740445962-5427.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 08:33:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.129},{"id":387777040,"title":"Silent Trump flees growing storm over Epstein 'cover-up' as he jets off for holidays without ANY comment","text":"President Donald Trump remained silent amid accusations of a 'cover-up' after the release of thousands of files related to convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein.\n\nThe president hyped the economy while speaking at a rally in North Carolina on Friday night but refused to address the growing outrage over his refusal to release all the documents related to Epstein.\n\nThe Department of Justice released more than 300,000 pages of evidence connected with the case - including images of Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. \n\nHowever, there are still many files that were left redacted in defiance of Congress. There has been rampant speculation that the administration was protecting powerful people implicated in Epstein's crimes.\n\nAfter the rally, Trump flew to Mar-a-Lago amid a growing chorus of criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. \n\nRepublican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna - who pushed to release the files - said that Trump's release was insufficient.\n\n'Unfortunately, today’s document release by [Attorney General Pam Bondi] grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago,' Massie wrote. \n\nCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for Attorney General Pam Bondi to resign. \n\n'Now the coverup is out in the open,' Ocasio-Cortez said. 'Protecting a bunch of rapists and pedophiles because they have money, power, and connections. Bondi should resign tonight.' \n\nRepublicans like Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene were also unsatisfied with the release. \n\nMace tweeted out several hours after the drop: 'RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES'\n\nGreene called the redactions 'not MAGA' and said the insufficient drop had some Republicans 'raging and walking away.' \n\nCNN anchor Jake Tapper took out his phone and scrolled through hundreds of blacked out pages while live on air.\n\n'It’s all black. It’s just 100 pages of redaction,' Tapper complained. 'That’s the transparency we’re getting here.'\n\nAt least six of Epstein's victims have broken their silence to express disappointment with the files released by the Trump administration. \n\nMarina Lacerda, one of the women who claims she survived sexual assault by Epstein beginning when she was 14 years old, said she wanted to see greater transparency. \n\n'Just put out the files,' she said. 'And stop redacting names that don't need to be redacted.'\n\nJess Michaels, one of Epstein's earliest known victims, had similar concerns in a discussion with The New York Times. \n\n'They are proving everything we have been saying about corruption and delayed justice,' she said. 'What are they protecting? The coverup continues.'\n\nThe president commented briefly on failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the rally, noting that it was more fun to beat her in the election than Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\n'She's nasty. I wouldn’t want to go home to her,' Trump said about Hillary Clinton. \n\n'She was a nasty b—person. I was going to use a ‘B’ word but my wife would not be happy.'\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton was seen in released images from Epstein's estate while relaxing in a swimming pool and sitting on a plane with a woman. \n\nTrump appeared to be mentioned just once in the files. It was alleged that Epstein introduced Trump to a 14-year-old girl at Mar-a-Lago where Trump said, 'This is a good one, right?'\n\nTrump has insisted that he banned his former friend Epstein from his Florida estate once he discovered the financier was trafficking young women.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Trump hosted an event in the Oval Office to talk about lower prescription drug prices but did not take questions from the press.\n\nHe also ignored the press as he left the White House and boarding Air Force One for North Carolina.\n\nMore than 600,000 pages related to the pedophile have now been released this year, prompting the Trump administration to describe itself as the 'most transparent in history' following Friday's disclosure.\n\nThe Justice Department has said additional materials will be unsealed and released before the end of the year.\n\nThe DOJ posted the documents on its website, organizing the material into four separate data sets.\n\nThe trove includes images from Epstein's homes, including rooms adorned with nude photographs and distinctive bright blue carpeting.\n\nClinton protested the release of the photos, as a spokesman accused the DOJ of 'shielding' President Trump and 'stalling' the full release.\n\n'Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats,' the statement read.\n\nOthers accused the Justice Department of redacting too many details in the released documents.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche insisted that the redactions were necessary to protect the identities of victims.\n\n\"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law — full stop,' he told Fox News. 'There are no redactions of famous people.'\n\nSenior Trump officials reacted on social media to some of the photos of Clinton.\n\n'Oh my!' exclaimed Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, on X in reaction to the photos.\n\n'Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman… that boy up to somethin,' wrote White House Communications Director Steven Cheung, sharing a photo of Clinton with a woman who's identity was redacted on X. \n\nAn initial review indicates the documents released today originate from three separate investigations into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes against young women.\n\nMany of the files appear to stem from a 2005 police investigation in Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a federal probe that culminated in Epstein's controversial 2008 plea deal.\n\nOthers relate to a later investigation launched by Manhattan prosecutors in 2019 - a case that was never finished after Epstein died in jail while awaiting trial.\n\nBeing named or pictured in the files is not necessarily an indication of wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. \n\nAhead of the release on Friday, President Trump refused to answer questions about the release of the documents after an event with pharmaceutical company executives in the Oval Office on Friday, saying he didn't want to 'spoil' the event by allowing the media to ask 'questions having to do with anything else.'\n\n'I won't even take questions today, because there's no way I can take questions that are anywhere comparable to what you just witnessed,' Trump declared. \n\nFriday's dump of documents also revealed that Epstein once received a novelty check for $22,500 from Trump. \n\nThe name in the signature line reads very different from Trump's famous signature these days, but clearly reads in the designated space 'D.

A Government source said that the Budget in November was seen as a success “because no one was forced to resign over it”.\n\n‘We need to tell people about the good things’\n\nThe key, according to Starmer and many others in Labour, is to improve the communications. “We can’t just say that we’re fixing problems, we need to tell people about the good things we are doing in their lives,” one Government adviser said. “And there is quite a lot of it but voters don’t know about it.”\n\nThe Prime Minister told the Cabinet immediately after the Budget that ministers should now focus their efforts on promoting initiatives such as freezes to bus fares, train tickets and prescription charges; the removal of £150 worth of levies from energy bills; and the rollout of free breakfast clubs in schools. \n\nMeanwhile, his right-hand man, chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, told a meeting of special advisers to take inspiration from Australia, whose centre-left leader Anthony Albanese won re-election through concentrating on the cost of living.\n\nStarmer is now considering making a speech on the issue early next month.\n\nAn MP said: “We all have a role to play. If you can’t sell that we’re lifting half a million children out of poverty, that we’re increasing the minimum wage, that we’re helping parents with the cost of school uniforms and giving free breakfasts then that’s on you.”\n\nA different backbencher agreed that living costs were “what my constituents care most about” and called on ministers to be “much clearer about what we’re doing, why we’re doing it”.\n\nThey said that it had never been more challenging to be in Government, pointing for example to a profusion of anti-Labour channels on YouTube, many of which spread fake news. “That means we have to be even better to counterbalance that environment,” the MP added.\n\nBut at the same time as trying to communicate more with the public – including by launching his own TikTok account and a Substack newsletter – Starmer this week moved to shut down transparency by cutting the number of weekly media briefings offered by No 10 from eight to five. \n\nThe scrapped briefings would be replaced by “occasional” press conferences with ministers at which online influencers and a small number of hand-picked journalists will be able to ask questions, Downing Street comms chief Tim Allan said.\n\nThe gambit has appalled some Labour veterans who believe the party must take every opportunity to spread its message. \n\nOne source said: “When the country isn’t listening and the papers aren’t convinced, the answer isn’t turn off one of the mics. It’s grab every single one, crank up the volume, make your argument.”\n\nBig test comes in May\n\nThe big test of Starmer’s leadership, and whether his policies really are starting to shift the dial as allies hope, will come in May at elections for the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments, as well as local councils across much of England.\n\nReform UK strategists are expecting big gains in the most pro-Brexit areas of the country. A party source joked: “Sometimes I just lie in bed thinking about how great the local election areas are for us. Sunderland, Dudley – it’s perfect. Everywhere except the shires!”\n\nAnd Wales has become apparently a two-horse race between Reform and Plaid Cymru, ending a century of Labour domination there. \n\nA poll this week showed Starmer’s party on just 10 per cent – which for one MP is more evidence that the leader must go.\n\n“This is extinction level stuff,” they said. “I personally can’t see a scenario where he takes us into the next election. I even wonder whether he might just decide to do what is right himself and step down to allow for someone else to come in.”\n\nAnother Labour MP dismissed claims that removing Starmer would be disloyal to the man who engineered last year’s general election victory, insisting: “It’s precisely because I know how bad a Reform government would be for my constituents that I will do whatever is needed to stop that happening and keep Labour in power.”\n\nThe problem for the Prime Minister’s critics is that there is still no obvious replacement. Andy Burnham is outside Parliament, Angela Rayner – who is currently writing a memoir and is widely tipped for a return to the Cabinet in 2026 – risks still being tarred by the controversy over her taxes, and Wes Streeting may prove too right-wing for Labour activists to accept. \n\n“You just have to keep plodding on,” one MP said.\n\nAnother Labour source said: “I don’t believe that there will be a leadership move after the May elections, that is the narrative every year and it pretty much never happens. \n\n“The truth is they don’t have a viable candidate who actually gets better numbers than Starmer, so they don’t have any momentum. I suspect that after a couple of weeks the local election results are forgotten and nothing has happened.” \n\nAnd a Government insider predicted that MPs would “get scared” by the prospect of party members choosing a new leader well to the left of Starmer.\n\nTories showing signs of recovery\n\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives appear convinced that their recovery is in full swing, after a marked improvement in Kemi Badenoch’s performance at weekly bouts of Prime Minister’s Questions. \n\nSpeaking to the 1922 Committee of backbenchers on Wednesday, the leader said: “Next year won’t be easy. We lost the trust of the public. But we can turn it around… and we will do it in one term.” A member of her shadow Cabinet joked: “We got dumped by the electorate because we’d let ourselves go. We need a glow-up!”\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, too, are generally optimistic. Their rating in nationwide opinion polls has plateaued this year, but they have made key gains in council by-elections. \n\nSome mutterings are beginning to start among MPs who fear that voters do not know what Sir Ed Davey stands for, however – one said: “We need to have a stronger brand, a stronger message. But there’s still time for that.”\n\nAnd the Greens, along with Reform, have been the big success story of the year under their energetic new leader Zack Polanski. \n\nThey have been squeezing Labour from the left, although Starmer’s team remain confident of dealing with them in time for the next general election.\n\n“The Greens will get a lot more scrutiny as we get closer to an election and people will start to understand what their policies are,” a senior Government source said. \n\n“Will 20 per cent of people really vote for those policies?”\n\nThey insisted that “there is only room for two parties”, adding that Starmer will copy the strategy of Emmanuel Macron who won two elections by saying “you have to vote for me to keep out the far right” – an argument you can expect to hear more and more loudly from Labour throughout 2026.","url":"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/labour-extinction-level-threat-reform-greens-4121106","image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SEI_278510603.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C1196px%2C675px&resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 06:00:00","author":"Hugo Gye","authors":["Hugo Gye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":387774752,"title":"‘Hillary Was Nasty’: Trump Says He Almost Used The ‘B Word’ For Clinton At Carolina Rally","text":"US President Donald Trump on Friday reflected on his past election victories during a rally in Rocky Point, North Carolina, comparing his 2016 win against Hillary Clinton with his 2024 election success.

This release, which occurred on 19 December 2025, follows months of political pressure and a legal mandate under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.Among the documents released are photographs and records that include notable public figures. The Indian Express reported that former President Bill Clinton appears in several images, including one where he is seen with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate.Other celebrities mentioned in the documents include Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, and Kevin Spacey. The publication noted that being named or pictured does not imply involvement in Epstein's crimes.“The release of these documents is a significant step towards transparency regarding Epstein's network,” said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.The release was mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which requires the Justice Department to disclose unclassified records related to Epstein and Maxwell. The report indicated that more documents are expected to be released in the coming weeks.Deepfake Video of Bill Clinton Shared as Him Talking About Epstein’s Client ListDespite the extensive release, many sections of the documents remain redacted to protect victims and ongoing investigations. The publication further reported that the Justice Department acknowledged that the release is incomplete and additional disclosures are anticipated.In the released files, Clinton is depicted in various settings, including a private plane and a pool, alongside Maxwell. The report highlighted that Clinton's spokesperson stated he had no knowledge of Epstein's criminal activities.Other notable figures, such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, also appear in the documents. The publication reiterated that the presence of these individuals in the files does not equate to any wrongdoing.The release of these documents has sparked renewed interest in Epstein's connections with powerful individuals and the extent of his criminal activities. The report added that the public is eager to learn more about the implications of these connections.As the investigation continues, the Justice Department is expected to provide Congress with a summary of what has been released and what remains withheld. The publication noted that the law mandates transparency, but it also allows for redactions to protect sensitive information.This Image of US VP Kamala Harris Posing With Jeffrey Epstein Is AlteredNote: This article is produced using AI-assisted tools and is based on publicly available information.
