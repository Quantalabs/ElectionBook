The list includes not one but two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump, the murder of a health insurance executive, the murder of two Israeli Embassy staffers, the murder of Catholic schoolchildren in Minneapolis, the shooting of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the firebombing of a pro-Israel march in Colorado, and the burning of Tesla vehicles. If one looks a little further back to 2017, there was the assassination attempt by a leftist gunman who shot Republican members of Congress while they practiced for their annual baseball game against Democrats.\n\nSome of these incidents have been properly condemned by Democratic officials, and the killing of Kirk has been met by elected Democrats with dignified and appropriate comments. These restrained responses suggest two things. First, Democrats may feel chastened by the enormity of what has just taken place, recognizing that the murder of a young married father of two who spent his life talking calmly and reasonably in an effort to persuade college students defies their usual efforts to turn any shooting into a debate about the ready availability of guns. Second, one hopes it also betokens an understanding that members of their party have been guilty of treating past incidents cynically or with levity and that they have grievously polluted our politics with a casual attitude toward violence.\n\nAfter the attempted assassination of Trump, some Democrats belittled the event and made a punchline of jokes, as was the case with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). Other incidents, notably Luigi Mangione’s killing of a healthcare executive, have been outright celebrated by many on the Left, including by prominent late-night talk show hosts, as has the burning of Teslas and Tesla car lots. Few Democrats bothered even to comment on a conspiracy to kill ICE agents in Texas.\n\nAmericans simply must not ignore how Democrats’ rhetoric is fueling this wave of atrocities.\n\nOn MSNBC, just minutes after Kirk was shot, but before his death was confirmed, Texas Democrat Matthew Dowd chose to blame the victim, saying, “He has been one of the most divisive younger figures in this, who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech, aimed at certain groups. And I always go back to, hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which often then to hateful actions.” That’s very nearly, “It’s his own fault; he had it coming.”\n\nIt escapes Dowd, who might be the least self-aware man on the planet, that Democrats are the principal purveyors of hateful words, which they aim at conservatives and their ideas. They simply will not accept that people of good faith can disagree with them. And their hateful words have been followed by hateful actions.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the Democratic Party’s 2024 presidential candidate, called Trump a “fascist” who was seeking “unchecked” power.\n\nGov. Tim Walz (D-MN), the Democratic Party’s 2024 vice presidential candidate, called Trump’s government a “Gestapo.” He has called Trump a “wannabe dictator” and advised Democrats, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner, maybe it’s time for us to be a little more fierce.”\n\nGov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), a leading contender for the Democratic Party’s 2028 presidential nomination, pandered to his base by comparing Trump’s government to Nazi Germany and advised his followers, “If we don’t want to repeat history, then for God’s sake, in this moment, we better be strong enough to learn from it.”\n\nWhen failed Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke called Trump a Nazi on Newsom’s podcast, Newsom nodded along in agreement, which isn’t surprising because Newsom has also compared Republicans to Nazis.\n\nAs this publication noted just days ago, after the Catholic school shooting in Minnesota, “You can only call Trump and the Republican Party ‘Nazis’ and ‘threats to democracy’ so many times before your supporters start taking you seriously.”\n\nMany Democrats have taken their leaders’ reckless words as gospel truth rather than the hideous lies that they are. A recent Rutgers University study found that 55% of self-identifying “liberals” believe killing the president is a justifiable means of pursuing their political goals. A large survey published by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression this week found that over a third of college students said violence was at least sometimes acceptable to stop speeches on college campuses.\n\nWhich is what Kirk was doing when he was shot on Wednesday — he was speaking about controversial topics on a college campus.\n\nThe Democratic Party is adrift without a positive vision for the future of the country beyond rent control, defunding the police, and government-run grocery stores. But it is impossible to deny the link between its histrionic rhetoric toward conservatives and the pattern of political violence we are now witnessing.\n\nWe hope Democrats will take the shooting of Kirk as a reflection point to tone down the demonization of people who disagree with them politically.","summary":"Charlie Kirk was a national leader of young conservatives.

Kirk pressed, flipping the script on his interviewer.\n\n'I completely agree with you on that,' conceded Newsom. 'It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair.'\n\nThe Left was outraged, upset over Newsom's admission and, perhaps more, by the way he legitimized Kirk, who had come a very long way.\n\nFrom 18-year-old college dropout, to builder of a $100 million-a-year political action group, to close ally of President Donald Trump and now - at just 31 years old - interrogator of a likely Democratic White House hopeful, the future for Kirk was, indeed, promising. \n\nBut on Wednesday, Kirk, was shot and killed while appearing at an event for his organization, Turning Point, on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.\n\nThe gathering of hundreds of students was part of his movement's 'America Comeback Tour.' A campaign for which he was always the star.\n\nThe presumed political assassination has sparked bipartisan shock and outrage - even in a country riven by political violence. \n\nThe shooting comes two days after the start of the trial of a man charged with attempting to assassinate Trump. Ryan Routh, 59, aimed a rifle at Trump through a fence at his West Palm Beach golf course in September 2024.\n\nAnd that incident followed just two months after the first attempt on Trump's life: in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet whiz past Trump's head, clipping his right, leaving the presidential candidate bloodied but defiant.\n\nKirk, a devout Christian, said at the time that Trump was saved by divine intervention, suggesting a 'gust of wind' may have 'pushed that bullet ever so slightly.' He added that 'the Holy Spirit in scripture is often associated with a gust of wind. God's hand is on Donald Trump.'\n\nOn Tuesday night, less than 24 hours before his midday appearance in Utah, Kirk, as usual, was in the midst of the action.\n\nHis latest remarks, delivered on his chart-topping conservative podcast, were being dissected by a CNN panel.\n\nKirk had claimed that a black man who fatally stabbed a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina on August 22 had been motivated by race hatred. Van Jones, a liberal CNN commentator, strongly rejected Kirk's argument, calling it 'race-mongering' and 'hate-mongering.'\n\nIn his final post on X, Kirk wrote: 'If we want things to change, it's 100% necessary to politicize the senseless murder of Iryna Zarutska because it was politics that allowed a savage monster with 14 priors to be free on the streets to kill her.'\n\nIndeed, it was Kirk's personal mission to take the rhetorical fight to his – and more recently, Donald Trump's – political opponents.\n\n'Trump won,' Doug Deason, a major Republican and Turning Point donor, told the New York Times in February. 'But would he have won it without Charlie? I don't know.'\n\nFor his part, Kirk wasn't bashful about claiming credit for his work.\n\n'High school boys are the most conservative that they have been in the last 50 years,' he told a room of political backers at Turning Point's annual donor meeting in December.\n\nThe 2024 exit polls, he pointed out, showed that compared with 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had lost up to 24 percentage points of support among voters under 30 in six of seven swing states.\n\n'The youth vote won Trump the White House,' Kirk boasted.\n\nThough, perhaps surprisingly, Kirk was initially on the fence about Donald Trump.\n\nAs late as the Republican National Convention in 2016, Kirk was quoted saying that he 'was not the world's biggest Donald Trump fan.' He was won, he says, by the younger generation of Trumps - Don Jr, Eric and Lara Trump – who saw the articulate and passionate youngster's potential and working to bring the then-22-year-old into the fold.\n\n'I traveled the country for about 70 days straight carrying Donald Trump Jr.'s bags and getting his Diet Cokes,' Kirk told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in February 2019. 'Helping book flights and taking pictures and coordinating media, essentially being the youth director of the campaign and also being Don Jr.'s body man.'\n\nThe president also took note. He began to see Kirk as the voice of a pro-Trump generation, and a vital link to younger voters.\n\nKirk's passions - backing conservative Christian values; raging against the indoctrination of students and DEI initiatives - fed into Trump's own policy platform.\n\nIt was Kirk who first coined the term 'China Virus' to describe COVID-19; a term Trump would co-opt with great relish. And Trump regularly retweeted Kirk's musings and invited the young activist to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.\n\nKirk, in turn, transformed his proximity to the president into a media and activism powerhouse. He published five books, and launched his own podcast and YouTube channel, which has 3.8 million subscribers.\n\nBorn to a mental health counselor mother and architect father in the northwestern suburb of Arlington Heights, Kirk always said his family was conservative, but not particularly political.\n\nA young Kirk was an Eagle Scout, and dreamed of getting into West Point, the US military academy which trains officers.\n\nIn a 2015 speech to the Conservative Forum of Silicon Valley, he said getting into the Army was his 'No. 1 dream in life', but that he was passed over in favor of 'a far less-qualified candidate of a different gender and a different persuasion.'\n\nThe rejection appears to have been pivotal: around that time, in 2012, he wrote an opinion piece for the right-wing website Breitbart railing against the indoctrination of teenagers by liberal textbooks.\n\nKirk then enrolled at Harper College, a community college in the Chicago suburbs, but dropped out on the encouragement of Bill Montgomery, a conservative businessman who became Kirk's mentor, and with whom Kirk co-founded Turning Point in 2012 at the age of 18.\n\nKirk took TPUSA, as it became known, and grew it into a machine focused on 'freedom, free markets, and limited government.'\n\nAlong the way, he made powerful friends and courted deep-pocketed allies: Foster Friess, an evangelical Christian businessman, gave TPUSA its first mega donation, with Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus's foundation soon opening its checkbook.\n\nThe DeVos family - relatives of Trump's first education secretary Betsy DeVos - donated heavily, and wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, Ginni Thomas, sat on TPUSA's board.\n\nIn 2016 the two nonprofit entities, Turning Point USA and the political-action organization Turning Point Action, reported a total revenue of $4.3 million: by 2023, that had rocketed to $92.4 million.\n\nSuch was Kirk's power that, at the inauguration in January, a Daily Beast reporter tweeted: ''Charlie Kirk has better seats than every member of Congress. Tells you how little Trump thinks of Congress,' one GOP lawmaker tells me.'\n\nSenator Jim Banks, a Republican of Indiana, replied 20 minutes later: 'Charlie Kirk has done more than most members of congress combined to get us to this point today.'\n\nKirk leaves behind his wife, former beauty queen Erica Frantzve Kirk, 36, whom he married in May 2021 – and their two children, a three-year-old daughter and a 16-month-old son.","summary":"From college dropout to builder of a $100 million-a-year political action group, to close ally to Trump and interrogator of a likely Democratic White House hopeful.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15086671/Charlie-Kirk-shot-killed-turning-point.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/11/01/102026573-0-image-a-35_1757550553966.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-11 00:33:16","author":"Editor,Harriet Alexander","authors":["Editor","Harriet Alexander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":359395110,"title":"Prominent Trump ally shot dead","text":"By Eric Bradner, CNN\n\n(CNN) — Charlie Kirk, a conservative political activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, has died after being shot at an event at Utah Valley University, President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. He was 31.\n\nAs Trump remade the Republican Party, Kirk embodied the party’s newfound populist conservatism in the social media age. Trump has credited Kirk with galvanizing and mobilizing the youth vote for him.\n\n“No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie,” the president wrote. “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.”\n\nKirk’s sudden death Wednesday sent shockwaves across the political spectrum, with Republicans and Democrats calling for an end to political violence at a time of heightened concern about deadly attacks and the targeting of public officials.\n\nLast year, a gunman attempted to assassinate Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. In April, a man was arrested in connection with an arson at the Pennsylvania governor’s house as Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family slept inside. In June, a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were assassinated in their home.\n\nKirk, himself a college dropout, was influential with college students and young voters — not only in helping to elect Trump to the presidency but also to inspire a new movement of conservative activists. His involvement began in the wake of the tea party movement and grew with Trump’s ascendance.\n\nHaving co-founded Turning Point in 2012 at the age of 18, Kirk was a prominent supporter of Trump who courted young voters and used his network of nonprofits to seek to turn out voters on campuses and churches for Trump in 2024.\n\nKirk frequently traveled to college campuses, speaking and taking questions from audience members in exchanges that often led to viral videos. Kirk’s appearance at Utah Valley University on Wednesday was the first of a 14-city fall “American Comeback Tour.” He was answering a question about mass shootings when gunfire rang out.\n\nAmong those in attendance was former US Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican. He said on Fox News he was at the event with his wife, daughter and son-in-law. He said Kirk “came out, he was throwing hats, riling up the crowd.”\n\n“I was watching Charlie. I can’t say that I saw blood. I can’t say that I saw him get hit, but I did see him fall immediately backwards into his left,” he said.\n\nThe American Comeback Tour had Kirk’s signature “Prove Me Wrong Table,” where he would urge those who disagreed with him to debate an issue.\n\nKirk traveled with a private security contingent, a Turning Point USA aide traveling on the tour told CNN, whether he was speaking to large rallies like the one in Orem, Utah, or at smaller events.\n\nThe president and dozens of other Kirk allies – as well as Democrats who had sharp disagreements with him – posted calls for prayer online in the wake of the shooting.\n\nKirk most recently appeared in the Oval Office in May, attending the swearing-in ceremony of Judge Jeanine Pirro as US attorney for Washington, DC.\n\nKirk argued Trump was saving the American dream\n\nKirk was known for debating college students about abortion rights, which he opposed; climate change, which he downplayed; and transgender rights, which he rejected. He frequently sought to rally young people around traditional gender roles. He also backed Trump’s mass deportation efforts.\n\nKirk spoke at the last three Republican conventions. In 2024, he said that marriage and home ownership were elusive for too many young Americans, and faulted former President Joe Biden.\n\n“Under Biden, our young people own nothing and they are miserable. Donald Trump refuses to accept this fake, pathetic, mutilated version of the American dream,” he said. “Donald Trump is on a rescue mission to revive your birthright, one your grandparents and those before them gave everything to hand down to you.”\n\nKirk was an outspoken advocate for gun rights.\n\nAt an April 2023 Turning Point USA Faith event, he said that “you will never live in a society when you have an armed citizenry and you won’t have a single gun death.”\n\nBut, Kirk added, “I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.”\n\nHaving once advocated for the separation of church and state, Kirk embraced more religious themes in recent years and often spoke about politics in apocalyptic terms.\n\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2020, he praised Trump for understanding “the seven mountains of cultural influence” — a reference to a Christian nationalist movement that calls on believers to exert influence in government, media, education, business, arts and entertainment, family and religion.\n\nOn the campaign trail with Trump in Georgia last year, Kirk referred to the contest against then-Vice President Kamala Harris as “a spiritual battle” and said the election was “civilizational defining.”\n\n“These next 12 days will define the future of our republic,” he said in the late October rally. “The forces of darkness have tried everything they possibly can.”\n\nHe started in politics as a teenager\n\nKirk got his first experience in politics as a student at Wheeling High School in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, when he volunteered for the winning 2010 Senate campaign of Republican former Sen. Mark Kirk.\n\nHe earned national attention in 2012 when, as a high school senior, he wrote in Breitbart News that high school students were being indoctrinated by liberal textbooks. He briefly attended Harper College, but dropped out to become a full-time conservative activist, and went on to argue that college is unnecessary for many people.\n\nKirk and retired businessman and conservative activist Bill Montgomery co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012. The two had met when Kirk was 18, at a speaking engagement at Benedictine University that followed his Breitbart piece. The organization was quickly backed by a roster of major Republican donors, including Foster Friess.\n\nHe went on to become a best-selling author and well-known media personality who hosted a daily three-hour show.\n\nIn 2021, Kirk married Erika Frantzve, with whom he shared two young children.\n\nPeople who knew Kirk described him as an intense thinker with an analytic mind.\n\nHe was seen as understanding the pulse of the young conservative movement and the “Make America Great Again” base. He had a direct line to Trump and could count on the president valuing his opinion even if they disagreed.\n\nRepublicans had floated the idea of Kirk eventually running for office in Arizona, which his group worked to flip back to Trump’s column last year.\n\nHe reveled in debating people with whom he disagreed – with video of his fights with liberals often being shared by both sides in the argument – and believed he could change minds through conversation, something his allies and fans noted Wednesday.\n\n“If you actually watch Charlie’s events — as opposed to the fake summaries — they are one of the few places with open and honest dialogue between left and right,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Instead of climbing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said producer prices for final demand fell 0.1 percent in August.\n\nEconomists had expected a 0.3 percent gain, once again showing that Wall Street’s establishment economists are still attached to the tarifflation narrative. Year-over-year, PPI rose just 2.6 percent, far below forecasts of 3.3 percent.\n\nThe revision to July also tilted the trend lower, with the prior 0.9 percent jump reduced to 0.7 percent. Reality has undercut the claim that tariffs would produce a cascade of price hikes.\n\nMargins Collapse Again and Goods Prices Barely Budged\n\nThe biggest drag on prices came from services, where prices dropped 0.2 percent. The most important driver was a 1.7 percent plunge in “trade services,“ the Bureau of Labor Statistics measurement of markups wholesalers and retailers charge. Businesses are clearly absorbing higher costs rather than passing them on. If tariffs were a “national sales tax” on consumers, as Kamala Harris and countless Wall Street economists claimed, these margins should be holding steady or rising. Instead, they are shrinking—just as they did in April and June.\n\nFinal demand goods edged up just 0.1 percent, thanks to declining energy prices. Excluding energy and food prices, final demand goods prices climbed 0.3 percent. Service prices fell 0.2 percent.\n\nPrices of personal consumption goods were completely flat for the month, indicating that consumers are not being squeezed by tariffs. Personal home electronic equipment prices were flat. Household appliance prices fell 0.5 percent. Car prices climbed just 0.2 percent. Household furniture prices rose 0.2 percent, and commercial furniture prices were flat. Clothing prices for men and boys declined 0.1 percent, and clothing prices for women and girls were flat.\n\nThis is not inflation but relative price shifts between categories. If tariffs are driving some prices higher, these are being more than offset by declining prices elsewhere. As the Council of Economic Advisers has noted, many analysts and pundits are confusing relative price changes with inflation. There will always be some of the former. What we’re not seeing is the latter.\n\nEven further back in the supply chain, the story is the same. Processed goods prices rose 0.4 percent, but unprocessed goods fell 1.1 percent, driven by a 2.8 percent drop in crude oil. Intermediate services ticked up 0.3 percent. These are modest, mixed signals—nothing like the sweeping surge that tariff critics promised. The inflationary story stops at the warehouse door.\n\nFrom Lonely Argument to Mainstream View\n\nFor months, we’ve argued that tariffs are not hitting consumers with higher prices but squeezing margins for businesses and exporters. That was a lonely position to defend for the first half of this year. Now it’s fast becoming the conventional wisdom.\n\nOn CNBC’s Squawk Box Tuesday, Mohamed El-Erian said:\n\n“There’s the exporter, the importer, and the consumer. And so far the consumer is carrying the least of the burden. … They’re finding out that they cannot pass through as much of the price increases as they want. And that is particularly true for those who sell to lower income consumers. So what we’re getting is that this has to be absorbed, either by the exporter or importer…What we’re learning is that the final impact on the consumer is much less than people expected.”\n\nThat’s exactly what the PPI shows: margins squeezed, costs absorbed, and consumers shielded. The tarifflation narrative is dead.\n\nThe Case for a Bigger Fed Cut\n\nThe Fed has long insisted it is “data dependent.” If that’s true, the latest data leave little choice but to ease more aggressively.\n\nProducer prices fell instead of rising. Payroll growth was far weaker than previously thought. Benchmark revisions wiped out nearly a million jobs.\n\nOn CNBC, Mohamed El-Erian put it bluntly: these numbers point to a 50-basis-point rate cut. The Fed can keep pretending tariffs are fueling inflation, or it can recognize what the data show: costs are being absorbed, inflation is contained, and growth is slowing.\n\nThe time has come for a big cut in rates, followed by a series of cuts to bring rates down from their currently restrictive stance.","summary":"The August producer price report delivered yet another blow to the doomsayers who predicted President Donald Trump’s tariffs would ignite inflation.\n\n\nThe post Breitbart Business Digest: Producer Prices Fall Again, as the Tarifflation Narrative Collapses appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/09/10/breitbart-business-digest-producer-prices-fall-again-as-the-tarifflation-narrative-collapses/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/09/bbd-tariffs-9-10-25-getty-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 23:50:31","author":"John Carney","authors":["John Carney"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.427},{"id":359387332,"title":"Charlie Kirk's beliefs: Kirk's shocking remarks over women and their career goals days before his death- Here's what he said","text":"Charlie Kirk, prominent conservative activist, just a few days before he died, talked about family, faith, and the choices that young women in America have to make.

He was 31.\n\nTrump confirmed the death on his social media site, Truth Social.\n\nKirk had just taken the stage at the event, at Utah Valley University, when he was shot in the neck shortly after noon. He was taken to a hospital, where he was later declared dead.\n\n>> Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk fatally shot in Utah; ‘person of interest’ in custody\n\nKirk was perhaps the leading voice among a cohort of young conservative activists who emerged during the Trump era. He had little connection to, or respect for, the Republican establishment, or for the ideas that traditionally undergirded the conservative movement.\n\nInstead, he showed a genius for using social media and campus organizing to build a following, which he then presented to donors and Trump-adjacent politicians to gain more resources and access.\n\nBy the end of 2024, he was considered something of a kingmaker. He had been an early champion of selecting Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as Trump’s running mate. Several of his biggest donors received positions in the Trump administration, and he was central in rallying support behind embattled Cabinet nominees like Pete Hegseth, who was accused of sexual assault after Trump chose him to be secretary of defense.\n\nHe likewise rallied his supporters against Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, who he said was not sufficiently supportive of Trump. She resigned in early 2024.\n\nKirk never sought a position within the administration. Instead, it became clear over the last year that his ambition was for something much larger: reshaping the Republican Party and, beyond that, American politics itself.\n\n“We want to transform the culture,” he told The New York Times Magazine in February.\n\nKirk was 18 when he founded Turning Point USA in 2012, conceiving it as a conservative response to liberal organizing platforms like MoveOn.org. He drew significant early support from Republican donors like Foster Friess and members of the Trump family like the president’s son Donald Jr., who were attracted by his fresh face and bold pitch for gaining ground among young voters.\n\nHe quickly became a fixture in the Trumpian media sphere. He tweeted relentlessly with a brash right-wing spin, including inflammatory comments about Jewish, gay and Black people. Even some conservatives found his approach distasteful, but not Donald Trump: One sign of Kirk’s ascendance was how often Trump retweeted him.\n\nBy the start of the first Trump administration in 2017, Kirk was already in regular rotation on the conservative TV pundit circuit and an in-demand speaker among right-wing organizations. He proved to be a captivating speaker and an extremely capable debater, with a gift for bringing coherence to the president’s often logically fraught statements.\n\nHe was equally influential within the administration. He claimed to have visited the White House about 100 times during the first Trump term, including for meetings to discuss nominations and high-level personnel decisions.\n\nKirk was far from the only young face to emerge in the Trump movement. But whereas activists like Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulos went too far too early in their embrace of baldly racist and homophobic ideas, Kirk had an innate polish and was able to tack quickly among far-right activists, establishment Republicans and skeptical young voters.\n\nHe focused his activism on what he characterized as rampant Marxism and gender ideology on college campuses. He encouraged students to report professors whom they suspected of embracing such ideas, and he did the same in appealing to parents and grade school students.\n\nTurning Point grew rapidly, adding dozens of campus chapters a year and largely displacing older conservative youth organizations like Young Americans for Freedom. He not only brought high-profile right-wing speakers to colleges; he provided training, networking and organizing, in the process creating a tight web of activists and future politicos.\n\nHe proved adept at packaging his public appearances with slick backdrops and high-value productions. He gave his speaking tours names: the “Exposing Critical Racism” (2021), “You’re Being Brainwashed” (2024).\n\nKirk rose even further into the conservative stratosphere during the early days of the pandemic, when he was quick to attack the World Health Organization — which, in his typical fashion, he called the “Wuhan Health Organization” — accusing it of hiding the source of COVID and claiming that it had emerged from a Chinese lab in the city of Wuhan. He later rallied opposition to school lockdowns and mask mandates.\n\nHe was so vocal in his willingness to spread unsupported claims and outright lies — he said that the drug hydroxychloroquine was “100% effective” in treating the virus, which it is not — that Twitter temporarily banned him in early March 2020. But that move only added to his notoriety and seemed to support his claim that he was being muzzled by a liberal elite.\n\nFollowing the 2020 election, Kirk led a “Stop the Steal” protest in Phoenix, embracing the false right-wing narrative that Trump had actually won the White House in his race against Joe Biden. He promised to send 80 “buses of patriots” to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day the election results were to be certified by Congress — to support the Trump. Only about seven buses arrived.\n\nUndaunted, Kirk was among the first to rally around Trump once he left office, traveling to Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Florida, to strategize a comeback. Like the president, Kirk sensed that the country was not done with Trumpism, and that they could use the new Biden administration as a foil.\n\nKirk grabbed hold of the opportunity with both hands. He created a new group, Turning Point Faith, to amplify the role of Christian nationalism within the Trump movement. He doubled down in his critique of the left, which he said had taken over campuses, corporate America and government.\n\nHe continued to provoke: During a speech in Mankato, Minnesota, in 2021, he referred to George Floyd, the Black man whose murder by a Minnesota police officer sparked protests, as a “scumbag”; at other times, he referred to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as “a bad man.”\n\nAnd he joined in Trump’s campaign against immigration, at times endorsing the so-called great replacement theory, the popular far-right idea that immigrants will soon displace white Americans — even adding an antisemitic twist to it.\n\n“Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them,” he said on “The Charlie Kirk Show” in 2023.\n\nFor a moment, it seemed as if such comments might signal the end of Kirk’s rise. Instead, he reached out to conservative Jewish donors and otherwise jittery Republicans, and at the 2024 Republican National Convention, in Milwaukee, he was given a prime speaking slot.\n\nThere was no secret to his staying power: He delivered results. He spent tens of millions of dollars on voter mobilization through Turning Point and other groups in the run-up to the presidential election. Trump won a surprising share of the youth vote, about 45% nationally, and drew even with Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in several swing states.\n\nAfter Trump’s victory, Kirk moved his family — his wife, Erika, and two young children — to a rented condo near Mar-a-Lago, so that he could participate in key discussions about the incoming administration.\n\nAnd to make his status as an ultimate insider clear, Turning Point held a gala event in Washington on the eve of the inauguration, at which some 1,500 people paid at least $5,000 a ticket to brush shoulders with the likes of Donald Trump Jr. and Kash Patel, who would become the FBI director.\n\nCharles James Kirk was born Oct. 14, 1993, in Arlington Heights, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. His father, Robert, an architect, and his mother, Kimberly, were active in conservative circles — his father was a major donor to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.\n\n“I started listening to Rush when I was a junior in high school,” Kirk told The New York Times Magazine, referring to right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh. “Listening, I was, like, ‘This guy is unbelievable!’”\n\nIn 2012, as a senior in high school, he wrote an opinion article for the conservative website Breitbart News criticizing the prominence of liberal economists like Paul Krugman in his textbooks. The article led to an appearance on Fox News, which in turn drew the attention of Bill Montgomery, a restaurateur and early supporter of the right-wing Tea Party movement.\n\nAfter Kirk explained his vision for bringing fresh conservative ideas to young voters, Montgomery urged him to skip college and start immediately. Kirk was accepted at Baylor University and briefly attended Harper College, in Palatine, Illinois, but soon took Montgomery’s advice and dropped out.\n\nHe founded Turning Point USA with support from Montgomery and Kirk’s father, who came up with the group’s name. He talked his way into the 2012 Republican National Convention, where he ran into Friess and gave him an impromptu pitch. Friess sent him a $10,000 check a few days later.\n\nOriginally based outside Chicago, Kirk relocated to the Phoenix area, where he spent the next decade building the Turning Point empire; eventually, his headquarters encompassed five buildings, several named for prominent donors.\n\nHe was not initially a Trump supporter; during the 2016 Republican primary, he first supported two other candidates, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and then Sen Ted Cruz of Texas. But he was won over to the Trump campaign after a meeting with Donald Jr., who brought him on as his social media coordinator.\n\nHe married Erika Frantzve, a former Miss Arizona, in 2021. His survivors include his wife and their two children. Citing their desire for privacy, the Kirks did not reveal their children’s names.\n\nAlthough he rarely touched on religion during his early years, Kirk increasingly embraced evangelical Christianity following the pandemic. He grew critical of gay rights and the separation of church and state, and began to cite Bible verses as support for his views.\n\nTo Kirk, Trump’s reelection demonstrated that his form of conservatism had moved from the fringes to the mainstream. He spoke frequently of an “American Renaissance.”\n\nOthers seemed to agree: This past spring, Kirk was the first guest to appear on a new podcast hosted by Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California.\n\nAnd he continued to build his support among young voters with his “Prove Me Wrong” tour, which brought him to Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Several hundred ecstatic onlookers cheered as he took the stage. He sat down and began to speak. Then came the sound of a gunshot.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"Charlie Kirk, a conservative wunderkind who through his radio show, books, political organizing and speaking tours did much to shape the hard-right movement that has coalesced around President Donald Trump, becoming a close ally of his, died Wednesday in Orem, Utah, after he had been shot while speaking at a college campus event.

They have filed a lawsuit against Director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, urging a federal judge to mandate their immediate reinstatement and prevent the perceived erosion of “the country’s national security.”\n\nThe lawsuit, presented in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accuses Patel, the FBI, Bondi, the DOJ, and the Executive Office of the President of infringing on the plaintiffs’ First and Fifth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs seek reinstatement and backpay for former Acting Director of the FBI Brian Driscoll, Jr., former Assistant Director in Charge Steven Jensen, and former Special Agent in Charge Spencer Evans. Driscoll and Jensen are represented by attorneys Christopher Mattei, Margaret Donovan, and Abbe Lowell, while Evans is represented by Mark Zaid, an attorney known for handling the Ukraine whistleblower case.\n\nThe complaint alleges that evidence of a “campaign of retribution” is rooted in an Aug. 6 encounter between Driscoll and Patel. According to the suit, Patel confessed that he was instructed to terminate anyone involved in criminal investigations against President Trump, implying his own job security was contingent on compliance. Patel allegedly stated that Trump “hasn’t forgotten” past attempts to “put” him “in jail.”\n\n“He explained he had to fire the people his superiors told him to fire, because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President. Patel explained that there was nothing he or Driscoll could do to stop these or any other firings, because ‘the FBI tried to put the President in jail and he hasn’t forgotten it,'” the complaint said. “Driscoll indicated his belief that Patel’s reference to his superiors meant DOJ and the White House, and Patel did not deny it.”\n\nThe lawsuit further stated that although Patel “knew” the actions were “likely illegal” and that he risked being sued and deposed, he proceeded with the dismissals. This renders his confirmation hearing assurances about avoiding political revenge on Trump’s behalf as hollow. The filing contained portions of Patel’s commitment that “no one will be terminated for case assignments.”\n\nIn a return to the scene for Emil Bove, Driscoll further recounted a conversation he had with the former Trump criminal defense attorney, before he became principal associate deputy attorney general and an eventual Trump lifetime appointee to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe suit said Driscoll told Bove he was uncomfortable with a political line of questioning that White House transition team member Paul Ingrassia subjected him to during an interview for a “high-level position at the FBI” about who he voted for, whether he thought FBI agents who “stormed” Mar-a-Lago to probe Trump should be “held accountable,” what his thoughts on DEI were, when he started supporting Trump, and if he “voted for a Democrat in the last five elections[.]”\n\nThe suit alleged that Patel, before he was confirmed as director, had told Driscoll in advance that he should pass the interview provided that Driscoll wasn’t a Democratic Party donor or voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“Driscoll did not respond to those comments. In total, the conversation between Patel and Driscoll lasted less than five minutes,” the suit claimed. “Prior to this call, Driscoll had never met or spoken with Patel.”\n\nBove, hearing Driscoll’s concerns and knowing he “failed” the interview, managed to change Ingrassia’s mind that Driscoll wasn’t “based out” enough, according to court documents.\n\n“Driscoll told Bove that he wanted nothing to do with the entire situation if it required him to violate the law, and that not only was he apolitical by nature, but that it was essential for the FBI to remain apolitical,” the suit continued.\n\nDriscoll said that he nonetheless went on to serve as acting director of the FBI — instead of the acting deputy director job he thought he was getting — for roughly one month from Trump’s second inauguration as president, apparently explained by a “clerical error.” From there, Bove, while acting deputy attorney general, commenced a purge in earnest of FBI agents assigned to Jan. 6 cases and allegedly accused Driscoll of leaking that to the press, which he denied.\n\nAfter Patel was confirmed in February, the suit said, Driscoll would not submit to his ask to “make a list of poor leaders within the FBI” but said he “instead intended to take some leave to spend time with his family, to which Patel stated that he understood and supported him.”\n\nDriscoll returned in March and was reassigned as FBI assistant director for the Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG). By early August, the administration was exerting pressure on Driscoll to force out FBI Supervisory Special Agent Chris Meyer, a military veteran, based on “incorrect[]” social media posts from “various online personalities” among Trump’s base that wrongly said Meyer “had been a signatory to the Mar-a-Lago search warrant affidavit and was now Patel’s personal pilot.”\n\n“In fact, Meyer was not the signatory to the Mar-a-Lago search warrant affidavit,” the suit said. “He was not the case agent for the investigation concerning President Trump’s handling of classified documents and he did not participate in the search of Mar-a-Lago.”\n\nThe plaintiff claimed that on Aug. 5, days before he was fired, he was told by Patel that Meyer was on the outs anyway.\n\n“Specifically, Driscoll stated that summarily firing Meyer would be illegal based on his military veteran status and would also violate all established FBI policies for adverse actions against personnel,” the complaint went on. “Patel responded that Meyer would be fired by Friday, August 8, 2025, and that there was nothing either Patel or Driscoll could say or do that would stop it.”\n\nPatel then allegedly admitted that the FBI would lose in court if sued over this. Three days later, Driscoll was fired by Patel for “fail[ing] to execute and perform requested tasks and issued communications to the FBI workforce that undermined the leadership of the Department of Justice,” allegedly engaging in “insubordination within the Bureau and weaken[ing] workforce morale” and failing to “timely respond to unapproved disclosure to the media of law enforcement sensitive information.”\n\nSteven Jensen, who worked on Jan. 6 cases, similarly alleged that he was pressured in May by former Fox News host turned Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino to fire military veteran and Special Agent Walter Giardina “based on nothing more than unfounded allegations that were ‘just out there[.]” Like Driscoll, Jensen was then fired in August.\n\nAnd Spencer Evans claims his firing letter cited “a lack of reasonableness and overzealousness in the implementation of COVID-19 protocols and policies” while deputy assistant director of the Human Resources Division (HRD) during the pandemic. From the suit, claiming there’s some evidence Patel had it out for Evans before the former was confirmed FBI director:\n\nEvans eventually moved on from HRD and transferred to become the SAC of the FBI’s Las Vegas Field Office in 2022. Unbeknownst to him at the time, a former FBI Special Agent who had been involuntarily discharged had been regularly posting about Evans on his social media pages and podcast. Shortly after January 2024, Evans learned that this ex-agent had been airing his grievances on social media against Evans and other FBI leaders since at least 2022 and had developed a close relationship with Patel.\nSince the inauguration, this ex-agent has claimed that he had advised Patel prior to his confirmation to fire Evans as soon as he was confirmed and that Patel had agreed. For example, he posted a screenshot of a text message that purports to show a text message between the ex-agent and then-nominee Patel where he stated, “THIS guy is the dude in charge of HR who PERSONALLY denied my request to not take a Covid test every 2 days in order to keep my job. And removed me. Good morning.” According to the posted communication, a contact named “Kash” replied, “He’s f—ed.”\n\nIn statements shared with Law&Crime, Driscoll, Jensen, and Evans each said the lawsuit was about rooting out politicization of the FBI.\n\n“The men and women of the FBI make countless sacrifices to accomplish the Bureau’s mission: protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution,” Driscoll said. “That’s why it is necessary to detail the politically-motivated actions that led to our firings. The American people deserve an FBI made up of professionals who can serve righteously and confidently, with no fear of inappropriately applied pressure or wrongful termination.”\n\nJensen added that he aim to “champion the values of truth and justice for those who continue to serve in the FBI” and “re-establish the highest standards of justice and ensure that every American, particularly those entrusted with immense authority of federal law enforcement, respects and obeys the law.”\n\nEvans likewise stated that “Americans should demand FBI leaders who make decisions based solely on the facts of an investigation and never on the desired outcome of one.”\n\nThe defendants have not yet responded to the lawsuit, and the FBI has reportedly declined to comment.\n\nThe plaintiffs’ lawyers, however, said their clients were simply “dismissed because they prioritized duty over politics.”\n\n“This lawsuit is not just about their rights as individuals. It is about protecting the institutional integrity of the FBI and ensuring that law enforcement can protect the American people without being targeted for partisan retribution,” the lawyers said. “Upholding the Constitution and the FBI’s independence is essential to our national security and democratic principles.”\n\nRead the lawsuit here.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi speaks during a ceremonial swearing-in of Kash Patel,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Dismissed FBI Officials File Lawsuit Against Kash Patel and Pam Bondi first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/dismissed-fbi-officials-file-lawsuit-against-kash-patel-and-pam-bondi/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fired-FBI-officials-sue-Kash-Patel-and-Pam-Bondi.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 23:19:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.623},{"id":359391274,"title":"Charlie Kirk, Trump ally, shot dead at Utah university","text":"Right-wing activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk was shot dead Wednesday at Utah Valley University in what officials described as a “political assassination,” raising fears of escalating political violence in the U.S.Kirk, 31, was shot while speaking at a campus event. Video showed him addressing the crowd when a single gunshot rang out. Kirk collapsed in his chair as panic erupted among attendees.FBI Director Kash Patel said one person is in custody.“The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,” Patel said on social media platform X.President Donald Trump confirmed Kirk’s death on Truth Social.“The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,” Trump wrote.Trump ordered flags at federal buildings to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday.“No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us,” Trump added.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called the killing “a tragic day for our nation” and confirmed it was a political assassination.“We just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be,” Cox said.Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who was at the event, described the moment the shooting occurred.“First question was about religion. He went on for about 15-20 minutes. Second question, interestingly, was about transgender shooters, mass shooters, and in the midst of that, the shot rang out,” Chaffetz said. “As soon as that shot went out, he fell back.

But another run for president in 2028 after a slim but dramatic loss to Trump? Still uncertain.\n\n“It seems like she is edging away from running for president, step by step,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political communications at UC Berkeley and USC. “This type of positioning looks more like playing for history instead.”\n\nHarris’ most ardent supporters, who have stood by her since her first, short-lived run for president in 2019, feel otherwise, believing the candor and honesty she displays in her book, titled “107 Days,” show what true leadership should look like.\n\n“It’s just a message of someone who wants to tell the truth and be honest about her feelings,” said Derreck Johnson of Oakland, a longtime personal friend who has volunteered with her campaigns.\n\nHarris, the Oakland native who served as California’s Attorney General and U.S. Senator before Joe Biden named her as his running mate in 2020, is set to release the book on Sept. 23.\n\nIn excerpts released to The Atlantic, Harris said it was a mistake to allow Biden alone to decide whether to run for reelection, that he may have been “tired” but still sharp, and that her efforts to distinguish herself as vice president were undermined by a Biden team afraid of diminishing its aging leader.\n\n“During all those months of growing panic, should I have told Joe to consider not running? Perhaps,” she wrote. “But the American people had chosen him before in the same matchup. Maybe he was right to believe that they would do so again.”\n\nIn retrospect, she wrote, “I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition.”\n\nShe also took aim at Biden’s team — though not Biden himself — for failing to defend her against media attacks.\n\n“When the stories were unfair or inaccurate, the president’s inner circle seemed fine with it,” Harris wrote. “Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more.”\n\nTheir thinking was “zero-sum,” she wrote. “If she’s shining, he’s dimmed.”\n\nAlthough it may be understandable to express frustration with an expedited campaign that began when Biden pulled out in July last year, “this isn’t the way a future President of the United States normally expresses themselves,” Schnur said.\n\nThe excerpts also suggest that Harris is casting blame on others rather than herself and her own campaign, analysts say.\n\n“There are some fundamental, practical aspects of her as a candidate that are equally challenging to the weight of former President Biden on her potential candidacy,” said David McCuan, a Sonoma State political science professor.\n\nShe failed to capitalize on key assignments, like Vice President J.D. Vance did at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year, McCuan said, and made blunders during her presidential campaign, including her remark that “not a thing” came to mind of what she would do differently than Biden as president, and forgoing an invitation to comedian Joe Rogan’s podcast, where she might have picked up more voters among his millions of subscribers and followers.\n\nThe release of the book three years before the next presidential election is “cracking the door to a potential candidacy that I think is not there,” McCuan said. “I think her moment has passed, even though this is a traditional time that you would release a book if you were going to run for president.”\n\nLongtime Harris supporter Elisa Camahort Page, a San Jose writer and entrepreneur, says that excerpts of the book released so far show that Harris “was very respectful” of Biden and perhaps Democrats should learn from Republicans, who primed Trump him for his second reelection attempt by supporting him in the interim four years.\n\n“I would 100% spend the next four years pumping her up,” Camahort Page said. “Lots of people don’t win their first run for president. Biden didn’t. Reagan didn’t. Lots of people try again and win, and that would be following a playbook that the GOP has used successfully.”\n\nShe doesn’t blame Harris for losing to Trump, though.\n\n“You know who I blame most for Donald Trump being in office?” Camahort Page asked. “The Republican Party that had many chances to walk away from him and didn’t, and the people who voted for him.”","summary":"Harris's most ardent supporters who have stood by her since her first, short-lived run for president in 2019, believe that the candor and honesty she displays in her book show what true leadership should look like.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/10/kamala-harris-first-digs-from-upcoming-book-heres-what-bay-area-supporters-analysts-think/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Election_2026_Governor_Harris_73525.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 23:08:37","author":"Julia Prodis Sulek","authors":["Julia Prodis Sulek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":359382992,"title":"Biden, Obama, and others on the left call for end of political violence after death of Charlie Kirk","text":"The political world is mourning the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and many voices on the left are calling for civility and an end to political violence.\n\nAmong those are former President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who posted their responses on social media.

As doors closed on the room where the officials met, the sound of an expletive surfaced.\n\nOnce news of Kirk’s death reached the public, the flags at the White House were promptly lowered to half-staff in his honor. Similarly, Eric Trump stated that flags would also be lowered in tribute at all Trump-owned properties.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat often critical of Trump and who had Kirk as a guest on his podcast earlier this year, condemned the shooting on X shortly after it happened.\n\n“The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying, vile, and disgusting,” Newsom stated. “In the USA, we must stand against political violence in ALL its forms.”\n\nKirk, who co-founded Turning Point, which organizes and mobilizes young conservative activists, died after he was rushed to a hospital. He had been speaking about mass shooting incidents involving trans people when he was shot in the neck. Gruesome video of the attack quickly proliferated on social media.\n\nWhile some politicians used the shooting to make political points — including Republicans accusing liberals of inciting violence with rhetoric and Democrats arguing for tighter gun regulations — most stuck to more unifying messages offering prayers for Kirk and his family, condemnations of violence or both.\n\nVice President JD Vance posted a prayer on X: “Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.” In an earlier message, sent shortly after Kirk was shot, he praised Kirk for engaging in open conversation with allies and critics alike.\n\n“If you actually watch Charlie’s events — as opposed to the fake summaries — they are one of the few places with open and honest dialogue between left and right,” Vance wrote. “He would answer any question and talk to everyone.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic nominee for president, wrote on X: “I am deeply disturbed by the shooting in Utah. Doug and I send our prayers to Charlie Kirk and his family. \n\n“Let me be clear: Political violence has no place in America. I condemn this act, and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence,” she added.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, it was not clear who shot Kirk. But some elected officials and prominent figures were quick to point fingers and try to score political points.\n\n“Conservative, liberal, whatever you are, you shouldn’t be shot for your beliefs,” Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told NBC News. “And I hope that every single Democrat across the country will stand up and acknowledge that they have a problem within their party.”\n\nMace rejected the idea that Republicans might be equally responsible for the killing of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, in June. \n\n“Some raging leftist lunatic put a bullet through [Kirk’s] neck, and you want to talk about Republicans right now?” she said. “No. No, not at all. No this is on — the Democrats own this.”\n\nSimilarly, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who credited Kirk with getting her engaged in politics, blamed progressives and the media for his death.\n\n“EVERY DAMN ONE OF YOU WHO CALLED US FASCISTS DID THIS,” she wrote on X. “You were too busy doping up kids, cutting off their genitals, inciting racial violence by supporting orgs that exploit minorities, protecting criminals, and stirring hate. YOU ARE THE HATE you claim to fight. Your words caused this. Your hate caused this.” \n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, a former Trump administration official and the owner of X, wrote, “The Left is the party of murder.” He posted the message before Kirk’s death was confirmed.\n\nSome leading Democrats denounced gun violence in the hours after Kirk’s shooting, amplifying their long-articulated view that firearms should be more heavily regulated, while others stayed away from political and policy pronouncements. \n\n“Condemning another absolutely disgraceful act of gun violence,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., wrote on X. “My thoughts & prayers are w/ Charlie Kirk & his family in this terrible moment & we are all grateful for first responders who immediately jumped into action.”\n\nLikewise, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Arizona, who survived an assassination attempt more than a decade ago and who runs an eponymous nonprofit organization dedicated to ending gun violence, pointed to the fact that figures on the left and the right have been shot and killed this year. \n\n“This summer, America has seen multiple politically-motivated assassinations — first of a Democratic legislator, now of a Republican activist — because dangerous people turned to guns to express their disagreements,” Giffords said in a statement. “Both parties have been targeted, and both parties share a moral and patriotic duty to take meaningful action to stop gun crime from claiming more lives.”\n\nTrump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July 2024 after a sniper’s bullet hit him in the ear. In a separate incident, a man accused of attempting to assassinate him at one of his golf clubs in September 2024, is on trial in Florida.\n\nThe Republican governor of Utah, where Kirk was killed, and the Democratic governor of Arizona, where he lived, called, respectively, for justice and calm.\n\n“Working with the FBI and Utah law enforcement, we will bring to justice the individual responsible for this tragedy,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said after having spoken to Trump.\n\n“This tragedy is not about who Charlie Kirk supported politically,” Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said. “It is about the devastating loss of a father, a neighbor, and an Arizonan who called this state home, and whose life was cut short by senseless violence. We must stand together in rejecting violence, lowering the temperature of our politics, and recommitting ourselves to the values of civility, respect, and community that American democracy requires.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — Prominent members from both Republican and Democratic parties united in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The unexpected passing of Charlie Kirk sparks widespread shock, sorrow, and denouncements of political violence. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/the-unexpected-passing-of-charlie-kirk-sparks-widespread-shock-sorrow-and-denouncements-of-political-violence/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Charlie-Kirk039s-death-prompts-outpouring-of-shock-grief-and-condemnations.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 22:39:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":359385690,"title":"Charlie Kirk, right-wing provocateur and close ally of Trump, dies at 31","text":"Charlie Kirk, a conservative wunderkind who through his radio show, books, political organizing and speaking tours did much to shape the hard-right movement that has coalesced around President Trump, becoming a close ally of his, died on Wednesday in Orem, Utah, after he had been shot while speaking at a college campus event. He was 31.\n\nPresident Trump confirmed the death on his social media site, Truth Social.\n\nMr. Kirk had just taken the stage at the event, at Utah Valley University, when he was shot in the neck shortly after noon. He was taken to a hospital, where he was later declared dead.\n\nMr. Kirk was perhaps the leading voice among a cohort of young conservative activists who emerged during the Trump era. He had little connection to, or respect for, the Republican establishment, or for the ideas that traditionally undergirded the conservative movement.\n\nInstead, he showed a genius for using social media and campus organizing to build a following, which he then presented to donors and Trump-adjacent politicians to gain more resources and access.\n\nBy the end of 2024, he was considered something of a kingmaker; several of his biggest donors received positions in the Trump administration, and he was central in rallying support behind embattled cabinet nominees like Pete Hegseth, who was accused of sexual assault after Mr. Trump chose him to be secretary of defense.\n\nHe likewise rallied his supporters against Ronna McDaniel, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who he said was not sufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump. She resigned in early 2024.\n\nMr. Kirk never sought a position within the administration. Instead, it became clear over the last year that his ambition was for something much larger: reshaping the Republican Party and, beyond that, American politics itself.\n\n“We want to transform the culture,” he told The New York Times Magazine in February.\n\nMr. Kirk was only 18, in 2012, when he founded Turning Point USA, which he conceived as a conservative response to liberal organizing platforms like MoveOn.org. He drew significant early support from Republican donors like Foster Friess and members of the Trump family like the president’s son Donald Jr., who were attracted by his fresh face and bold pitch for gaining ground among young voters.\n\nHe quickly became a fixture in the Trumpian media sphere. He tweeted relentlessly with a brash right-wing spin, including inflammatory comments about Jewish, gay and Black people. Even some conservatives found his approach distasteful, but not Mr. Trump: One sign of Mr. Kirk’s ascendence was how often Mr. Trump retweeted him.\n\nBy the start of the first Trump administration in 2017, Mr. Kirk was already in regular rotation on the conservative TV pundit circuit and an in-demand speaker among right-wing organizations. He proved to be a captivating speaker and an extremely capable debater, with a gift for bringing coherence to the president’s often logically fraught statements.\n\nHe was equally influential within the administration. He claimed to have visited the White House about 100 times during the first Trump term, including for meetings to discuss nominations and high-level personnel decisions.\n\nMr. Kirk was far from the only young face to emerge in the Trump movement. But whereas activists like Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulos went too far too early in their embrace of baldly racist and homophobic ideas, Mr. Kirk had an innate polish and was able to tack quickly among far-right activists, establishment Republicans and skeptical young voters.\n\nHe focused his activism on what he characterized as rampant Marxism and gender ideology on college campuses. He encouraged students to report professors whom they suspected of embracing such ideas, and he did the same in appealing to parents and grade school students.\n\nTurning Point grew rapidly, adding dozens of campus chapters a year and largely displacing older conservative youth organizations like Young Americans for Freedom. He not only brought high-profile right-wing speakers to colleges; he also provided training, networking and organizing, in the process creating a tight web of activists and future politicos.\n\nMr. Kirk rose even further into the conservative stratosphere during the early days of the pandemic, when he was quick to attack the World Health Organization — which, in his typical fashion, he called the “Wuhan Health Organization” — accusing it of hiding the source of the Covid virus and claiming that it had emerged from a Chinese lab in the city of Wuhan. He later rallied opposition to school lockdowns and mask mandates.\n\nHe was so vocal in his willingness to spread unsupported claims and outright lies — he said that the drug hydroxychloroquine was “100 percent effective” in treating the virus, which it is not — that Twitter temporarily barred him in early March 2020. But that move only added to his notoriety and seemed to support his claim that he was being muzzled by a liberal elite.\n\nFollowing the 2020 election, Mr. Kirk led a “Stop the Steal” protest in Phoenix, embracing the false right-wing narrative that Mr. Trump had actually won the White House in his race against Joseph R. Biden Jr. He promised to send 80 “buses of patriots” to Washington on Jan. 6, 2021 — the day the election results were to be certified by Congress — to support the outgoing President Trump. Only about seven buses arrived.\n\nUndaunted, Mr. Kirk was among the first to rally around Mr. Trump once he left office, traveling to Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Florida, to strategize a comeback. Like the president, Mr. Kirk sensed that the country was not done with Trumpism, and that they could use the new Biden administration as a foil.\n\nMr. Kirk grabbed hold of the opportunity with both hands. He created a new group, Turning Point Faith, to amplify the role of Christian nationalism within the Trump movement. He doubled down in his critique of the left, which he said had taken over campuses, corporate America and government.\n\nHe continued to provoke: During a speech in Mankato, Minn., in 2021, he referred to George Floyd, the Black man whose murder by a Minnesota police officer sparked protests, as a “scumbag”; at other times, he referred to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as “a bad man.”\n\nAnd he joined in Mr. Trump’s campaign against immigration, at times endorsing the so-called Great Replacement Theory, the popular far-right idea that immigrants will soon displace white Americans — even adding an antisemitic twist to it.\n\n“Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them,” he said on “The Charlie Kirk Show” in 2023.\n\nFor a moment, it seemed as if such comments might signal the end of Mr. Kirk’s rise. Instead, he reached out to conservative Jewish donors and otherwise jittery Republicans, and at the 2024 Republican National Convention, in Milwaukee, he was given a prime speaking slot.\n\nThere was no secret to his staying power: He delivered results. He spent tens of millions of dollars on voter mobilization through Turning Point and other groups in the run-up to the presidential election. Mr. Trump won a surprising share of the youth vote, about 45 percent nationally, and drew even with Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in several swing states.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump’s victory, Mr. Kirk moved his family — his wife, Erika, and two young children — to a rented condo near Mar-a-Lago, so that he could participate in key discussions about the incoming administration.\n\nAnd to make his status as an ultimate insider clear, Turning Point held a gala event in Washington on the eve of the inauguration, at which some 1,500 people paid at least $5,000 a ticket to brush shoulders with the likes of Donald Trump Jr. and Kash Patel, who would become the F.B.I. director.\n\nCharles James Kirk was born on Oct. 14, 1993, in Arlington Heights, a suburb of Chicago. His father, Robert, an architect, and his mother, Kimberly, were active in conservative circles — his father was a major donor to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign.\n\n“I started listening to Rush when I was a junior in high school,” Charlie Kirk told The New York Times Magazine, referring to the right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh. “Listening, I was, like, ‘This guy is unbelievable!’”\n\nIn 2012, as a senior in high school, he wrote an opinion article for the conservative website Breitbart News criticizing the prominence of liberal economists like Paul Krugman in his textbooks. The article led to an appearance on Fox News, which in turn drew the attention of Bill Montgomery, a restaurateur and early supporter of the right-wing Tea Party movement.\n\nAfter Mr. Kirk explained his vision for bringing fresh conservative ideas to young voters, Mr. Montgomery urged him to skip college and start immediately. Mr. Kirk was accepted at Baylor University and briefly attended Harper College, in Palatine, Ill., but soon took Mr. Montgomery’s advice and dropped out.\n\nHe founded Turning Point USA with support from Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Kirk’s father, who came up with the group’s name. He talked his way into the 2012 Republican National Convention, where he ran into Mr. Friess and gave him an impromptu pitch. Mr. Friess sent him a $10,000 check a few days later.\n\nMr. Kirk relocated to the Phoenix area, where he spent the next decade building the Turning Point empire; eventually, his headquarters encompassed five buildings, several named for prominent donors.\n\nHe was not initially a Trump supporter; during the 2016 Republican primary, he first supported two other candidates, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and then Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. But he was won over to the Trump campaign after a meeting with Donald Jr., who brought him on as his social media coordinator.\n\nHe married Erika Frantzve, a former Miss Arizona, in 2021. His survivors include his wife and their two children. Citing their desire for privacy, the Kirks did not reveal their children’s names.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"The founder of Turning Point USA played a central role in organizing young voters and giving shape to the pro-Trump agenda.

Graphic videos of the shooting, which happened in front of hundreds of people, began circulating soon after.\n\nThe 31-year-old was the founder of Turning Point USA, an organization that pushed the conservative youth movement toward embracing MAGA, culture war issues, and views that were once on the fringe of conservative politics. Through his podcast, media appearances, and numerous speaking tours, he has spread misinformation about the 2020 election and the pandemic; urged women to abandon their careers and stay at home with children; and fanned fears that LGBTQ+ rights would endanger children and erode society. At the time of the shooting, according to recordings from the event, he was discussing the false right-wing belief that many mass shooters are transgender.\n\nPoliticians on both the right and the left were quick to express horror at the violence.\n\nPresident Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!” He followed this with a pronouncement that he was ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff.\n\nOn X, before the death was confirmed, Vice President J.D. Vance wrote: “Say a prayer for Charlie Kirk, a genuinely good guy and a young father.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr., sharing his father’s post, wrote: “I love you brother. You gave so many people the courage to speak up and we will not ever be silenced.” Sen. Ted Cruz said he was praying for Kirk, with whom Cruz said he’d been friends “since he was a teenager.”\n\n“Charlie Kirk is a great man and a great fighter for the cause,” wrote the conservative media figure Matt Walsh. Even Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu—Kirk, a Christian, was a supporter of Israel—said he was praying.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic politicians as varied as former Vice President Kamala Harris, Sen. Chuck Schumer, New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi wrote on social media that the attack was “vile,” “shocking,” and “horrifying.” “Never thought I’d say a prayer for Charlie Kirk. But here goes,” former Sen. Al Franken wrote. “Political violence has no place in this country.”\n\nWhile the shooter’s identity and political beliefs remained unknown in the hours after the shooting, that didn’t stop many on the right from framing Kirk’s killing as an indictment of the left.\n\n“No more mercy for leftists,” wrote the Malaysian MAGA influencer Ian Miles Cheong. “They want you dead. They truly want to kill you and desecrate your body and erase your memory.”\n\n“THIS IS WAR,” wrote Chaya Raichik, the person behind the Libs of TikTok account.\n\n“The Left is the party of murder,” Elon Musk wrote.\n\n“The Left wants us dead,” wrote C.J. Pearson, a Gen Z conservative influencer. “This is not hyperbole. This is now the ONLY logical conclusion that any sane human being can reach after a repeated pattern of demonstrated behavior and violence.”\n\nBecause there was no immediate explanation for what had happened, many commentators, unable to make conclusions about the shooter, were forced to vent about the left’s response to Kirk’s killing. Some proclaimed that liberals were celebrating Kirk’s death. Others lashed out instead about MSNBC’s commentary, for having described him as a “divisive figure.” “This is perhaps the most disgusting response to a political act of violence I’ve seen on cable TV, ever,” one commentator wrote. In another MSNBC segment, one pundit remarked that “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” comments that drew outrage on the right.\n\nThe media personality Mike Cernovich called for massive investigations and congressional hearings into the funders of leftism. The former congressional candidate Blake Masters agreed: “Left-wing violence is out of control, and it’s not random,” he wrote. “Either we destroy the NGO/donor patronage network that enables and foments it, or it will destroy us.”\n\nOthers went further. “The last time the radical Left orchestrated a wave of violence and terror, J. Edgar Hoover shut it all down within a few years,” wrote the conservative activist Christopher Rufo. “It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest, and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos.”\n\nScott Presler, the conservative organizer, wondered aloud: “How do you coexist with people that want to murder you?” In response, the anti-transgender activist Riley Gaines responded: “And they’ll kill you in the name of ‘tolerance.’”\n\n“The rubicon has been crossed,” wrote Dana Loesch, the former spokesperson for the National Rifle Association.\n\n“This will be a turning point,” the conservative writer Megan Basham wrote. “It has to be.”","summary":"Many were quick to immediately frame Kirk’s death as an indictment of the left.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/09/charlie-kirk-shot-dead-turning-point-usa-founder-death.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/e3a16685-4131-4402-94d1-e09a98e32e8a.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 21:48:15","author":"Molly Olmstead","authors":["Molly Olmstead"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":359376940,"title":"Who was Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist and Trump ally?","text":"Charlie Kirk, who rose from a teenage conservative campus activist to a top podcaster, culture warrior and ally of US President Donald Trump, has been shot and killed during one of his trademark public appearances at a college in Utah.\n\nMr Kirk died doing what made him a potent political force — rallying the right on a college campus, this time Utah Valley University.\n\nHis shooting is one of an escalating number of attacks on US political figures, from the assassination of a Democratic state politician and her husband in Minnesota to last year's shooting of Mr Trump, that have roiled the nation.\n\nMr Trump announced Mr Kirk's death on his social media site, Truth Social.\n\nMr Kirk had personified the pugnacious, populist conservatism that has taken over the Republican Party in the Trump age.\n\nHe launched his organisation, Turning Point USA, in 2012, targeting younger people and venturing onto liberal-leaning college campuses where many Republican activists were nervous to tread.\n\nA supporter of Mr Trump during the billionaire's initial 2016 presidential run, Mr Kirk took Turning Point from one of a constellation of well-funded conservative groups to the centre of the right-of-centre universe.\n\nTurning Point's political wing helped to energise disaffected conservatives who rarely vote during Mr Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\nMr Trump won Arizona, Turning Point's home state, by five percentage points after narrowly losing it in 2020.\n\nThe group is known for its flamboyant events that often feature strobe lighting and pyrotechnics.

Back in April, Kirk took to X to share a study showing that 49% of Americans identifying left-of-center said it was at least partially justified to murder Elon Musk, with the majority saying it was at least partially justified to murder Trump. Kirk spent the better part of the last week championing the slain Ukrainian Iryna Zarutska to applaud Trump’s recent attempt to crack down on violence and crime on the streets of America’s cities.\n\nThe only thing Kirk advertised more passionately than Trump and the conservative cause was that of Jesus.

A spokeswoman, Ellen Treanor, for Utah Valley University shared that Kirk was struck about 20 minutes after he started speaking on the campus located in Orem, Utah. Treanor continued, saying a suspect fired at Kirk from the Losee Center, a building about 200 yards away. The shooting suspect is not yet in custody, despite earlier conflicting reports.\n\nHorrific footage\n\nFootage of the shooting has been shared online, with one showing Kirk's head jerking back as blood poured from his neck. Kirk was sitting under a tent with a slogan that read \"The American Comeback.\" Quickly after news of the shooting, both Democrats and Republicans denounced the violent act on social media. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, described the violence as \"disgusting, vile, and reprehensible.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old conservative commentator founded the right-wing political organization, Turning Point USA, when he was 18-years-old. The organization sends conservative speakers to college campuses across the country, and invited critics to prove Kirk wrong on political subjects. In the 2024 election, Turning Point played a significant role in getting young people to vote for President Trump.\n\nThe event at Utah Valley University was another in the many that Turning Point regularly host. Per the New York Times, at least 1,000 people were in attendance when Kirk was shot. A university spokesman, Scott Trotter, said campus was closed and classes were cancelled until further notice.\n\nAlthough Kirk did not work within the Trump administration, he was an influential figure. Since swaying the Gen-Z vote in November, Kirk helped vet prospective appointees. President Trump came to view Kirk as one of his closest allies, saying in 2021: \"Charlie Kirk, what he’s done with the young people.

He was the father to two children, a three-year-old daughter and one-year-old son. During a speech made in January 2023, Kirk shared his beliefs about marriage and children.

Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie’s family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children.\n\nKamala Harris mirrored the statement: \"I am deeply disturbed by the shooting in Utah. Doug and I send our prayers to Charlie Kirk and his family,\" the Democratic Party's 2024 presidential nominee, wrote on X.\n\n\"Let me be clear: Political violence has no place in America. I condemn this act, and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance called Kirk \"a genuinely good guy and a young father\" and urged prayers in after the horrific shooting.\n\nBernie Sanders offered his words after the assassination and wrote on Instagram: \"Political violence has no place in this country.

Kirk appeared to collapse in his chair before the camera swiftly moved and sounds of panic erupted in the audience.The university said the shooting happened around midday and initially said that a suspect was in custody, although multiple US media reports later said that was not the case.\"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us,\" Trump wrote.\"Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!\" Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who was at the rally, told Fox News the shooting had happened while Kirk was doing a question and answer session with the crowd.\"First question was about religion. He went on for about 15-20, minutes. Second question, interestingly, was about transgender shooters, mass shooters, and in the midst of that, the shot rang out,\" a visibly shaken Chaffetz told the network.\"As soon as that shot went out, he fell back,\" he said. \"Everybody hit the deck, everybody... a lot of people started screaming, and then everybody started running.\"Sophie Anderson, 45, told the Daily Mail she was standing 100 feet (30 meters) from the stage, said she knew it was a gunshot as soon as she heard the noise.\"He was shot in the neck and just fell over and he was just a fountain of blood,\" she told the outlet.Kirk had an outsized influence in US politics, helping the rise of Trump's support among younger voters -- one of the key factors in the Republican's return to power last year.With natural showmanship skills, Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 to drive conservative viewpoints among young people, turning him into the go-to spokesman on television networks and at conferences for the youthful hard-right.He used his enormous audiences on Instagram and YouTube to build support for anti-immigration policies, outspoken Christianity, and viral takedowns of hecklers at his many campus events.His presence on campuses was seen on the right as a welcome contrast to widespread liberal viewpoints in higher education, but have sparked often fierce opposition.News of the shooting provoked horror across the political spectrum, with senior figures on the right paying tribute.\"Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour,\" write Vice President JD Vance on social media, alongside a picture of the two men and the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.Right wing media figure Tomi Lahren called Kirk \"visionary\".\"He's actually opened the door for so many young conservatives to have a career and have, you know, a voice in this business. Figures on the left condemned the attack and urged calm.California Governor Gavin Newsom -- a frequent foil for right-wing figures like Kirk -- called the attack \"disgusting, vile, and reprehensible,\" while former vice president Kamala Harris said \"political violence has no place in America.\"Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- a Democrat who survived an assassination attempt herself -- said she was \"horrified\" by the attack.\"Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence,\" she said.","summary":"Right-wing youth activist and influencer Charlie Kirk, a major ally of President Donald Trump, was shot dead Wednesday in an apparent assassination that sparked fears of more political violence in an increasingly febrile United States.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/right-wing-trump-ally-charlie-kirk-shot-dead-us-university-3783043","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4620760/influential-us-right-wing-youth-organizer-charlie-kirk-has-been-shot-wounded-according-multiple.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a08380dc1cb7ed9ea483df4eb47db3cb","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 21:06:22","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.111},{"id":359373370,"title":"‘The View’ Breaks Down Why Kamala Harris Was Right to Call Biden ‘Reckless’ in Her Memoir | Video","text":"As “The View” weighed in on the first excerpts of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ new memoir “107 Days” on Wednesday, the panel came to the consensus that her campaign was derailed by and ultimately failed due to the egos within the Democratic party and other poor decisions.\n\n“She raised over a billion dollars, she locked up all of the Democratic delegates within 24 hours, she kept a rigorous schedule on the campaign trail, she did many things that I think no other politician could do in that time span,” co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said, kicking off the conversation. “But I think in many ways she was set up to fail.”\n\nWhile she noted that she doesn’t believe there was a “grand strategy against” Harris, Farah Griffin pointed out that presidents never want to be overshadowed by their second-in-command\n\n“Oftentimes things she was doing didn’t get credit, when negative things were said about her, there wasn’t pushback for her, and she goes into great detail about this,” she said. “They were going to lose because of those headwinds that Joe Biden couldn’t shake and she couldn’t break from him with.”\n\nCo-host Joy Behar then jumped in, naming all of Trump’s controversies as reasons why she thinks the Democrats assumed they’d obtain a victory in the race, including busting up the economy, Elon Musk’s massive donation to Trump’s campaign and his involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n“He was doing all those things, so [Democrats] figured they were going to get it,” Behar said. “‘He’s going to lose. How could he win after all the stupid things he’s done?’ And then he won anyway.”\n\nSara Haines also highlighted Harris’ claim that the decision to allow Joe, Jill Biden and their allies to be the only people deciding whether Biden should move forward with a second run was “reckless.” She also noted how Biden’s physical and mental decline should have been weighed.\n\n“Being the president is the most consequential job in the world. If you think someone is going to be tired or not going to be able to handle it, you put your best person in,” Haines said. “So I would say it was always up to the people around them, and I didn’t know until her remarks how separated the vice president and president’s teams are. I think this country deserves better. This is not an ego trip where someone gets credit and someone doesn’t; you’re a team or you’re not a team.”\n\nAt that, Hostin came in to spotlight Harris writing that Biden’s team wasn’t fond of her growing popularity, saying, “The machine was working against her when they should have been working for the country and for the party.”\n\nBy the end of it, Whoopi Goldberg admitted, point-blank period: “It’s everybody’s fault.”\n\n“People love to go back and say what we should have done. ‘We should have run a better campaign,’” Goldberg said. “I don’t understand why we have to re-litigate it. It happened and now we’re all sitting in it.”\n\nWith one last comment, Behar called out what she feels is the “elephant in the room.” “This country will not elect a woman. That’s the real bottom line,” she stated.\n\n“I would like to add, a Black woman,” Hostin concluded.","summary":"The panel unpacks the former VP's new book \"107 Days,\" which covers her 2024 campaign after President Joe Biden decided to drop out of the race\n\n\nThe post &#8216;The View&#8217; Breaks Down Why Kamala Harris Was Right to Call Biden &#8216;Reckless&#8217; in Her Memoir | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/the-view-kamala-harris-107-days-memoir-democrats/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rump-23.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 21:00:19","author":"Raquel 'Rocky' Harris","authors":["Raquel 'Rocky' Harris"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":359367046,"title":"Charlie Kirk, 31, helped build support for Trump among young people","text":"By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and ALI SWENSON, Associated Press\n\nCharlie Kirk, who rose from a teenage conservative campus activist to a top podcaster, culture warrior and ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed Wednesday during one of his trademark public appearances at a college in Utah.

Announcing the news, US President Donald Trump said: “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead.

One video appeared to show Kirk’s head jerking back as blood poured from his neck. He had been delivering remarks while sitting under a tent with the slogan “The American Comeback.” Here’s what we know so far about the shooting: What happened at the University? University spokeswoman Ellen Treanor had said that Kirk was struck about 20 minutes after he began speaking on campus. She said a suspect, who is not a student, had shot at Kirk from a building about 200 yards away. Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for Turning Point USA, had confirmed that Kirk had been shot in the neck. What have been the reactions to the shooting? Political leaders from across party lines condemned the shooting. “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot,” President Trump had written on Truth Social. “A great guy from top to bottom. GOD BLESS HIM!” In a post, Governor Gavin Newsom, Democrat of California, called the violence “disgusting, vile and reprehensible.” Former Vice President Kamala Harris said on social media she was “deeply disturbed” by the shooting of Kirk. “I condemn this act, and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence.” Speaker Mike Johnson, entering the House chamber for a moment of silence for Charlie Kirk, called his shooting “detestable.” What do we know about the shooter? According to Treanor, the shooting occurred roughly 20 minutes into Kirk’s speech. An alert from the university initially stated that the alleged shooter had been quickly taken into custody and was not a student at Utah Valley University. However, Scott Trotter, a university spokesman, later clarified that the person taken into custody was not the shooter. Law enforcement has not yet publicly identified the actual suspect or disclosed potential charges. What are witnesses saying? Recalling the series of event, Andrew Piskadlo, who was standing at the amphitheater in the campus waiting to debate Kirk about the Eighth Amendment, told The New York Times that he heard a single shot ring out. “It was surprising, and no one really got down until the people in front of the stage did,” Piskadlo, said. “I’m just hoping Charlie is OK.” Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"Videos posted online showed people running from the event after the gunshot rang out.

A gifted communicator with a passion for Donald Trump-style conservative politics, he grew the group into a massive nationwide network comprising more than 1,000 high school and college chapters.\n\nWith Kirk as their leader, the group promoted policies like free market capitalism and limited government. He also dove in head-first on culture war battles that roiled and divided the country — specifically on hot-button issues of race and gender.\n\nAmerica First spread its messages through provocative posters, confrontational viral videos and high-tech conferences. Detractors accused him of sowing seeds of division and dissent. Supporters praised him for giving conservative students a voice in traditionally liberal campus environments.\n\nBy his early 20s, conservative media had taken notice of the charismatic and articulate Kirk, and he became a familiar face on Fox News, where he defended the populist, anti-immigrant policies of Donald Trump through his first presidency.\n\nIn 2019, he launched The Charlie Kirk Show, a daily podcast and radio program that became one of the most downloaded political shows on Apple Podcasts. The platform increased his influence and visibility, seating him opposite elected officials and other conservative media superstars. He also authored several books, including The MAGA Doctrine (2020), which positioned him as a leading interpreter of Trump’s policies for a younger generation.\n\nKirk epitomized a new breed of young conservativism, one that found a home in digital media, outside the traditional confines of the mainstream. He and his colleagues at Turning Point USA leveraged the algorithmic nature of platforms like Instagram, YouTube and TikTok to create viral moments that celebrated the conservative worldview or mocked liberals.\n\nVideos in which he debated liberals or others that did not share his political opinions consistently garnered millions of views on digital platforms.\n\nBut as he found success in digital media, he also slowly embraced some of the conservative mainstream. He began hosting a radio show, The Charlie Kirk Show, in 2020 for Salem Radio Network, and earlier this year he stepped in as a guest host on the weekend edition of Fox & Friends.\n\nHis digital-first approach to commentary and content, however, was emblematic of a change in political consumption that culminated with President Trump’s victory in November 2024, with his campaign fully embracing content creators and podcasters, and often eschewing mainstream media outlets.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Erika Frantza, a businesswoman, podcaster and former Miss Arizona USA winner, and the couple’s two young children.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nCharlie Kirk\n\nCharlie Kirk Fatally Shot at Utah Event\n\nJerry Seinfeld\n\nJerry Seinfeld Compares “Free Palestine” Movement to the KKK\n\nIn Book Excerpt, Kamala Harris Says Leaving Reelection Decision to Biden Was “Recklessness”\n\nRambling Reporter\n\nThe Little Round Pill That’s Winning Awards Season\n\nunited kingdom\n\nJ.R.R.

I'm not saying this was some grand strategy against her, but it's a rule of thumb in White Houses that presidents and their teams are always looking out for the VP. They don't want them to take too much of the spotlight, they don't want them to do better than them. What happened is, often times things she was doing didn't get credit, when negative things were said about her, there wasn't pushback for her.\"\n\n Griffin said she \"dealt with this with [Mike] Pence and with Trump when I worked for him\" and that it's just \"something that happens\" in the political sphere.\n\n The former communications professional estimated that, \"the glaring signs were there that Donald Trump was going to win. Two-thirds of the country said they felt like the country was on the wrong track, and they wanted a different direction,\" and that there are only two options for political parties in the United States. She added that Biden's \"headwinds\" and Harris' inability to separate herself from them also contributed to the 2024 election loss.\n\n Sara Haines praised Harris for \"raising the morale\" of the country, and compared that kind of hope to the feeling that President Barack Obama ran on ahead of the 2008 election.\n\n \"Being the President of the United States is the most consequential job in the world. If you think someone is going to be tired or not be able to handle it, you put your best person in,\" Haines continued. \"I'd say it was always up to the people around them. I didn't know until her remarks how separated the vice president and the [resident's teams are. I think this country deserves better. This isn't an ego trip where someone gets credit and someone doesn't. You're a team, or you're not a team.\"\n\n Goldberg admittedly felt that Biden \"messed up\" in the first debate against Trump in June 2024, but \"the divisive for me, is if the Democrats had kept their mouths shut and took care of this in house, as opposed to making it a public spectacle, I think people would've had a better feel about it.\"\n\n \"They turned against the president,\" legal expert Sunny Hostin said, while Griffin replied to Goldberg by pointing out that \"ageism is a horrible thing, but there's also just biology and science and stats\" that support her suggestion that older politicians leave the door open for legislative chaos — like, as she cited, five Democratic lawmakers whose deaths in office allowed \"consequential legislation that impacts every American\" to pass from the opposing side.\n\n Goldberg then continued, \"But you know, you can't say that to a sitting president who's busting his ass trying to keep everything going and moving,\" she said. \"People love to go back and say what we should've done. We should've run a better campaign. People wanted to hear what they heard, they got what they wanted, I don't understand why we've got to relitigate it. It happened, and now we're all sitting in it. It's everybody's fault.\"\n\n Griffin said that \"voters should have a say,\" and that political parties shouldn't be the only entity that has a say in who runs.\n\n Leading up to the 2024 election, The View played an integral role, having hosted an interview with Harris that many cited as a key breaking point in her campaign when she told Hostin that \"not a thing that comes to mind\" in terms of what she'd do differently from Biden's presidency.\n\n Biden later revealed in a May 2025 interview on the talk show that he \"wasn't surprised\" that Harris lost the election.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n \"Not because I didn't think the vice president was qualified to be president,\" he clarified to the cohosts. \"She is, she's qualified to be president of the United States of America. I was surprised because they went the sexist route, the whole route. 'This is a woman,' she's this, she's that, really, I've never seen as successful and consistent [of a] campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country — and a woman of mixed race.\"\n\n The View airs weekdays at 11 a.m. ET/10 a.m. PT on ABC.","summary":"\"The View\" cohost spoke up during a tense debate about Harris and shifting blame during the election cycle, ahead of the former VP's new book.","url":"https://ew.com/whoopi-goldberg-sick-of-relitigating-kamala-harris-election-loss-11807479","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/4ZJabApgU-b21JMy3Ppr4ASkDOs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/whoopi-goldberg-the-view-kamala-harris-091025-4784d9dc5da342a090b14cba691a3846.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 20:30:00","author":"Joey Nolfi","authors":["Joey Nolfi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":359367864,"title":"Expectations ‘smashed’: Wholesale inflation unexpectedly declined in August","text":"Wholesale inflation unexpectedly declined in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported Wednesday morning.\n\nThe producer price index (PPI) inched down by 0.1% in August, beating economists’ expectations, according to the BLS. Meanwhile, the index for final demand declined to a 2.6% increase for the 12 months ending in August, compared to a 3.3% increase in July, the BLS reported.\n\n“One thing I found interesting looking at the numbers was so much of it was being driven by the energy prices going down,” Preston Brashers, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That was the big driver in the overall PPI falling. It’s interesting because we have been seeing so much deregulation and kinda pushing to open up federal lands and different things of that nature, and I think it’s been having some success.”\n\n“At the same time, there was some concern from people about paring back the tax subsidies for the Green New Deal in the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill,’ that that would actually raise energy prices, but there doesn’t seem to be any indication of that,” Brashers added.\n\nAugust’s PPI report comes after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Aug. 22 that the central bank may lower interest rates in its upcoming September meeting. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell as being “too late” for declining to slash interest rates in 2025.\n\n“The unexpected decline in PPI really solidifies that there will almost certainly be a rate cut at the next Fed meeting,” Brashers continued. “I think, you know, some people were looking at whether there would be a 50 basis point cut, I think that’s maybe a bit more of stretch even now, just because if you look at some of the particulars, a lot of the decline is coming from energy, so they [the Fed] may look at that and that may make them less inclined to think that they need to have that dramatic of a reaction. But, it is true, it seems like they’re a little bit late to this.”\n\n“Because of its dual mandate, the Federal Reserve must balance decisions with an eye on both unemployment and inflation, and right now there’s tension between a rapidly weakening U.S. labor market and inflation that remains above target,” Peter C. Earle, director of Economics and Economic Freedom at the American Institute for Economic Research, told the DCNF. “The unexpected drop in producer prices last month makes it more feasible for the Fed to lower rates, since it suggests that cost pressures aren’t being aggressively passed on to consumers.”\n\nEarle said that the “key test is Thursday’s CPI [Consumer Price Index] release.”\n\n“If that report shows a similarly subdued trend, it could lower the risk of spiking prices after a rate cut and make even a 50-basis-point move at next week’s FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting look feasible,” he added.\n\nStill, Earle told the DCNF that the August PPI numbers “show mixed signals in the real economy.”\n\n“The producer price index numbers show mixed signals in the real economy,” Earle explained. “The headline decline was driven by services, specifically the steepest drop in trade services margins since July 2024, which implies wholesalers and retailers are absorbing more tariff costs rather than passing them through. That points to some margin compression. Goods inflation, however, is still elevated — finished core goods saw their largest monthly gain since May of this year — suggesting that supply-side cost pressures haven’t gone away. Taken together, this hints at easing pressure in services but stubborn inflation in goods, reflecting an economy where pricing power is uneven and still under stress from tariffs.”\n\n“Beyond the PPI print itself, Treasury yields fell modestly, with the 10-year dipping as low as 4.05%,” Earle added. “Market reactions are forward-looking, and regression analysis between PPI and CPI points to a possible negative CPI print — but those correlations are shaky, and volatility in services pricing means one soft month doesn’t guarantee a trend. Survey data continues to show persistent cost concerns among businesses and households, suggesting that even if disinflation gives the Fed room to ease rates, inflationary risks haven’t disappeared.”\n\n“Non-existent wholesale inflation gives even more justification for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by at least 50 basis points at its meeting next week,” Alfredo Ortiz, CEO of Job Creators Network, said in a statement provided to the DCNF. “Thanks to President Trump and Republican policies, small businesses no longer have to worry about runaway inflation that destroys profit margins and alienates customers. Now, the biggest threat they face is artificially high interest rates from a politicized Fed.”\n\n“When small businesses can’t access credit, they can’t reinvest in their businesses and create jobs in their communities,” Ortiz added. “Low and predictable inflation ensures the Fed can finally cut rates to free up capital and empower small businesses to kick start the Main Street resurgence.”\n\nFollowing the release of the August PPI report, Trump wrote in a Wednesday Truth Social post that “Too Late” Powell must lower interest rates “right now.” The president wrote further that the Fed chairman “doesn’t have a clue.”\n\n“Just out: No Inflation!!!” Trump wrote in the social media post. “‘Too Late’ must lower the RATE, BIG, right now. Powell is a total disaster, who doesn’t have a clue!!! President DJT.”\n\nMoreover, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Wednesday that the latest PPI report indicates that Trump has “defeated” former President Joe Biden’s “inflation crisis.” Biden notably oversaw rampant inflation throughout much of his time in office.\n\n“The latest PPI report shows there is no inflation — wholesale prices fell and smashed economists’ expectations,” Leavitt said. “President Trump has defeated Joe Biden’s inflation crisis while successfully implementing powerful tariffs, which haven’t hiked prices like the so-called ‘experts’ claimed. This is yet another reason for Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell to cut the rates immediately to make everyday life more affordable for Americans.”\n\nLast month, Trump announced he was firing BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report fell short of economists’ expectations, claiming she had “faked the Jobs Numbers” before Election Day 2024 to try and improve former Vice President Kamala Harris’ chances of winning. Trump announced on Aug. 11 that he had selected conservative economist Dr. E.J. Antoni to serve as the BLS’ new commissioner.\n\nAdditionally, the BLS reported on Tuesday that U.S. job growth in the year ending in March was much weaker than previously thought, with the economy likely adding a whopping 911,000 less jobs during that time period.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Every political leader must loudly and clearly decry this violence.”\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called Kirk “the most eloquent truth teller of an era,” adding, “Charlie is already in paradise with the angels. We ask his prayers for our country.” \n\nFormer President Joe Biden said in a statement: “There is no place in our country for this kind of violence. It must end now. Jill and I are praying for Charlie Kirk’s family and loved ones.” \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris said she was “deeply disturbed” by the shooting, adding, “Political violence has no place in America. I condemn this act, and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence.” \n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), whose husband Paul was a victim of political violence in 2022, wrote on X: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.), who hosted Kirk on his podcast earlier this year, called the shooting “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible.” \n\nGov. Josh Shapiro (D-Penn.) wrote on X: “The attack on Charlie Kirk is horrifying and this growing type of unconscionable violence cannot be allowed in our society.”\n\nThis is a developing story.

However, her “limitless energy” and “laser focus” can sometimes come across as “controlling” or “difficult,” sources told The Post.\n\n“It would be like dropping a grenade” in the newsroom, one former CBS News veteran said, of Weiss’ addition to the network.\n\nShould Weiss come aboard, sources said she would likely lock horns with the network’s “dug in culture” at programs like “60 Minutes,” which recently elevated longtime assistant Tanya Simon to executive producer.\n\n“They are used to doing things their way,” another source said.\n\nSources had speculated that the ambitious Weiss would be loathe to report to CBS News president Tom Cibrowski after running her own company. Insiders said she could be a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive, who is regarded more as a production wizard than a journalist by those who have worked with him.\n\nEither way, it appears clear that Weiss is likely to take a major role steering the editorial coverage of the network. It is unclear whether Weiss — who has a podcast, “Honestly with Bari Weiss” and a column in The Free Press — will take on an additional journalistic presence at CBS News.\n\nStaffers, meanwhile, are reportedly “apoplectic” and “not happy at all” about the prospect of Weiss joining the network in any capacity and changing the tenor of its coverage on subjects like the war in Gaza, Status reported last week.\n\nOthers are simply “freaking out” over the newly installed management’s mandate for workers to return to the office five days a week starting next year — a move interpreted by many as a pretext to mass layoffs in November, The Post reported exclusively last week.\n\n“They are hoping to get a lot of attrition,” one source said of Ellison’s intentions.\n\nWeiss — who famously ditched the left-leaning New York Times before launching The Free Press — has emerged as a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media. That caught the eye of Ellison before his deal with the Federal Communications Commission to provide unbiased coverage to gain approval for Skydance’s $8.4 billion merger with Paramount.\n\nEllison has been in talks with Weiss for roughly a year, a source with knowledge said, but his overtures grabbed the attention of the media when the two were spotted in July at the Allen & Co. summit, otherwise known as the “summer camp for billionaires,” in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\nSemafor reported on Sunday that Weiss floated bringing in her former New York Times boss James Bennet for a senior role if she takes the reins at CBS News.\n\nNo formal discussions with Bennet have taken place, Semafor reported.\n\nThe former editorial page editor quit the Gray Lady in June 2020 after staffers staged an internal revolt over his decision to green-light an op-ed from Sen. Tom Cotton, which argued for a military crackdown on rioting that took place following the police-involved death of George Floyd.\n\nHe has since argued that the Times succumbed to “illiberal bias” in a 17,000-word essay for The Economist and in public talks.\n\nWeeks after Bennet left the paper, Weiss handed in her resignation. She published an open letter blasting the Times for its ideological conformity while alleging she was subjected to harassment over her political views in an “illiberal environment.”\n\nCBS News and “60 Minutes” have come under fire over similar accusations.\n\nAs part of the post-merger reset, Skydance Paramount on Monday named Kenneth R. Weinstein as CBS News ombudsman — an FCC condition aimed at addressing bias complaints.\n\nWeeks before the merger was approved by the FCC, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump over alleged biased editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris shortly before the election.\n\nThe network denied any wrongdoing, but it eventually settled the lawsuit with Ellison sweetening the deal by agreeing to throw in an additional $20 million in pro-MAGA advertising to get the deal done, Trump has said.\n\nAside from the Harris scandal, the network was forced to fend off calls of bias over its Israel coverage, which roiled the company’s then-controlling shareholder Shari Redstone.\n\nLast October, “CBS Mornings” co-host Tony Dokoupil was thrust into the spotlight after a tense interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who described Israel as a state built on “apartheid” and “ethnocracy.”\n\nDokoupil, who is Jewish and has two children living in Israel, slammed Coates for omitting historical context — to the shock of “CBS Mornings” staff, who later complained to network brass.\n\nAdrienne Roark, the president of the news division at the time, rebuked Dokoupil in an all-hands meeting on Oct. 7 — the two-year anniversary of Hamas’ deadly attack on Israel — saying his work didn’t meet the standards of the network.\n\nMonths later, “60 Minutes” aired a controversial segment featuring State Department officials who quit over American support for Israel’s efforts to root out Hamas terrorists in Gaza — a piece the American Jewish Committee blasted as “shockingly one-sided, lacked factual accuracy, and relied heavily on misguided information.”","summary":"According to a source, Ellison first approached the hard-charging Weiss about taking a top role at “60 Minutes\" as he looks to make major changes at the left-leaning organization that will bring more conservative voices to the network.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/10/media/bari-weiss-closes-in-on-top-job-at-cbs-news-but-staff-fear-it-would-be-like-dropping-a-grenade/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/110665762-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/lW5C0W7b-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-10 19:31:15","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.018},{"id":359353136,"title":"U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk shot while speaking at Utah college event","text":"Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nCharlie Kirk speaks at an event at Utah college, seconds before he was shot.Article contentSign In or Create an Accountor View more offersArticle content“We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot.

Although special elections are not necessarily predictive of how the midterms will go, Democrats see these results as showing a highly motivated base amid Trump's second term in office.What to KnowTuesday night delivered Democrats their latest overperformance in Virginia's 11th Congressional District. Democrat James Walkinshaw won the special election to replace the late Congressman Gerry Connolly by roughly a 50 point margin in the Fairfax County-based district.The district has long been safely Democratic as Northern Virginia's D.C. suburbs shifted leftward. But Walkinshaw's performance marks a larger margin than Harris carried the district by last November. She won it by only 34 points—roughly the same margin by which Connolly won reelection.This is part of a broader trend of Democrats winning by stronger margins than Harris last November across the country.Democrats' strongest overperformance comes from New York's 22nd Senate district, where Democrat Sam Sutton won by 35 points in a May special election. Trump carried the seat by 55 points in November, making for a 90 point overperformance. The district is located in South Brooklyn and includes Orthodox Jewish communities. While Trump has performed well there, it has been more open to Democrats down ballot.In an August special election for Rhode Island's 34th Senate District, based around North Providence, Democrat Stefano Famiglietti won by a 67-point margin—compared to Harris' 11-point margin last November.Meanwhile, Democrat Amanda Clinton pulled off a similarly strong win in an Oklahoma special election in June. She carried her Tulsa-based district by 69 points, compared to Harris' 19-point victory.Democrats have overperformed in 34 special elections, while Republicans have overperformed in five special elections in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. There have been four additional non-partisan special elections in Louisiana and Mississippi.What People Are SayingMartin told Newsweek: \"As the fall election season starts, the DNC is all hands on deck to win the crucial Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and California ballot measure elections in November. Democrats have overperformed or won in 41 out of 42 key elections so far this year, including last month having our third double digit overperformance in Iowa this year after deploying our distributed organizing program. That is the core of our mission. The DNC is committed to building infrastructure and power across the country and that starts with these critical November elections.\"Split Ticket analyst Lakshya Jain wrote to X in March: \"Main implication of all of this special election hullaballoo is that Republicans are starting to realize like Obama 2008, many of their new voters just don't care about non-presidential elections — and that generally makes for ugly midterms on turnout alone.\"What Happens NextTwo major elections held this year are viewed as key bellwethers for the midterms—those are the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races. Democrats are leading polls in both of those races, but Republicans are still optimistic about their chances, particularly in New Jersey.","summary":"Democrats have overperformed VIce President Kamala Harris' margin in more than two dozen special elections this year.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-overperforming-special-elections-map-2127881","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2719981/democrats-overperforming-special-elections.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=cef61de49826b2ab9980cf5bcc53be64","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-10 19:08:51","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.154},{"id":359336480,"title":"Kamala Acknowledges White House Concern Over Biden’s Health","text":"Kamala Harris, the former Vice President, has acknowledged in a somewhat confusing manner that she was aware President Joe Biden might not be the best candidate for reelection, but chose not to voice her concerns, effectively keeping this information under wraps. She now reflects on this decision, labeling it an act of “recklessness.”\n\nThen, because this is Word Salad Kammy we’re talking about, she says Biden was fine.\n\nIn her forthcoming memoir, 107 Days, which features a segment published in the Atlantic, Harris openly confronts this matter:\n\n“Throughout those months filled with rising anxiety, should I have advised Joe against running? Perhaps. Yet, the American people had previously elected him in a similar contest,” she explains. “Maybe his belief that they would reelect him was justified.”\n\nThen she admits it was “recklessness” for someone (including herself) not to have stepped in to stop Biden from running for another term:\n\nShe recalls how everyone often repeated, “It’s Joe and Jill’s decision,” almost as if they were under a spell. Was it a display of grace, or was it carelessness? Looking back, Harris considers it was indeed carelessness. The situation was too critical for it to be treated as a mere personal choice motivated by someone’s ego or ambition.\n\nYet, true to form, Harris manages to contradict herself by asserting that Biden was fit for the role, a belief she still maintains:\n\nMany attempt to create a storyline about a massive White House cover-up of Joe Biden’s health. [Me: But, wait, you just mentioned there were “months of growing panic,” which indicates a significant concealment effort at the White House.] Here’s the reality from my perspective. Joe Biden was an intelligent man with vast experience and strong convictions, fully able to fulfill presidential duties. Even on his least favorable day, he was more informed and competent, with greater judgment and more compassion, compared to Donald Trump on his best day. At 81, Joe occasionally showed signs of fatigue, evident in his physical and verbal slips. It’s unsurprising to me that the debate incident occurred following consecutive trips to Europe and a journey to the West Coast for a Hollywood fundraiser. I don’t attribute it to a lack of capacity. Had that been my belief, I would have expressed it. Ultimately, while I hold great loyalty to President Biden, my loyalty to my country is stronger. [emphasis added]\n\nNote how she writes, “I don’t believe it was incapacity.” So, she’s claiming she still doesn’t believe it was incapacity. Okay, then why does she consider it “reckless” that no one stepped in to stop Biden from running again?\n\nShe is spewing total nonsense: contradicting herself, dissembling…\n\nNot even 60 Minutes could edit this nonsense into something cohesive.\n\nAlso of note is that she admitted to — and this is important — “months of growing panic” over Biden’s obvious decline.\n\nMonths, y’all.\n\nSo alarm bells were going off in the White House for months, which proves White House staffers were worried about Biden’s frailty long before that fateful debate. After all, it was only three weeks between the debate and Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race.\n\nMonths of growing panic at the White House over Biden’s inability to run for president, and no one did anything other than cover it up.\n\nAnd here’s the simple truth: If Biden was incapable of running for president, he was incapable of being president.\n\nKamala has had at least six months to write this book, and this is the best she could come up with? This is one dumb woman.\n\nThroughout the rest of the excerpt, she mostly complains about how Biden and the White House undermined her campaign.\n\nMaybe, but she was hopeless either way. Did Joe Biden hypnotize her to lie about having worked at McDonald’s?\n\nWith $1.5 billion in campaign cash and the entire corporate media fawning over her, covering for her, promoting and shilling for her, she had it all … and still blew it.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

He was 31.\n\nKirk died doing what made him a potent political force — rallying the right on a college campus, this time Utah Valley University. His shooting is one of an escalating number of attacks on political figures, from the assassination of a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota to last summer’s shooting of Trump, that have roiled the nation.\n\n— Mike Johnson speaks about killing of Charlie Kirk — \n\nTrump announced Kirk’s death on his social media site, Truth Social: “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie,” Trump wrote.\n\nKirk personified the pugnacious, populist conservatism that has taken over the Republican Party in the age of Trump. He launched his organization, Turning Point USA, in 2012, targeting younger people and venturing onto liberal-leaning college campuses where many GOP activists were nervous to tread.\n\nA backer of Trump during the president’s initial 2016 run, Kirk took Turning Point from one of a constellation of well-funded conservative groups to the center of the right-of-center universe.\n\nTurning Point’s political wing helped run get-out-the-vote for Trump’s 2024 campaign, trying to energize disaffected conservatives who rarely vote. Trump won Arizona, Turning Point’s home state, by five percentage points after narrowly losing it in 2020. The group is known for its flamboyant events that often feature strobe lighting and pyrotechnics. It claims more than 250,000 student members.\n\nTrump on Wednesday praised Kirk, who started as an unofficial adviser during Trump’s 2016 campaign and more recently became a confidant. “He was a very, very good friend of mine and he was a tremendous person,” Trump told the New York Post.\n\nKirk showed off an apocalyptic style in his popular podcast, radio show and on the campaign trail. During an appearance with Trump in Georgia last fall, he said that Democrats “stand for everything God hates.” Kirk called the Trump vs. Kamala Harris choice “a spiritual battle.”\n\n“This is a Christian state. I’d like to see it stay that way,” Kirk told the 10,000 or so Georgians, who at one point joined Kirk in a deafening chant of “Christ is King! Christ is King!”\n\nKirk had also remained a regular presence on college campuses. Last year, for the social media program “Surrounded,” he faced off against 20 liberal college students to defend his viewpoints, including that abortion is murder and should be illegal.\n\nKirk was married to podcaster Erika Frantzve. They have two young children.\n\n— Dan Hausle on Charlie Kirk’s impact of the 2024 election — \n\nTurning Point was founded in suburban Chicago in 2012 by a then 18-year-old Kirk and William Montgomery, a tea party activist, to proselytize on college campuses for low taxes and limited government. It was not an immediate success.\n\nBut Kirk’s zeal for confronting liberals in academia eventually won over an influential set of conservative financiers.\n\nDespite early misgivings, Turning Point enthusiastically backed Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination in 2016. Kirk served as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s eldest son, during the general election campaign.\n\nSoon, Kirk was a regular presence on cable TV, where he leaned into the culture wars and heaped praise on the then-president. Trump and his son were equally effusive and often spoke at Turning Point conferences.\n\nAs money poured in, Kirk bought a $4.75 million Spanish-style estate on a gated Arizona country club. Turning Point steered millions of dollars to contractors owned by Kirk and his associates, and some Republicans were skeptical when it announced it would spearhead an attempt to turn out infrequent voters during Trump’s 2024 campaign.\n\nBut as younger voters shifted right in 2024 and Trump ran up a five-point margin of victory in Arizona, Kirk and his allies claimed vindication of his view of a sharp-elbowed, culture-war-oriented conservatism.\n\nKirk’s evangelical Christian beliefs were intertwined with his political perspective, and he argued that there was no true separation of church and state.\n\nHe also referenced the Seven Mountain Mandate, which specifies seven areas where Christians are to lead — politics, religion, media, business, family, education and the arts, and entertainment.\n\nKirk argued for a new conservatism that advocated for freedom of speech, challenging Big Tech and the media, and centering working-class Americans beyond the nation’s capital.\n\n“We have to ask ourselves a question as a conservative movement: Are we going to revert back to the party of the status quo ruling class?” he said in his speech opening the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2020.\n\n“Or are we going to learn from what I call the MAGA doctrine? The MAGA doctrine, which is a doctrine of American renewal, revival, one that America is the greatest country in the history of the world.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.
