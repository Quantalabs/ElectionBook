Put aside that, as of yet, it is far from clear that any judicial orders have been violated. Even under the worst assumptions, what Trump is doing to the independence of the federal courts is far less serious than what the Biden-Harris Administration tried to do to the independence of the federal courts.\n\nOn April 9, 2021, President Biden created a \"Commission\" to examine \"reforming\" the \"membership\" of the U.S. Supreme Court. This action alone is a more serious threat to judicial independence and to the rule of law than are any of the actions with respect to the courts taken so far by President Trump. Imagine how the Democrats would react if President Trump were faced with a liberal Supreme Court majority and therefore created a Commission to examine \"reforming\" the \"membership\" of the Supreme Court. Democrats would say fascism was around the corner.\n\nAmong the ideas the Biden Commission seriously considered were imposing 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices by passing a statute. This is an idea which I once favored for policy reasons, but which I concluded decades ago in a law review article could only be done by a constitutional amendment. I have subsequently concluded that 18-year term limits for Supreme Court justices are also a bad idea, as a matter of policy, because every two-term president would get four Supreme Court appointments, which is almost always enough power to change the jurisprudential balance on the Supreme Court.\n\nNonetheless, after Joe Biden withdrew his presidential candidacy last summer because of his dismal performance in a nationally televised debate, he gave a speech in Texas endorsing a statute term limiting the Supreme Court justices (a proposal that was understood as calling for legislation, not a constitutional amendment, in part because in the same speech Biden called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision in Trump v. United States (2024) while not calling for a constitutional amendment to change the membership of the Supreme Court). Senator Sheldon Whitehouse's bill to do this provided for eliminating the Senate filibuster as to his 18 year Supreme Court term limits bill. Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic Party's nominee for president, immediately endorsed Joe Biden's plan for statutory court packing via term limits. As Senator Whitehouse's bill makes clear, the plan was to eliminate the Senate filibuster and ram the term limits, i.e., court packing, through both Houses of a narrowly divided Congress despite the absence of any popular mandate to make such a sweeping change, which would have trashed the rule of law and demolished the independence of our life tenured judiciary.\n\nThe size of the Supreme Court has been fixed at nine justices since 1869, 156 years of our 236-year history as a constitutional republic. An exhaustive survey by University of Wisconsin law professor Joshua Braver conclusively demonstrates that there is quite simply no tradition of Supreme Court packing or radical membership changes in American constitutional history. President Biden's actions and speeches after he withdrew from the presidential race, which were endorsed by Kamala Harris, were a flagrant attack on the independence of the U.S. Supreme Court and on the rule of law itself. They were un-American and smacked of the behavior that goes on in banana republics like Argentina, which are devoid of the rule of law.\n\nUnder Biden's proposal in July 2024, a new seat on the Supreme Court would be created by statute, and not by a constitutional amendment, for every Supreme Court justice who has served for 18 years or longer at the beginning of a President's first and third year in office. Once a justice was confirmed to that new seat, any justice who had served for 18 years or longer would be barred under Sen. Whitehouse's bill from hearing any case in the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Such justices would be unconstitutionally confined to hearing cases only in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or cases in the inferior federal courts, unless they resigned.\n\nThe Court would be \"packed\" because the number of justices would increase beyond the nine who have served since 1869, and justices who have served as \"Judges of the supreme Court\" would be disqualified from hearing cases in the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. Had Kamala Harris won in November 2024, and had a 50 to 50 Democratic Senate with a Democratic House of Representatives been elected, as could easily have happened, Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts would have been forced out of office in the first and third year of Kamala Harris's presidential term.\n\nApart from the unwisdom and un-Americanism of partisan court-packing, the plan is unconstitutional. Congress's supposed power to term limit or pack the Supreme Court comes from a clause in the Constitution which empowers Congress \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the judicial Power of the United States.\" This clause allows Congress to pass the rules of federal procedure. It allows Congress to create new judgeships and to regulate federal court jurisdiction to some degree, just as it allows Congress to create executive offices and cabinet departments and agencies.\n\nBut those laws creating judges must be \"necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\" the judicial power, not \"for undermining the judicial power.\" There are sometimes good grounds for creating new federal judgeships as the caseload of the existing judges gets out of hand, but it is not possible to say with a straight face that the Supreme Court is straining under its caseload, which is roughly a third of where it stood four decades ago. Nor can anyone say with a straight face that Clarence Thomas and John Roberts are suffering from the effects of old age that plague former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Necessary and Proper Clause does not allow Congress and the President to destroy the third co-equal branch of our federal government or to create two Supreme Courts when the Constitution says that there shall be only one. Court packing by statutory term limits is unconstitutional, and if such a bill is ever enacted into law, it will be the duty of the Supreme Court to hold it unconstitutional.\n\nThis was a very serious threat to judicial independence and the rule of law. Certainly, nothing President Trump has done so far comes even close.\n\nStatutorily imposed term limits, for their part, would have applied to \"Judges of the supreme Court\" whose offices are critically created by the Constitution itself, and not by federal statutes. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution specifically says that: \"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint … Judges of the Supreme Court ……\" \"Shall\" means \"must,\" and so the Constitution itself creates the offices of \"Judges of the supreme Court,\" and it orders the President to fill those offices. Moreover, Article III of the Constitution specifically adds that \"The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their offices during good Behavior.\"\n\nCongress can term limit the time during which Supreme Court justices serve as inferior court judges, when they sit by designation on the inferior federal courts, because it was Congress, not the Constitution, which gave Supreme Court justices this dual office. Hence, it was constitutional for Congress to eliminate circuit-riding by Supreme Court justices. But Congress cannot legislate as to the office of \"Judge of the supreme Court,\" which the Constitution both creates and grants life tenure to.\n\nLikewise, Congress cannot prevent \"Judges of the supreme Court\" from hearing cases on the Supreme Court's appellate docket because Article III of the Constitution provides that \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court\" and that that power \"shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority\" as well as to eight other categories of Cases or Controversies.\n\nCongress's only power to regulate the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is to make good housekeeping rules for how the Supreme Court exercises its appellate jurisdiction. Congress may not create two Supreme Courts: one of which hears critically important appellate jurisdiction cases and the other of which hears only trivial original jurisdiction cases. The opening words of Article III could not be clearer in saying that Congress may create \"one\" and only \"one\" Supreme Court.\n\nSo, this was the first and most flagrant Biden Administration violation of the rule of law and attack on judicial independence.\n\nThen there was the extortionate threat that the Biden-Harris Administration made in Murthy v. Missouri (2024) to Facebook, Meta, and YouTube that the Administration would bring an antitrust lawsuit against these companies to break them up unless they censored free speech, including truthful information, related to Covid-19, election integrity, and other topics, under the guise of combating misinformation. Justice Alito's dissent describes in chilling detail this threat to free speech and the First Amendment. The only reason the Supreme Court did not reach the merits was an absence of standing to sue. When it comes to extortion to shut down freedom of speech, the Biden-Harris Administration wrote the playbook.\n\nAnother Biden Administration attack on the rule of law occurred in 2021, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a nationwide moratorium on the eviction by landlords of tenants, allegedly to stop the spread of Covid-19. This was as consequential and uncompensated taking of the private property of landlords as that which occurred in the 1952 Steel Seizure Case. In Alabama Ass'n of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Services (2021), the Supreme Court held that this was an executive branch abuse of power, because it exceeded any statutory power the executive branch had.\n\nThen, on November 5, 2021, OSHA, spurred on once again by President Biden, announced that his administration would be promulgating a vaccination or test mandate for all private companies with 100 or more employees. This order came at a time when many Americans, especially conservatives, were afraid to be vaccinated. A vaccination mandate is a violation of the right to bodily integrity that can only be justified when there are years of proof that the vaccine works and is safe to take. In National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor, OSHA (2022), the Supreme Court ruled, under the Court's Major Questions Doctrine, that OSHA had exceeded its statutory authority in issuing this sweeping, totalitarian mandate on all American workplaces.\n\nDemocrats now complain that President Trump is playing fast and loose with statutory text. They may be right on occasion, as with using IEEPA to raise and lower tariff rates (as I have repeatedly argued), but where were these Democrats a few years ago?\n\nThen, yet again in 2021, the Biden Administration tried to use an obscure portion of the Clean Air Act to get the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate climate change regulations that would have cost trillions of dollars to comply with. This would have bankrupted the country and greatly depressed economic growth. In West Virginia v. EPA (2022), the Supreme Court struck down these rules as being unauthorized by statute, and as raising a Major Question that must be dealt with by Congress.\n\nAnd in Biden v. Nebraska (2023), the Biden Administration tried to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt to help itself politically with younger voters even though Biden must have known that he had no statutory authority to do this. The Administration woefully exceeded its statutory authority to forgive such debt, and the Supreme Court struck down the debt forgiveness plan, again under the Major Questions Doctrine. (The Court correctly recognized that the statutory authority was limited to narrow waivers and modifications in the event of \"national emergenc[ies],\" such as the 9/11 attack that prompted the enactment of the law.)\n\nAnd finally, on his last full day in office in 2025, President Biden preposterously declared that the Equal Rights Amendment had been validly ratified and was now the 28th Amendment to the Constitution. This attempt to alter the 236 year-old rule of recognition for Article V changes to the Constitution is a form of \"constitutional vandalism,\" and is contrary to precedents such as Dillon v. Gloss (1921) and Illinois v. Ferriero (D.C. Cir. 2023).\n\nThis analysis does not even include President Biden's, and the Democratic Party's, four prosecutions of former President Donald Trump on flimsy charges, plus New York State's outrageous $450 million civil suit against President Trump. Until the Biden Administration, no President had ever prosecuted his predecessor in office for anything. Joe Biden tore up that rule and threw the whole weight of the Department of Justice and the FBI against President Trump who he was running against in the 2024 presidential election. The States of New York and Georgia piled on. As former Judge, and now Stanford law professor, Michael McConnell wrote in the Wall Street Journal, the New York State criminal case, in particular, was a sham and a travesty of justice.\n\nThe only charge brought against President Trump that was even plausible was mishandling of classified documents, but former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton had had a private email server that was unsecured at her private home and that could have been easily hacked by the Russians that had classified documents on it. Since Clinton was not prosecuted for this gross breach of mishandling classified information, then-former President Trump should not have been prosecuted for misuse of classified information either. To make matters worse, Attorney General Merrick Garland even appointed an unconstitutional Special Prosecutor to go after Trump, as Judge Aileen Cannon of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida correctly held in the summer of 2024.\n\nNo President has posed a bigger threat to judicial independence, to the freedom of speech, to liberty (by woefully misreading federal statutes), or to constitutional norms (like not prosecuting your predecessor in office) than President Biden did. I have spoken out against what I see as the improper actions of the Trump Administration, such as its treatment of Columbia University, its attempt to rescind birthright citizenship, and its exceeding its statutory authority as to tariffs; but I think the Biden Administration's record on following the rule of law and respecting judicial independence is dreadful. To those who fear that the United States is becoming an authoritarian state, thank God that the Biden-Harris Administration is no longer in office.\n\nThat being said, I very strongly disapprove of the Trump Administration's behavior toward law firms, its threats to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, and its attempts to coerce university speech and mandate curricula. I expect to discuss those lengthy subjects in a later post.","summary":"Democrats tried to alter unconstitutionally the membership of the Supreme Court; they extorted Facebook into censoring free speech; they issued presidential executive orders unsupported by statute; and they pushed unprecedented prosecutions of Biden's predecessor in office, and his 2024 opponent, in the presidential race.","url":"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/05/08/president-bidens-and-the-democrats-assault-on-the-supreme-court-and-the-rule-of-law/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 00:38:31","author":"Jack Nicastro,Steven Calabresi","authors":["Jack Nicastro","Steven Calabresi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":319343580,"title":"Hate and hackery: How the Pulitzer Prize destroyed itself","text":"This week Mosab Abu Toha, a Hamas apologist and serial fabricator who vilified female Israeli hostages and justified their kidnapping on Oct. 7, won the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for commentary for a series of essays about Gaza in The New Yorker.\n\nIt is unsurprising, because the Pulitzer Prize has become an irremediable joke.\n\nYou’d think that the Pulitzer, administered and awarded by Columbia University, would want to repair its tattered reputation after awarding a slew of debunked pieces that spread the Russia-collusion hoax.\n\nThey went in another direction.\n\nThe Pulitzer for “public service,” for instance, went to the leftist propaganda site ProPublica for “exposing the fatal consequences of abortion bans.”\n\nProPublica is perhaps the nation’s leading purveyor of Potemkin journalism, which entails dressing up political propaganda with neutral-sounding journalistic verbiage to create the impression that you’ve done genuine reporting. \n\nIts abortion stories are perhaps the sloppiest and sleaziest of its catalog, even worse than its string of pitiful smears against Supreme Court justices. \n\nIn a healthy environment, journalism schools would use them as prime examples of hackery and conjecture.\n\nTake its award-winning story on Amber Thurman.\n\nIn August 2022, the 28-year-old North Carolina woman checked herself into a suburban Atlanta hospital emergency room, complaining of severe pain. She was suffering from an infection caused by the remains of twin fetuses she had aborted by pill five days earlier.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice when reading ProPublica’s Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters is that they fail to offer a single on-the-record source who maintains that abortion laws slowed or stopped doctors from providing medical help for Thurman.\n\nIndeed, a reader must plow through to the 57th paragraph of the article to find this throwaway line: “It is not clear from the records available why doctors waited to provide [emergency help].”\n\nNot clear? That’s a remarkable concession to make deep into a story.\n\nThe headline, after all, promises to prove that “Abortion Bans Have Delayed Emergency Medical Care.” Have, not may have.\n\nAnyway, by “not clear,” the reporters mean no testimony exists to support the implication that a dilation and curettage procedure, in which the lining of the uterus is scraped to remove tissue, was delayed because doctors were nervous about Georgia’s abortion law.\n\nWhenever the story hits a juncture at which any real reporter would feel compelled to offer corroboration, ProPublica switches to interviewing nameless “OB-GYNs in states that outlawed abortion” or pro-abortion activists who offer politically motivated guesswork.\n\nWe call that a “column” in the business.\n\nTo confuse readers, ProPublica regularly conflates miscarriages with elective abortions.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: The fetuses had already been destroyed. There was absolutely no legal basis for any doctor, not even one confused about the supposed ambiguities of abortion laws, to fail to give Thurman all the care she needed.\n\nThat seems like a vital fact that should have been mentioned somewhere in a 3,400-word investigative piece.\n\nI don’t care where you stand on abortion, that’s not journalism. Yet this is the type of hackery that wins you a Pulitzer these days.\n\nThe only inarguable truth in the Thurman case is that she died from complications caused by abortion pills.\n\nThat’s the headline. That’s the buried lede.\n\nKnowing this, ProPublica feels compelled to assure readers that there are only “rare complications” from abortion pills — “extremely rare” even.\n\nProPublica, funded by a deep-pocketed progressive group, exists to create fake stories for politicians to use as oppo material.\n\nYou may remember when many political experts assured us that the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision and resulting state-level abortion limitations would forever sink the entire GOP?\n\nWell, less than a week after the Thurman story hit, Axios reported that Senate Democrats would launch a “blitz on emergency abortion care . . . after ProPublica reporting on death of Georgia woman.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned Thurman on many occasions.\n\nIt should be said that ideological bias doesn’t prevent a journalist from making arguments that rely on facts.\n\nIt is implausible, however, that any genuine journalist could possibly believe ProPublica’s Thurman story was well-reported, or that Abu Toha’s essays enlightened anyone.\n\nAnd the fact that the Pulitzer Prize rewards this kind of transparent hackery only further destroys its already battered credibility. \n\nDavid Harsanyi is a senior writer at the Washington Examiner.","summary":"This week Mosab Abu Toha, a Hamas apologist and serial fabricator who vilified female Israeli hostages and justified their kidnapping on Oct. 7, won the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for commentary.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/08/opinion/hate-and-hackery-how-the-pulitzer-prize-destroyed-itself/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/newspress-collage-89lyphquz-1746742291488.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1746727983&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 23:52:34","author":"David Harsanyi","authors":["David Harsanyi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.568},{"id":319341616,"title":"Joe Biden's Wife Jill Gives Former President 'Signal' To Stop Answering Risky Questions — After Admitting He Wasn't Surprised Trump Beat Kamala","text":"Joe Biden seemed to be shut down by his own wife Jill during a visit to The View Thursday, RadarOnline.com can report. \n\nThe former president dropped by the ABC program for just his second TV interview since leaving the White House, as he took responsibility for Donald Trump's big election win.Joe, 82, was asked about critics claiming he suffered a sharp \"cognitive decline\" during his final year in office.\n\nAs he stammered through a response, the former president started to make a point, telling the hosts, \"You know, one of the things.\"\n\n Before he could finish his thought, he stopped suddenly – mid sentence – simply saying: \"I've spoken enough.\" \n\nJill, 73, instantly picked up the rest of the question, as Joe stared down at the ground. \n\nSharp-eyed viewers took to X.com to speculate that Jill gave him some sort of predetermined \"secret signal,\" like a nudge or kick, to get him to stop speaking.The People Have Spoken\"Truly amazing stuff here,\" one person tweeted. \"Joe Biden is asked about the books that have been written about his cognitive decline.

She has frequently spoken out against Democrats this year despite her past support for the party.What to KnowLi addressed Biden's alleged decline in an interview with journalist Tara Palmeri, who published on YouTube on Wednesday. Li said she began to believe Biden was not \"as quick as he was before\" in 2022 and noticed that he would need notecards \"for simple things\" at events, she said.She believed Biden was given questions beforehand during a small event in February 2023 and that his answers came across as \"rehearsed,\" she said.

Palmeri asked Li if she had any \"regrets\" about her time with Biden and not doing anything to share her concerns at the time.\"Trust me, I do all the time,\" Li said. \"It causes me agony.\"In the weeks following the election, Li increasingly broke with the party before leaving it altogether.

He blasted the Fake News Puff Piece in an angry post on Wednesday morning, demanding that CBS be held accountable for its lies. Its nomination in the Outstanding Edited Interview category is a total slap in the face to TRUTH and Honest Journalism , according to Trump, who has repressed the free press and praised outlets that spread his ideology. Did 60 Minutes and its Corporate Parents apply to get an Emmy for an illegally falsified interview, or did other Fake Outlets nominate them for this dubious 'honour'? he continued, railing against the totally discredited Emmys,” as quoted in a report by the Daily Beast.Was the Harris interview really altered?His argument is based on the fact that the show chose to play a clip of one part of Harris' response on CBS's Face the Nation, followed by another part the following day. Although its parent company, Paramount Global, has attempted to reach a settlement to ensure its merger with Skydance, CBS has stated that the interview was not fraudulently edited.President Donald Trump also called the article an election-interfering interview... which aired on CBS just before Election Day and deep into early voting on Wednesday.According to the president, CBS illegally fixed, manipulated, and doctored throughout Harris' answers, in an attempt to make Kamala appear at least somewhat coherent.

This country will be like a rocket ship that goes straight up.”\n\nThe stock market seemed to agree, rising more than 500 points on the news that we might avoid tariff induced inflation or an economic slowdown.\n\nBut buying the stock market now with a difficult China trades deal looming plus the EU? Maybe, though consider the following:\n\nMore trade deals will be announced probably as early as next week with India and Japan. India would have emerged first if it weren’t for its government being distracted with a possible war with Pakistan, my sources with contacts in the White House say. Australia and South Korea could follow.\n\nMore good news. We may even get a surprise or two that should boost confidence that Trump learned from the near implosion of the markets that followed “liberation day” and caused him to “pause” his sledgehammer approach to trade and instead cut deals using the deft hand of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rather than the blunt of instrument of Howard Lutnick or Peter Navarro.\n\nHere’s my worry: Those deals are small potatoes. So is the UK, with an economy valued at a little less than $4 trillion.\n\nFor comparison, the US has a GDP of more than $30 trillion, while China is hovering at $20 trillion, the EU (European countries outside of the UK) at $20 trillion.\n\nWe still don’t have deals with two trading partners with economies that, when combined, dwarf the size of the US.\n\nAnother worry: There seems to be something contrived about the UK framework. My sources say Team Trump pushed for the deal when it became clear that India was taking longer than expected. The framework, such as it is, was light on details.\n\nThe US runs a trade surplus with the UK, it’s a friend, yet the baseline 10% tariff remains. The deal cuts UK car tariffs to 10% from 25%, but how many working-class folks do you know who drive a Rolls, a Jaguar, or a Bentley?\n\nPlus, the UK isn’t China — not even close. China with its massive consumer market and ability to provide US consumers with cheap stuff and it’s the big kahuna in Trump’s trade gable. Get it right with China, and the US economy could flourish.\n\nGet it wrong and prepare for inflation — possibly a recession.\n\nBessent is preparing to fly to Geneva to meet with Chinese economic leaders to try and get it right in what many think will be a grueling series of trade negotiations. Trump certainly appreciates what is at stake.\n\nThe administration is already looking to exempt baby items — car seats and strollers — that use parts made in China because the last thing Trump needs is to stoke inflation on working families, something that followed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris right through the election.\n\nTrump has already said is initial 145% tariff on Chinese good will be a lot less; The Post is now reporting it might be brought down to 50% to get a deal.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not a fan of betting against Donald Trump because I learned from experience. Most thought he wouldn’t return from the political near dead after January 6, lawfare would put him in jail or at the very least slow him down. Sorry not even a bullet grazing his head could do that.\n\nBut Thursday’s UK deal is the beginning of something, not the end.

His public reemergence — he also sat for a BBC interview that aired Wednesday — comes before the imminent release of books expected to be critical of his sharpness and his ability to have sought reelection last year.\n\n“They are wrong,” Biden said of reports that he had declined in his final year in office. “There’s nothing to sustain that.” He later added, “The only reason I got out of the race is because I didn’t want to have a divided Democratic Party.”\n\nBiden said that while Democratic leaders and donors wanted him to drop out after his poor debate performance in June, the party’s rank and file did not — an assertion that runs counter to polling before and after the debate.\n\n“The Democratic Party at large didn’t buy into it,” he said of the push for him to quit the race. “But the Democratic leadership and some of the very significant contributors did.”\n\nAs Biden sits for interviews, his party is not exactly longing for his presence as it tries to fight Trump’s attempts to dismantle large parts of the federal government and the international alliances of which Biden remains proud. A host of ambitious Democrats vying for influence before the 2028 presidential primary race have been discussing ways to cast the party in a new light.\n\nNone of them have been particularly eager to revisit Biden’s decision to seek reelection or to explore why former Vice President Kamala Harris was unable to defeat Trump. Biden, however, offered thoughts on both subjects.\n\nHe said that he “wasn’t surprised” that Harris had lost and that she had fallen victim to sexist attacks.\n\n“They went the route of the sexist route,” Biden said of the Trump campaign and other Republicans. “I’ve never seen quite as successful and a consistent campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country, and a woman of mixed race.”\n\nBiden also said a pandemic hangover had altered Americans’ relationship with their government in a way that was not fully appreciated during the presidential campaign.\n\n“I think we underestimate the phenomenal negative impact that COVID had and the pandemic had on people, on attitudes, on optimism, on a whole range of things,” he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that his White House had not done an adequate job of delivering immediate results and had instead focused on longer-term projects like his infrastructure and computer chip legislation.\n\n“Well, we made a lot of commitments, and we — you know, billion-dollar tunnels going through for Amtrak, bridges, so on — but we weren’t quite as good as he was about advertising it,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s constant sales pitch. “It doesn’t say, ‘Biden brought you this.’ There’s nothing saying, ‘The Democrats brought you this.’ And we knew none of this would occur for another six months to two years. It takes time to do all that.”\n\nBiden dodged a question about whether he would have defeated Trump had the former president not abandoned his campaign last July. But he did accept some responsibility for Harris’ loss.\n\n“Yes. I do, because, look, I was in charge, and he won,” Biden said. “So, you know, I take responsibility.”\n\nWhile Biden offered a somewhat familiar defense of his legacy and his ability to serve as president, his wife, Jill Biden, offered more aggressive pushback. Joining him in the interview, she attacked journalists who have written books about her husband and others who have said he was a diminished figure as his White House term concluded. She also denied reporting suggesting that she had been overprotective of him.\n\n“The people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us,” she said. “I was with Joe day and night. I saw him more than any other person. I went — woke up with him; I went to bed at night with him. So I saw him all throughout the day, and I did not create a cocoon around him.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Former President Joe Biden defended his mental acuity during an interview today and blamed sexism, the coronavirus pandemic and his struggle to provide Americans with short-term results for President Donald Trump&#8217;s return to power.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/05/08/breaking-news/biden-defends-his-mental-acuity-blames-sexism-for-harris-defeat/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/themes/hsa-redesign/images/thumbnail-128x128.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 20:30:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":319306556,"title":"Miss Joe And Jill Biden On ‘The View’?

We'd argue like hell, by the way.”\n\nBiden dropped out of the presidential race in July 2024 and endorsed Harris as his successor after growing criticisms of his performance in a debate with Trump the previous month.\n\nWhen asked what he would say to critics who suggest that stepping aside a little more than 100 days before the election hampered the former vice president’s campaign, Biden touted his administration’s accomplishments.\n\n“We got more major legislation passed to fundamentally change the direction of the country than any president has in a long, long time—decades,” Biden said. “My point is that we had a very successful effort to change the direction of the country, and we did, and [Harris] was every single part of that.”\n\nBiden said he waited until this interview to speak out on Trump’s first 100 days in office due to a longstanding tradition of allowing one’s successor some time to “get off the ground without going after him.”\n\nBut enough time has now elapsed, the former president suggested.\n\n“I think he has done, quite frankly, a very poor job in the interest of the United States of America,” Biden said. “I think, you know, the greatest Alliance in the history of the world is NATO, not a joke, and he’s blown it up. I was able to expand it.”\n\nThe hosts noted how Trump has mentioned Biden, his family, or his administration hundreds of times since Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 and asked Biden why he believes the president is fixated on him.\n\n“I beat him,” Biden said with a smile, referring to the 2020 election.\n\nHowever, the former president said he took partial responsibility for Trump prevailing in the 2024 election.\n\n“Look, I was in charge, and he won. So, you know, I take responsibility,” he said.\n\nWhen asked about allegations that he was in a “dramatic decline” of his cognitive abilities during the final year of his presidency, Biden said the anonymous sources cited in various media reports were wrong.\n\n“There’s nothing to sustain that,” he said.\n\nInstead, Biden said he dropped out of the race because he didn’t want to divide the Democratic Party further.\n\n“That’s why I got out of the race. And I thought it was better to put the country ahead of my interest, my personal interest. I’m not being facetious. I’m being deadly earnest about that,” Biden said.\n\nHe acknowledged the concerns many had about his age, since he would have been 86 years old by the end of a potential second term.\n\n“I get it. I understand the concern. I really do. But the point of the matter is that I would offer specific evidence, if we had time, exactly what I got done when I supposedly lost my cognitive capability,” Biden said.\n\n“When I got out of the race, I was still going to be president. I think I did a pretty damn good job the last six months.”","summary":"Biden fielded questions on the 2024 election, including addressing allegations that he was in cognitive decline during his final year in office.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-sits-down-with-abcs-the-view-in-1st-interview-since-leaving-office-5854483","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/25/id5730161-GettyImages-2173561309-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 20:01:50","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":319320398,"title":"Joe and Jill Biden fire back on 'The View' against accusations of health cover-up, call stories 'wrong'","text":"Former President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden fired back on \"The View\" on Thursday against stories about Joe's mental decline behind the scenes at the White House, with Jill cutting in at one point as the ex-president trailed off while defending his record.

Number two, you know, think of what we left with. We left with a circumstance where we had an insurrection when I started, not since the Civil War.

I mean, it was nonstop.\" She praised her husband for working hard and said, based on the state of things now under President Donald Trump, \"give me Joe Biden any time,\" leading to loud applause from the audience. Griffin also pressed the former president about his dramatic departure from the 2024 race under pressure from fellow Democrats like Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. He said he exited because he didn't want a divided Democratic Party, while again insisting during the show he could have beaten Trump. \"I thought it was better to put the country ahead of my interests, my personal interests. I’m not being facetious. I’m being deadly earnest about that,\" Joe said. \"And I think that we still— let me put it this way. I had six more months. Did a pretty good job in six months.\" AGE-OLD SENIORITY QUESTION DIVIDES DEMOCRATS AS BIDEN RETURNS TO NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT He acknowledged concerns about his age — he would have been 86 at the end of a second term and was already the oldest American president in history — but said he got plenty done when \"I supposedly lost my cognitive capability.\" Co-host Whoopi Goldberg, a fervent Biden supporter, suggested that his poor showing at the debate last year started the whole concern over his fitness for office. \"Why do you think people bought into it, especially the Democrats?\" Goldberg asked. Joe said he hadn't lost many debates but acknowledged he had a \"bad night\" while also saying he was sick that evening. His wife said he admitted it to her afterward — and he used a colorful term for \"screwed up\" — but she didn't want those 90 minutes to define his presidency. \"We all saw it, it was terrible,\" Jill said of her husband's debate performance. In actuality, Republicans and some Democrats had been raising concerns before the debate for years and especially throughout 2024 about Joe's mental fitness, through such moments as the Robert Hur report that mentioned his failing memory, a bombshell Wall Street Journal story about behind-the-scenes concerns, and various viral videos of him appearing to freeze up or seem confused that the White House dismissed as \"cheap fakes.\" However, the debate's fallout was unmistakable. Although Joe held on at first, he succumbed to party pressure and exited the contest on July 21, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who went on to lose the general election to Trump.

More than half of Latinx voters confidently casted their ballots for him, and after just 108 days of Trump back in the White House, folks are having regrets... but it’s way too late!\n\nSince Trump’s return, mass deportations have disproportionately shaken Hispanic communities nationwide. Recent news of Trump rescinding the Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants was immediately met with backlash within the Latinx community, who thought they’d be protected from Trump’s onslaught of attacks on migrants.\n\nAdelys Ferro, the director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told NPR he feels “beyond betrayed” by the administration. “They used us,” Ferro said, and he’s not the only one. The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported on a family of MAGA Latinos who tearfully shared how their son was taken to an ICE detention center despite him having a green card.\n\nBut while many in the Latinx community continue to express their disbelief for Trump’s actions, Black people are sitting back like “we told you so.” On X, @NaClyCem, pointed out how Black Americans warned their Latinx brothers and sisters “Trump is racist and is going to deport anyone who is not the right color. Latinos should not support him,” but not enough people listened.\n\nBlack people, in fact, began warning about Trump over a decade ago. In 2015, the Latinx community found its way at the center of the immigration debate after Trump repeatedly villainized Hispanic migrants. But despite the president targeting “rapists” and “terrorist gang members” coming from across the Southern border, thousands of Latinx voters still sang along to “I will vote for Donald Trump” jingles at rallies before showing up and out for Trump... twice.\n\nNow, Trump is honoring his self-proclaimed “mandate” to tackle immigration, and in response, thousands of protestors continue to flood the streets— many in cities with majority Latinx populations like San Antonio and Miami, according to Texas Public Radio and the Miami Herald. \n\nTensions only rose more after stories of folks like Kilmar Abrego Garcia made national headlines. Garcia was arrested and deported to El Salvador, despite a judge’s 2019 order barring him from being sent there, according to NBC News. The Trump administration continues to claim Garcia is an active member of a dangerous gang, but a different judge ordered his return back to the states. Trump refuses to do so.\n\nMany in the Black community empathize with stories like Garcia’s. @Biz4Ever tweeted, “Because many of us have been falsely accused & sentenced but not released, we actually can relate more to Kilmar Abrego Garcia” compared to Trump, who claimed to relate to Black folks after being convicted on 34 felonies. \n\nBut on the other side, most folks aren’t as concerned considering the 51 percent of pro-Trump Latinx voters, according to exit polls. @notcapnamerica asked, “What are we supposed to do with this information,” referring to the AJC’s article. @DrAlbertUtd responded, “We used all our empathy when we voted for the women that wouldn’t have done this,” referencing former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIs the Black community heartless for this so-called “lack of empathy?” No, but they are frustrated not only with Trump but also with the Latino people who put him back in office, against their own interests. The president has a “deport now and ask questions later” motto, and unfortunately, the Latinx community will likely continue to bear the brunt of it.","summary":"It’s too late to get their money back, but Latinx voters are expressing buyer’s remorse after electing President Donald Trump.

There's nothing to sustain that.”\n\nAsked about his widely criticised debate performance that fueled Democratic concerns last June, Biden admitted it was a poor showing.“It was a bad night,” he said.“We were still winning the primary. The Democratic Party at large didn't buy into it, but the Democratic leadership and some of the very significant contributors did.”\n\nDespite his eventual withdrawal, Biden maintained he was confident in his chances.“I do [believe I could have won], because look, I was in charge and he won,” Biden said.“So I take responsibility.”\n\nBiden didn't hold back when discussing Trump 's return to power, criticising his rival's early days in office.\n\n“Let me put it this way, he's had the worst 100 days any president's ever had,” Biden said.“And I would not say honesty has been his strong point.”\n\nBiden emphasised that his decision to withdraw was ultimately about party unity.“The only reason I got out of the race was because I didn't want to have a divided Democratic Party,” he said.\n\nReflecting on his exit, Biden noted:“When I left the race, Kamala had hundreds of millions of dollars. She had the best organized-through our campaign-every organization, every state was organized.”\n\nThe former president also weighed in on Kamala Harris' failed 2024 bid , saying he was“not surprised” by her loss and accused Republicans of running a sexist campaign.\n\n“I wasn't surprised, not because I didn't think the vice president was the most qualified person to be president... I wasn't surprised because they went the route of-the sexist route, the whole route,” Biden said.“I've never seen quite as successful and consistent a campaign, undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country-and a woman of mixed race.”\n\nBiden added that Harris, now considering her next move, has remained in close contact with him.“She has a difficult decision to make about what she's going to do. I hope she stays fully engaged,” he said.“I think she's first rate, but we have a lot of really good candidates as well.”\n\nBiden acknowledged 2024 was a challenging year, citing COVID-19's lingering effects and inflation. However, he admitted his administration struggled to highlight its successes.“We failed at advertising our wins and what we had accomplished,” Biden said.\n\nFormer first lady Jill Biden joined the interview's second half, defending her husband's work ethic and pushing back against claims of cognitive decline.\n\n“The people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us, and they didn't see how hard Joe worked every single day,” Jill Biden said.“He'd get up, he put in a full day, and then at night he would-I'd be in bed, you know, reading my book, and he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff. I mean, it was nonstop.”\n\nShe also addressed reports that she created a“cocoon” around Biden to shield him from scrutiny.“I was with Joe day and night. I saw him more than any other person... and I did not create a cocoon around him,” she said, calling allegations from“so-called friends”“very hurtful.”","summary":"(MENAFN - Live Mint) Former President Joe Biden on Thursday (May 8) rebuffed criticism over his delayed exit from the 2024 campaign, insisting in an interview on ABC's–The View– that he could have ...","url":"https://menafn.com/1109526349/Worst-100-Days-Ever-Joe-Biden-Rips-Into-Donald-Trump-Fires-Back-At-Mental-Decline-Claims","image":"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-05/08/LM_dfc82image_story.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 19:01:21","author":"Date,MENAFN","authors":["Date","MENAFN"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jo","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":319292856,"title":"Biden touts being ‘close’ with Harris, but 'not surprised' by election loss","text":"Former President Joe Biden, in a wide-ranging interview on ABC's \"The View\" on Thursday, said he was not surprised by Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in the 2024 presidential election, but not because of her qualifications as a candidate -- instead, pointing to sexism and racism he said had been leveled against her.\n\n\"I wasn't surprised, not because I didn't think the vice president was the most qualified person to be president … I wasn't surprised because they went the route of -- the sexist route, the whole route,\" Biden said.\n\nHe continued: \"I've never seen quite as successful and consistent campaign, undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country -- and a woman of mixed race.\"\n\nBut Biden, separately, said he still thinks he would have beaten Trump if he had stayed in the race.\n\n\"Yeah, he still got seven million fewer votes,\" Biden said of Trump, noting by how much he beat Trump in the 2020 election popular vote.\n\nHis comments come after several months out of the spotlight for the former president as he and Democrats look to sort out his role post-presidency. Last month, Biden emerged from private life to deliver a speech on Trump's potential impact on Social Security and made an appearance at Harvard University.\n\nQuestions persist on the party's priorities and who may be the best to message and communicate on the Democrats' behalf -- questions that extend to both Biden and Harris.\n\nBiden, for his part, told \"The View\" that he's in the midst of self-reflection -- and, to that end, writing a book.\n\n\"Things are moving along and we're getting squared away trying to figure out what the most significant and consequential role I can play, consistent with what I've done in the past,\" he said.\n\nThe former president also addressed his relationship with his former running-made-turned-candidate, saying that he and Harris had spoken as recently as Wednesday. Yet, he quickly stopped himself from addressing specifics of their \"frequent\" conversations, including side-stepping any chatter about Harris' possible gubernatorial or potential presidential ambitions.\n\nSources have told ABC News previously that Harris may be mulling a run for governor of California, her home state; others have speculated she could mount a run for president in 2028 -- a controversial notion within the Democratic Party.\n\nMany of Harris' longtime national supporters told ABC News in March that they are lukewarm on her potentially running for president in 2028; others have called for a full break from the Biden-Harris administration and for the party to consider new standard bearers.\n\nBut on Harris' broader political future, Biden said he was hopeful that she stayed involved in some significant way, but stopped short of sharing which route he hopes she takes.\n\n\"She's got a difficult decision to make about what she's going to do. I hope she stays fully engaged. I think she's first-rate, but we have a lot of really good candidates as well. So, I'm optimistic. I'm not pessimistic,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's remarks don't seem to have mollified progressives who felt he hamstrung Democrats' chances in 2024. Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green said in a statement after the interview that the former president is in \"denial\" over both his and Harris' viability as strong candidates on the 2024 ticket, suggesting that anti-establishment Democrats would fare better to lead the party.\n\n\"Joe Biden is in denial about the fact that neither he nor Kamala Harris should have been the 2024 Democratic nominee if we wanted to defeat Donald Trump. In this moment, voters demand authentic anti-establishment figures who will shake up a broken political system and economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people, and that's not Biden or Harris.\"\n\nAsked on \"The View\" to respond to claims that he should have dropped out of the race and endorse Harris sooner, Biden said that Harris still had a long period to campaign and that they worked together \"in every decision I made.\"\n\nBiden also denied reporting that claimed he had advised Harris to suggest that there was no daylight between the two of them -- saying that they were partners and worked together.\n\n\"The View\" co-anchor Sunny Hostin brought up Harris' comments on \"The View\" in October, toward the end of her presidential campaign, when asked if she would have done \"something differently\" from what Biden had done over the last four years. She responded, \"there is not a thing that comes to mind,\" a moment widely seen as one that hurt her among voters who felt she needed to make a cleaner break from the Biden White House.\n\n\"I did not advise her to say that,\" Biden said, adding that he thought Harris meant she would not change any of the successes that the Biden-Harris White House had achieved.\n\n\"She was part of every success we had. We'd argue like hell, by the way,\" Biden added, stressing that the disagreements were all signs of a positive working relationship.\n\nEven though he indicated no tension between himself and Harris, Biden did not answer directly when asked about tension between him and other longtime supporters, including former President Barack Obama, whose administration he served in as vice president.\n\nAsked about what his relationship with Obama is like now, and how he addresses concerns Obama and others reportedly raised over his ability to serve a second term as president, Biden pivoted to why he got out of the race -- and did not mention Obama.\n\n\"The only reason I got out of the race was because I didn't want to have a divided Democratic Party ... I thought it was better to put the country ahead of my interest, my personal interest,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden did say, in his response, that concerns over his age -- 81 during the campaign -- were valid, but pointed to what he still accomplished at the end of his presidency as evidence against claims he had cognitively declined.\n\nABC News' Alexandra Hutzler and Zohreen Shah contributed to this report.","summary":"Joe Biden told ABC's \"The View\" that he was not surprised by Kamala Harris' loss in the 2024 presidential election – pointing to sexism and racism.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-touts-close-relationship-harris-surprised-election-loss/story?id=121606391","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/3ea9200f-cc86-43a1-afa9-e8e79a6aa6a6/biden-view-3-abc-gmh-250508_1746718777096_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 19:01:21","author":"Brittany Shepherd,Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Brittany Shepherd","Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":319331204,"title":"Pope Leo, Global American","text":"Chicago, that somber city, has given the Catholic Church a pope, by way of Peru and Italy. Robert Francis Prevost’s life, like that of his church, has been nothing if not cosmopolitan, crossing borders and continents, spanning hemispheres. The Church, of course, is not only cosmopolitan but parochial as well, hewing to doctrines crafted more than a millennium ago by clerics a good deal less cosmopolitan than the crew that just anointed Prevost. The new pope, who’ll go by the name of Leo, brings to the job a background that’s pastoral, as was his predecessor’s. Whether that means Leo’s approach to humanity will be as inclusive as Francis’s, who didn’t let some of those ancient doctrines impede a more welcoming embrace to those who’d run afoul of some previously enforced thou-shalt-nots, remains to be seen.\n\nEven if Leo proves more orthodox in such matters than Francis, both his pastoral and globe-trotting histories suggest his brand of Catholicism won’t be anything like the just-us Catholicism of JD Vance. That may well mean that he will continue the Church’s tradition of elevating the global over the national, and also continue Francis’s affirmation of the rights of immigrants, which Francis made part of his Easter message just a few hours before he died.\n\nSo, will the first American pope criticize the war on immigrants now being waged by the worst American president? And will it have any special resonance coming as it does from an American, Chicago-born, from one of the most polyglot of cities?\n\nHistorically, the Church in America has periodically been divided over a multitude of issues, up to and including right now, when increasingly right-wing, orthodox, and censorious priests are busily prompting more centrist and moderate and abuse-concerned Catholics to leave the Church. But if there’s one unifying through line in the American Church’s history, it’s support for immigrants. For much of its history, after all, the American Church—clergy and laity both—consisted not just of immigrants, but immigrants whom America’s Protestant majority degraded and despised: the Irish, then the Italians, then the Mexicans and Latin Americans. Most of that history may seem ancient to us today, but we should remember that our nation didn’t have a Catholic president until John F. Kennedy, who had to pledge he’d heed no Vatican communiqués in order to win election. For that matter, we’ve only had one more Catholic president (Joe Biden) since Kennedy.\n\nBefore Kennedy, there was just one Catholic presidential nominee in our history: New York governor and Tammany Hall alumnus Al Smith, whom the Democrats nominated in 1928, and whose whistle-stop campaign train was greeted by burning crosses as he traversed our country. Smith had been a forceful and eloquent opponent of the 1924 law that had effectively closed off immigration to America from anyplace other than northwestern, Protestant Europe, and spoke consistently thereafter on the harm the nation was inflicting on itself by failing to open its doors to immigrants of all faiths from all over.\n\nSmith’s stance both reflected and informed that of the Church, so much so that the New York Archdiocese (Smith’s own) established a yearly Al Smith fundraising dinner, to which, in presidential election years, the nominees are invited to speak, so long as they don’t give campaign speeches. Last year’s was attended by Donald Trump, even though his views on immigrants and immigration were about as antithetical to Church doctrine as, say, a Chris Hitchens ode to atheism. Kamala Harris chose not to attend, perhaps in protest of the Church’s opposition to women’s reproductive freedoms, but thereby missing a chance to contrast her bona fides as Al Smith’s humanistic heir with Trump’s alignment with the anti-Smith, anti-Catholic cross-burners of 1928.\n\nThe history of the American Church, in which the history of Al Smith figures so prominently, is one of the legacies that Pope Leo inherits, all the more so since Pope Francis put the rights of immigrants at the center of Church concerns. And now that we have an American pope, will he invoke that history to oppose Trump’s conversion of the American republic to a deportation state? I have no way of knowing, but Leo has plenty of runway if he chooses to take that on.","summary":"Today on TAP: In its very DNA, the Catholic Church in the U.S. is pro-immigrant.

But he continued to stubbornly insist that he could have beaten his rival—and that, at 82, and declining in the public eye, he was still up for the job of the presidency. “He still got seven million fewer votes,” Biden said of Trump, when asked if he still thinks he would have won the 2024 race, which he exited after a disastrous debate performance that underscored public concerns about his age.\nAbout that debate: “I had a bad, bad night,” Biden maintained. But “we were not going to let 90 minutes of a debate define his presidency and all those years of service,” his wife added.\nOf course, that’s precisely what happened. For his decades in public life, for his initial triumph over Trump in 2020, and for the successes at the beginning of his term, his legacy will be defined by a hubris that paved the way for Trump’s even more destructive return.\nThat hubris was on full display Thursday, as he was asked by co-host Joy Behar why Trump so frequently invoked Biden’s name: “[Because] I beat him,” Biden quipped, doing his best Clint Eastwood. “I’m used to dealing with bullies.”\nBiden's interview was reminiscent of the “watch me” defiance he showed during the second half of his presidency and the end of his campaign, as he downplayed his own negative polls and public perceptions about his capacity to serve. That was tone-deaf at the time. But it's even more so now, with Trump exerting his expansive vision of executive power from the White House and more robust reporting on the extent of Biden's senescence. “There’s nothing to sustain that,” he said of his reported decline.\n“If you look at things today,” the former first lady added, “give me Joe Biden any time.”\nThe former president’s View appearance Thursday was the second stop of his burgeoning “Miss Me Yet?” tour, following a BBC interview in which he rehashed a familiar criticism of Trump from his campaign: “That’s not who we are,” he said. It was orchestrated, Politico reported, by a former member of his press office, Chris Meagher, whom he is said to have hired to burnish his reputation, amid criticism over the difficult position he put Kamala Harris and the party in last cycle. “If Biden goes and does the interviews, we see a rested and relaxed and thoughtful Biden, that could play very well,” Democratic consultant Caitlin Legacki told the outlet.\nAnd Biden did seem relaxed, even getting off a couple zingers at his successor’s expense, as when Behar noted that Trump had claimed the pardons he issued at the end of his presidency were “vacant”: “Oh, he’s vacant,” Biden said.\nBut so, too, is this legacy project of his: Biden is not running for office. He’s not likely to be a particularly effective surrogate for future Democratic campaigns. The only person to benefit from this image-rehabilitation effort is, of course, Biden. And, after a bruising campaign that hinged in many ways on his own pridefulness, perhaps it is time to move on: “There are a lot of young and dynamic leaders in the Democratic Party who are focused on the path forward,” as one Democratic operative told Politico. “It’s better we focus on them, instead of an old man trying to convince himself and America he isn’t responsible for Donald Trump’s reelection.”","summary":"“I beat him,” the former president said of Trump on The View, part of a media blitz aimed at repairing his legacy.

Griffin specifically asked Biden whether the sources for books that allege “there was a dramatic decline” in his mental acuity during the last year of his term “are wrong.” (RELATED: Kamala Campaign’s Latest Reported Scapegoat For Failure: Her Chair Height)\n\n“They are wrong. There’s nothing to sustain that. Number one. Number two, you know, think of what we were left with. We were left with a circumstance where we had an insurrection when I started — not since the Civil War. We had a circumstance where we were in a position that we — well, the pandemic, because of the incompetence of the last outfit and up over a million people dying, a million people dying,” Biden said. “And we were also in a situation where we found ourselves unable to deal with a lot of just basic issues, and which I won’t go into in the interest of time. And so we went to work and we got it done and, you know, one of the things that — well … I’m talking too long.”\n\nAfter Biden trailed off, his wife took over to counter the allegations.\n\n“Alyssa, you know, one of the things I think is that the people who wrote those books were not in the White House with us. And they didn’t see how hard Joe worked every single day,” the former first lady said. “I mean, he’d get up. He’d put in a full day, and then at night he would — I’d be in bed, you know, reading my book and he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff. I mean, it was nonstop.”\n\n“The White House — being president is not like a job. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a life that you live. You live it 24 hours a day,” she continued. “That phone can ring at 11:00 at night or 2:00 in the morning. It’s constant. You never leave it. And Joe worked really hard. I think he was a great president and if you look at things today, give me Joe Biden any time.”\n\nAfter Biden withdrew from the presidential race on July 21, 2024, he held few public events, having none scheduled in 43 of the first 75 days following his exit, according to an Axios analysis. White House aides and close Biden allies told the outlet that they thought the president had been aging faster due to the stress of his position and his son’s legal battles. \n\nGriffin followed up by asking about prominent Democrats’ worries about his mental acuity.\n\n“I understand the concern. I really do. But the point of the matter is that I would offer specific evidence if we had time, exactly what I got done when I was supposedly lost my cognitive capability and, secondly, what we did after we got out of the race,” Biden said. “I said when I got out of the race, I was still going to be president. I think I did a pretty damn good job in the last six months.”\n\nBiden endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris after he dropped out. President Donald Trump decisively defeated Harris in November, securing all seven swing states and the popular vote.\n\nThe former president also explained on “The View” Thursday that he “wasn’t surprised” by the election result in part because of sexism.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

However, Jill would likely be required to reveal details surrounding her husband’s declining mental health, as well as his disastrous debate against President Donald Trump and his decision to leave the 2024 race — which could be a “holdup,” according to the report.\n\nThe report notes that while Jill is Biden’s “biggest defender” and a book of her own would better allow her to shape her family’s narrative, she would likely “be grilled about reports she covered up his decline,” and “any publisher would want all the behind-the-scenes details, particularly for a seven-figure deal.” \n\nAnother way the Bidens could snag a book deal is by Jill going “scorched earth on those high-profile Democrats who turned their backs on Biden,” the report continues. The list of people who privately and publicly told Biden to step aside includes Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and George Clooney. Jill Biden also allegedly has a grudge against former Vice President and failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris. \n\n“She’s his grudge-holder for sure, and there are definitely plenty of people she will never talk to again, but it’s unlike her to take public swings at specific individuals or lay blame.

The report comes to a surprising determination, given recent history.\n\nVirginia and New Jersey hold their state elections the year after the U.S. presidency is contested, and with only two big races in the entire nation at that time and both seen as barometers for public opinion on how the president is doing, media attention is often substantial.\n\nIn many cases, these “off-year” elections have seen the party that lost the presidency put extra effort into “sending a message” to the public at large that the presidential victory is not some mandate for his party’s agenda over theirs and to their voter base that the party has not been dispatched into irrelevance.\n\nFor example, in 2021, the year after Joe Biden became president, not only did Republican Glenn Youngkin win the governor’s mansion in Virginia, the GOP was within three points of upsetting incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy in New Jersey, a decidedly blue state.\n\nThe first “Sabato’s Crystal Ball” report of the 2025 campaign season has been issued, and it shows that both states, which were carried by Kamala Harris by 6 points in 2024, are “leaning Democrat.”\n\nSix points is certainly outside of the margin of error but not by enough to classify either state as “likely Democrat” yet. (The Crystal Ball is named after the Center for Politics’ founder, University of Virginia Professor Larry Sabato, in honor of his record of success in predicting elections, aside from the 2016 and 2024 presidential races)\n\nThe center’s J. Miles Coleman wrote in his analysis: “In the smattering of elections held so far in 2025, Democrats have generally been performing similarly to how they performed in 2017, which augured well for them in the following year’s midterm. New Jersey and Virginia represent Democrats’ next big tests: They really should win both races.”\n\nThe report points out that New Jersey is still in the midst of a multicandidate primary for the Democratic Party’s gubernatorial nomination and that the center’s prediction is that U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill will win and face former state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli, the likely GOP nominee.\n\nIn Virginia, with both gubernatorial positions wrapped up by former Rep. Abigail Spanberger for the Democrats and current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears as the GOP standard-bearer, the center reports that the campaigns are already in “general election mode” and, therefore, the commonwealth has a “firmer” lean to Democrat than the Garden State.\n\nThe web publication Political Pulse has aggregated all Virginia polling through April 30 and reports that Spanberger has 42% to Sears’ 37% average. That leaves 21% undecided before Virginia’s early voting begins Sept. 19.\n\nThe wild card in these contests is the pace at which the president has been governing—with so much going on in Washington, that has not allowed for the traditional glut of national political news reporters to devote a lot of airtime or column space to these races. That is a factor that may weigh heavily in Virginia.\n\nAdditionally, with the most recent real estate report showing that residential vacancies in heavily Democrat-populated Northern Virginia are up 26%, that could make the gap between Spanberger and Sears easier to close with the vast “red” counties in the rest of the state that have lower populations.\n\nWhile the recent controversies involving the down-ticket race for Virginia’s lieutenant governor have brought a little more raw attention to the Virginia races, especially to the Republicans, the GOP candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general will need a coming together as a ticket and a show of unity to get the kind of turnout they will need to win in November.\n\nThough Donald Trump lost Virginia in 2024, 2 million Virginians voted for him. By comparison, 1.66 million voted for Youngkin when he won the governor’s race in 2021. The Republican ticket will need almost all of those Trump voters to do what so many do not do: Come out and vote in the off-year elections come November.","summary":"The Center for Politics at the University of Virginia has published a report looking at where the only two gubernatorial races in the nation stand...

He wasn’t hiding somewhere, I didn’t have him, you know, sequestered in some place.” \n\nThe January report argues the exact opposite, and was bolstered by the Speaker’s daughter blasting of the former first lady. “If I was Lady McBiden, I’d put on my big girl pants, play the long game, and think about my husband’s legacy,” Pelosi told Politico. “There aren’t that many people left in America who have something nice to say about Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi is one of them.” \n\nThough Alexandra Pelosi told the site she was speaking only for herself, the comments strained an already weakened relationship between the Bidens and Pelosis, stemming from the Speaker’s ousting the president to make way for Kamala Harris to run.\n\nThe View co-host Sara Haines asked Dr. Biden Thursday if she thinks she was “too close to the situation to objectively gauge whether he could handle a full four more years.”\n\nBiden was adamant that was not the case. “I was with Joe day and night,” she said. “I saw him more than any other person. I woke up with him, I went to bed at night with him, so I saw him all throughout the day,” she continued, so she was confident in his mental ability to do the job.

Biden, who left office in January, addressed the Democrats' disastrous 2024 election, concerns about his age and Trump's divisive leadership during a Thursday interview on ABC's “The View.\" Also Read | Donald Trump Announces US-UK Trade Deal, Says Agreement Increases Access for American Agricultural Products. The 82-year-old Democrat said he has intentionally avoided speaking out publicly until this week to give Trump more than 100 days in office without his interference, as is typically the tradition following a change in the White House. Asked about the last election, Biden said he was surprised by the role that he gender and race played in the contest.

He's not expected to play a central role in Democratic affairs as the party turns to a new generation of leadership, although he acknowledged on Thursday that he has maintained regular contact with Harris and has offered his guidance on her political future. “She's got a difficult decision to make about what she's going to do. I hope she stays engaged,” Biden said, declining to share his specific advice. Biden rejected concerns about his cognitive decline prompted by a disastrous debate performance last June. He also declined to criticise the Democratic leaders who privately pressed him to abandon his campaign. “The only reason I got out of the race was because I didn't want to have a divided Democratic Party,\" he said, adding that the broader party didn't buy into concerns about his age following the “terrible” debate performance, “but the Democratic leadership and some of the very significant contributors did.” Thursday's appearance also marked Biden's first joint interview with former first lady Jill Biden since leaving Washington. She rejected those who believe she created a protective cocoon around her husband while in office to protect him from scrutiny about his age. “It was very hurtful especially from some of our so-called friends,\" she said of the criticism. “I was with Joe day and night … and I did not create a cocoon around him,\" she continued. “You saw him in the Oval Office. You saw him making speeches. He wasn't hiding somewhere.” Meanwhile, the former president did not hold back when the conversation turned to Trump's job performance. “He's had the worst 100 days any president has ever had,\" Biden said.

Naturally, for MSNBC, she highlighted his “rebuking” of conservatives and Republicans, but not of liberals and Democrats.\n\nTur asked former Time managing editor and Obama Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Richard Stengel, “Do you foresee this having some legs in the American political landscape?”\n\nStengel was hopeful that it would, “Yeah. You summarized it well. I mean, it may indeed be a rebuke of some of those conservative ideas. I don't know that the cardinals are thinking about American politics as much as we are, but he's a different kind of American.”\n\nHe contrasted Leo with Trump, “He's a different kind of American. He represents values that are different than the values on the world stage of the MAGA Trump administration. Concern for the poor, concern for immigrants, all of the things that Francis talked about. I think it's a boon to the idea that Americans don't have to be this kind of autocratic model that we're seeing with the Trump Administration.”\n\nLeo also claimed that Kamala Harris’s support for abortion meant the 2024 election was about the need to “choose the lesser evil.” He has also claimed that protecting society’s most vulnerable means “ensuring their dignity is upheld from the womb to the end of life” and “Bishops are called to be shepherds who defend the sanctity of life, ensuring no one — neither the unborn nor the aging — is left without the Church’s love and protection.”\n\nTur, however, wanted to stay with immigration, “He’s lived an integrated life. I mean, he's lived in many other places. He speaks multiple languages. He's an American who has not isolated himself in American—in America. He's not a nationalist. In fact, when he was rebuking JD Vance, he was rebuking the idea that Vance put forward, which is that in the Christian faith, you love yourself first, your family next, your community after that, and then everybody else. And the rebuke from Pope Leo XIV before he became pope was no, Jesus did not say that. There is an order to your love. This is a man who has been global as America in this moment is becoming much more insular.”\n\nA few minutes later, Tur raised the subject of sexuality with the former head of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the U.S., Father Timothy Kesicki, “Yeah, I'm curious about, you know, Pope Francis was open to gay marriage, and there are a lot of gay and lesbian Catholics who felt like this was a real step in the right direction for them, renewed their faith in the Church, felt like they were a part of it, and there was worry, a lot of consternation about who might be chosen next and whether it would be somebody much more conservative who would take that away from them.”\n\nFact-check: Francis was not open to gay marriage. Nevertheless, Tur rolled on, “Where do you see Pope Leo XIV falling on this? I know he chose the name, it’s social justice, but do you expect that he's going to follow in the footsteps of Francis when it comes to LGBTQ issues?”\n\nKesicki tried to be delicate, “Well, we have not seen anything formally written by formerly Cardinal Prevost about this issue… So, I think what you're going to see is someone who is a deep listener, who is going to step into this new role, listening to the many pastoral concerns of the church. And he's going to kind of hold in balance the fundamental teachings of the Church with the pastoral needs of those in front of him.”\n\nWe may not have any formal writings, but we know that he believes that a “homosexual lifestyle” and “alternative families comprised of same-sex partners and their adopted children” are “at odds with the Gospel.”\n\nIt is also a matter of public record that Leo is opposed to “the promotion of gender ideology” because it “is confusing” and “seeks to create genders that don’t exist.”\n\nOver the next several days, as Leo’s papacy is still a new story, expect the media to focus on his historical comments about Vance and how Leo is “a different kind of American.” However, that does not mean that they will hype the fact that he is also different from their liberal culture warrior selves.\n\nHere is a transcript for the May 8 show:\n\nMSNBC Katy Tur Reports\n\nKATY TUR: Do you foresee this having some legs in the American political landscape?\n\nRICHARD STENGEL: Yeah.

Joe Nye was the great Harvard political philosopher who came up with the idea of soft power. Soft power as opposed to hard military power, the power of culture, the power of influence.

But first of all, I think we know that he understands the issue from his experience in the United States, as well as his decades in South America. He would have paid attention to every step Pope Francis took to love every member of the church. So, I think what you're going to see is someone who is a deep listener, who is going to step into this new role, listening to the many pastoral concerns of the church. And he's going to kind of hold in balance the fundamental teachings of the Church with the pastoral needs of those in front of him.","summary":"After Cardinal Robert Prevost became the first American ever to be elected Pope on Tuesday and took the name Leo XIV, MSNBC’s Katy Tur picked and chose what aspects of his beliefs to amplify and which ones to downplay or ignore.

Lady Gaga, on the other hand, sang at Joe Biden’s 2021 inauguration and campaigned for Kamala Harris, vowing that the vice president, not Trump, was the candidate who would ensure American freedom, opportunity and promise.\n\nBut a report by the Daily Mail claims that Lady Gaga would be willing to join another mega-star, Elton John, in entertaining the other rich and famous guests at the couple’s three-day wedding extravaganza, which is expected to take place in Venice June 24 to June 26.\n\nSanchez, who was widely maligned recently for her “Marie Antoinette”-like display of privilege, hubris and cleavage during her recent Blue Origin space ride, only wants the biggest musical stars to perform for her guests, a Daily Mail source said. According to the report, those guests are expected to include Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey and Katy Perry, her sister Blue Origin “astronaut.”\n\n“Lauren wanted some big talent to sing for them and it just doesn’t get any bigger than Gaga and Elton,” the source said. “It also helps that Gaga and Elton are good friends and were happy to do it together, which is cool. It will be like a mini vacation for the besties.”\n\nThe Daily Mail source also insisted that the timing works for Lady Gaga, as she’s not set to start her Mayhem Ball Tour until July 16.\n\nBut representatives for Lady Gaga and Elton said they wouldn’t be singing at the wedding, while a Lady Gaga source “emphatically denied” the Daily Mail report to Page Six. “We’re also told that the overseas wedding is not even on Gaga’s calendar,” Page Six said.\n\nPage Six offered a reason to doubt the Daily Mail’s report on Lady Gaga singing at the wedding, saying that the U.K. tabloid has since backed down on its claims that the wedding will take place on Bezo’s $500 million mega-yacht, as its anchored in the waters of the Adriatic Sea off Venice.\n\nCNN actually cited a spokesperson for the mayor who said the wedding would take place on the yacht. But a Daily Mail source has said that is “not true.”\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if certain celebrities will be willing to be seen at the wedding of the Amazon founder and his socialite fiancée, a former Los Angeles-based entertainment reporter who also flies helicopters. Some 200 people are expected to attend the wedding, the mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, confirmed in a statement, the Daily Mail said. Other A-listers on the guest list supposedly include Leonardo DiCaprio and Barbra Streisand, though they, like Lady Gaga, like to be known as political progressives.\n\nAnother celebrity Harris supporter who is still likely to be at the wedding is actor and activist Eva Longoria, who is known to be good friends with Sanchez. In 2024, she also accepted a $50 million “Courage and Civility” prize from Sanchez and Bezos, to be used for any cause she chooses. In return, Longoria praised the power couple for their “courage and civility.”","summary":"A Daily Mail report this week claimed that Lady Gaga had agreed to join Elton John in performing for the power couple's rich and famous guests at their lavish June wedding in Venice.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/08/lady-gaga-emphatically-denies-singing-at-bezos-and-sanchezs-wedding/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP25066059104353.jpg?w=1024&h=755","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 17:02:37","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.085},{"id":319255058,"title":"Joe and Jill Biden went on ‘The View’ to let us know they still don’t quite get it","text":"For anyone who wants to criticize Joe Biden for how he did during the presidency, his wife Jill wants you to know that the presidency is a tough job. People who thought he wasn’t up to scratch “didn’t see how hard Joe worked every day,” she told The View during their joint interview Thursday morning, as she and her husband launched their reputational comeback tour. Listen, I don’t think you understand: Jill was in bed at night and Joe was still on the phone! It was nonstop! “That phone could ring at 11 o’clock or at 2 a.m”, because being the president is “a lifestyle”.\n\nLuckily, America is full of people who can’t countenance taking a phone call that late for their job, otherwise that might’ve been received unsympathetically. Of course, while Joe was working 24/7, he was making a $400,000 salary, with a further untaxed expenses allowance of $169,000 for travel and entertainment on top of that. But you wouldn’t accept less than that to take phone calls at bedtime, right? Right?!\n\nThat moment underscored what we already suspected about the Bidens — that, likeable and inoffensive as they are, they’re out-of-touch. Thursday was Joe Biden’s first live interview since losing the 2024 election, and his first turn at the View table since last September — a reunion greeted with Whoopi Goldberg's firm \"we're not gonna fool around.” The TV show and the former president are a natural match: both have been on air far longer than their critics think they should, both remain strangely comforting to large swathes of Americans, and both occasionally let something deeply weird slip out before anyone can stop them.\n\nThe president-emeritus was hoarse and slightly breathless in the first 20 minutes of his appearance. He referenced his time as VP — “I was the vice president, I was with Barack…” — before the sentence wandered off into the political equivalent of a cul-de-sac. The co-hosts leaned in like sympathetic aunts, hoping he’d find the thread again.\n\nStill, he eventually got in a few decent zingers, calling Trump’s return “the worst 100 days any president’s ever had,” before adding, “I wouldn’t say honesty’s been a strong point.” \n\nAfter the first ad break, Biden had settled into his familiar groove: avuncular, mildly baffled, and occasionally interrupted by flashes of clarity that reminded everyone why he got elected in the first place. Asked about Trump’s first 100 days, he genuflected, prompting Anna Navarro to suggest he’d make a good pope (perhaps a more age-appropriate election race for him, considering the Vatican’s median age.) Earnest, folksy, and sprinkled with the kind of self-deprecating humor that makes you forget he once called a voter a \"lying, dog-faced pony soldier,” he managed to shoehorn in an aside about foreign policy, NATO and Putin, even as he acknowledged that The View doesn’t do that kind of thing.\n\nJoy Behar suggested that Trump’s fixation on Biden is “shrink territory.” Why is he obsessed with you, she wondered? Without missing a beat, Biden delivered his cleanest jab of the morning: “I beat him.” The table roared and the crowd applauded. It was a rare moment where the old campaign snap resurfaced, even if only briefly. \n\nDid he take responsibility for Trump’s return? “Yes,” Biden said plainly, a confession that somehow felt both refreshingly adult and politically useless. Then he went off-script to defend his infrastructure agenda — Amtrak, bridges, drug prices — noting, not inaccurately, that “we weren’t quite as good about advertising it” as his rival. This may be the understatement of the century from a president who passed a trillion-dollar bill and still let Trump define him as a man who spends most of his time napping. \n\nOn Kamala Harris, he was firm: they speak frequently, and no, he didn’t ask her to stay uncomfortably close to his policies when she picked up his campaign; in fact, they “argued like hell”. And then, as Joy invoked Trump’s claim that Biden’s autopen makes all laws “void and vacant,” Biden quipped, “Well, he’s vacant.” A charitable laugh came from everyone, even though it’s essentially a playground retort.\n\nWe were two ad breaks in before the former First Lady made her appearance. And that’s when Whoopi Goldberg brought up the debate. The car crash. The catastrophic “oh no, Grandpa wandered onstage again” moment. \n\n“Everybody lost their minds,” Goldberg said, as she described the aftermath of the disastrous back-and-forth that led to Biden stepping aside for Kamala Harris. Joe conceded he’d been sick, not as an excuse, just as… well, yes, an excuse.\n\nJill jumped in: “We all saw it, it was terrible.” A rare moment of spousal candor. “Yes, you screwed up,” she says she told him onstage in the immediate aftermath. But she counseled him to put his shoulders back and turn up for his supporters. And by the way, she didn’t “sequester him” in the days before the debate like some geriatric hostage, either. “I wish she had,” Joe joked. He’s not the only one.\n\nThere was a little bitterness there. Jill added that it was “hurtful” when people suggested she’d been Lady Macbething things for Joe — especially when such accusations came from “so-called friends”. Asked earlier in the interview about his friendship with Obama and whether it’s been damaged by the whole debacle, Joe either sidestepped the question or forgot it. And, of course, Jill underlined for us all how the presidency is actually hard.\n\nThere were vintage Joe Biden moments — “I shouldn’t say this” and “I’ve been advised not to say this” followed by milquetoast stuff about how great his infrastructure achievements were — as well as a clearly rehearsed aside about how the average billionaire in America pays just 8.2% tax, which went down well. Then there was the old “‘We’re still the greatest country in the history of the world.” At least someone still believes it.\n\nAs the program drew to a close, Jill got to talk for a bit about her new job in women’s healthcare advocacy, and Joe got to reveal that he’s writing another book (they’ve only given him a year to do it!) The broader aim here was clearly a little image rehab so that both of those extracurriculars go well for them. A reminder that Joe Biden is still alive, still speaking in complete sentences, and capable of turning up for a hopefully lucrative post-presidential speaking tour. \n\nThe View, with its gently liberal studio audience and rotating panel of supportive head nods, is a safe zone in which to spread that message — a warm bubble in which even a misstep is met with an encouraging “Aww!” and a break for ad time. However, if this was meant to be the soft launch of the post-presidency messaging tour, it’s clear the product still needs some polishing.","summary":"The former president and first lady are perfectly likeable people.

So, you know, I take responsibility,\" Biden said during a joint appearance with former First Lady Jill Biden on ABC's The View.Why It MattersBiden's comments signal a shift in tone as Democrats reckon with Trump's historic comeback. Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election after Biden bowed out late in the campaign, making him the first president since Grover Cleveland to win non-consecutive terms.What To KnowThe interview, broadcast live, was the couple's first joint media appearance since departing Washington in January. It marks a reentry into the public sphere for Biden, who has kept a relatively low profile following his decision not to seek reelection after a faltering debate performance in mid-2024.Asked by co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin what he made of Trump's victory, Biden said he was \"disappointed\" but \"not surprised\" that Trump beat Harris.Biden maintained he would have beaten Trump in the election, but said he accepted some blame for Trump's victory because of voter concerns about border security and the cost of living during his tenure.While reflecting on the last election, Biden reaffirmed his belief that he could have defeated Trump again. \"He still got sven million fewer votes,\" he said. \"A lot of people didn't show up.\"Trump, meanwhile, has continued to attack Biden publicly. At a recent cabinet meeting, he mentioned Biden by name 52 times, a fixation Biden dismissed. \"I beat him,\" he said. \"I'm used to dealing with bullies.\"Biden also blasted Trump's early performance in his second term. \"He's had the worst 100 days any president's ever had,\" the former president said. He criticized Trump's posture on foreign policy, particularly concerning NATO and key international alliances.Regrets, He Has a FewThe Democrats faced intense scrutiny over the past year, culminating in Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race and Harris failed presidential campaign. Critics questioned his cognitive ability, especially following his debate with Trump on CNN. On The View, Biden acknowledged, \"I had a terrible night,\" but defended his broader record in office.He pointed to the sexist and racial undertones in the attacks against Harris: \"I have never seen as successful and quite as consistent a campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country, and a woman of mixed race.\"In addition to addressing the election and public concerns, Biden reflected on the broader political climate. He noted that liberal democracies around the world had seen setbacks and argued that leaders underestimated the lingering psychological and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on voters' attitudes.\"I think we underestimated the phenomenal impact that COVID and the pandemic had,\" Biden said.Jill Biden also pushed back on accusations she had isolated her husband from the public. \"It was very hurtful especially from some of our so-called friends,\" she said. \"I did not create a cocoon around him. I mean, you saw him in the Oval Office. You saw him making speeches. He wasn't hiding somewhere.\"What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump told reporters during a meeting in the Oval Office on April 17: \"Jimmy Carter died a happy man. You know why? Because he wasn't the worst president—Joe Biden was.\"Former First Lady Jill Biden on The View: \"Joe worked really hard. I think he was a great president. If you look at things today, give me Joe Biden anytime.\"What Happens NextWhile Biden asserted that he would have beaten Trump had he remained in the race, public opinion at the time of his departure tells a more complicated story. According to a CNN poll conducted in January 2025, Biden's approval rating stood at just 38 percent as he left office, with 58 percent disapproving of his job performance—a figure near his presidency's lowest marks.Another Gallup survey found that 54 percent of Americans believed Biden would be remembered as a below-average or poor president, while only 19 percent expected him to be rated positively by history.Biden, meanwhile, has hired a veteran Democratic communications specialist, suggesting he may be planning more media appearances.","summary":"The former president maintained he would have beaten Trump in the election, but said he accepted some blame for Trump's victory.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-takes-responsibility-donald-trumps-win-first-time-2069774","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2641205/jill-biden-joe-biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 16:55:26","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.082},{"id":319251528,"title":"‘The View’: Joe Biden “Wasn’t Surprised” That Kamala Harris Lost To Trump, Says He Would’ve Won If He Stayed In The Race","text":"Former President Joe Biden stopped by this morning’s episode of The View to talk about his party’s failed campaign just over 100 days into President Donald Trump‘s return to the White House.\n\nLast July, Biden announced that he would be withdrawing himself from the 2024 presidential election, leaving then-Vice President Kamala Harris just over three months to campaign for the Democratic Party. While Democrats were feeling optimistic about her chances of being Trump, she ended up losing the electoral vote, the popular vote, and every key swing state when the results were counted in November 2024. \n\n“I wasn’t surprised — not because I didn’t think the Vice President was the most qualified person to be president,” Biden said on this morning’s episode of The View. “She is. She’s qualified to be the President of the United States of America.”\n\n“But I wasn’t surprised because they went the sexist route the whole route,” he continued, referring to Trump’s campaign. “This is a woman, she’s this, she’s that. Really, I’ve never seen quite as successful and consistent a campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country — and a woman of mixed race.”\n\nWhen Harris lost the race, Democrats wondered what they could’ve done differently. Should Biden have stepped aside sooner to allow more time for her to campaign? Or would their party have won if he had stood firm in his place and continued to run for a second term? \n\nLooking back, Biden believes he would’ve beaten Trump had he stayed in the race since the current POTUS “still got 7 million fewer votes” than he did when they ran against each other in 2020.\n\n“A lot of people didn’t show up, number one,” Biden said. “Number two, they were very close in those toss-up states.

Instead, they see this as a proxy battle in the culture war.\n\nFirst, let’s distinguish the facts from the claims circulating the internet. Sharmake Beyle Omar, a Somali man, confronted Hendrix on camera at a park. He repeatedly asked whether she called a black child (who is not his son) a “n*****,” and she responded that “it’s none of your f***ing business.” Omar then questioned, “Why don’t you have the balls to say it right now again?” She flipped up her middle finger, declared, “F*** you, n*****,” and continued repeating the slur. Hendrix claimed that the boy was rummaging through her things, and she affirmed that she had called the child the slur. (She has since written that the child was stealing from her diaper bag, and states that “I called the kid out for what he was.”) As the profane altercation continues, Omar tells her, “That’s hate speech, and you can be recorded for that,” then asserts, “We’ll see about that, what the internet has to say about you” as she walks away with her toddler.\n\nOmar shared the video with the world, and predictably, people had lots to say — but some of their commentary was expressed through dollars and usernames.\n\nAs is usually the case with viral controversies, people started digging up dirt. It’s clear that, prior to the park incident, neither Hendrix nor Omar was a model citizen. A 2012 case between the State of Minnesota and Hendrix ended in conviction for a “disorderly conduct” petty misdemeanor. (That physical case file was destroyed, and no documents are available.) Hendrix was convicted in 2014 for the misdemeanor of “third-degree driving while impaired.” In 2015, there was an eviction case between “Bald Eagle Holdings” and Hendrix. Omar, too, has a record. Since 2012, Omar has been convicted for the petty misdemeanor of “skateboarding in business area,” the misdemeanor of driving after a license suspension, and another petty misdemeanor. In 2021, when he was working for FedEx and earning nearly $7,000 a month, his former wife filed against him for child support. (They were married in 2012, and they had three kids together before separating in 2018.) In 2022, Omar was charged with the sexual offenses of “nonconsensual sexual contact” and “penetration” of a minor involving “coercion,” but those were all dismissed on March 14, 2025, “in the interest of justice.”\n\nBut most people didn’t bother rummaging through court documents. Instead, they arrived at judgments based on the brief footage alone, then picked a side. The following comments about Hendrix were posted on Bluesky: “Normalize sending death threats to Shiloh Hendrix,” “Make her famous (and unemployable),” “Shiloh Hendrix, you made your bed. Now die in it,” and “I take comfort in knowing that wherever Shiloh Hendrix goes, she will never find peace.” (Statements of this nature are seemingly endless.) The verbal outrage against Hendrix was complemented by material support for the black child. A NAACP branch launched a fundraiser titled “Help Us Seek Justice for a 5-Year-Old Facing Racial Hate,” which raised just under $350,000 before it closed in response to the “family’s wishes.” (At present, the boy remains anonymous, and there is no publicly available proof of his age or purported autism diagnosis.) Similarly, the fundraiser titled “Stand Against Shiloh Hendrix and Racism: Support the NAACP” has about $4,000 in donations. The fundraiser “Prosecute Shiloh Hendrix” asks for donations to support a legal team that will prosecute her “for assault with an escalation to a hate crime.” (Apparently, some people didn’t read the full description, since a person who gave $40 commented, “While I don’t agree with the villain role she takes, her life does not deserve to be ruined because of this, death to the antiwhite narrative.”)\n\nIn response to the onslaught of threats, Hendrix started an online fundraiser to “protect [her] family,” claiming that “My SSN has been leaked. My address, and phone number have been given out freely. My family members are being attacked. My eldest child may not be going back to school. Even where I exercise has been exposed.” Since it launched, she’s raised over $750,000. (Whether she ever sees that money is a different matter. The black activist Kiandria Demone declared, “I didn’t just want to cyberbully, I wanted to take action,” and is targeting the fundraising platform’s payment processor with the hopes that Hendrix doesn’t get a penny.)\n\nBut the usernames of the contributors (before the host website prevented comments and anonymized all donations) were more revealing than the actual amounts given on the pro-Hendrix fundraiser. The user named “kill all jews Andblacks” gave Hendrix $5, the user “Nate Higgers” gave $10, and “WhiteLoveWorldwide” gave $15. Other messages expressed in the usernames included “DontUseSlursButDontDOXCancelPeople,” “Tired of One-sided BS,” “EveryoneIsTribal NowWeAreToo,” and “God Bless Shilo and Family.” Additional contributions are given under the names “Karmelo Anthony,” “Kamala Harris,” and “Al Sharpton,” obviously as subversive pseudonyms.\n\nWhat should we make of all this? I maintain that 1) an individual should avoid saying slurs and expletives, 2) slurs and expletives transgress social standards but, even when said with extreme hostility, do not violate the law, 3) there is a sociolinguistic double standard where the use of a slur is considered acceptable if and only if the speaker is a member of the human group degraded by that slur, 4) the use of a word — any word — shouldn’t ruin your life, and 5) filming someone, even a really bad guy, and uploading the video online to facilitate an intimidation campaign makes you an agent of the Thought Police. Based on these principles, it is easy to guess how I evaluate this incident. I think that Hendrix is a bad person for using a slur, and especially for directing it toward a child — whether he’s five or eleven, whether he’s autistic or not, whether he stole from her or not. I also think that Omar is a bad person because he assembled an internet army to destroy her life — and that’s more aggressive than screaming a slur.\n\nNational Review’s Haley Strack argued that “Shiloh Hendrix is not a victim,” and I firmly disagree. Shiloh is, of course, responsible for her language. But the punishment doesn’t match the crime. She and her family members — who aren’t responsible for her speech — now face threats because of it. Just as Shiloh’s language was disproportionately harsh toward the child who supposedly stole from her bag, the unrelenting harassment toward her family is disproportionate to the use of the slur. You can make the argument that a slur inflicts harm, but if that’s your position, then surely you have to concede that death threats are comparatively worse.\n\nBut here’s the thing that actually matters: The Hendrix fundraiser is a proxy war that cannot be evaluated independently of recent events, and the donors are sending a range of messages. Some are racist, and they believe they are mirroring the tribalism exhibited by other demographics. Others are trying to counter-signal the recent support for Karmelo Anthony, a black teenager who accumulated over $500,000 in donations as he was charged with fatally stabbing the white teenager Austin Metcalf. Before the comments and usernames were disabled, messages on the Anthony fundraiser included “death to the white man,” “God bless this young man, he had to defend himself from a bunch of rednecks,” and “these crackas need to understand that we are NOT our ancestors, and they will reap what they sow.” Some of Hendrix’s donors are frustrated with the sociolinguistic disparities, and they note there’s a word with Voldemort-like status that warrants either social death or no judgment, depending on the speaker’s racial identity. Moreover, there isn’t a word or phrase that racial minorities can spew toward white people that results in similar consequences. In fact, condemning white people was rewarded just years ago, and authors of “antiracist” manuals to abolish “whiteness” made gazillions of dollars. Perhaps most significantly, the contributors believe they are disincentivizing further cancellation campaigns. The stance is clear: If you summon an internet army to ruin someone’s life, even someone who has done something objectively bad, we’re going to provide significant support, so don’t bother doing it again.","summary":"The online controversy is a proxy fight in the culture war.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/05/battle-of-the-shiloh-hendrix-fundraisers/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-side-by-side5.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 16:36:48","author":"Abigail Anthony","authors":["Abigail Anthony"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":319253724,"title":"Joe Biden tells “The View ”he 'wasn't surprised' Kamala Harris lost presidential election to Donald Trump","text":"Former President Joe Biden has opened up on The View about his thoughts on Vice President Kamala Harris — whom he bowed out of the 2024 election cycle to endorse — losing the presidential race against Donald Trump.\n\n After a warm Thursday morning introduction from moderator Whoopi Goldberg ahead of Biden's live interview with all six View cohosts, the panelists inquired about a long list of developments that unfolded across the last year — including Harris' devastating loss to Trump.\n\n \"Last time you were here was a little over a month before the election, and you had made the selfless and very difficult decision, I'm sure, to step aside,\" Sara Haines said. \"Democrats were feeling optimistic about the Vice President's chances of winning the presidency. But then election night came, and it was like 2016 all over again. So, why do you think the Vice President lost, and were you surprised?\"\n\n The 82-year-old collected his thoughts before admitting that he \"wasn't surprised\" by Harris' loss to Trump.\n\n \"Not because I didn't think the Vice President was qualified to be President,\" he clarified. \"She is, she's qualified to be President of the United States of America. I was surprised because they went the sexist route, the whole route.

She was every single part of that,\" explained Biden, before Hostin brought up a pivotal moment in Harris' campaign that saw her say on The View that there was \"not a thing that comes to mind\" in terms of what she'd do differently from Biden's presidency — a moment that was widely used in Republican attack ads against Harris.\n\n \"First of all, I did not advise her to say that, No. 1. I was Vice President, I understand the role. No. 2, I think she was talking about, she wouldn't have changed the successes we've had, as opposed to wouldn't change anything at all,\" Biden observed. \"That was used in a way that is contrary to what she meant by it when she said that. She was part of every success we had. We argued like hell, by the way. That's good.... we worked it out, it was a mutual thing.\"\n\n Elsewhere, Biden also told the cohosts that he's doing well, but weighing options for how he can be of service to American people after his presidency, amid writing \"another book,\" he confirmed.\n\n Hours before Biden's appearance on The View, Griffin made headlines for slamming his post-office approach to public life, calling him a \"messenger no Democrat wants to see out there right now\" during a discussion on CNN.\n\n \"People are ready to move on, with due respect to the former president. And most former presidents give their legacy some time to breathe,\" Griffin said Wednesday on the network. \"I think of Jimmy Carter. When he lost, he didn't go out there and do a lot of interviews. He gave his legacy some time. A decade later, he was one of the most beloved former presidents.

It was cast as a hellscape overrun by crime, fentanyl, and homelessness—a “cesspool,” as David Sacks described it during the Republican National Convention, of “open encampments and open drug use.” Never mind that Kamala Harris’s campaign for presidential office was broadly moderate—her association with the Golden City, where she served as district attorney more than a decade earlier, led Donald Trump to condemn her as a “San Francisco radical.” Following Harris’s defeat, the prerogative for Democrats to reconsider how they were governing at a state and city level was urgent: “The first step for Democrats,” wrote the Washington Post’s editorial board in a November op-ed, is to “fix blue states.”\nThis is a mandate that San Francisco’s new mayor, Daniel Lurie, who is front and center of many of the new changes within the city, has seemingly taken to heart.\nLurie, 48, is trim and mild-mannered, with a no-nonsense approach to governing that is already shaking up the city’s entrenched bureaucracy. On the campaign trail, the moderate Democrat made bold promises, vowing to build housing, dismantle homeless encampments, revive the city’s downtown, and hold the city’s various government departments and nonprofits accountable. “We have great challenges ahead but also incredible opportunities,” Lurie said shortly after winning the election. “[We] are going to turn around a great American city.”\nLurie, who has just wrapped his first 100 days in office, is still basking in his political honeymoon. But his largely enthusiastic reception in San Francisco shows the first signs of optimism not only for a blue city that may be on track for real changes, but for the beleaguered Democratic Party at large. In Lurie, some Democrats see a model for what the party should prioritize at the national level. “There is a growing school of thought that the best thing for Democrats nationally is to show they can govern and keep people safe—that they are not obsessed with identity politics or canceling someone who disagrees with them,” said Tony Winnicker, a political adviser who, in addition to working with Lurie’s team, has advised former San Francisco mayors Ed Lee and Gavin Newsom. “I don’t think Daniel Lurie is seeking this role, but the pragmatic and heads-down approach he takes to the office could be a good example when it comes to leading Democrats out of the political wilderness.”\nLurie’s political inexperience is evidenced by one of his most ambitious campaign promises: a vow to dismantle San Francisco’s bloated bureaucracy. For years, the city has been caught in a power struggle emblematic of the Democratic Party’s deeper ideological rift: between progressives determined to dismantle a system they see as rotten to its core and moderates willing to tolerate its flaws for the sake of getting things done. These were tensions that, when compounded by the pandemic, triggered paralysis. “I don’t want to use the term ‘deep state,’ but within the San Francisco bureaucracy, there is definitely an entrenched status quo,” said Winnicker. (Symptomatic of the city’s absurdist policymaking was a 2023 city-appointed reparations committee recommending that San Francisco give Black residents $5 million and homes that cost $1 per family, and a proposal for a 150-square-foot public toilet that would have cost taxpayers $1.7 million and take more than two years to build.)\nWhether or not Lurie can unwind the city’s sclerotic tendencies for good remains unclear. During his campaign, he repeatedly pledged to build 1,500 new beds for the homeless within his first six months in office—a goal that, while relatively straightforward, revealed his political naivete: “To make that campaign promise in the first place shows that Lurie genuinely did not understand the machine he was getting into and the weaponized incompetence he would be up against,” a San Francisco writer who covers city policy told me. “There is a sense that Daniel Lurie has no idea what’s going on and does not know how the levers of power within the city work.” (Lurie has since expanded his timeline for delivering the beds, and his campaign has broadened its definition of what constitutes a bed.) In response to this, Lurie’s press secretary pointed me to a line from Lurie’s 100-day address in which he said that building the 1,500 beds was still a goal that was within his “line of sight. It won’t be easy, but I’m never going to apologize for setting ambitious goals…We may not always hit them, but we will never stop trying.”\nStill, Lurie’s greenness could serve as a strategic asset. “Lurie was not a known quantity,” said Steven Bacio, who cofounded the organization GrowSF, an advocacy group that produces deeply researched voter guides. “He has been absolutely blessed,” he adds. Lurie has been blessed, too, by organizations like Bacio’s, which supports public safety and additional housing, and which paved the way for more moderate leadership by helping flip the board of supervisors to a moderate majority in 2024.\nYet another advantage for Lurie is the political upheaval of 2022, in which San Francisco ejected some of its most left-leaning candidates. “The city had a reckoning over which direction it wanted to go in, and it voted to have a new district attorney,” said Brooke Jenkins, who was reelected as the district attorney in November. Jenkins is referring to her predecessor, Chesa Boudin, who, in the two-and-a-half short years he served as district attorney, came to personify the sort of whimsical progressivism that the city appears now to be rejecting wholesale. (Many city agencies—especially the police—felt that Boudin’s push to divert offenders into rehab and mental health programs clashed with his duty as the city’s top prosecutor.)\nTo Jenkins, San Francisco has long been governed on the “staunch belief that ideology was more important than results. That’s where the party has gone wrong. You can take an ideological position, but if you can’t govern within the basic functions of that ideological framework, people will not be pleased.”\nBut there are key differences. For one, Lurie has a more congenial relationship with his board of supervisors. And he is affable: “If you didn’t endorse Mayor Breed, she wouldn’t talk to you,” said Jim Araby, a veteran labor organizer in San Francisco. In contrast, when Araby told Lurie that his labor union would not endorse him, Lurie was unfazed. “He said, ‘That’s okay. After I win, we’ll work together.’ And that’s literally what happened,” said Araby, who joined Lurie’s administration as a senior adviser on labor relations in November.\nOh, and another thing: Lurie is rich. As an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune, the jeans company born in San Francisco, he may be the richest person to ever run for city mayor, which, as more than one person pointed out to me, makes him “so rich that you can’t buy him.” Lurie’s mayoral bid—the most expensive in recent city history—was largely self-financed, giving him a rare degree of political independence: “He can afford to piss people off,” said Winnicker.\nPerhaps Lurie’s greatest advantage, though, is that he has friends in high places—especially within the tech industry. As part of his plan to revitalize the city, Lurie has assembled many of the industry’s most influential power players in a committee that includes DoorDash cofounder Tony Xu, Airbnb cofounder Brian Chesky, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “Daniel Lurie is encouraging tech companies to stay in San Francisco,” said Ryan Petersen, the CEO of the supply chain management company Flexport, which has offices along San Francisco’s troubled downtown Market Street. “Lurie has called me. He texted me. He shows up when companies sign a new lease. He puts in the effort.”\nPetersen said he was attacked twice on Market Street outside his company’s offices, which led him to stop hiring employees in San Francisco. While he is still considering leaving the city for good, he is optimistic that the new mayor will curb street violence and revitalize the city’s downtown. While the mayor has made it clear that he has no intentions to run for higher office, some, like Petersen, are hopeful. “Whoever cleans up San Francisco becomes the front-runner to be the governor of California, and whoever becomes governor of California goes on to be the front-runner to be the president of the United States,” said Petersen. “So it’s an incredible opportunity for somebody to become a national figure. I don’t know if Daniel Lurie is the guy, but I hope so.”","summary":"The mild-mannered mayor is well-liked and well-heeled, but some worry his inexperience bodes poorly for pulling the Golden City out of its political dysfunction. “Lurie genuinely did not understand the machine he was getting into,” says one local writer.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/daniel-lurie-san-francisco-playbook-democrats","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/681cd596cc950443fba28758/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/Daniel-Lurie-San-Francisco.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 16:09:35","author":"Zoë Bernard","authors":["Zoë Bernard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.213},{"id":319236344,"title":"President Biden Continues to Say He Would’ve Beaten Trump, Says He Wasn’t Surprised by 2024 Election Outcome: “They Went the Sexist Route”","text":"President Joe Biden was in good spirits as he returned to The View for his 10th appearance on the ABC daytime program and first live TV interview since he left the White House.\n\n The former commander-in-chief was brought out early in the show for a solo interview before he was joined by his wife, former first lady Dr. Jill Biden. And the show devoted its full hour to its interview with the Bidens.\n\n President Biden was peppered by questions about the 2024 presidential election, which saw the president drop out in July after a poor performance at a late June debate with then-Republican candidate Donald Trump led to growing calls for him to end his reelection bid. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate and she won the support to become the Democratic nominee. But Harris ended up losing the election to Trump, who won all seven swing states.\n\n When asked if he was surprised by the outcome, Biden said he wasn’t not because Harris isn’t qualified to be president — she is qualified to be president, he insisted. But he blamed misogyny and negative campaigning by the Trump team for Harris’ loss.\n\n “They went the sexist route — this is a woman, this and that,” Biden said. “I’ve never seen such a successful and consistent campaign undercutting the notion that a woman of color couldn’t win.”\n\n Biden added that he speaks to Harris “frequently” and has sought his opinion (“not going to tell you what it is”) and said she’s got a “difficult decision” about her political future, as she’s been reportedly pondering a run for California governor but is also seen as a potential 2028 presidential candidate.\n\n “I hope she stays fully engaged; I think she’s first rate,” Biden said of Harris while adding that there are “other great candidates” in the Democratic party, leaving him “optimistic about the future not pessimistic.”\n\n Still, Biden continues to maintain, as he told USA Today shortly after the election, that he would’ve beaten Trump, highlighting how though Trump won he received a smaller popular vote total than the more than 80 million people who voted for Biden in 2020. “A lot of people didn’t show up,” Biden said, referring to the 2024 voter turnout.\n\n When asked about his late exit from the 2024 presidential race and whether that hampered Harris’ campaign, Biden dismissed that argument saying that Harris was with him “in every decision we made,” touting his administration’s legislative and economic achievements and how “she was every single part of it.”\n\n “It was a very tough year, but look what happened in the meantime,” he said in part.\n\n As for Trump, when asked why the president, who keeps invoking Biden’s name, can’t keep talking about him, Biden was quick to say it was “because I beat him,” adding quietly, “I’m used to dealing with bullies.”\n\n Still Biden said he “takes responsiblity” for Trump’s re-election.\n\n “I was in charge and he won,” he said, going on to talk about the border legislation that Democrats have said Trump scuttled.\n\n More to come.","summary":"In his first live TV interview since leaving the White House, the former commander-in-chief spoke on Thursday's 'The View' about criticism of his late exit from the 2024 presidential race and the fate of Kamala Harris' campaign.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/biden-wouldve-beaten-trump-sexism-harris-loss-the-view-1236211047/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BidenGettyImages-2162013738.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 16:02:28","author":"Hilary Lewis","authors":["Hilary Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.105},{"id":319281218,"title":"Biden tells 'The View' he wasn't surprised Harris lost, blames sexism and racism","text":"Former President Joe Biden said he wasn't surprised that former Vice President Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, blaming the loss on sexism and racism.

Why is now the right time for you to speak out?” View co-host Ana Navarro asked the former president, wondering what his “honest assessment” of Trump’s first three months in office.\n\n“I think he has done, quite frankly, a very poor job in the interest of the United States of America,” the ex-president declared. “I think, you know, the greatest alliance in the history of the world is NATO, not a joke. And he’s blown it up. I was able to expand it.”\n\nBiden added that he was worried about the “long-term” impact of Trump’s foreign policy on the world, including the president’s seemingly close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“I have known Putin for over 45 years. He’s a dictator,” Biden grumbled before also taking aim at Trump’s handling of healthcare and Social Security.\n\nLiberal co-host Joy Behar, meanwhile, brought up Trump’s “obsession” with Biden and his White House tenure, noting that the president has “mentioned you and your family and your administration at least 580 times” since entering the White House.\n\n“ Why is he so fixated on you and blaming you for everything?” Behar wondered.\n\n“I beat him,” Biden snarked as the audience roared with laughter. “I’m used to dealing with bullies.”\n\nThe Bidens’ appearance on The View, which has long been a safe haven for the former president as this marked his 11th time on the show, appears to be part of a concerted media effort to respond to recent books about his cognitive decline and fitness while in office. \n\nIn their book Fight, which was released last month, veteran political reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes paint a picture of the battle within the White House as Biden’s age and gaffes became an increasing issue, prompting prominent Democrats to urge him to step aside and allow Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place. \n\nMeanwhile, CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson have collaborated on the upcoming book Original Sin, which will be released later this month and is about “Biden's decline, its cover-up, and his disastrous choice to run again.” During a CNN appearance on Wednesday night, Navarro – who is also a CNN commentator – said she felt that the former president was trying to preempt the news cycle.\n\n“There's books that are coming out that are basically arguing that he was practically brain dead and that there was a massive cover-up by his administration,” she declared on CNN NewsNight. “And I think he wants to get ahead of it and respond and put out his version.”\n\nEarlier this week, Politico reported that Biden had hired his former deputy press secretary Chris Meagher to help publicly defend his reputation as he looks to become more engaged publicly following Trump’s first 100 days. The View sitdown, which is his first live television interview since Trump’s inauguration, looks to be the first big test of this new strategy.\n\n“The timing of Biden’s appearance on The View is notable because it comes after the 100-day mark, a period in which former presidents have typically avoided criticizing their predecessors,” Politico noted. “Now Biden can take on Trump more directly, the people said. It is also a venue he has often retreated to at fraught moments dating back to 2007, including his first interview after launching his 2020 presidential run and last September as the first sitting president to do so, during which he called Trump a ‘loser.’”\n\nThe interview also comes after he sat down with the BBC for an interview that was released on Wednesday, in which he tore into his successor on multiple levels. \n\nSpecifically, he called Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine give up territory to Russia in order to bring an end to the war “modern-day appeasement,” adding that he was gravely concerned about NATO potentially breaking up.\n\n“What the hell’s going on here? What president ever talks like that?” Biden also said about Trump’s proposals to annex Greenland and make Canada the 51st state. “That’s not who we are. We’re about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.”","summary":"‘I think he has done, quite frankly, a very poor job in the interest of the United States of America,’ Joe Biden said of his successor","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-the-view-trump-election-b2747408.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/08/15/38/the-view-(11).jpg?trim=0,50,0,50&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/JQyqxJ26-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-08 15:53:53","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.151},{"id":319233132,"title":"Biden reveals on ‘The View’ he ‘wasn’t surprised’ Trump defeated Harris in 2024 election","text":"Former President Joe Biden revealed Thursday in his first TV interview after leaving the White House that he “wasn’t surprised” President Trump trounced Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n“I wasn’t surprised, not because I didn’t think the vice president wasn’t the most qualified person to be president.

The author’s latest poetry collection, “Smother” ($26, W.W. Norton) hit bookshop shelves recently, so we took the opportunity to hear more about her work. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: Smother is such an evocative word. How did you decide on it as your title?\n\nA: The book is about smoke and motherhood primarily as its two subjects. Once I realized smother is a portmanteau of the two subjects, it seemed inevitable as a title. But I also like the tongue-in-cheek aggressiveness of it, because it sets a tone for the whole book that lets you know that this isn’t going to be a demure book. People often assume poetry books will be beautiful, full of lament or awe, and this book intends to be a little more gritty and in the real world.\n\nThe epigraph to the book is an annoying and dismissive comment by an editor at a major magazine that says he’s completely uninterested in poems about mothers or poems with the word mother in them. I’m also using the title to gesture in immediate defiance of that idea: There’s going to be a lot of the word ‘mother’ in this book.\n\nQ: Tell me more about the poem “Smother,” and the smoke metaphor you use.\n\nA: That poem is my play on the idea of the smoke as the idealized and unattainable mother. There’s an unattainable and damaging — and also limiting — idea of motherhood that we’re told to aspire to, and it is impossible in a real experience of being a human mother. Similarly, smoke can be everywhere but invisible; this dangerous thing that’s in our midst, and you can’t really get away from it — like you can’t get away from the patriarchy. I started thinking about things that annoyed me about what I was told about motherhood, and I replaced all the mothers with smoke as the character. That poem let me get out a lot of my frustrations and make fun of some of those ideas.\n\nQ: I saw a few different themes in the book: motherhood, climate — specifically the Northern California experience of wildfires — and friendship. How did all of those fit together for you within the collection?\n\nA: As I was writing this, one of my closest friends died, and so I started writing elegy poems to her. She was 39 when she died, and I was feeling devastated at her loss. I started writing to her, and in the process of writing those poems, all of these other societal elements kept coming in, like the smoke from all of our fires, and the distance that I felt from my friend after death, and from other people, by technological means. Then, COVID happened, which exacerbated all of those things and brought it to a head. That felt so isolating and demoralizing to me that I started making more active efforts to find and hold on to other women and value those friendships, because we are mortal, and we are far away from each other a lot of the time. I started writing love poems to my female friends in the latter half of this book, and that ended up being my answer to some of the losses I write about.\n\nQ: Are there Bay Area-specific moments or experiences locals should look out for in your book?\n\nA: I mention my kids in 2020 going to the same school that Kamala Harris integrated. Some squirrels made a little nest in my backyard, and we found in their building materials part of a Warriors flag. Two of the poems deal with the Caldor fire and its aftermath. The City of Berkeley owns Echo Lake and Tuolumne Camp in the wilderness (near South Lake Tahoe and Yosemite, respectively). The Tuolumne camp burned down in the 2013 Rim Fire and the Echo Lake camp was threatened by the Caldor Fire, which burned right up to the edge of the camp. That started to feel symbolic because these are our public estates, things owned by all of us, and generations of Bay Area and Berkeley kids have grown up in these spaces.\n\nQ: That’s right, your last poem talks about replanting trees to help restore Tuolumne Camp. What do you hope readers take away from your book?\n\nA: That poem ends with a tempered hope. You’ve planted these trees, and hopefully they’ll grow. Hopefully they’ll live in their new spots, and will grow tall enough, and we won’t have another fire here, so that in a generation or two, they can give back this family camp to the next generation of kids at Berkeley’s Tuolumne Camp. But it’s tempered hope, right? Because the engineer who was telling us how to plant the trees said, “One in 10 might make it.” I thought that was really depressing. But she said it in this hopeful way, and the more I thought about that, and sat with it for this poem, the more I thought that it is actually hopeful. You do more, with the hope that you’ve done enough that some will make it. There were multiple tree plantings, and people planted enough so that if even just one-tenth made it, we’d have a good forest. But the amount of effort is not lost on me, and I think that that probably is what you come away with at the end: That the effort to replace it and come back from this is not going to be small, but it’s a good idea to be hopeful about it. At the camp, there are all these little trees that we now get to go back to every year. They were a foot when we planted them, and now they’re nine feet. It’s exciting. I think the hope is justified, but effort is also required.\n\nQ: Other thoughts to share?\n\nA: This book is very much about community. I run a literary arts center with my husband called Left Margin Lit, which is a co-working space for writers. This is a single-authored book, but I wrote these poems in a more communal way than I’ve ever written before. That’s another source of hope and optimism for me — that there are a lot of people who love the arts here, and we can do this stuff together.\n\n‘CREEK FIRE’\n\nThe dark comes in on my girl’s tenth birthday.\n\nFire bearing crow feathers—no, ash.\n\nIt comes with its big breath,\n\nsun without light.\n\nCold morning\n\nin the surrounding counties,\n\neveryone blinking, looking around,\n\nphones lifted to the horizon.\n\n— “Excerpted from Smother: Poems.

Instead, he said that the Trump team “went the sexist route” by casting doubt that a woman can be president, and also by playing the race card.\n\n“I have never seen as successful and quite as consistent a campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country, and a woman of mixed race,” Biden said.\n\nHe also said that “we underestimate the the phenomenal impact that Covid and the pandemic” had, as the disruptions continued to impact voters views of the country.\n\nCo-host Alyssa Farah Griffin asked Biden about polling last year that showed that only 28% of voters felt the country was on the right track, and whether he bears some responsibility for Trump’s return to office.\n\n“Yes, I do,” Biden said. “I was in charge and he won.”\n\nThe former president, though, blamed Trump for scuttling a bipartisan agreement on border security, which would have given Biden an election year win on a primary issue in the campaign. Instead, Trump argued that Biden was ignoring the problem and was responsible for a flood of migrants across the border.\n\nBiden also pointed to his administration’s legislative successes, including an infrastructure bill, but said that “we weren’t quite as good as he was” when it came to marketing accomplishments.\n\nAs he did in a BBC interview earlier this week, Biden blasted Trump’s performance in office, warning that he was undermining NATO and other key alliances.\n\n“He has had the worst 100 days that any president has ever had,” Biden said.\n\nBiden was later joined by former First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nHis appearance came as Donald Trump was commanding attention from the Oval Office, announcing a trade agreement with the UK. Trump’s press conference was to start at 10 a.m. ET, but was delayed about 45 minutes. Inadvertently or not, it countered Biden’s appearance.\n\nTrump has continued to blame Biden. As Joe Behar noted, he mentioned his predecessor’s name 52 times at a recent cabinet meeting.\n\n“Why is he so fixated on you?” Behar asked.\n\n“I beat him,” Biden said. “I’m used to deal with bullies.”\n\nHe also said that he thinks he could have beaten Trump. “He still got 7 million fewer votes. A lot of people didn’t show up,” he said.\n\nWith a standing ovation from The View audience, Biden’s appearance before a friendly crowd may be a counter to what is likely to be negative attention to his initial decision to run in 2024. Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s Original Sin is due to be published on May 20.\n\nBiden said that he is writing his own book, a presidential memoir, and “they told me i had to do it within a year.”\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

After a disastrous debate against Donald Trump on June 27 last year he took nearly a month to finally end his reelection bid, finally calling time on July 21.\n\nThat gave Harris just 106 days to build-out a presidential campaign, and she ultimately lost to Trump in November.\n\n'It's a question lots of people ask you, Mr. President – did you leave it too late? Should you have withdrawn earlier, given someone else a bigger chance?' BBC journalist Nick Robinson asked.\n\n'We left at a time when we had a good candidate,' Biden said of Harris in the interview that aired Wednesday morning. 'She was fully funded.' \n\n'And what happened was, what we had set out to do, no one thought we could do,' the former president added. 'We had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'I'm gonna stop now.''\n\nBiden also took the opportunity to hit out at his successor Donald Trump, accusing him of 'modern-day appeasement' in his attempts to end the Russia-Ukraine War. \n\n'What the hell's going on here? What president ever talks like that?' he added about Trump's plans to annex Greenland and Canada.\n\n'That's not who we are,' he continued. 'We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.' \n\nThe ex-president struggled throughout the interview to properly articulate his thoughts, refusing to address Trump by his name.\n\nHe also mumbled and took long pauses, sighing heavily and speaking in a whisper at times.\n\nBiden also voiced his worries about relations between US-Europe declining under the Trump administration, as Allied nations marked the 80th anniversary of VE Day this week.\n\nHe called it 'foolish' to think Putin would concede if parts of Ukraine were given in a peace deal.\n\nThe appearance on The View also comes as a diary Jill Biden reportedly kept during their time in the White House is set to be used in a tell-all book. \n\nThe former First Couple have faced a slew of embarrassing articles and books on Biden's decline in office, and Biden is said to have been preparing a book to combat the allegations. \n\nInsiders told the Daily Mail the couple could land a book deal worth $30 million.","summary":"Former President Biden gave a halting and mumbling performance on The View as he and Jill Biden gave their first joint interview since leaving the White House.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14692177/Joe-Biden-View-Trump-Kamala-Harris-interview.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/08/16/98180785-0-image-a-59_1746716941800.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/07/3523832631876799746/1024x576_MP4_3523832631876799746.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-08 15:39:15","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.553},{"id":319229986,"title":"Former Biden fundraiser-turned Trumper has spectacular meltdown in podcast interview","text":"A former fundraiser for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who switched her allegiance to President Donald Trump following his election win, fell apart spectacularly in an interview about her upcoming tell-all book.\n\nLindi Li accused podcaster Tara Palmeri of “ambushing” her, after she was asked a relatively simple question about the contents of the book in which she had “unfettered access” to parts of the White House.\n\nThe 34-year-old served as the Democratic National Committee Mid-Atlantic Regional Chair and stumped for vice president Harris during the 2024 presidential election.

I don’t know what you’re trying to get at.”\n\nPalmeri noted several other details of the book that Li claimed were “still in draft form” and being written by a ghost writer, prompting the recent Trump-convert to become irritated – saying she had asked Palmeri’s producer not to share details of the text.\n\n“It’s not even done. So you’re sharing a form that’s, like, really rough and I specifically… he promised me that you wouldn’t be sharing this rough draft… it’s not ready to be published and you’re sharing a draft that’s not done,” Li said.\n\nPalmeri then questioned why Li would write something in her draft book if it was not a fact, to which Li began to become more flustered, reiterating she had not written specific parts of the book.\n\nAfter more back and forth, Li – visibly annoyed – asked Palmeri: “Are you just here to ambush me? Like what is going on now?”\n\nAfter the sweeping Democratic loss in the presidential election in November, Li was one of the first within the party to blame the result on over-progressiveness – including the selection of Harris’ running mate Tim Walz.","summary":"A former fundraiser for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who switched her allegiance to President Donald Trump following his election win, fell apart spectacularly in an interview about her upcoming tell-all book.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/lindi-li-biden-harris-trump-podcast-meltdown-b2747372.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/08/15/35/Screenshot-2025-05-08-at-10-47-35-AM.png?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-08 15:25:47","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":319224252,"title":"Sen.
