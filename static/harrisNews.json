JESUS CHRIST IS LORD!!”\n\nCalls for military tribunals against Trump’s perceived enemies have been a common refrain among his supporters, especially those in the conspiracy orbit of QAnon. \n\nTrump has previously called for military tribunals against Obama and former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney. Trump has also called for former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris to be jailed.\n\nIn May, Trump amplified a Truth Social post that called for Obama to face trial.\n\n“ALL ROADS LEAD TO OBAMA... RETRUTH IF YOU WANT PUBLIC MILITARY TRIBUNALS,” the account posted, accompanied with a photo of Trump and Obama. Trump shared the post on his own account. \n\nTrump’s threats of military tribunals might now pale in comparison to his most emboldened threats yet. Last month, Trump suggested Democratic veterans in Congress should be hanged for releasing a joint video urging U.S. military service members to disobey unlawful orders.\n\nTrump called it “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” and boosted a post from an anonymous account that read: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trumps-late-night-posting-spree-included-guarantee-obama-will-face-military-tribunal_n_692f59cbe4b02d38edf087a3?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/692f423e190000129e6a0be2.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 22:33:21","author":"Ryan Grenoble,Sebastian Murdock","authors":["Ryan Grenoble","Sebastian Murdock"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":384437584,"title":"Trump rips Somali community as federal agents reportedly eye Minnesota enforcement sweep","text":"President Donald Trump called a bloc of Somali migrants to Minnesota \"garbage\" who rely too heavily on the U.S. welfare state, as ICE reportedly eyes ramped-up immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities.

While the Democratic Party has been in flux after then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ defeat by President Donald Trump, recent victories by both moderate and progressive candidates have given mixed messages about the party’s path of victory moving forward. During an appearance on The Daily Beast Podcast published Monday, Carville was asked by host Joanna Coles about the future of the Democratic Party. \"So let’s do a little unwrapping here,\" he said. \"The mayor of New York has never been a figure in national politics. Let me repeat, the mayor of New York, who's never been much of a figure in national politics.\" Carville, who has criticized Mamdani in the past, cited multiple major changes happening in politics, mocking that by contrast, the view of many people is, \"But we must talk about Mamdani, because New York is the center of the universe, that nothing else exists in the United States but New York.\" BILL MAHER WARNS FELLOW DEMOCRATS OF MAMDANI’S IMPACT, SAYS THE ‘WHOLE’ PARTY IS ON THE BALLOT He went on to argue, \"in fact, the city of New York is not a very — it's a big player in finance. It's a big player in theater, it's a big player in advertising, it’s a big player in creativity. It is one of my favorite cities in the entire world. In fact, I'm going there tomorrow, I can't wait. But you're not the center of the political universe. You're just not. You're not even a swing place. If it wouldn't be for your money, politicians wouldn't much care about you.\" \"I’m deducting from that you’re saying the future of the Democratic Party is going to be moderate?\" Cole asked. Carville argued that right now, the Democratic Party does not have a message so much as it has an argument that Republicans must be stopped. \"The only way that you're going to have a message is Democratic voters are going to pick their presidential nominee,\" he said.

Ever,\" Carville said, mocking the idea that Mamdani represents where Democrats across the country are politically. \"Right now that gets in the way of the storyline, right? Because New York has to be central to the story, right?\" When Cole continued to share data about the turnout for Mamdani, arguing the election of a democratic socialist was significant, Carville replied, \"That’s great, that’s great, it’s New York City. It’s not anything else.\" He added, \"I tell you that you’re not the center of the political universe in the United States.\" \"Well that’s very disappointing to me,\" the host joked. \"This is a brutal Monday morning.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Strategist James Carville cautioned that the Democratic Party&apos;s national message is likely to be more moderate, arguing people put too much stock in New York elections.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/carville-says-mamdani-victory-not-bellwether-warns-nyc-not-center-political-universe","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/split-photo-carville-and-mamdani.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 22:20:56","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":384410960,"title":"Kornacki: Democrats look to overperform in Tennessee special election","text":"Kornacki: Democrats look to overperform in Tennessee special election\n\nIE 11 is not supported.

At the end of the administration’s monthly Cabinet meeting, Fox Business’ Edward Lawrence asked Trump whether Musk was \"back in [his] circle of friends\" after their falling-out. Trump responded: \"Well, I really don't know. I mean, I like Elon a lot\"…he said, praising Musk’s endorsement during the 2024 campaign before noting their disagreement over electric-vehicle policy. Musk was a fixture in the White House in the early days of the second Trump administration as he took on the role as the Department of Government Efficiency's de facto leader. He served as a special government employee with the Trump administration to help lead DOGE, frequently attending Cabinet meetings and joining Trump during public events. Musk's tenure with DOGE wrapped up at the end of May. TRUMP TEASES MUSK AT FORUM AS ONCE-FROSTY DYNAMIC SEEMS TO TAKE A TURN Musk had also championed Trump during the 2024 election cycle, criss-crossing battleground states that ultimately all voted for the Republican candidate over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump repeatedly celebrated Musk for his efforts at DOGE to remove potential federal overspending, fraud and mismanagement – an effort assailed by government employees and Democrats who protested both the Trump administration and Musk repeatedly earlier this year. TRUMP RENOMINATES MUSK ALLY JARED ISAACMAN TO LEAD NASA AFTER EARLIER REVERSAL The cozy friendship fell to pieces in June, however, when Musk began publicly ridiculing the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which was a massive piece of legislation Trump signed into law in July that advances his agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. Musk railed against the legislation, which Trump had been rallying Republican lawmakers to pass since the beginning of his second term, posting on X that it would be the \"BIGGEST DEBT ceiling increase in HISTORY\" and also claimed in a personal attack on Trump that \"@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.\" Trump previously told the media that his relationship with Musk changed when he began discussing plans to eliminate the electic vehicle mandate, which would affect Musk's signature electric company, Tesla. Trump signed a trio of congressional resolutions in June ending California's restrictive rules for diesel engines and mandates on electric vehicle sales, with Trump celebrating that his signature \"will kill the California mandates forever.\" WHITE HOUSE TAUNTS LIBERALS WITH PROVOCATIVE MEME-FILLED DEBUT ON BLUESKY The pair abruptly parted ways in June, with Musk weeks later offering some support to Trump's presidential actions on social media, such as praising a ceasefire deal between Israel and Gaza in July. Musk was seen physically back in Trump's orbit in September during the memorial service for Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA's founder who was assassinated on Sept. 10. The pair was seen sitting next to each other and chatting during the ceremony.

And it’s become the perfect mascot for everything that has gone catastrophically wrong with the American left.\n\nWelch, originally from Texas, made her name as an Oklahoma suburban mom ranting about motherhood and related cultural topics with her cohost, Angie Sullivan, on their podcast, I’ve Had It. Shortly before the 2024 election, they stopped complaining about driving their kids to soccer practice. Instead, the two, clearly led by Welch, turned their podcast into a radical left political show, inviting guests on like former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Kamala Harris, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, and far-left influencer Hasan Piker.\n\n PSA pic.twitter.com/BSHi9jvYUp — I’ve Had It Podcast (@ivehaditpodcast) June 27, 2023\n\nChanging the course of their podcast turned out to be a smart move, as their listenership and notoriety exploded. But mainly for Welch, as Sullivan’s main job seems to be nodding in agreement to all of Welch’s insane beliefs. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!)\n\nWelch has celebrated political violence, including cheering the murder of Charlie Kirk, and urged fellow Democrats to adopt violent rhetoric to stay culturally relevant. She’s crossed a line that used to be sacred, but because she aligns with Democrats, she was rewarded. A conservative who giggled at the hypothetical murder of a leftist would be deplatformed by sunrise, yet Welch is invited on CNN and praised as the left’s Joe Rogan.\n\nWelch also lobbed smears at Stephen and Katie Miller, calling him a Nazi Jew and later attaching the insult to Katie, all because Stephen Miller believes in securing the border.\n\n One more time for the permanant record: Stephen Miller is a white supremacist Nazi pic.twitter.com/j3zL0gt3uA — I’ve Had It Podcast (@ivehaditpodcast) December 1, 2025\n\nStill, the issues with Welch are deeper than the inflammatory content she uses to drive her podcast listeners. It’s her open contempt for American whites from the heartland, which she calls “crusty white people,” and her insistence that America has no culture except multiculturalism.\n\nLike many left-wing wine moms, she believes that our nation is an original sin requiring constant atonement. Gratitude, continuity, and organic social cohesion are dismissed as bigotry, xenophobia, and fascism. The logical endpoint of their worldview is a rootless society in which the only permissible identity is perpetual grievance. While they believe this leads to liberation, what we get is civilizational suicide dressed up as compassion.\n\n If it looks like a Nazi, walks like a Nazi, and talks like a Nazi – it’s a Nazi. #ElonMusk #JDVance pic.twitter.com/pUJgTF194m — I’ve Had It Podcast (@ivehaditpodcast) February 17, 2025\n\nWelch is not an anomaly. She is the embodiment of the Obama-era left. She packages hatred of our country, its traditions, and faithful citizens in a shiny wrapper of left-wing resistance and allyship to anything and anyone who tears down our social cohesion. It is venom sold as virtue. (Every Parent Sees It: Adults And Children Are Out Of Control And It’s Because Of Our Low-Trust Society)\n\nA movement that celebrates Welch and others like her admits, even if it’s subconsciously, that it has entered a large swath of our country into a suicide pact.

Let them go back to their country and fix it.”\n\nThe president has used the shooting to rail against Somali immigrants in Minnesota despite the suspect being an Afghan national who received asylum in the United States under Trump earlier this year.\n\nTrump — who has routinely used derogatory and inflammatory language to describe Minnesota’s Somali population and Somali Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar — has baselessly alleged Somali immigrants are “taking over” the state and “roving the streets looking for ‘prey.’”\n\n“Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage,” Trump said Tuesday.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to deploy so-called strike teams made up of roughly 100 federal law enforcement officers to go after Somalis with final deportation orders, though immigrants who are still seeking legal status could be caught up in the raids. The New York Times first reported the directive.\n\n“Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,” Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Independent in response to questions about the operation.\n\n“What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” she said.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the prospect of federal agents surging into the city is “a frightening moment for our Somali community.”\n\n“That’s not American. That’s not what we are about,” he said during a press conference Tuesday.\n\n Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, who is from Somalia, added that “Somali Americans are here to stay.”\n\n“We love this state. We love this country,” he said. “This is home. We’re not going anywhere.”\n\nIn the aftermath of last week’s attack on National Guard members, Trump announced a barrage of anti-immigration policies, including a “permanent” pause on immigration from “Third World Countries” and a threat to strip U.S. citizenship from naturalized immigrants “who undermine domestic tranquillity.”\n\nHe also threatened to “end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country” and deport noncitizens who are deemed to be “non-compatible with Western Civilization.”\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have also “halted all asylum decisions.”\n\nMore than 80,000 people of Somali descent live in Minnesota, making the state the largest Somali diaspora community in the world in the wake of a brutal civil war that broke out in the 1990s in the East African nation. The vast majority are U.S. citizens.\n\nOmar, whose family fled Somalia to escape civil war when she was a young girl, became a citizen more than two decades ago.

Let them go back to their country and fix it.”\n\nThe president has used the shooting to rail against Somali immigrants in Minnesota despite the suspect being an Afghan national who received asylum in the United States under Trump earlier this year.\n\nTrump — who has routinely used derogatory and inflammatory language to describe Minnesota’s Somali population and Somali Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar — has baselessly alleged Somali immigrants are “taking over” the state and “roving the streets looking for ‘prey.’”\n\n“Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage,” Trump said Tuesday.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to deploy so-called strike teams made up of roughly 100 federal law enforcement officers to go after Somalis with final deportation orders, though immigrants who are still seeking legal status could be caught up in the raids. The New York Times first reported the directive.\n\n“Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,” Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Independent in response to questions about the operation.\n\n“What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” she said.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the prospect of federal agents surging into the city is “a frightening moment for our Somali community.”\n\n“That’s not American. That’s not what we are about,” he said during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nMinneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, who is from Somalia, added that “Somali Americans are here to stay.”\n\n“We love this state. We love this country,” he said. “This is home. We’re not going anywhere.”\n\nIn the aftermath of last week’s attack on National Guard members, Trump announced a barrage of anti-immigration policies, including a “permanent” pause on immigration from “Third World Countries” and a threat to strip U.S. citizenship from naturalized immigrants “who undermine domestic tranquillity.”\n\nHe also threatened to “end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country” and deport noncitizens who are deemed to be “non-compatible with Western Civilization.”\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have also “halted all asylum decisions.”\n\nMore than 80,000 people of Somali descent live in Minnesota, making the state the largest Somali diaspora community in the world in the wake of a brutal civil war that broke out in the 1990s in the East African nation. The vast majority are U.S. citizens.\n\nOmar, whose family fled Somalia to escape civil war when she was a young girl, became a citizen more than two decades ago. Trump has falsely said she “probably” entered the country illegally and described her as “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab.”\n\nThe Trump administration has also threatened to cancel Temporary Protected Status for Somalia, though only a small number of Somalis in the country are still protected by the program, which temporarily grants immigrants facing humanitarian crises in their home countries legal permissions to live and work in the United States.\n\nAs of March, there were 705 Somalis covered under TPS, according to the Congressional Research Service.

While the barb didn’t come from President Donald Trump himself -- who has called female reporters “piggy” and “ugly” in recent weeks -- White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson labeled Carpenter “stupid” in a statement. \n\nThe ordeal began Tuesday morning when Carpenter responded to a video published on social media Monday by The White House. The video shows members of Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) arresting people while Carpenter’s song “Juno” plays. \n\nThe song is notorious at Carpenter’s concerts as she typically demonstrates a sexual pose during each show which is preceded by the phrase “have you ever tried this one?” The ICE video plays that phrase as people are being arrested by agents and end up in different positions. \n\nCarpenter disavowed the video on social media, saying \"this video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.\" About 90 minutes later, TMZ reported Jackson responded on behalf of The White House. \n\n\"Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?” Jackson said, referencing a lyric in Carpenter’s hit song “Manchild.”\n\nSo far, Carpenter has yet to respond and Trump has not weighed in directly. \n\nThis isn’t the first time the Trump Administration has feuded with female pop singers publicly. Trump himself has routinely insulted Taylor Swift in the last few years, going so far as to say he “hates” her. He also called for Beyonce to be prosecuted over untrue claims that she was paid $11 million by former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign. \n\nOver the last decade, dozens of artists have asked Trump and his team not to use their music during his campaign stops or on videos produced by his White House.","summary":"The pop singer called the video \"evil and disgusting\" prior to a White House spokesperson calling the singer \"stupid.\"","url":"https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/12/white-house-calls-female-pop-music-megastar-stupid-after-using-her-song-in-ice-arrest-video.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/5I3X3AS5DNDZXOX5KX7B4UTPY4.jpg?auth=5e43b2cfcd67465b61d81a72f699d546e5e9eec2aebad3fef6b41f9d8bfdcf63&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 19:56:29","author":"Matt Durr","authors":["Matt Durr"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":384380792,"title":"Sabrina Carpenter Slams White House's ‘Evil’ ICE Video Using Her Song","text":"Sabrina Carpenter is speaking out after President Donald Trump’s White House used one of her songs in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation video.\n“This video is evil and disgusting,” Carpenter, 26, wrote via X on Tuesday, December 2. “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”\nOne day earlier, the White House posted a video featuring images of ICE officers detaining individuals alleged to be “dangerous” criminals residing in the United States without proper authorization. Carpenter’s song “Juno” played in the background of the 21-second clip.\n“Have you ever tried this one?” the White House captioned the video via X, referencing Carpenter’s viral moments in her life shows in which she strikes various sexual poses. “Bye-bye.”\nIn response to Carpenter’s post, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson defended the video and its content.\n“Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists and pedophiles from our country,” Jackson said in a statement to Us Weekly on Tuesday. “Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”\n(According to the Cato Institute, 93 percent of individuals detained and booked in ICE detention centers have not been convicted of a violent crime, and nearly two-thirds have no criminal conviction at all.)\nCarpenter’s post comes just days after she wrapped the United States portion of her Short n’ Sweet tour with six sold-out shows at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena.\nAccording to the singer, the tour raised more than $1.5 million for various organizations, including The Jed Foundation, Best Friends Animal Society and Trans Law Center. The shows also “helped register tens of thousands of new voters” with HeadCount.\nShe is expected to headline the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California, in April 2026.\nCarpenter isn’t the first celebrity to object to having their music be associated with Trump’s administration’s policies.\nIn October, Kenny Loggins made headlines for criticizing the White House’s use of his hit song “Danger Zone” in a video that depicted Trump flying over No Kings protestors.\n“This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.’ Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” Loggins, 77, said in a statement shared with Variety at the time. “I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together.”\nIn 2024, Beyoncé also threatened a cease and desist order to the Trump campaign after it used “Freedom” in a video. That song later became former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign song.\nSwedish band ABBA, rock band Foo Fighters, Olivia Rodrigo and other artists have also demanded the president stop using their music at events or in videos over the years.\nOne celebrity who has previously expressed support for Trump and his music choices is Kid Rock.\n\"[Trump's] got so many good songs playing,” the country singer shared on Fox News in April 2024 when addressing Trump’s music overhead at campaign rallies and events. “It's a playlist I would play. I've heard of ‘House of the Rising Sun.’ I've even heard Springsteen songs, you know, Elvis, Elton John, and then there'd be these patriotic tunes.”","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sabrina-carpenter-slams-white-houses-evil-ice-video-using-her-song/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2233673430-sabrina-carpenter.jpg?crop=374px%2C25px%2C1036px%2C583px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=86&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 19:36:09","author":"Mike Vulpo","authors":["Mike Vulpo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":384385298,"title":"ABC, NBC, CBS evening newscasts ignore widening Minnesota fraud case on Tim Walz's watch","text":"Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., is at the center of a widening scandal as federal prosecutors continue to unravel one of the nation’s largest COVID-era fraud cases, but anyone who relies on evening newscasts on ABC, NBC and CBS for information would have no idea. The Justice Department announced new charges last week against the 78th defendant in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme, which prosecutors say involved more than $300 million in stolen funds from a federally funded child nutrition program and has already resulted in over 50 convictions. Many of the individuals charged come from Minnesota’s Somali community, and critics have pointed at Walz. A group of Minnesota state employees said they wrote to former Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) multiple times \"warning them\" about Walz and what they described as his \"incompetence, fraud scandals and retaliation.\" Walz was Harris' running mate on the failed Democratic 2024 ticket. In a Truth Social post on Thanksgiving, Trump tore into Walz, who the president called \"seriously r------d,\" and accused the governor of doing nothing \"either through fear\" or \"incompetence.\" TIM WALZ FIRES BACK AT TRUMP ACCUSATION OF 'INCOMPETENCE,' DODGES ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FRAUD IN MINNESOTA The New York Times published a blistering report on Saturday, headlined, \"How Fraud Swamped Minnesota’s Social Services System on Tim Walz’s Watch,\" writing, \"Walz and fellow Democrats are being asked to explain how so much money was stolen on their watch.\" However, ABC’s \"World News Tonight,\" NBC’s \"Nightly News\" and \"CBS Evening News\" have not mentioned Walz by name in the past week, according to a search of transcripts using Grabien Media. The terms \"Somali\" and \"Somalian\" were also not used on any of the three network newscasts. ABC News, NBC News and CBS News did not immediately respond when asked by Fox News Digital why their evening newscasts skipped the story. NewsBusters referred to it as an \"omission\" and accused the networks of suppressing the scandal. \"Another day, another massive story of blue-state political malfeasance hidden by the elitist media nightly news,\" NewsBusters analyst Jorge Bonilla said in a report for the conservative media watchdog. \"This time, there is not a peep about the exploding welfare scandal currently engulfing the state of Minnesota — which directly implicates some of its senior-most elected leaders.\" MINNESOTA GOVERNMENT WORKERS BLAME WALZ FOR 'MASSIVE FRAUD' AMID ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SOMALI COMMUNITY \"This is, without a doubt, a scandal of massive proportions that continues to unfold. And yet, a search of the legacy nightly news over the past week yields absolutely nothing,\" Bonilla continued. \"Had such allegations of corruption unfolded in, say, Florida, you’d never hear the end of it. But, as is often the case with these things, they appear to be different. The double standard wins again.\" Walz did face questions about the scandal Sunday on NBC’s \"Meet the Press,\" when host Kristen Welker pressed him on whether he takes responsibility for failing to stop the fraud in his state. \"Well, certainly, I take responsibility for putting people in jail,\" the governor responded. \"I will note, it's not just Somalis. Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We're AAA-bond rated. But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail,\" Walz continued. \"We're doing everything we can. But to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few? It's lazy.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Walz also addressed the fraud at a press conference last week, saying it \"undermines trust in government,\" and \"undermines programs that are absolutely critical in improving quality of life.\" \"If you’re committing fraud, no matter where you come from, what you look like, what you believe, you are going to go to jail,\" Walz said.

Darrell Issa is reportedly considering a run for Congress in Texas next year rather than his current district in California as major redistricting in California and Texas continues to change the political landscape for the midterm elections. Issa could head to Texas to run in the state’s 32nd Congressional District currently represented by Democratic Rep. Julie Johnson after Texas split her district in the controversial GOP-friendly redistricting effort. The redistricting incited California to redraw its districts in favor of Democrats, which made the path forward more difficult for Issa, Punchbowl News reported on Monday. Issa was significantly affected by California’s newly redrawn maps that voters approved last month. The change transformed the landscape from a district where Trump won by 15 points to new boundaries where former Vice President Kamala Harris would have won by 3 points, according to the Cook Political Report. A source told Fox News Digital Issa did not \"go looking\" for the opportunity but that friends in Texas encouraged him to run, and he is \"working through it.\" GOP LAWMAKER FLIPS SCRIPT ON NEWSOM, BASS BY DEFINING ANTI-ICE RIOTS WITH 1 WORD Further complicating the situation is the fact that redistricting in both California and Texas is facing legal challenges. And it is unclear whether they will be in effect for next year’s critical midterm election that will decide the balance of power in Congress. The Supreme Court is expected to decide on Texas' redistricting in the next few days after a panel of federal judges blocked the state from using its redrawn congressional map, calling it \"racially gerrymandered,\" a ruling which Republicans across the country have blasted as a \"double standard.\" CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASS CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING PROPOSITION IN VICTORY FOR NEWSOM, DEMOCRATS In California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom successfully backed a ballot measure to erase the new seats Republicans were likely to pick up in Texas, Trump’s Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit challenging the redistricting, arguing that race was \"used as a proxy\" in California to justify creating districts favorable to Democrats. The move by Republicans in Texas to attempt to add more GOP seats has created a political firestorm across the country as lawmakers in other states have pledged to make counteracting moves as Republicans try to defend a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives, where Democrats need a pickup of just three seats to win back control.

The Trump administration has conducted multiple strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean on small boats accused of ferrying drugs in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in such strikes since early September. There is a long list of performers and artists who have objected to the Trump administration using their songs and copyright material, including ABBA, Bruce Springsteen, Olivia Rodrigo, Rihanna , Phil Collins, Pharrell, John Fogerty, Semisonic, Neil Young, Eddy Grant, Panic! at the Disco, R.E.M., Guns N’ Roses, Celine Dion, Beyoncé and Adele . Carpenter's rebuke came as Trump, 79, appeared to doze off during a marathon cabinet meeting. As members of his top team took turns to shower him with gushing praise, the elderly President's eyes drooped, he leaned forward and appeared to be close to falling asleep. At other times he leaned on his hand and closed his eyes during the meeting which lasted longer than an hour. It's not the first time Carpenter has criticised Trump. After endorsing and supporting Kamala Harris ahead of last year's election, Carpenter told an audience the day after the election: “I hope we can be a moment of peace for you, a moment of safety. Sorry about our country and to the women in here I love you so so so so so much & I really hope for the rest of this night that you can enjoy yourselves because you absolutely deserve it.”","summary":"The country pop singer laid into the US President after the White House used one of her songs in a video showing people being cuffed and deported","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/sabrina-carpenter-savages-donald-trump-36341874","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36341878.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Sabrina-Carpenter-Trump-25336635200598.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 18:54:12","author":"Mikey Smith","authors":["Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":384397182,"title":"Gas prices drop below $3 nationwide as Trump says $2 gas within reach","text":"Americans are seeing relief at the pump as the national average for regular gas fell to $2.99 on Monday, AAA reported — the first time prices have dipped below $3 in more than four years.

Marsha Blackburn.\n\nBut the retirement of incumbent Rep. Mark Green has led to the state’s first House special election in four decades today, and the president appears nervous.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump claimed on social media without evidence that Democratic state Sen. Aftyn Behn “hates Christianity, will take away your guns, wants Open Borders, Transgender for everybody, men in women’s sports, and openly disdains Country music.”\n\nAnd Monday night, on the eve of the election, Trump spoke virtually at multiple campaign events for Republican nominee Matt Van Epps, a ratcheting up of his involvement in a race that historically is not competitive.\n\nTo be clear, Van Epps is the favorite to win, but Democrats think Behn may be able to cut the margin to perhaps 10 points.\n\nThat would be yet another sign of a Democratic wave.\n\nAfter the party’s successes in November’s elections, that would be yet another sign of a Democratic wave coming in the congressional midterms. \n\nAlthough it’s historically unlikely, a 12-point swing nationally next year would mean Republicans would lose every competitive district and even some safe seats, giving Democrats control of the House by a comfortable margin.\n\nBehn’s surprising strength is one of several indicators of a coming Democratic rebound.\n\nIn November, the party won competitive governor’s races in Virginia and New Jersey, Trump’s approval continues to drop, and 23 House Republicans have announced they will retire, compared with 16 Democrats. Trump’s tariffs, his tax cuts and spending law and his immigration crackdown all poll poorly, meaning GOP candidates will have a tough sell, and Republicans in Congress do not yet have a plan to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.\n\nIn a surprising turn, MAGA ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced she will retire at the start of the year after predicting Republicans will lose control of the House. \n\nFormer Speaker Kevin McCarthy suggested that Greene’s retirement is a warning sign.\n\nFormer Speaker Kevin McCarthy suggested that Greene’s retirement is a warning sign for the GOP.\n\n“She’s almost like a canary in the coal mine,” McCarthy told Fox News after Greene’s announcement. “This is something inside Congress, they’d better wake up, because they are going to get a lot of people retiring, and they’ve got to focus.” \n\nBoth parties are treating the special election as a major test, devoting significant resources to it.\n\nThe House Majority PAC, which concentrates on electing Democrats, announced last month $1 million in TV and digital ads to support Behn’s bid. Additionally, two Democratic groups supporting Behn have poured more than $1 million into the race, according to Federal Election Commission (or FEC) filings. That includes almost $300,000 in mailers boosting Jonathan Thorp, the independent candidate in the race, in a bid to split the conservative coalition Van Epps has worked to build.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump-aligned and Elon Musk-funded political action committee MAGA Inc. has spent almost $1.3 million in the race, according to FEC filings, the bulk of which has gone toward opposition ads against Behn. That’s on top of the $15,000 the PAC spent on a phone-banking effort in support of Van Epps last month, the first spending by the committee on any race in this term. \n\nAnd in a sign of Trump’s specific focus on this race, the president held a tele-rally for Van Epps the day after early voting began in the race. His involvement prior to the event had been limited to a Truth Social endorsement days before the Republican primary.\n\n“I am asking all America First Patriots in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, who haven’t voted yet, to please GET OUT AND VOTE for MAGA Warrior Matt Van Epps,” Trump wrote in an X post urging voters to back the Republican candidate, his first post on the platform in more than a month.\n\nIn the meantime, Democratic voters in Nashville got a visit from former Vice President Kamala Harris, who aimed to galvanize the party’s base as the unlikely but possible chance of an upset grows. Notably, Harris did not appear onstage with the candidate she urged the crowd to support.\n\nPolling places begin closing at 7 p.m. in Tennessee. Election watchers will likely call the race for the Republican not long afterward. But both parties will pore over the results for days.\n\nThis is a preview of MS NOW’s Project 47 Newsletter.

For her part, Carpenter made her thoughts about President Trump and his administration known back in 2024, a year prior to her Tuesday tweet.\n\n“Sorry about our country,” the “Man’s Best Friend” singer-songwriter told concert attendees last year, shortly after Trump defeated Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and won the 2024 presidential election. “To the women in here, I love you so so so so so much, and I really hope for the rest of this night that you can enjoy yourselves because you absolutely deserve it.”\n\nCarpenter is, notably, not the only prominent celebrity that has called out the White House this year for involving them in one of its pro-ICE social media ads. In September, comedian and podcaster Theo Von demanded that the Department of Homeland Security take down a video that reappropriated a clip of himself saying, “Heard you got deported, dude. Bye!” \n\nVon took to X shortly after the video was posted to reveal that he had not approved of the video and requested its removal from the platform. “Please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos,” Von wrote at the time. “When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are a lot more nuanced than this video allows.” Von’s request was fulfilled, as the video featuring him was eventually removed.\n\nIt remains to be seen what, if any, response the White House will have to Carpenter’s similar condemnation of its unapproved use of her music.","summary":"\"Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda,\" the \"Juno\" singer warns\n\n\nThe post Sabrina Carpenter Condemns White House&#8217;s Use of Her Music in Pro-ICE Video as &#8216;Evil and Disgusting&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/sabrina-carpenter-response-juno-song-white-house-ice-video/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2196802140.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 16:32:55","author":"Alex Welch","authors":["Alex Welch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.091},{"id":384369592,"title":"Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Reportedly Leaving U.K. After Ditching U.S. Over Trump","text":"Comedienne and former talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi are reportedly heading back to the United States from Great Britain despite claims that they abandoned the U.S. over Donald Trump’s election last year.\n\nAccording to reports, DeGeneres and de Rossi are looking to head back to California to avoid the chilly winter in Britain’s tony Cotswolds region, to which the two fled after Trump’s election win over Kamala Harris.\n\nDeGeneres has claimed that she intends to stay in the U.K. at least until Trump leaves office.

He’ll Lose, Too.","text":"Ever since the political meltdown that was 2024 for the Democrats, the dominant question has been, “Who’s next?” Who will be the next standard-bearer for the party? Not just the next presidential nominee, but the next Barack Obama or Bill Clinton. But there’s a problem with this way of thinking. The extreme leftists who have pirated the party away from the old guard aren’t particularly fans of male candidates. \n\nThe extreme left doesn't want another Bill Clinton. He’s a man, and he’s white. That’s all the radicals see, and they don’t want that. They don’t even want another Barack Obama, because believe it or not, even another Democrat leader like him would be too mainstream for the far-left base. \n\nThe far left’s political DNA these days demands they choose an out-of-step member of two or three protected classes at once; the candidate needs to check some boxes. As for a political platform, hating America is key. \n\nStill, the extreme leftists got their way with both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and we all saw how that worked out. Though an old, white man, Biden was a vegetable who served his purpose. He was as manipulable as the auto-pen scandal will likely bear out. Harris checked some boxes and at also appeared as though she would be as controllable as Biden. We’ll never know if that is true, thank God. \n\nThe Democrat base doesn't want a strong leader to guide it. It wants a weak figurehead to take guidance from the powers that be in the shadows and on the extreme left. But it also cynically wants someone who will have crossover appeal in a general election where independent and Republican votes are necessary to win.\n\nThat brings us to Mark Kelly, the senator from Arizona, who has a lot in common with another senator from the same state, John McCain. The parallels have long been obvious, but in terms of considering the 2028 presidential race, the one that matters is that both McCain and Kelly were and are perceived as cynical enough to play a role and do what’s expected of them, but above all, to respect the D.C. establishment. \n\nKelly has been proving this with his recent propaganda campaign, urging active-duty service members to disrespect the military chain of command, while paradoxically portraying himself as some moralistic patriot. \n\nIn the middle of Mark Kelly's long-winded, holier-than-thou diatribe where he acts like he's the real victim just trying to protect the country from its mean ole President, he is forced to admit...PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT ISSUED ILLEGAL ORDERS!!This guy is such a hot mess. pic.twitter.com/z4mmccr09a— Andrew Kolvet (@AndrewKolvet) December 1, 2025\n\nSome Democrats think they’ve found their John McCain. \n\nKelly has a familiar resume – military service, combat credentials, national hero status, cross-party appeal, and, prior to his most current dust-up, he at least did have an image that leaned more astronaut-engineer than Washington politician. While the extreme left hates that, everyone knows Republicans like it. So, what the leftists need are assurances and proof that Kelly will play ball with them if they were to hold their noses and rally around him. \n\nHe's trying to provide that proof right now. \n\nThe media’s next shiny object guest is Mark Kelly. Joined CNN and NBC this morning already doing his best Joy Reid imitation with the baseless charge that the Trump immigration crackdown is racist.Kelly resided over an open border in Arizona for years and did nothing. https://t.co/8pRlbXH5QS— Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) November 30, 2025\n\nKelly is also trying to prove he’s the one who can stabilize the party in the run-up to the midterms and the 2028 presidential race. \n\nThere is one thing the Democrats may be forgetting: McCain lost. Kelly will lose, too. \n\nIt’s like that modernized and paraphrased quote from Alexander Hamilton, “If you stand for everything, you stand for nothing.” \n\nIn wanting to keep Kelly on a short leash, the extreme left will get what it wants out of him. But its ties to the candidate will not be invisible, and this itself will hurt his crossover appeal as he tries to emerge as one of the senior leaders of his party. \n\nThe more pragmatic, powerful forces on the left don’t like to lose. The major donors, the billionaires who fund and control the party, are getting frustrated. Yes, they like their identity politics and ideologies, but they want more. They want power. And if it takes using another white guy to get it, they will. \n\nThe only question for them is, “Is he the guy to do it?” They want to see evidence of that crossover appeal, and they, too, want a demonstration that he’s willing to play ball with them.\n\nBeing so indebted to so many divergent power centers in your own party is a handicap. McCain saw this when he ran for president. He was a lifelong moderate Republican. He famously touted his ability to “cross the aisle,” which most conservatives read as “sellout.” And so, they stayed home on election day in large numbers. \n\nWhen McCain ran for president against the fresh face and voice of Barack Obama, the contrast couldn’t have been more stark. McCain was a Beltway animal by this point. He was a RINO poster child. This was his turn, and that’s why he was nominated. He wasn’t politically nimble, but he tried to pivot and portray himself as more conservative. He wasn’t. \n\nAs we all saw, that didn’t work out. The McCain campaign went down in flames. \n\nLooking ahead, it’s easy to see that history can repeat itself. Imagine a Mark Kelly on the debate stage with JD Vance. Kelly is strong and articulate, but he’s only as good as his communications training. He’s terrible on his feet. He can’t improvise. He’s not a wonk. But more than anything, he’s so predictable that all the media coaching in the world can't fix it any more than it curbed Kamala Harris’s word salads. \n\nVance, on the other hand, is more articulate, stronger, and better by far at delivering his message and seizing opportunities on the fly. From an optics point of view, Vance is younger, and with that, he’s got a natural irreverence for the political world's nonsensical traditions — so much so that he could easily expose Kelly for everything that he is. \n\nThe Democrats will tell themselves that Kelly is their McCain-like answer to the political polarization that’s killing them, but in the process, they will prove they’ve learned nothing. \n\nRecommended: Don’t Settle for a ‘Merry Christmas’ This Year. This is the Year of the ‘Blessed Christmas.’\n\nAmerica in 2026 and 2028 will not be looking to prop up a former astronaut, a decorated military vet, or a Democrat moderate. It will continue to want common-sense solutions to its most common problems. It will continue to want people who don’t lie to them so badly that they're expected to pretend to believe such things as men can become women. \n\nKelly will know there are certain lines he can’t cross for risk of losing his base, but he will have to know that if he doesn’t cross them, he’ll never stand a chance of winning a general election. He’ll try to balance the two against each other, and he will fail. \n\nMcCain touted himself as a “maverick,” willing to abandon his own party if he thought it was “the right thing to do.” That kind of messaging worked on some independents, but not enough. If Kelly were to try that, the net result would be that everyone would universally hate him. \n\nIn the coming two federal election cycles, America will not vote based on the biography of the candidate. In the end, Kelly’s resume, like McCain’s, won’t move the electorate. \n\nOur elections are tribal now. People will vote along hardened cultural lines, ideological identities, and deeply entrenched fears about the future. Fears that will be exacerbated by the fear-mongers in the media and on the campaign trail. \n\nFor this reason, it’s most likely that Kelly won’t even survive a Democrat primary season. His centrism will be diluted by other candidates who play much better in an identity politics arena.

Readers also sought life advice from Mel Robbins, campaign books by former Vice President Kamala Harris, among others, and the posthumous memoir from one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre.\n\nHere are 10 notable books of 2025, in no particular order.\n\n “Sunrise on the Reaping,” by Suzanne Collins \n\nSuzanne Collins once swore she was done with “The Hunger Games,” but the author has not given up on her blockbuster series and neither have her readers. “Sunrise on the Reaping,” a prequel set 24 years before the first book, sold more than 4 million copies worldwide, according to Scholastic, even as the press-shy Collins declined to promote it or give any interviews except for one with her editor, David Levithan. \n\nCollins began the series in 2008 and many fans have grown up with it. At an opening night event in February, numerous attendees were in their 20s and 30s and spoke of how their teenage appreciation had deepened for Collins' dystopian world, in which contestants hunt and kill each other — all while being broadcast live. “As a kid you focus so much on the plot and the action,” explained 26-year-old Savannah Miller. “As an adult I connected to the characters a lot more and had more of an emotional response.”\n\n “The Let Them Theory,” by Mel Robbins \n\nThe year's most talked about self-help book, Mel Robbins' “The Let Them Theory,” offered familiar and assuring messages for a troubled time: Focus on the inner self, don't try to change what you can't change. Robbins acknowledged debts to everyone from the ancient Stoics to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and the title of her opening chapter reads like a variation of the Serenity Prayer: “Stop Wasting Your Life on Things You Can't Control.” Released late last year, Robbins' blockbuster was high on bestseller lists throughout 2025 and the author appeared everywhere from “Meet the Press” to “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” Time magazine named Robbins among its top 100 creators: “She's empowered millions to stop overthinking, start exercising and ignore their inner critic.”\n\n “Flesh,” by David Szalay \n\nLiterary fiction traveled in 2025, from India to New York ( Kiran Desai's “The Loneliness of Sunny and Sonia”), from Houston to Japan (Bryan Washington's “Palaver”), from the recent past to the 22nd century ( Ian McEwan's “What We Can Know”). \n\n“Flesh,” winner of the Booker Prize, was a physical, economic and social travelogue. It's a deadpan account of a working-class, half-dead Hungarian, István, who proves equally attractive to women and disaster as life pulls him along through sexual improprieties, juvenile detention, military service in Iraq, the good life in London and back down again. Happiness beyond the fleshy kind is almost entirely absent from David Szalay's novel, but “Flesh” has a subtle, uncanny rhythm that made admirers out of everyone from Dua Lipa to Booker judge Roddy Doyle, who told reporters after the award was announced: “It is, in many ways, a dark book but it is a joy to read.”\n\n “Careless People,” by Sarah Wynn-Williams \n\nSome books make news just by existing: Anticipating an angry response from Meta, Flatiron waited until just days before publication to announce an unflattering insider take on Meta by Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former director of global public policy at was then Facebook. Wynn-Williams alleged that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had offered to accommodate the Chinese government’s demands to censor the social media platform and that Sheryl Sandberg, Joel Kaplan and other executives had enabled an abusive workplace that included sexual harassment. \n\nMeta countered that “Careless People” was a mix of “out-of-date” information and “false accusations,” and it convinced an emergency arbiter that Wynn-Williams had violated a confidentiality agreement and should be barred from promoting her book, which went on to top The New York Times' nonfiction list. A headline from Vice read: “Meta Tries to Kill Damning Tell-All Book, Accidentally Promotes It to Bestseller.”\n\n “Nobody's Girl,” by Virginia Giuffre \n\nThe very existence of “Nobody's Girl” made news, and kept on making news. Six months after the death of Virginia Giuffre, publisher Alfred A. Knopf released her posthumous “Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.” Her painful accounts of her years as a “sex slave” helped build GOP support for releasing Justice Department files on Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, and to President Donald Trump's reversing his earlier objections. Her explicit memories of one Epstein client, the former Prince Andrew, helped lead King Charles III to strip his brother of his royal title and banish him to a private residence.\n\n“Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” a statement from Buckingham Palace read at the time.\n\n “The Fate of the Day,” by Rick Atkinson \n\nThe second of Rick Atkinson's planned three-volume history of the Revolutionary War was published to wide acclaim and helped establish him as one of the foremost military scholars of his time, one given a leading voice in Ken Burns' documentary on the country's independence. With some 50 pages of source material listed, “The Fate of the Day” combines precise and bloody details of battles fought between 1777 and 1780 with vivid sketches of protagonists known and obscure. “There is no better writer of narrative history than the Pulitzer-winning Atkinson,” a New York Times review read in part.\n\n “Shadow Ticket” (and “Vineland”), by Thomas Pynchon \n\nAt age 89, Thomas Pynchon was back after a yearslong hiatus. “Shadow Ticket” was a characteristically shaggy tale of a 1930s private detective, Hicks McTaggart, whose search for a missing cheese heiress lands him everywhere from Milwaukee to Budapest. Meanwhile, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson transformed Pynchon's 1990 novel about aging radicals, “Vineland,” into one of the year's most celebrated movies, “One Battle After Another.” Anderson, who faithfully adapted Pynchon's “Inherent Vice” in 2014, is apparently one of the privileged few to be in contact with the famously private author. \n\n“Realistically, for me, ‘Vineland’ was going to be hard to adapt,” Anderson observed in the movie's press notes. “Instead, I stole the parts that really resonated with me and started putting all these ideas together. With (Pynchon’s) blessing.”\n\n “Original Sin,” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson (Reliving 2024, Part I) \n\nBooks on the winning candidate in 2024, Trump, proved less attractive to readers than accounts about the losing side. “Original Sin,” by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson, was among several notable works that looked back and wondered how it went so wrong for the Democratic Party. The Tapper-Thompson book centered on the aging of President Joe Biden, made painfully public when he debated Trump, and on the aides and family members the authors alleged were keeping his cognitive decline a secret. “The original sin of Election 2024 was Biden's decision to run for reelection — followed by aggressive efforts to hide his cognitive diminishment,” the authors concluded.\n\n “107 Days,” by Kamala Harris (Reliving 2024, Part II) \n\nThe title refers to the hurried (and unsuccessful) campaign the vice president led when she took over from Biden after he dropped out in the summer of 2024. Harris pointed fingers in many directions: at Biden's staff (“Their thinking was zero-sum: If she's shining, he's dimmed”); at herself, and her answer on “The View” that nothing “comes to mind” when asked how she would govern differently than Biden (“I had no idea that I'd just pulled the pin on a hand grenade”); and at the speed of time (“One hundred and seven days were not, in the end, long enough to accomplish the task of winning the presidency”). \n\n “Independent,” by Karine Jean-Pierre (Reliving 2024, Part III) \n\nFormer White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre gained notice simply from the title of her book, “Independent,” an early tip that she had left the Democratic Party. The subtitle promised harsher takes: “A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines.” Unlike other critics, she didn't argue that the party had become too “woke” or had stayed with Biden for too long. She objected to how Biden was treated by the press and by fellow Democrats and contended he “remained thoughtful, clearheaded, and well-informed,” however poorly he came across in his debate with Trump. “We had a major miss,” she concluded about the 2024 campaign, “and I was starting to take a hard look at my party.”","summary":"The publishing world's notable releases this year included a new “Hunger Games” novel and a book by Thomas Pynchon","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/joe-biden-virginia-giuffre-kamala-harris-charles-iii-new-york-b2876557.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/02/15/YE-Books_08961.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 15:39:59","author":"Hillel Italie","authors":["Hillel Italie"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.353},{"id":384387690,"title":"10 notable books of 2025: A posthumous memoir about Epstein, 'Hunger Games' and reliving 2024 - AP News","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — The year in publishing saw such notable releases as the latest “Hunger Games” novel and the first book in years from Thomas Pynchon.

Tim Walz’s involvement in a “massive fraud” scheme that involved Somali immigrants bilking more than $1 billion from taxpayers, they revealed Monday.House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) told The Post that his panel “will conduct a thorough investigation into Governor Walz’s failure to safeguard taxpayer dollars” as a result.“Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was warned about massive fraud in a pandemic food-aid program for children, yet he failed to act.

Four years ago, however, the media was overwhelmingly silent on the topic of presidential health when the then-oldest sitting president during his term, Joe Biden, led from the Oval Office in a health saga that has continued long after Biden dropped out of the 2024 federal election and exited 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. on Jan. 20. Media outlets and others heightened scrutiny of Trump's health earlier in 2025 when he was spotted with swollen legs in July while attending the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey, as well as other photos stretching back to February showing bruising on his hand. The media has most recently been focused on an MRI scan Trump received during a checkup at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland in October, which was described as routine by the administration, with Trump's physician reporting that Trump is in \"exceptional health.\" The checkup was Trump's second in 2025, following an April visit that Navy Capt. Sean P. Barbabella, the physician to the president, said found Trump \"remains in excellent health.\" WHITE HOUSE PROVIDES TRUMP HEALTH UPDATE AFTER MRI SCAN CONCERNS SWIRLED The White House railed against left-leaning media outlets’ recent focus on Trump’s health as \"garbage narratives,\" accusing them of having previously downplayed \"Joe Biden’s severe mental health decline\" while he was in the Oval Office. \"No one believes the failing legacy media’s disingenuous obsession about President Trump’s health because we all just watched them actively cover up Joe Biden’s severe mental health decline for the past four years,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital on Monday. \"The facts are clear: President Trump has shared several comprehensive medical updates, in the effort of total transparency, all of which show he is in excellent health. The fake news media pushing garbage narratives about President Trump’s energy levels while they get to publicly question him nearly every single day is why Americans’ trust in the media just hit a new all-time low.\" Fox News Digital took a look back at the mainstream media's coverage of Biden's health before dropping out of the 2024 presidential race at the 11th hour amid mounting concerns over his mental acuity, and the media's recent focus on Trump's health and evaluations. TRUMP'S HEALTH REPORTS Trump has railed against the media for their focus on his health that he said is cast in a negative light despite the administration releasing details to the public on Trump's check-ups. Trump, for example, slammed The New York Times in November for publishing a piece focused on him serving in the Oval Office at 79 years old while facing the \"realities of aging.\" Trump described the article as a \"hit piece\" that follows years of the media reportedly publishing \"purposely negative\" articles. Following reporters questioning White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt about details surrounding the MRI in November, Trump told the media on Sunday evening when pressed about the scan that he would release the MRI results to the public amid media scrutiny. The White House released Trump's MRI results on Monday when Leavitt read the report to the media that found Trump was in normal and good health. \"The purpose of this imaging is preventative to identify any issues early, confirm overall health, and ensure the president maintains long-term vitality and function,\" Leavitt said. \"… Overall, his cardiovascular system shows excellent health.\" TRUMP REVEALS HE HAD 'PERFECT' MRI DURING RECENT WALTER REED PHYSICAL Left-leaning and mainstream outlets have pressed the White House about Trump’s health for months, a shift that intensified after photos of his swollen legs and a bruised hand surfaced online. While Trump entered his second term as the oldest person ever inaugurated at 78, the questions did not escalate until this summer. The White House attributed the bruising to frequent handshakes and said the swelling stemmed from chronic venous insufficiency — \"a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,\" according to Leavitt. ACCUSATIONS OF BIDEN HEALTH 'COVER-UP' The media has previously come into the White House's line of fire over its heightened focus on Trump's health after Biden's presidency, which reached a crescendo in July 2024 when Biden dropped out of his re-election race at the 11th hour amid mounting concern that his mental acuity had slipped. \"I can tell you there was certainly a lack of transparency from the former president, from the entire former administration,\" Leavitt told reporters in April. \"And frankly, a lot of people in this room, when it came to the health and the competence of the former president of the United States, Joe Biden.\" The Trump administration, as well as conservative critics and liberal journalists, have repeatedly slammed the reported cover-up of Biden's declining health after a wave of political memoirs recounting the 2024 and Biden presidency, including alleging that Biden staffers were aware of and fretted about the president's mental decline, but publicly promoted him as physically and mentally fit to serve as president. Biden's mental acuity had been under conservatives' microscope since before the 2020 election. Concerns among the mainstream media, however, did not heighten until February 2024, when special counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating Biden’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as vice president, announced he would not recommend criminal charges against Biden for possessing classified materials after his vice presidency, calling Biden \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Conservatives railed that the report proved Biden's mental acuity was, in fact, on a steady decline, pointing to the president's increasingly mumbled public remarks, a high-profile fall while boarding Air Force One in 2021 and another fall while on a bike ride in Delaware in 2022. Biden has denied that he suffered a cognitive decline while in the White House, including during a May interview on \"The View,\" when he said new books detailing an alleged mental decline were \"wrong.\" The media did grill then-White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in June 2023 over Biden's repeated public falls, including when he fell during the Air Force Academy's graduation ceremony in Colorado and stumbling on a flight of steps in Japan that year. But it wasn't until 2024 that the White House press corps repeatedly pressed the administration on the president's health. TRUMP DECLARED IN 'EXCELLENT OVERALL HEALTH' BY DOCTOR AFTER WALTER REED VISIT The final year of Biden's presidency included a handful of public gaffes and missteps, including former President Barack Obama seen taking Biden’s wrist to seemingly lead him offstage at a fundraiser in Los Angeles in June 2024 and another viral video showing the then-president standing relatively motionless during a Juneteenth concert event at the White House. The Biden White House brushed off concern surrounding the videos by describing the footage as \"cheap fakes,\" which the administration described as real videos that are cropped or edited in an allegedly deceptive manner. 2024 DEBATE PERFORMANCE OPENS FLOODGATES TO BIDEN HEALTH COVERAGE Concern over Biden's mental acuity hit a fever pitch in June 2024 after he took the debate stage to face off against Trump in the election cycle. Biden's debate performance was seen as a failure, with traditional allies soon joining conservatives in their concern over the president's health in the context of encouraging Biden to pass the mantle to a younger generation of U.S. leaders. \"Is anyone in the White House hiding information about the president’s health or his ability to do the job day to day?\" a journalist asked Jean-Pierre during the first press briefing after the disastrous debate. Another said: \"You’ve said a couple of times now that the White House has provided thorough medical records for the president. The White House released a six-page summary back in February. I don’t think that was a full accounting, necessarily. And Dr. O’Connor, in that memo, described the president as quote, ‘a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.’ \"I think that is clearly not what the majority of Americans are seeing,\" the reporter added. While yet another pressed: \"Why not release more about his medical — his physical and mental health? Why not?\" The 46th president ultimately dropped out of the race at the end of July 2024, giving his successor for the nomination, former Vice President Kamala Harris, just over 100 days to rally support. Concern over Biden's health has carried into the Trump administration, with the Biden team announcing in May that the former president was undergoing treatment for advanced prostate cancer that had not been detected when he was in the Oval Office. In addition, Trump has railed against his predecessor's use of an autopen to sign official presidential documents, including executive orders and pardons, and announced he would terminate all documents signed by the autopen. The lack of media coverage over Biden's health was underscored during the White House Correspondents' Dinner in April, when an Axios reporter who authored a book on Biden's health decline ripped the Biden administration and his media colleagues for a \"cover-up.\" AXIOS REPORTER HITS MEDIA FOR WHIFFING ON COVERAGE OF BIDEN’S DECLINE AT WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS’ DINNER \"President Biden’s decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,\" Alex Thompson, Axios reporter and co-author of \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" said during the dinner. \"But being truth tellers also means telling the truth about ourselves.

The assassin came from a civilization built on the Koran. You can see the difference with your own eyes.\n\nWe cannot keep bringing in people from Islamist cultures and expect a good outcome. Unless you are a leftist for whom the “good outcome” is to rip America out of the rich soil of its biblically based culture. \n\nIn the days that followed Beckstrom’s murder, establishment media reported that the assassin was depressed and neighbors were worried he might commit suicide. He felt alienated. One headline said he was “deranged.” Notice how precise it is. I guarantee his attorney will plead not guilty by reason of insanity when the assassin goes on trial.\n\nDid his mental illness cause him to yell “Allahu akbar” as he opened fire on our National Guardsmen? No. That was a declaration of jihad—a statement of his faith. But nobody in our establishment will ever say that his Islamic faith was butting up against the values of America and he was furious about it.\n\nTrump Responds\n\nPresident Trump responded decisively to this terrorist attack in our nation’s capital. He ordered all asylum claims to be suspended pending security reviews. All immigration requests from Afghan nationals have been suspended, as have visa applications for anyone traveling on an Afghan passport.\n\nThe president also announced his intention to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. [immigration] system to fully recover.”\n\nIn addition, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has ordered “a comprehensive review and a re-interview of all refugees admitted from January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.”\n\nDemocrats and some of the GOP establishment are going crazy because President Trump is putting the safety of American citizens first and putting some desperately needed common sense in our immigration system.\n\nLike the U.S., Great Britain took in thousands of Afghans. But the British government secretly got a court order to prevent British media from reporting on how many Afghans were being brought in. That gag order was only recently struck down.\n\nBut this was an important public policy issue British voters deserved to know about, as Afghan migrants are “over 20 times more likely to be convicted of sexual offenses than British citizens.”\n\nIt should be more and more obvious that in today’s world “diversity” is not “our strength.” For Western nations, it is a death sentence. Worshipping at the altar of diversity and using it to justify the mass migration of Third World people to your country is a death sentence.\n\nThe Walz Example\n\nAmericans everywhere have been shocked by the recent disclosures of massive fraud being committed in Minnesota by certain immigrant populations, particularly Somali migrants. Governor Tim Walz claims he was clueless and had no idea that his state was being robbed blind. Millions of dollars ended up in the hands of overseas terrorist organizations.\n\nWell, more than 400 career employees at the Minnesota Department of Health and Human Services signed a public letter saying they repeatedly warned the governor about the corruption that was growing in the Somali community. They begged him to work with them to stop it.\n\nBut instead of stopping the fraud, Walz enabled it. He punished whistleblowers and handcuffed state auditors.\n\nMinneapolis’s Somalis learned how to play the “progressive” game. Whenever they were challenged, they immediately played the race card. They threatened government agencies, saying, “If we don’t get these grants, we’re going to accuse you of racism.”\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar repeated the charge when asked about Somali fraud accusations, saying it was “xenophobic and racist” to even raise the issue. \n\nThat’s the same strategy Pakistanis used to groom young girls in Great Britain. They told local police, “If you arrest us, we’ll tell the country you’re racist.” Sadly, because of the oppressive power of woke ideology in Great Britain, it worked.\n\nGov. Walz was almost a heartbeat away from the presidency, but Big Media never bothered to do a “deep dive” into the corruption of “Little Mogadishu” under Walz’s administration.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/123193-deadly-demonization-2025-12-02","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 14:28:53","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":384305482,"title":"Trump lashes out at opponents in bizarre late-night Truth Social binge","text":"Donald Trump engaged in an extensive posting spree on Truth Social late Monday night, reposting approximately 150 items over five hours, and resumed posting early Tuesday morning. \n\nHis posts covered a wide array of topics, including compliments for Melania Trump, conspiracy theories targeting Democratic Rep.

Chief among them is the “pick one” plurality voting system – also called winner-take-all – used to elect nearly all of the 520,000 government officials in the United States. \n\nIn this system, voters select one candidate, and the candidate who receives the highest number of votes wins.\n\nPlurality voting is notorious for producing winners without majority support in races that have more than two candidates. It can also create spoilers, or losing candidates whose presence in a race alters the outcome, as Ralph Nader’s did in the 2000 presidential election. And it can result in vote-splitting, where similar candidates divide support, paving the way for a less popular winner. This happened in the 2016 Republican primaries when Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich split the anti-Donald Trump vote. \n\nPlurality can also encourage dishonest voting. That happens when voters are pressured to abandon their favorite candidate for one they like less but think can win. In the 2024 elections, for example, voters whose preference for president was Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, might have instead cast their vote for Democrat Kamala Harris. \n\nAn increasingly well-known alternative to plurality voting is ranked choice voting. It’s used statewide in Maine and Alaska and in dozens of municipalities, including New York City. \n\nBetter performance\n\nWhereas plurality voting allows voters to select only one candidate, ranked choice lets them rank candidates. If a candidate secures a majority of first-place rankings, they are the winner just like they would be under plurality. \n\nBut the two systems diverge when there is no majority winner. Plurality simply chooses the candidates with the most first-place votes, while ranked choice voting eliminates the person with the fewest first-place votes and transfers their votes to the next candidate on each ballot. The process is repeated until there is a majority winner. \n\nRanked choice voting makes use of more information from the voters than plurality, but does it avoid some of the problems plurality suffers from? \n\nWe are a team of mathematicians who recently concluded a study aimed at answering this and related questions. We analyzed some 2,000 ranked choice elections from the U.S., Australia and Scotland. We supplemented those real-world results with 60 million simulated elections. \n\nThe results were clear: Ranked choice voting performed much better across all the measures we tested, including spoiler, vote-splitting, strength of candidates and strategic voting.\n\nEmpowering voters\n\nPlurality voting produced a spoiler up to 15 times more often than ranked choice voting. And it was 50% more likely to elect an extreme candidate. Plurality, furthermore, was highly susceptible to vote-splitting, while ranked choice voting was nearly impervious to it. \n\nRanked choice voting picked strong candidates up to 18 times more frequently than plurality voting, where by “strong” we mean candidates who received many first-place votes and also had broad support, even among their noncore supporters. This method also rarely elects a weak or fringe candidate and typically elects a candidate near the electorate’s ideological center.\n\nRanked choice voting is also more resistant to various forms of strategic behavior such as bullet voting, where voters choose only one candidate despite the ability to rank more, and burying, where voters disingenuously rank an alternative candidate lower in the hopes of defeating them.\n\nOur research also studied the ways in which election systems can influence behavior. In a plurality election, voters are afraid that their ballot could be “wasted” on a candidate who doesn’t have a shot at winning, or that they might contribute to a spoiler. Our study shows that ranked choice voting largely avoids these pitfalls, empowering voters to express their true preferences rather than being strategic. \n\nWe found that candidates in ranked choice voting elections do best when they adopt the policies the greatest number of people support, meeting the voters where they are. \n\nIn Alaska’s 2022 special U.S. House election, for example, Democrat Mary Peltola positioned herself firmly within Alaska’s center-left base – while still embracing some positions considered conservative outside of Alaska. She won by garnering enough second-place votes from supporters of Republican Nick Begich. \n\nAnd in the New York mayoral primary in June 2025, Zohran Mamdani won by creating a coalition with another progressive candidate, Brad Lander, and occupying a progressive space representing a range of voters. \n\nThe Alaska and New York examples highlight some differences with plurality voting, which often favors appealing to a narrow base without the necessity of reaching out beyond it. \n\nMending a broken system\n\nA mathematically interesting feature of Alaska’s 2022 special U.S. House election is that Begich beat both Peltola and Republican Sarah Palin in head-to-head contests – meaning that more people ranked Begich above Peltola than the other way around – but lost the ranked choice voting election to Peltola. \n\nCritics seize on such cases as reasons to avoid ranked choice voting. But our work shows that these are statistical outliers, occurring fewer than 1% of the time. \n\nOverall, our research shows that ranked choice voting elects candidates with broader support and greater democratic legitimacy than plurality. It therefore seems sensible that voting reform advocates continue to pursue this method as an alternative to plurality voting.\n\nAt a time when Americans are losing faith in democracy, voters cannot afford systems that hand victory to unrepresentative candidates and force them to play tactical games. The math is in, and the evidence is overwhelming: Plurality voting is broken. Ranked choice voting will not solve every democratic ailment, but it is a good step toward mending them.","summary":"Ranked choice voting largely avoids the pitfalls of plurality voting, giving voters the power to express their true candidate preferences rather than being strategic.","url":"https://theconversation.com/ranked-choice-voting-outperforms-the-winner-take-all-system-used-to-elect-nearly-every-us-politician-267515","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/704271/original/file-20251124-56-u4vayr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C146%2C4649%2C2324&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 13:35:17","author":"Director of Institute for Mathematics and Democracy,Ismar Volić,Professor of Mathematics,Wellesley College; Andy Schultz,Wellesley College; David McCune,William Jewel College","authors":["Director of Institute for Mathematics and Democracy","Ismar Volić","Professor of Mathematics","Wellesley College; Andy Schultz","Wellesley College; David McCune","William Jewel College"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.335},{"id":384271658,"title":"Trump’s wild midnight Truth Social posting binge features over 100 messages ranging from treason to beautiful Melania","text":"President Donald Trump was on Truth Social late Monday night, reposting a wide range of online content, from compliments about the first lady to conspiracy theories about Democratic Rep.

DEM HOUSE HOPEFUL GETTING YANKED FROM GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DURING ATTEMPTED SIT-IN GOES VIRAL AHEAD OF ELECTION Behn also dodged questions about whether she disagreed with any of 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' policies. \"Honestly, haven‘t thought about it. I‘ve got 24 hours to — I don‘t mean to be flippant, but I have 24 hours to win this race. And, all I‘ve been thinking about is talking to every last voter possible, at the doors and trying to make my case as to why I am the best candidate,\" she said. \"But there's no policy that you would identify that again, the party's presidential nominee held, that you do not agree with?\" Hunt asked again. Behn insisted she was focusing on lowering costs for the people of Tennessee. After the interview, Hunt told her CNN panel that she was \"surprised\" Behn couldn't name a point of disagreement with Harris, who lost Tennessee to President Donald Trump by nearly 30 points. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Behn made headlines for criticizing Nashville, which is part of the district she hopes to represent, in a 2020 podcast that resurfaced days before the Dec. 2 special election. \"I hate the city, I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music, I hate all of the things that make Nashville apparently an 'it' city to the rest of the country. But I hate it,\" she said in the podcast. Trump won the district comfortably in the 2024 election, and Democrats are hoping an upset victory or at least a close loss by Behn would give them further political momentum going into 2026.","summary":"Tennessee Democrat Aftyn Behn avoided direct answers on police funding and whether she disagree with any of Kamala Harris&apos; policies during a CNN interview ahead of her congressional race.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/aftyn-behn-dodges-questions-police-funding-policy-disagreements-kamala-harris","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/aftyn-behn-cnn-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 13:12:58","author":"Hanna Panreck","authors":["Hanna Panreck"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":384263016,"title":"Tennessee voters make final call in House special election testing Trump’s power","text":"By JONATHAN MATTISE, Associated Press\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.

The targeted schools must notify students that their certification is in jeopardy. Another 4,500 schools are being warned they may face similar action.Schools that lose certification will no longer be able to issue the certificates showing a driver completed training that’s required to get a license, so students are likely to abandon those schools. It’s not clear how many of those schools have been actively teaching students.\n\nThe problem is ongoing, widespread, and serious.

On October 24, three people were killed in Ontario, California, when Jashanpreet Singh crashed into them while driving under the influence. California had issued Singh a CDL.

It's Election Day in Tennessee after two pricey campaigns garnered some big political cameos. And, the Watergate scandal gets the MAGA treatment. Here's what to know today. Ukraine warns issues remain as U.S. team arrives in Russia President Donald Trump said there's a \"good chance\" for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine as his negotiators head to the Kremlin today, although officials in Kyiv have said key details still need to be ironed out. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is set to meet with President Vladimir Putin today, the Kremlin said, after what U.S. officials described as \"very productive\" talks with Ukraine. He is expected to lay out for Putin a version of the peace plan that has been agreed with Kyiv, hoping the Russian leader will compromise on his hardline demands. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was rallying European support in Paris, though he cautioned that some \"tough issues\" still have to be worked out with Washington. It could be a pivotal week for diplomacy, said Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign affairs chief. “It is clear that Russia does not want peace, and therefore we need to make Ukraine as strong as possible in order then to be ready to stand up for themselves in this very, very difficult time,” Kallas told reporters Monday. Putin signaled last week that he was ready to have a \"serious\" conversation after Kyiv and its allies demanded changes to the peace plan, but he has shown little sign of stepping away from hard-line demands that formed the basis of the original 28-point proposal backed by Trump.

White House confirms a second strike was ordered on an alleged drug boat The White House confirmed the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September. The follow-up attack killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts said that the second attack could constitute a war crime. The confirmation comes amid widespread criticism and bipartisan investigations in the House and Senate into the second strike on the same boat. The leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee — chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I. — said in a statement that they will be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said they were taking \"seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\" Read the full story. What to know about Tennessee's expensive special election Today's special election for the district west of Nashville has turned into a more contested campaign than some predicted. National party figures and big money have been pouring into parts of Nashville and the counties to the south and west that make up the 7th Congressional District, which was represented by Rep. Mark Green until the Republican resigned earlier this year. Trump, who won the district by 22 points in 2024, joined GOP nominee Matt Van Epps for a tele-rally, while former Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin have canvassed with the Democrat, state Rep. Aftyn Behn. And the ad war between Van Epps and Behn has gotten more heated by the day, with about $6 million in candidate and super PAC spending, according to AdImpact. Though the district leans heavily Republican, Democrats see a confluence of factors turning this race more competitive than usual, as the GOP faces a number of challenges. Trump's approval rating has declined throughout the first year of his second term, while Democrats are energized after election wins last month. Read the full story.

Staff Pick: Water(gate) under the bridge The Watergate scandal is a defining moment in U.S. history, presidential corruption and accountability. It prompted a series of government transparency reforms and influenced generations of journalists. It became a shorthand comparison for political scandal and lent the omnipresent \"-gate\" suffix to many that followed. But those lessons are now being flipped by some of the most influential right-wing figures, including people known to have Trump's ear, who insist that Watergate was actually an underhanded scheme by the \"deep state\" and the press to take down a popular Republican president.

Unfortunately, pro-abortion advocates have spent decades determining what “choice” women should want — while attacking pregnancy resource centers that offer women what they need. \n\nFor the past three decades, it has been my privilege to serve as a volunteer and board member at Aid for Women, a network of pregnancy centers and maternity homes in Illinois. The success of pregnancy resource centers like ours in offering women genuine support and resources has made us targets for pro-abortion smear campaigns, lawfare, and even physical attack.\n\nPro-abortion activists don’t seem to care if women, children, and families are cut off from the support they need.\n\nOn Dec. 2, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case that perfectly encapsulates the targeting and harassment organizations like ours have suffered for years.\n\nThe case, First Choice Women’s Resource Centers v. Platkin, will determine whether the New Jersey attorney general can arbitrarily demand private donor lists and other confidential information from First Choice Women’s Resource Center without cause.\n\nIt’s critical that the Supreme Court rule favorably toward First Choice Women’s Resource Centers and send a warning to those targeting pro-life work nationwide.\n\nPro-abortion attacks on pregnancy resource centers have escalated in recent years.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, pro-abortion radicals unleashed a summer of rage that included physical violence on nearly 100 pregnancy resource centers nationwide. These attacks were shocking to those of us stepping up to meet the need post-Dobbs, especially after fresh polling revealed that 60% of post-abortive women said they would have preferred to parent if they had more resources and support.\n\nWe were baffled why anyone would want to cut off support networks for women, many of whom clearly wanted to choose life, at a time when increased limits on abortion made our work more essential than ever. Even in blue states that do not have a single restriction on abortion, pro-abortion politicians have striven to strangle our support networks and shut us down.\n\nThose of us at Aid for Women felt each of these attacks personally. Even still, we had no idea that we would soon experience pro-abortion “rage” firsthand.\n\nThis past August, our center staff served countless babies and moms, oblivious to the Democratic National Convention that was being held in our state.\n\nAt that convention, former Vice President Kamala Harris’ Democrat nomination acceptance speech fearmongered about President Trump’s abortion agenda, alleging that Trump and his allies would endanger women and their rights.\n\nJust hours later, one of Aid for Women's Chicago pregnancy centers was badly vandalized, with doors cemented shut and red paint thrown on the windows, graffiti reading, \"Fake Clinic! The dead babies are in Gaza.\" The political vitriol from the DNC undoubtedly inspired the physical attack on our center.\n\nUnfortunately, the vandals only succeeded in hurting the very women they claim to champion.\n\nThe following day, a dozen pregnant mothers who had booked prenatal appointments at Aid for Women were unable to be seen by the organization’s physician and nurse practitioners due to the vandalism. Dozens more could not visit to pick up the diapers, formula, infant and maternity clothing, and household supplies that Aid for Women provides — all free of charge and all without any government assistance. Every service and item given to pregnant women is provided through the generosity of donors.\n\nRELATED: The FDA’s deadly betrayal of pro-life America\n\n STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhat those attacking our center failed to realize is that many of our clients live below or just skimming the poverty line. Some have housing insecurity. And their inability to access our center for the care that they needed likely affected them dramatically.\n\nUnfortunately, pro-abortion activists don’t seem to care if women, children, and families are cut off from the support they need.\n\nAs we approach oral arguments in First Choice Women’s Resource Center, Inc. v. Platkin, the attacks on centers like ours serve as a powerful reminder that those offering alternatives to abortion have become punching bags of abortion extremists that will do anything to stop lifesaving work and promote abortion.\n\nFor example, the New Jersey attorney general is alleged to have singled out First Choice Women’s Resource Center because of its pro-life and Christian views. New Jersey officials allegedly have spent months harassing First Choice with crippling administrative requirements, threatening legal sanctions if the organization refused to produce private donor records and other private information — all of which is confidential to protect those involved from the very real threat of pro-abortion retribution.\n\nCompounding this injustice was the shocking truth that New Jersey officials did not have a just cause for this burdensome lawfare and still have not submitted any evidence of wrongdoing by First Choice or any of its associates.\n\nDespite this, donors and volunteers engaging in charitable work face the possibility of intimidation and retribution for putting their money — and their time — where their mouths are.\n\nIt’s critical that the Supreme Court end this unfair lawfare against First Choice and draw a line to stop pro-abortion attacks on pregnancy resource centers once and for all.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/align/leftist-war-on-pro-life-pregnancy-centers-faces-supreme-court-reckoning","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/leftist-war-on-pro-life-pregnancy-centers-faces-supreme-court-reckoning.jpg?id=62261260&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 12:00:00","author":"Mary Fiorito","authors":["Mary Fiorito"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":384263424,"title":"Rev. Jesse Jackson's message of hope remains an inspiration","text":"News of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s health struggles has stirred many. It has me praying. And it has me remembering the hard lessons he taught, shaped in the trenches of our people’s ongoing fight for freedom.\n\nLook around the world, and it is easy to find charismatic voices rising amid liberation movements. Black America has been blessed with such figures across generations — perhaps because we have been cursed with a freedom struggle that never really ends.\n\nThrough all that pain and hope, for nearly half a century, our most consequential and transformative leader has been the Rev. Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr.\n\nSome dismiss his leadership as style over substance. “Keep Hope Alive!” they say. Sometimes with reverence. Sometimes half-mockingly. When I hear that latter tone, I’m reminded how privileged a life one must lead to think hope is just a slogan and not sacred labor.\n\nThey don’t understand the discipline it takes to help a people — or a nation — maintain hope in the face of adversity.\n\nLast summer, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Jackson invited me to join him and his family in their box. I sat beside my old mentor and friend, holding his hand as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the nomination for president.\n\nThe symbolism of the location for the night was unmistakable. We were in the city that sent Barack Obama to the White House. But we were also in the city that decades before empowered Jackson to show America the question was no longer whether it would elect a Black president but when.\n\nHe demonstrated that truth not only through his presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988 — campaigns that broke ceilings and forged coalitions but through the generations of leaders he encouraged and inspired.\n\nThe year after his last presidential run, Virginia elected its first Black governor, L. Douglas Wilder. New York elected its first Black mayor, David Dinkins. Both publicly named Jackson as someone who helped make their possibilities real.\n\nAnd just this past January, at Chicago’s Martin Luther King Day celebration, Jackson’s impact was visible from City Hall to the state Capitol — a reminder that his legacy is not nostalgia, but political infrastructure.\n\nA decade earlier, I was one of the few Black partners at any Silicon Valley venture-capital firm. I was told there had only been 36 Black men to hold such positions in the history of the Valley.\n\nThen Jackson showed up. He stood before the boards of some of the largest technology companies in the world and told them plainly they needed to open their doors — not because it was charity, but because it was smart business.\n\nFirms that had never once hired African American investors began doing so soon after. I asked one top executive if Jackson’s public and private confrontations of their leaders had influenced that shift. He didn’t hesitate: “He’s right. We need to change.”\n\nThat’s the core of Jackson’s leadership — not just breaking barriers himself, but inspiring others to do so. He helped ordinary people see themselves as leaders and compelled those with resources to recognize their responsibility.\n\nIn doing so, he became a beacon of hope and taught others to be beacons themselves.\n\nHe continues to model that courageous hope even now. His leadership lessons still empower others to help transform our world for the better.\n\nIn 2010, Jackson and I led a delegation of African American leaders to Senegal to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence. Nearly every head of state on the continent was present, including some notorious for human rights abuses.\n\nI froze, unsure how to engage them. Jackson did not. He walked forward, shaking their hands and hugging each with warmth.\n\nLater I pulled him aside. “I don’t see how I can do that,” I told him.\n\nHe looked me in the eye. “Someday somebody’s parent or wife will call me,” he said. “A soldier. A missionary. A businessperson. And they will want help getting his or her loved one free. How will I be able to convince that president to free them if he doesn’t know that I love and respect him as my brother?”\n\nIt was a lesson in diplomacy that changed everything for me. But it was more than diplomacy. It was a Christian pastor living out Jesus’s commandment to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\nThis wasn’t sentimentality. It was strategy. Integrity. Faith turned into action.\n\nI stepped back into that room and greeted every leader there without judgment, without reservation. Not because each had earned it, but because transformation requires it.\n\nBecause hope demands it. Because, as Jackson taught, the work is helping each other become our best and never giving up on the faith that each of us can do better tomorrow than we did yesterday.\n\nAs Jackson fights to regain his strength in Chicago, his lesson stands: hope is not a feeling you wait for. It is a discipline you practice.\n\nAnd he is still teaching us — by living it — that no matter how dark the moment may be, we must keep hope alive by continuing to fight for a better day.\n\nBen Jealous is a professor of practice at the University of Pennsylvania and former national president and CEO of the NAACP.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2025/12/02/rev-jesse-jacksons-keep-hope-alive-chicago-civil-rights-ben-jealous","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7fedfda/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6122x4083+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc5%2F87%2Fed9fea824522bef03dffe342834c%2Fnokin","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 12:00:00","author":"Ben Jealous","authors":["Ben Jealous"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.274},{"id":384280344,"title":"The Supreme Court Can End New Jersey’s War on Pregnancy Resource Centers","text":"The Left is attacking pregnancy centers again. Today the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case of First Choice Women’s Resource Centers v. Platkin. First Choice is a network of pregnancy resource centers (PRCs) serving vulnerable pregnant women in New Jersey.\n\nMatthew Platkin is New Jersey’s attorney general, and he is trying to make life hell for PRCs in his state. How? By launching a series of politically targeted lawsuits with the goal of donor doxing and death by paperwork. \n\nPlatkin has targeted First Choice on the basis of its religious and pro-life views by issuing the organization a burdensome subpoena seeking confidential donor and client information. It’s good old-fashioned lawfare.\n\nI say the Left is attacking PRCs again, but it’s never really stopped. The last time PRCs had their day at the Supreme Court it was because Democrats, led by then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris, tried to force the pro-life centers to advertise and refer for abortion, a violation of their free speech and, in many cases, religious beliefs. Thankfully, the Supreme Court agreed with the PRCs.\n\nSince then, the Left has only turned up the pressure on PRCs through rhetorical attacks, legal harassment, and outright vandalism and violence. Why?\n\nBecause pregnancy resource centers are unquestionably an increasingly important—and arguably essential—part of a post-Dobbs world that shifted the legal landscape around abortion. Yet the stubborn realities of crisis pregnancy have not. Pregnancy resource centers exist not only to meet the immediate needs of those women, but also to help those who want to be moms thrive in that role. This perpetually vexes the Left’s pro-choice idealogues.\n\nWhat Pregnancy Resource Centers Do\n\nPregnancy resource centers first stabilize an almost always unstable situation. They meet the immediate health and material needs of pregnant moms in crisis. For some, that means baby supplies (diapers and formula). In just one year, PRCs nationwide served an estimated 1.85 million people, providing 2 million baby outfits, 1.3 million packages of diapers, 19,000 strollers, and more than 30,000 car seats. In New Jersey, where Platkin is on the hunt, PRCs served more than 23,000 men, women, and children with 8,713 pregnancy tests, 6,872 ultrasounds performed by licensed medical professionals, 9025 packs of diapers, 75,472 baby outfits, and 1,658 cans of formula.\n\nFor others, that help takes the form of housing. A woman named Monica found such help when fleeing domestic violence and homelessness while pregnant. Aid for Women pregnancy center’s maternity home, Heather’s House, took her in immediately and stayed with her for the course of her pregnancy and after she had a baby boy. The center’s staff even babysat while Monica took ESL classes.\n\n“I can’t even begin to express how much Aid for Women has impacted my life. I was able to work on establishing a life for me and my son,” she said in an interview. “Everything in my life has been touched by Aid for Women and their support of me, not just having a place to live, but real support of me as a woman and as a person, has changed the direction both of our lives could have gone.”\n\nHelping mothers establish a life is what PRCs specialize in. An estimated 1 in 4 women report their abortion as “unwanted or coerced,” 60% of post-abortive women say they would have preferred to have their baby if they had more emotional or financial support. One study found that 61% of women reported “high levels of pressure” to have abortions. PRCs provide women the support they need to not only make a true choice, but also to thrive as mothers.\n\nMany offer career counseling, life coaching and parenting classes. One PRC so empowered Claire Anctil-Cathey that the former client went on to establish one herself. She said her pregnancy was like “being in total darkness” until she sought help at a PRC. It was like “being led into the light by people who just stepped in and cared for me and provided me the support that I needed one step at a time to get to a place where I was on my feet.”\n\n“No one’s ever looked at them and said, ‘Well, you can do this, and we can help you,’” Claire says of her center’s clients. “Our main goal is to provide these women with the same sort of support that they would have from a loving, healthy family.”\n\nThis is what New Jersey’s attorney general and the Left want to shut down. So far, it isn’t working. The number of PRCs increased by 35% over a decade, and they now outnumber abortion clinics by a 3-to-1 ratio. Small wonder that 70% of those polled said PRCs should receive public funding.\n\nThey have become an essential part of a new, genuinely pro-mother era. The Supreme Court should shield them from ideological attacks aimed at shuttering them. \n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Gavin Newsom and I don’t have much in common politically. He’s the Democratic governor of California; I work for a think tank in Utah that supports limited government. Newsom opposes school choice and issued a moratorium on some new charter schools in California. I’m a former public school principal who has become a school choice advocate, and I support alternatives like charter schools.\n\nOn one thing, Newsom and I agree — criminalizing chronically absent students and their families is a bad idea.\n\nThe attendance crisis in schools is real. Nearly one in four students nationwide is chronically absent. Absences put pressure on students, who fall behind, and on teachers, who are left to fill the gaps.\n\nSome lawmakers believe that solving chronic absenteeism, also known as truancy, can be achieved through courtrooms and criminal codes. They say that if parents are threatened with fines or jail, students will start showing up.\n\nIt sounds harsh. It’s also wrong. Punitive truancy laws don’t address the real reasons kids miss school. Instead, these laws turn frustration with a complex problem into a blunt legal hammer.\n\nAs a public school principal, I was always concerned about chronic absenteeism. I spent many hours with parents and students trying to understand why school wasn’t working for them.\n\nSome teachers wanted me to turn to the courts. But legal action never fixed the problem. It was simply a way to hand off a problem schools didn’t feel equipped to solve. The sentiment was understandable. The solution was not.\n\nTruancy isn’t a politically partisan issue. Timmy Truett, a Republican representative in Kentucky, and Kamala Harris, the former Democratic vice president, senator and attorney general from California, both pushed for stricter truancy penalties.\n\nIn Kentucky, a 2024 law requiring court referrals for truant students led to a surge of families pulling their children out of public schools to homeschool, rather than face legal consequences.\n\nAnd in California, Harris’ policy of arresting and charging parents with misdemeanors produced equally troubling results. One California mother was arrested after her daughter, who has sickle-cell anemia, missed school due to hospitalizations.\n\nHarris, while running for president, said she regrets criminalizing truancy in California. And Newsom in early October signed a bill ending California’s policy of punishing parents with a fine or a year in jail for their children’s chronic truancy.\n\nTruancy laws all share a fatal flaw: they ignore why students are absent in the first place.\n\nHealth struggles, bullying, economic hardship, and weak school connections are often the real barriers. Threatening parents does nothing to resolve them. It only deepens the divide between families and schools.\n\nBeneath the statistics lives an uncomfortable truth that few want to say aloud: Public schools do not work well for every student.\n\nSome face unsafe or hostile environments. Others encounter ideological conflicts or simply feel lost in the system. Families often disengage because their schools aren’t meeting their needs.\n\nThere is a better solution. Schools must shift from punishment to prevention. Over the past 15 years, many states have made tremendous strides towards this goal.\n\nIowa built a data system to catch absentee patterns early. Georgia required attendance teams and school climate committees. These efforts share one trait — they treat absenteeism as a problem to solve with families, not a crime to prosecute against them.\n\nSchools that intervene early see results by building trust and addressing practical obstacles, such as transportation, bullying, health and engagement issues. These strategies rarely make headlines, but they work.\n\nLawmakers should follow these examples. Address safety and climate concerns directly. Help schools build stronger relationships with families. And expand educational options for those who are not thriving in traditional settings.\n\nAttendance improves when families trust their schools, not when they fear them.\n\nJon England is the education policy analyst at Libertas Institute, a Utah-based free-market think tank.","summary":"Laws criminalizing absenteeism all share a fatal flaw: they ignore why students are absent in the first place.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/02/opinion-california-schools-can-stop-truancy-without-arresting-parents/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021125-ICE-Schools-Salinas-LV_27.webp?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 11:45:57","author":"Jon England","authors":["Jon England"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.566},{"id":384249616,"title":"The shocking numbers behind Trump's massive collapse with independent voters: New pol","text":"President Donald Trump just hit a new low in his approval rating among independents, a new poll showed. \n\nThe latest Gallup poll, released Friday, showed Trump had just a 25% approval rating among independents.

The district isn’t typically viewed as competitive—Trump carried it by about 22 points last November. But Democrats are hopeful that Behn could flip the seat, as the party has performed well in special elections this year, and recent polls show a close race.\n\nThe race has drawn national attention, including from both Trump and Harris, who returned to the campaign trail for the first time since last year to urge Democrats to vote in the special election. A Behn victory would deal a major blow to Trump and a victory to Harris, who has been speculated to be a potential 2028 presidential candidate.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nTurnout will be key to victory in the Tennessee special election. The district comprises parts of Nashville, Clarksville, and rural and suburban areas in central Tennessee. Democrats are hopeful that high turnout in Nashville will carry Behn across the finish line. But if turnout is higher in the more conservative areas, Republicans will be favored.\n\nHarris and Trump have both been involved in the race.\n\nHarris has not formally endorsed Behn but attended a canvassing event for Democrats in Nashville last month, urging her party to vote in the election, reported The New York Times. Harris spoke earlier that day at Fisk University, a historically Black college. While Harris was unable to defeat Trump last November, a candidate for whom Harris attended a canvassing event defeating a Trump-backed candidate in a conservative district could be a major loss for Republicans.\n\nDemocratic state legislator Aftyn Behn speaks during a campaign event in Nashville, Tennessee, on November 13, 2025.\n\n“This election is 14 days from today,” Harris said at the canvassing event, per The Times.\n\nBehn also appeared at the event and emphasized the race as the “most competitive” in the country. Her campaign told The Nashville Banner, when asked why Harris did not endorse Behn by name, that her campaign “did not organize the event.”\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has waded in on the race, backing Van Epps. In a Truth Social post on Sunday, he urged Republicans to “GET OUT AND VOTE” for him.\n\n“Do not take this Race for granted. The Radical Left Democrats are spending a fortune to beat one of the best Candidates we’ve ever had, Matt Van Epps! You can win this Election for Matt. GET OUT AND VOTE FOR MATT VAN EPPS, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement — HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!” Trump wrote.\n\nA Behn victory could be a “boost” for Harris, John Geer, Vanderbilt Poll co-director and professor of political science, told Newsweek.\n\n“I think it would be a boost for her for sure, but really, this election—it would be a serious setback for both for Trump,” he said.\n\nIt would also be a “setback” for House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, as it would shrink the GOP’s already thin majority in the House of Representatives, he said.\n\nHarris’ decision to attend the canvassing event “speaks to the fact that this race is closer than people thought,” he said.\n\nHowever, Kent Syler, a professor of political science at Middle Tennessee State University, said a Behn victory may have more limited implications for Harris.\n\n“I’m sure the Behn campaign was honored to get the former vice president’s endorsement,” he said. “But in all honesty, this election is about one person, and that’s President Donald Trump.”\n\nMidterms are referendums on the sitting president, he said. If Democrats make this a close race, it would be viewed as a sign of chilling approval toward the president ahead of the midterms, when Democrats are hoping to retake control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nIf Behn breaks the mid-40s in terms of her share of the votes, it would suggest a continuation of the trend of Democratic overperformances, Syler said. That would add to the list of strong performances they could use to recruit strong candidates in more competitive districts ahead of next November, he said.\n\nAnything above 45 percent would be “the cherry on top,” he added.\n\nRepublicans have been trying to make the race more about Behn and Democrats and less of a referendum on Trump, Geer said.\n\n“If you take a look right now at Van Epps’ advertisements, they’re not talking about his ties to Trump. They’re trying to attack Behn as a radical, or that Van Eppps is going to be really good at keeping costs down, which is of course the primary issue...","summary":"Democrats have a chance at overperforming in the Tennessee special election after Harris attended a canvassing event last month.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tennessee-special-election-could-be-kamala-harris-revenge-on-donald-trump-11138338","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25321654825283.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 11:00:00","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":384294002,"title":"Transcript: Trump’s Hold on the GOP Has Never Been Weaker","text":"Bacon: Right. They don’t care about high prices. They care about helping their elite friends.\n\nDonegan: For you means he’s going to lower your grocery bill—he’s not going to do this supposedly silly trans stuff, and he’s going to focus on what really matters. You could actually read that ad, bigoted as it was—and I do not want to understate that—as mocking Democrats for the supposed triviality of their culture-war issues.\n\nI just don’t think there are that many people—clearly they’re out there and they’re dangerous—but I don’t think there are that many people who are motivated day to day by contempt for trans Americans. And I do not think you can win people over just by moving to where you think they are on culture-war stuff. That thermostatic instinct—the trying to chase the middle on the culture-war stuff—makes you look cynical. It makes you look like you don’t believe in anything, right?\n\nWhen Spanberger and Mamdani and these winning candidates refused to do that, it looked more like they had a sense of principles but really had a sense of priorities. I’m focused on affordability was Mamdani’s answer to every single question he was asked. And so I think one way Democrats have begun to evolve, and that I’m encouraged by, is choosing the questions they want to answer—choosing their own messaging priorities as opposed to constantly chasing whatever the Republican attack was, being on the defensive, and fighting on the territory that has been given to them rather than the territory they chose.\n\nBacon: My worry was that they were going to move to the right on cultural issues. And it seems to me that they’ve kept their same positions while leading with economics. And that’s probably a better—that may have been a better course. And maybe Kamala, to be fair, did some of that herself, but the context may be different now.\n\nDonegan: Yeah. I think Kamala got kind of screwed. \n\nBacon: I was going to say that.\n\nDonegan: I don’t think she had a real opportunity in the very short amount of time she had to campaign to carve out a separate identity from Joe Biden. She also was not willing to break from Joe Biden on several important issues. But I don’t know exactly how much of a chance she had. I think her political career is over. I do not think she should try to run again. I think she should make a lot of money giving speeches to Goldman Sachs or whatever people do after they’ve been the vice president.\n\nBacon: And you don’t really mean Goldman Sachs, but I get the point.\n\nDonegan: Well, she should exit electoral politics. but that’s because she’s tainted by the unpopularity of somebody else.\n\nBacon: It’s a good place to finish—actually, one more question, and I’ll let you go. If you’d asked me in mid-2024, I was a big hyping-for-Gretchen person. She would be a great candidate to run; someone like that would be great. She’s a woman, she’s appealing. If you had asked me who should replace Biden, I would’ve said Harris is dragged down by the ticket—maybe you pick somebody like Andy Beshear. I could pick a few other people.\n\nBut I have to confess, I’m curious where you stand now, because having this whole year finished, Gavin Newsom—who is not somebody I normally like—has been better than I thought and has led more than I thought. And Whitmer has spent a lot of the year doing the Let me show you how bipartisan I am stuff. Shapiro is in that box too: let me show you how much I reach the other side while they destroy the country.\n\nSo, in other words, who do you like? Anybody you’ve been impressed by for 2028? Anybody you’ve been disappointed by? Because Whitmer’s on my list of people I wanted to be excited by and am not. And Newsom and Pritzker are on my list of people who have led this year and made me feel better about them.\n\nDonegan: Yeah. I’m going to be honest with you, Perry: when I think about another Democratic primary, I just want to put my head in my hands and hide until late 2028.\n\nI think you have Democrats trying to square their local obligations with their national reputations, right? I think you’re right that Pritzker has been an interesting leader. I think the way he got Donald Trump to back down on a more aggressive National Guard deployment to Chicago is very impressive. Pritzker is also the leader of a very blue state.\n\nGavin Newsom has his finger in the air trying to see which way the wind is blowing, and sometimes that blows him in directions that I like and sometimes it doesn’t. But I don’t really totally trust him to have a core set of principles, which I think is symptomatic of an older Democratic problem. \n\nBacon: But he’s also not that old, right? He’s in his fifties. He’s not actually old. He just sort of thinks old. He’s been around for a while, but I don’t think he’s actually that old.\n\nDonegan: He’s a Gen X guy with a boomer mentality. But he is the leader of a very blue state. He is being more aggressive because he has the leeway to do that within his state. \n\nWhitmer really disappointed me in the first six, eight months of the Trump presidency. She was an excellent, aggressive, progressive leader of Michigan during the first Trump and Biden terms. She was, I thought, really skillful in handling the post-Dobbs fallout in her state…\n\nBacon: I’ll come back to her. I’m not going to rule her out.\n\nDonegan: But she made the mistake a lot of people made in that post-2024 era, where she thought Trump represented something really significant and overestimated his power. She’s also responding to her state, which is not very blue. And so this is something where everybody is accumulating liabilities as they go.\n\nAnd I don’t have a pick right now.

In Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet tour, the line became a signature moment: during each performance, she demonstrated a different sexual position onstage as she sang it. The White House social media team used the lyric to mock the physical positions of detained migrants as agents moved in to arrest them, adding the caption, “Have you ever tried this one? Bye-bye.” It remains unclear whether the administration secured permission to use Carpenter’s music, though past incidents suggest it is unlikely. Representatives for Carpenter and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Carpenter is not the first pop star whose music has been used without approval. Last month, Olivia Rodrigo publicly condemned the administration and the Department of Homeland Security after her song “All-American Bitch” was inserted into an Instagram video encouraging “voluntary self-deportation.” Rodrigo called the post “racist, hateful propaganda,” prompting officials to remove the clip. Taylor Swift’s music has also appeared in government social media content. A recent White House slideshow set Swift’s “The Fate of Ophelia” to images of Donald Trump celebrating “The Fate of America,” including military footage and Trump’s mugshot. Swift did not comment, but she has been a vocal critic of Trump and endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024. Similar controversies have hit DHS posts that used audio from comedian Theo Von, country star Zach Bryan and even Pokémon media—each pushing back against their work being repurposed. Reaction to the Sabrina Carpenter video has been sharply divided. Supporters of the administration praised the stunt as irreverent and humorous, with commenters writing, “Barron is the GOAT” and “This is genius.” Critics called the video tasteless and dehumanizing. “I hope Sabrina sues,” wrote one user. Another summed it up: “What did I just watch?” Carpenter herself has remained silent. Whether she follows Rodrigo’s lead—or brushes it off—may determine whether the White House’s latest attempt at pop-culture propaganda becomes another social media misfire.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/culture/article/r1xehs3b11e","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/26/SJ11khRV11Zx/SJ11khRV11Zx_1_86_1000_563_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 10:59:44","author":"Ynet","authors":["Ynet"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":384256528,"title":"Want to Know How the 2026 Midterms Will Go? Look at Tennessee Today.","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThe White House doesn’t often call White House, Tennessee. But on Monday morning at the Colorado Grill—a burger joint on the two-lane highway going through this town about 30 miles north of Nashville—Donald Trump was on the phone.\n\nHe was calling Speaker Mike Johnson, who was going through the motions of saying hello to patrons who had shown up for an early lunch. Johnson was there for some last-ditch campaigning ahead of Tuesday’s special election, when voters in Tennessee’s 7th District will send a new representative to the House. And Trump was checking in with Johnson for a status report on how the race was going.\n\nJohnson put the President of the United States on speakerphone in the country restaurant and let Republican nominee Matt Van Epps chime in to profusely thank Trump again for his support. As they reminisced about when Trump had spoken (again via speakerphone) to a rally earlier in the morning, the President noted he didn’t have notes in front of him when he spoke. “It’s a good thing you’re a natural, Mr. President,” said the Speaker of the House.\n\nTrump reminisced about his line deriding the Democratic candidate, Aftyn Behn, over the telephone that morning: “She’s anti-Christian and anti-country music.”\n\nSpeaking to Johnson and Van Epps, Trump noted “the anti-Christian thing was good.” Van Epps agreed. “That line really worked, Mr. President.”\n\n(Bob and Doris Ness of White House who had “just come in for a burger” were just as impressed. The loyal conservatives never thought that the Speaker of the House would be standing six inches from their restaurant booth broadcasting a call from Donald Trump).\n\nA more candid status report for Trump would go something like this: Van Epps is the favorite on Tuesday when he faces off with Behn, a progressive activist turned Democratic state legislator. It’s a district, after all, where Trump trounced Kamala Harris by 22 points in 2024. But all is not well: Polls show the race uncomfortably close for Republicans, and the real shock isn’t that Trump was calling to come up with attacks on a Democratic congressional candidate—it was that he had to call at all.\n\nTuesday’s special election for a Nashville-based congressional district will be the definitive barometer of the political environment ahead of the 2026 midterms. Despite the attention paid to recent governors’ races in Virginia and New Jersey and a mayor’s race in New York, Tuesday’s race will give the nation the best gauge so far of Democrats’ chances of taking the House next November.\n\nAnd, if Behn does pull off an astonishing upset, it could lead to the collapse of the fragile Republican House majority even sooner. Johnson’s margin is thin already and is set to get more so next month, when Marjorie Taylor Greene is scheduled to resign. Matt Gorman, a top aide to the National Republican Campaign Committee in 2018, contrasted the GOP’s current situation to the one they faced ahead of the midterms in Trump’s first term: “We just worried about the narrative,” he said. “They have the majority to worry about.”\n\nIt’s a lot of attention for a district that typically gets very little. The district is a gerrymandered slice of Middle Tennessee that stretches up from Kentucky and down to Alabama, grabbing a hefty chunk of Nashville. No one gave it a second thought until, suddenly this spring, Republican incumbent Mark Green announced his retirement to pursue business ventures in Guyana.\n\nIn doing so, it set up a great weather vane for the state of national politics.The gerrymandering left the seat a heterogeneous array, including many of the base demographics both parties will need to turn out next November. It includes the bulk of metro Nashville’s African American population, plenty of progressive hipsters who’ve flocked to the city from across the South, traditional right wing suburbia and slices of Appalachia.\n\nAnd, unlike the Virginia and New Jersey elections, it’s a federal election featuring relatively unknown candidates without any complicating state issues. In particular, Virginia’s election featured well known candidates in the type of state race where voters are still willing to cross partisan lines. The Democrat, former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, was widely considered an exemplary candidate who ran a nearly flawless campaign. The Republican, Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, was considered a train wreck. Among the Republican consultant class, the question was not whether she’d lose but just how much of a drag she would be.\n\nTennessee’s 7th is a far cleaner test of what 2026 will look like—and not just because it’s a congressional election focusing on federal issues. Instead, it’s a test run for everything that will happen next year. Behn focused consistently on affordability in her television ads and on the trail. In contrast, Van Epps—a more establishment-oriented candidate who locked down the Republican nomination after securing Trump’s endorsement—has rotated between touting his Trump support, his biography and, increasingly, going after Behn as “radical.”\n\nDespite the district’s Republican lean, it’s developed into a tight race. One recent poll showed it as a virtual dead heat, with Van Epps clinging to a narrow two point lead.The poll left Democrats drooling. One national Democratic operative who had been tracking the race thought that even a ten-point win for Van Epps would signal a huge opportunity for Democrats, given that Trump had won by more than twice that. “You open up every single district that Republicans won by less than ten.”\n\nSpeaking to Slate in a neighborhood bar crammed with twenty-something men in retro baseball caps drinking longneck beers, Behn was occasionally interrupted by patrons who viewed her as a hero. “I love you Aftyn,” they exclaimed as they approached for a hug as SEC football blared in the background.\n\nOver a glass of red wine, Behn was occasionally interrupted when one of her television ads blared in the background, which she viewed with a mix of glee and sheer disbelief. The progressive activist turned Democratic standard bearer didn’t apologize for an array of social media posts and podcasts that turned her overnight into a Fox News bogeyman. A longtime progressive activist in Nashville, Behn had shared her views on social media. Some were simply hot takes like her disdain for the near constant presence of bachelorette parties in downtown Nashville. Others like her 2020 calls to defund the police or seeming support for the burning of a police station were far more politically harmful. Regardless, they all became grist for the right wing content mill.\n\n“There’s no nuance in politics,” she said. “I would ask for the same grace that I give people who voted for an economic agenda that hasn’t been delivered.” She added: “And I was a private citizen, right? I have definitely matured as a lawmaker.”\n\nBehn, who was first elected to the state house in a 2023 special election, is a longtime liberal activist who was an organizer for progressive groups like Indivisible. However, she seemed confident that all of her past controversies would not be a political impediment in a special election where there were few swing voters. After all, the race is the only contest on the ballot on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. “This is a mobilization race,” she said. “It’s about turning out your base, right? And it doesn’t matter what I do, the people that were never going to vote for me were never going to vote for me.”\n\nThe challenge for Democrats is that the district doesn’t just resemble Behn’s Nashville-based turf that features hipsters rolling their eyes at bachelorette parties cavorting on pedal bars. The Behn campaign also was canvassing in deep red Williamson County, a prosperous jurisdiction which has become the bedrock of the modern Republican Party.\n\nThere, in subdivisions where all the brick houses were perched on identical cul de sacs, volunteers drove from house to house to find the rare Democrats and remind them to turn out on a crisp Sunday afternoon before the election. The houses almost invariably flew flags, often of an SEC football team but occasionally an American one. Often, the Democrats voters were college aged and off at school. The parents at home didn’t share their children’s political inclinations. One asked whether Behn was the Democrat. When told of the candidate’s party affiliation, there was the succinct response: “We’re not.”\n\nHowever, chipping away at the Republican margins in a conservative bastion like this is essential not just for Tuesday’s special election but for Democrats moving forward. Williamson County is the type where Democrats’ suburban gains have been stopped cold. It’s well educated and prosperous like many of the counties where Democrats have made their biggest gains in recent years but they’ve made far less progress there. Kamala Harris only got a third of the vote there in 2024 which was the second best performance by a Democratic presidential candidate there in the 21st century, trailing only Biden’s margin in 2020 in a county studded with evangelical mega churches and the sprawling McMansions of Nashville stars.\n\nRepublicans were pulling out the stops at the last minute for their candidate on Monday morning. The morning before the election, it felt like a convention of local Republican elected officials had gathered on Van Epps’ behalf. Gathered in a billionaire’s car barn and speaking to a crowd of roughly 150 people and about as many immaculately restored classic cars, Johnson showed up to campaign for Van Epps, thoughThe highlight wasn’t anything that the Louisiana Republican said into the microphone but rather what came out of his cellphone, as—as he would again later that day at the Colorado Grill—he held his phone on speaker mode up to it so that Trump could address the crowd. Although the president falsely claimed that he won the 2020 election before he even mentioned van Epps name, Trump went on to deliver a standard monologue about the race. Johnson held the phone with a thin smile. The key line of course was about Behn’s disdain for Christianity and country music, but there was plenty of other red meat offered for the crowd.\n\nEventually Van Epps took the stage too. His remarks focused alternatively on Behn’s left-wing views and his family’s military service, as he detailed a long series of close encounters with rocket propelled grenades that he and his family members had faced while serving in the U.S. military.\n\nAfterwards, Jody Barrett, an ardently right-wing state legislator who finished second in the primary, acknowledged to Slate that Van Epps had a slow start to the general election after his primary victory but he thought the GOP candidate had finally gotten up to speed in the homestretch. He cited the crowd of elected Republicans in the car barn—which included the governor, two senators, and three members of Congress—as a sign of how serious the campaign was.\n\nHowever Barrett still thought Republicans were greatly helped by the Democratic standard bearer. “The Democrats did us a huge favor. They nominated the most extreme, most radical, closest thing to a Marxist that they could have nominated.”\n\nSpecial elections defined the political landscape in the run-up to Trump’s first midterms in 2018. Before Jon Ossoff’s successful Senate run, his attempt to win a suburban Atlanta seat in the spring of 2017 captured national attention and set spending records, as Democrats narrowly fell short in what had long been considered a safe Republican seat. It proved a canary in the coal mine for the losses the GOP would suffer in suburban seats in 2018.\n\nOssoff’s House run was followed by a second special election that made national headlines. A few months later in 2018, Conor Lamb won a shock victory in a southwestern Pennsylvania seat that Trump had won by 20 points (just shy of the margin that Trump won Tennessee’s 7th district in 2024 by). Lamb was widely considered a model candidate and his opponent Rick Saccone was not. As Lamb dryly noted to Slate last week, “Part of what you need [in a special election] is a little bit of luck, and we had that when they nominated Rick Saccone.”\n\nGorman, the former NRCC aide, noted that Behn was different from either Ossoff or Lamb because of the sheer amount of opposition research available to Republicans from Behn’s long social media history as a progressive activist.\n\nRepublicans have long been operating with the slimmest of majorities andDemocrats will finally fill a long vacant safe seat in January With Marjorie Taylor Greene’s expected resignation, a shock Democratic win wouldn’t deprive Johnson of the gavel. However, it would leave him a tragedy or a sex scandal from being in a very vulnerable position in an already fractious conference.\n\nThe special elections were run with entirely different models. Both Lamb and Ossoff avoided doing too much national media and avoided nationalizing the race. As Lamb noted, “in the last week or 10 days, the sort of attention span of all the people in your district is just really starting to open and you have to deal with ‘do I want them hearing me give answers to national political questions, or do I want them to hear me continue and give the answers I’ve given throughout the whole campaign about what’s important for this district?’”\n\nIn contrast, Behn has consistently done national media, including interviews with progressive influencers like Joy Reid and Meidas Touch. It’s a calculation different than that made in those past special elections where there was more of a focus on persuasion—and where Democrats believed there were swing voters to persuade. After all, as Lamb noted “we now have eight years of data that shows every Democrat everywhere is very excited to come out and vote against Donald Trump, especially in special elections.”\n\nThe question is just how much excitement Republicans can muster. After all, while voters have come out of the woods to vote for Donald Trump when he is on the ballot, there has never been the same level of enthusiasm shown by his MAGA base in off years. Further, his approval rating is at near record lows. The result leaves Van Epps uniquely vulnerable to this discontent, as the Democratic operative notes, as a first-time candidate. “He’s kind of an unknown, which allows him to be defined by what the Republican Party stands for in the minds of voters right now.”\n\nThe district is still safely Republican enough that the association isn’t fatal for Van Epps. However, while he can survive these political headwinds, there are a lot of other Republicans who won’t be able to next year unless something changes. And Tuesday will give an indication of just how tough that political environment will be.","summary":"On paper, Republicans should win this race in a blowout.

He’s been in Congress. He’s a veteran. He did a lot of what American people are looking for.”\n\nThe American people averted that Democratic disaster of a ticket but Minnesota is now dealing with the incompetence and possible corruption of Walz’s administration.\n\nWalz over the weekend blasted Trump for tying the scandal to the Somali migration to Minnesota. The state is home to the largest Somali community in the country, a total of more than 100,000, including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, the Trump administration on Friday ended legal protections for Somali migrants in The Gopher State.\n\n“As far as demonizing our Somali community, maybe he could help us on some things,” Walz said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Demonizing an entire community, folks who are in the professions, educators, artists, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, they bring the diversity and the energy to a place like Minnesota.”\n\nTrump posted on Thanksgiving that Somali migrants “are taking over this once great state of Minnesota” and accused Walz of incompetence.\n\nAnd in a scathing post on X, employees of Minnesota’s Department of Health Services blasted Walz as dishonest and incompetent, saying he “has never taken any accountability for his role in fraud.”\n\nThe New York Times, in a lengthy expose, reported that “fraud took deep root in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali diaspora as scores of individuals made small fortunes by setting up companies that billed state agencies for millions of dollars’ worth of social services that were never provided.”\n\nA total of 59 people have been convicted in the schemes to steal the safety net programs, prosecutors say.\n\nImagine the outrage of Massachusetts residents if these crimes had happened under the watch of Gov. Maura Healey.\n\nBut Walz, whose military service came under scrutiny during the Harris campaign, has denied any knowledge of the plot that was undertaken mostly by Somali migrants whom he has lauded as pillars of the community.\n\nThe corruption scheme could widen in the coming months.\n\nA good question is what did Omar know about these stolen public funds, which were supposed to benefit poor children during the COVID epidemic? A former aide to Omar has already pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering in connection with the federal child nutrition program.\n\nSome Somali Americans are concerned that the scandal has damaged the reputation of their community, but critics of Walz say he let the scandal go on because he was afraid of alienating Somalis who have been supportive of him.\n\nMinnesota has attracted hundreds of thousands of immigrants mostly because of the state’s generous “Scandinavian-modeled” social service programs, according to the Times.\n\nThe schemes began with the food nutrition program as far back as 2022, when state agencies reimbursed a nonprofit organization for thousands of “nonexistent” meals. In reality most of the funds went toward paying for cars, houses and real estate projects, the Times reported.\n\nSomali American citizens also are accused of ripping off a program to provide therapy for autistic children by funneling kickback money to parents.\n\nThe depth of the scandal, which is just hitting Minnesota residents, has pitted immigrants against other longtime residents.\n\n“No one will support these programs if they continue to be riddled with fraud,” federal prosecutor Joseph H. Thompson told the Times. “We’re losing our way of life in Minnesota in a very real way.”","summary":"Dozens of people have been charged by federal prosecutors with fraud in connection with the stolen funds, mostly from a food nutrition program for children overseen by Governor and former Democratic VP nominee Tim Walz.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/02/battenfeld-marty-walsh-choice-for-vp-under-fire-in-childrens-food-scandal/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_Minnesota_Lawmakers_Shot_17766.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 10:18:21","author":"Joe Battenfeld","authors":["Joe Battenfeld"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211}]}
