(Photo by Eric BARADAT / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nFebruary 5, 2026\n\n\n\n\n ‘Save the Post’: Hundreds protest cuts at famed US newspaper \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Several hundred people rallied outside The Washington Post headquarters on Thursday to protest its decision to lay off hundreds of journalists, including most of its overseas staff.\n\n“Democracy dies in darkness. And you, Jeff Bezos, have turned off the lights,” a sign at the demonstration read, referring to the newspaper’s front-page slogan and its billionaire owner, who has become close to US President Donald Trump during the Republican’s second term.\n\nThe sweeping cuts at the Post announced on Wednesday came as major traditional media outlets in the United States face intense pressure from Trump, who routinely denigrates journalists as “fake news” and has launched multiple lawsuits against media organisations.\n\nREAD: Washington Post announces ‘painful’ job cuts\n\n“In a time where we’ve seen unprecedented attacks on the press, and anti- or negative sentiment toward journalists for just doing their jobs, it’s dangerous to cut staff this way,” said Michael Brice-Saddler, who covered the US capital for the Post and has now been laid off.\n\n“These cuts are not the fault of our staff, yet they are the ones who bear the brunt of the cost. They lose resources, they lose the ability to tell stories that are meaningful to Washington,” Brice-Saddler said.\n\nThe Post did not disclose the number of jobs being eliminated, but The New York Times reported that approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off.\n\nMost of the paper’s journalists overseas were let go, including its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent, as the war with Russia grinds on.\n\nSports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back, and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported.\n\nBezos reined in the newspaper’s liberal-leaning editorial page and blocked an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election — breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence. He was widely seen as bowing to Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Harris, and the paper lost around $100 million in 2024 as advertising and subscription revenues fell.\n\nMarissa J Lang, an enterprise reporter who was fired by the Post, said the full effect of the layoffs remains to be seen.\n\n“A lot of people have been asking me about the impact of these cuts, and I have very honestly been telling them, I don’t think we know yet,” Lang said.\n\n“The impact of losing 300 journalists who hold power to account, who investigate corruption, who tell you about what’s happening in war zones overseas, and whether your kids’ schools will be open because it snowed, is immeasurable,” Lang said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: layoff newspaper Washington Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n US publicly supports Haitian PM remaining in office after CPT mandate ends \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2026 \n\n\n PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti (CMC) – The United States (US) has signalled its strong support for Haitian Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimè’s leadership “i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In ‘most boring’ feat, Brazilian runs record 24h on treadmill \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2026 \n\n\n RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AFP) — A Brazilian man with a penchant for sporting records on Thursday broke a new one after tackling the most boring physica... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Rush Sports secures Caribbean broadcast rights for Winter Olympics \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2026 \n\n\n Caribbean sports broadcaster Rush Sports is the official broadcast rights holder in the region for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026.

Messages of hope, joy, and momentum resonated across TikTok, Instagram, X, and Facebook. By election day, they had amassed 8 million followers—an unprecedented digital footprint for a campaign run on an accelerated timeline. Then they lost. The digital team that had built this machine sat in silence, watching millions of followers stare at dormant accounts. “Coming off November 2024, these accounts were sitting dormant with around 8 million followers collectively,“ Lauren Kapp, who ran the TikTok account during the campaign, told Newsweek. “The question on everyone's minds was: what is going to happen to these accounts?“ This week, they got their answer: rather than dismantle the operation, Kamala Harris is officially relaunching the campaign accounts as “Headquarters,“ a permanent digital organizing project designed to operate year-round. The accounts will serve as what the team calls a “Gen Z–led progressive content hub,“ covering political news and fact-checking claims, as they try to compete with the meme-fueled strategy the White House has successfully used. Supporters react as Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris concedes the election during a speech at Howard University on November 06, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “This is way bigger than any one election cycle or any one candidate,” said Arlie Shugar, the video lead on the original Kamala HQ team and director of platforms at People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy organization. “We’re looking forward to covering the news day in and day out and uplifting progressive voices.” A Problem Democrats Keep Solving Poorly The decision to keep the accounts alive represents an unusual move in Democratic politics. Historically, campaign digital operations dissolve after Election Day, infrastructure dismantled and teams scattered. The Kamala HQ accounts—which had generated more impressions than both @realDonaldTrump and @TeamTrump combined during the 2024 race—could have followed the same path. Instead, Harris's team is treating digital organizing as a permanent problem requiring permanent solutions. “One of my largest takeaways from 2024 was the fact that Democrats have really been struggling with meeting this moment and the attention economy of the current day and age of digital,“ Kapp, who is managing partner at Luminary Strategies, said. The relaunch of Headquarters, in her view, is a direct response to that recurring failure. Headquarters operates through a three-way partnership: Harris's own team, People for the American Way (where Harris will officially serve on the board), and Luminary Strategies, Kapp's firm. The project currently has 12 staff members and is actively hiring platform-specific strategists and video editors. “Our goal is basically to build back the team in the same way that it was built in 2024,“ Kapp explained. “So to have Twitter strategists, Facebook strategists, Instagram strategists, TikTok strategists.“ The Broader Stakes The relaunch comes as Democrats prepare for the 2026 midterm elections and grapple with losing ground among younger voters. Trump won 43 percent of voters ages 18-24 in 2024, up from 31 percent in 2020, according to CNN exit polling. Recent polling suggests Gen Z sentiment toward Trump has deteriorated since his return to office, creating an opening Democrats hope to exploit. Harris has not declared plans to run for president in 2028, but the decision to build permanent infrastructure raises inevitable questions about her political future. When asked whether Headquarters signals such intentions, both women deflected. Supporters cheer as US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks during a Get Out the Vote rally at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on October 30, 2024. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS / AFP) “This specifically just shows the Vice President's commitment to Gen. Z,“ Kapp said. “This really is an investment into Gen. Z and people who are trying to reach young people. But this account is more than any one candidate or campaign.“ For Harris's team, the stakes are clear. “After all of the headlines about how we lost the election online in 2024 and we didn't go on enough podcasts, and we didn't do this, and we didn't do that, this is her taking a direct action to try to solve for that,“ Kapp said. “And while it's not going to solve everything, this is a huge step forward in the right direction.“ However, the project faces real challenges. The team attempted to secure the @headquarters handle on X but was unsuccessful. According to a source familiar with the matter, the platform requested a significant sum for the handle, making the acquisition unfeasible. Also, maintaining engagement during non-election years is typically harder than during campaigns. Content that went viral under the banner of a presidential race may struggle without that same galvanizing moment. Some Democratic strategists have also questioned whether another Gen-Z-focused organization makes sense when other groups already compete for similar funding and audiences.","summary":"After 2024, the Kamala HQ digital team tells Newsweek why their Gen Z strategy isn’t shutting down.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/inside-harris-plan-to-turn-kamala-hq-into-a-year-round-gen-z-hub-11474096","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2181280553.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 23:21:16","author":"Jesus Mesa,Leonardo Feldman","authors":["Jesus Mesa","Leonardo Feldman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":399864586,"title":"Jesse Watters: Kamala Harris is ‘obviously’ running","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Five February 05, 2026 06:07 \n\n Jesse Watters: Kamala Harris is ‘obviously’ running \n ‘The Five’ co-hosts remark on former Vice President Kamala Harris for her 'Headquarters 67' campaign.\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE FIVEV-VIDEOPOLITICSPRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES","summary":"‘The Five’ co-hosts remark on former Vice President Kamala Harris for her &apos;Headquarters 67&apos; campaign.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6388842238112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/d07dea82-4a1d-4cb3-b5da-b28ecbe9fff5/39f2323a-a89e-403f-8f56-90b8e8fb9cbc/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 23:08:35","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.664},{"id":399771858,"title":"Washington Post announces &#8216;painful&#8217; job cuts","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(FILES) The building of the Washington Post newspaper headquarter is seen on K Street in Washington DC on May 16, 2019.

His Amazon behemoth controversially paid Trump’s wife, First Lady Melania Trump, a reported $40 million for a documentary this year, along with another $35 million for marketing.\n\nMurray said the shifts at the Post reflect the radically changing economy for news media.\n\nThis “will help to secure our future…and provide us stability moving forward,” Murray said in a note to employees.\n\nHe cited changes to the news ecosystem, from individuals who “generate impact at low cost” to AI-generated content, as well as financial challenges that have already produced rounds of cost-cutting and buyouts at the Post.\n\n“The company’s structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often wrote from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nOn Facebook, Marty Baron, the Post’s executive editor until 2021, said: “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations.”\n\n– War zone layoff –\n\nThe Post did not disclose the number of job cuts, but the New York Times reports approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off.\n\nMost of the paper’s journalists overseas were let go, includings its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.\n\nSports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported.\n\nMurray said the Post would now focus on politics, national security, technology, investigations, and business, among other topics.\n\nBut a reporter who covered Amazon — currently valued at $2.6 trillion — was let go.\n\n“These layoffs are not inevitable. A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future,” the labor union representing many Post journalists said in a statement.\n\nIt called for supporters of the paper, acquired by Bezos in 2013, to rally outside its Washington headquarters at noon on Thursday.\n\nThe White House’s communications director, Stephen Cheung, issued a typically scornful message.\n\n“Just a reminder that printing fake news is not a profitable business model,” he posted on X.\n\n– Financial struggles –\n\nBaron, the Post’s former executive editor, said that Post owner Bezos had resisted “brutal pressure” from Trump in the past, but it was battered by “ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.”\n\nBezos reined in a liberal-leaning editorial page and blocked an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election — breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence, and seen as bowing the knee to Trump.\n\nIn response, loyal readers “fled the Post. In truth, they were driven away,” Baron said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Harris and the paper lost around $100 million in 2024 as advertising and subscription revenues fell.\n\nIn May 2024, Post publisher Will Lewis told staffers the paper lost $77 million over the preceding year and lost half of its audience since 2020.\n\nIn stark contrast, The New York Times announced Wednesday that it gained more than one million digital subscribers in 2025, bringing its total to nearly 13 million and confirming its dominant position in the US media market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Jeff Bezos job cuts Washington Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Chief Justice Bryan Sykes accepts Jolyan Silvera’s guilty plea \n\n\n\n\n BY JASON CROSS Observer staff reporter crossj@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Observer Online understands that Chief Justice Bryan Sykes has accepted Jolyan Silvera's guilty plea for manslaughter and using a ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bunny Wailer’s daughter boosts Blackheart Man merchandising to mark ‘Wailers 50’ celebration \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2026 \n\n\n Ngeri Livingston, the daughter of the late Bunny Wailer, is gearing up to expand the merchandising arm of her father's estate with the release of a sp... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Commonwealth experts to observe Barbados election for the first time \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2026 \n\n\n A team of Commonwealth experts has been deployed by Secretary-General Shirley Botchwey to observe the February 11 general election in Barbados.

And you, Jeff Bezos, have turned off the lights,” a sign at the demonstration read, referring to the newspaper’s front-page slogan and its billionaire owner, who has become close to President Donald Trump during the Republican’s second term.\n\n“In a time where we’ve seen unprecedented attacks on the press, and anti- or negative sentiment towards journalists for just doing their jobs, it’s dangerous to cut staff this way,” said Mr Michael Brice-Saddler, who covered the US capital for the Post and has now been laid off.\n\n“These cuts are not the fault of our staff, yet they are the ones who bear the brunt of the cost. They lose resources, they lose the ability to tell stories that are meaningful to Washington,” Mr Brice-Saddler said.\n\nThe Post did not disclose the number of jobs being eliminated, but The New York Times reported approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off.\n\nMost of the paper’s journalists overseas were let go, including its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent as Russia’s invasion of its neighbour grinds on. \n\nSports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported.\n\nMr Bezos reined in the newspaper’s liberal-leaning editorial page and blocked an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election – breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence. He was widely seen as bowing to Mr Trump. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in January that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Ms Harris and the paper lost around US$100 million (S$127 million) in 2024 as advertising and subscription revenues fell. \n\nMs Marissa J. Lang, an enterprise reporter who was fired by the Post, said the full effect of the layoffs remains to be seen.\n\n“A lot of people have been asking me about the impact of these cuts, and I have very honestly been telling them, I don’t think we know yet,” Ms Lang said.\n\n“The impact of losing 300 journalists who hold power to account, who investigate corruption, who tell you about what’s happening in war zones overseas, and whether your kids’ schools will be open because it snowed, is immeasurable,” Ms Lang said.

This feels more like keeping the door open than closing it.”\n\nOn Wednesday night, teasers hinted at the return of her social media presence, which officially relaunched Thursday on X and TikTok under the new brand “Headquarters.” This rebrand, created with the progressive nonprofit organization People For the American Way, is described as both a “youth mobilization organization” and a “next-generation campaigning” initiative.\n\nThe “headquarters_67” account already has five million followers on TikTok and 1.1 million on X. It’s unclear if the 67 is a reference to the viral internet meme that has been driving parents and teachers crazy for the best part of the past two years. The bio on the X account simply said “Elon [Musk] wouldn’t give us @headquarters.”\n\nIntroducing itself as a “Gen-Z led progressive content hub,” the account features a stylized banner with an inverted bald eagle, an American flag backdrop, and a light green “Headquarters” logo subtitled “A News Co.”\n\nEwald noted that the rebrand itself is what stands out most.\n\n“Shifting from KamalaHQ to a broader ‘Headquarters’ suggests she’s thinking beyond a single campaign,” she added. “More about staying engaged, especially with Gen Z. Harris has long understood that younger voters aren’t just a future constituency, they’re an expanding one, and that engagement has to be a two-way conversation, not just messaging at them. At a moment when Democrats are still trying to catch up to Republicans online, this also reads as a practical move. Even if a 2028 run is still down the line, maintaining visibility, relationships, and digital momentum makes sense. It’s a sign she’s still very much in the political arena, not stepping away from it.”\n\nHarris’ social media rebrand aligns with broader Democratic hopes to engage young voters ahead of November’s midterm elections. While young voters generally favor Democrats, President Donald Trump made notable gains with this group in the 2024 election, winning 43% of voters aged 18-24, up from 31% in 2020.\n\n“Headquarters” aims to mobilize young people who are pro-fairness and pro-democracy against right-wing extremism. Harris, who ran an unsuccessful last-minute campaign against Trump in 2024, now serves as the organization’s chair emerita.\n\n“It’s where you can go online to get basically the latest of what’s going on and also to meet and revisit with some of our great, courageous leaders,” Harris said in a short launch video. “So stay engaged, and I’ll see you out there.”\n\nMY NIGHT WITH KAMALA: HARRIS’S ‘I TOLD YOU SO’ TOUR COMES TO RICHMOND\n\nHeadquarters already seems to mirror elements of California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s popular X account, Governor Newsom Press Office, which blends rapid-fire political messaging with news-style content and often targets and mocks Trump and his administration. One of its first posts features a video of Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast, where he discusses whether he will make it to heaven.\n\n“I really think I probably should make it,” Trump said.\n\nThe Headquarters post added a snarky, “Mentioned 38,000 times in the Epstein files, btw.”\n\nLike Newsom, Harris is reportedly considering a 2028 White House run. A new Harvard-Harris poll released this week shows her leading the Democratic contenders, while Vice President JD Vance holds a commanding lead among Republicans. With her new social media operation and a national book tour underway, Harris appears to be strongly hinting at a possible return to the White House stage.\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD NOT BET AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS 2028 ON PREDICTION MARKETS \n\nShroff Kaivan, a political commentator and 2025 Democratic National Committee delegate who supported Harris, said the buzz around the rebranded social media sites shows America’s interest remains strong.\n\n“Whether she runs or not, it’s clear her most committed supporters are ready to suit up and campaign for her as hard as possible were she to run again,” Kaivan told the Washington Examiner. “The response to the teaser announcement showed Harris still garners huge excitement from a segment of the base.”\n\nLongtime California political expert Garry South suggested Harris should sit out the 2028 race to avoid the risk of serious embarrassment if she ran again.\n\n“Don’t know what she’s thinking,” he told the Washington Examiner. “It is hard for any politician who’s run for president not to see a potential president staring back at them in the mirror. In Harris’ case, if she is thinking of running again, perhaps she would be wise to listen to the people of her own home state, those who know her best, who are clearly telling her a very emphatic no, even her fellow Democrats.”","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris has reactivated her 2024 campaign social media accounts in a fresh effort to reach younger voters ahead of the midterm elections.

And as the kids today say, Wow. Just wow. \n\nThere is all manner of craziness on Threads, including a heavy infestation of men who think they’re women. One of the most spectacularly insane preoccupations of the platform in general, however, is that the 2024 election was stolen, and Kamala Harris was actually elected president of the United States.\n\nNo, I am not making this up. When Harris was touting her big announcement that turned out to be the establishment of Headquarters, “the new Gen-Z led progressive content hub,” some Threads users were beside themselves with excitement that Harris was going to announce that she had actually won the 2024 election, and, apparently with a simple wave of her hand, rid the world once and for all of Orange Man Bad.\n\nOne Threads user wrote: “Just putting it out there... Today @kamalaharris announces that the ‘grave national security threat’ Gabbard has been holding back is irrefutable evidence that Elon Musk was involved in a conspiracy to rig the 2024 election. S**tler is illegitimate and now the country is going to peacefully transfer power to Kamala and Tim Walz. Musk, Miller and S**tler are carted off in handcuffs. A national holiday is proclaimed and no one has to work. I HOPE & WISH.” \n\nThis is not just the fantasy of one person. On a post about a Daily Beast report saying that “President Donald Trump said he will only accept the GOP losing control of Congress in this November’s midterms if he considers the elections to have been ‘honest,’” another Threads user asked: “Like the 2024 election that he stole from Kamala?”\n\nThis was the time to start backing toward the door, smiling reassuringly, but I plowed on, finding that another big preoccupation at Threads is Trump’s supposed incapacity. This one is pure projection after four years of Old Joe Biden, during which leftists were insisting against all evidence that the alleged president was sharp as a tack, but Threads users go at it with gusto. One wrote: “Tom Llamas NBC News has interviewed President Trump. Trump continues to defend his mental and physical health, but he has all the signs and symptoms of frontal temporal dementia. He is in denial!” Well, yeah, someone certainly is.\n\nAnother provided the prevailing view on Threads of President Donald Trump in a handy and succinct summary post: “Trump is a narcissist, a multiple felon, and a proven sex offender. When the full Epstein Files are released, and not politically redacted, it's likely they will show him to be a pedophile as well. You can't blame a sick old man for this, but he's also incontinent and suffering from dementia.”\n\nGavin and Vogue Mag, Sittin’ in a Tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G…\n\nThe Epstein Files are a constant Threads preoccupation, with Threads users absolutely certain that they establish Trump as a monster of world-historical proportions, right up there with the Hitler they insist he is emulating, and that the only reason why he isn’t in prison right now is because he has bought off essentially most of the world, while his sycophants in the media cover for him. Yes, they really think that the establishment media covers for Trump.\n\nIn the final analysis, Threads world, as you may expect, is an ugly, angry world, full of bitter people whose fantasies don’t match the way the world really is, and who are enraged at the world for failing to rearrange itself to suit them. It would be amusing — okay, it frequently is — until one remembers that these unhinged people occupy positions of power and influence all over the country today. They’re even teaching our children. If you ever want to see exactly why that is such a dangerous fact, take a little dip into Threads.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/robert-spencer/2026/02/05/i-signed-up-for-threads-and-wow-leftists-are-even-crazier-than-i-thought-n4949178","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/188/2f3d59c8-4633-4e4f-a292-c9ddea720f98.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 21:51:00","author":"Robert Spencer","authors":["Robert Spencer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.066},{"id":399868642,"title":"Dems Have A 'Huge Advantage' In Midterms Following Texas GOP Loss, CNN's Harry Enten Says","text":"CNN’s chief data analyst Harry Enten on Wednesday predicted that a “huge Democratic rebound” could be on the horizon in this year’s midterms after the party’s stunning win in a Texas special election.

Obviously the CCP mouthpiece expects China to benefit from such a visit. Given that the outlet lies all the time, however, it is always better to take whatever it says with a grain of salt, whether positive or negative.\n\nThe Global Times also threw in an article taking a high moral tone on the Epstein files, which is insanely ironic given that the CCP is one of the most corrupt regimes in the world and currently convulsed with internal purges.\n\nSpeaking of media that functions as a mouthpiece for a particular political ideology, The Nation just nominated the violent anti-ICE domestic terrorists in Minneapolis for the Nobel Peace Prize.

I’m sure they’d prefer it to losing them. But the question is whether they actually care enough about winning to take the necessary steps—or even whether winning elections ranks among their top, say, five priorities.\n\nThe state is holding a Senate election in November that is, or could be, a pivot point in the chamber’s control. Yet Texas Democrats have lost every statewide election since 1994.\n\nDuring the Obama era, Democrats pointed hopefully to the state’s growing Latino population as a source of strength that would propel them inevitably back into majority status. This expectation of an emerging majority may have paradoxically caused the party to avoid making any accommodations to the state’s conservative-leaning electorate—why compromise their values to win when they could just ride the demographic wave?\n\nIn recent years, these hopes have faded. Latino voters swung rightward in 2024. They turned out to have more moderate views on issues, especially immigration, than do the progressive activists who influence Democratic positions. But once again, Texas looks winnable. Over the past year, Donald Trump has driven away the voters he gained. Every ingredient is in place for Texas to swing back, and potentially give Democrats a Senate majority, except one: the Texas Democratic Party.\n\nThe party’s latest and most egregious circular-firing-squad behavior transpired earlier this week, when the Democrat Colin Allred, who’d previously dropped out of the Senate race, endorsed Jasmine Crockett, one of the two remaining major competitors. He gave his reason for doing so in a video he posted to social media on Monday. “I understand that James Talarico had the temerity and the audacity to say to a Black woman that he had signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, meaning me, not a formidable, intelligent Black woman, meaning Jasmine Crockett.”\n\nAllred didn’t hear Talarico’s statement directly, which is why he had to say “I understand” that Talarico said it. Allred’s apparent source was a TikTok post by the activist and influencer Morgan Thompson, who said that Talarico had uttered the offensive remark in a private conversation.\n\nTalarico denies having said it. “In my praise of Congresswoman Crockett, I described Congressman Allred’s method of campaigning as mediocre—but his life and service are not,” he wrote in a statement. “I would never attack him on the basis of race.”\n\nTalarico would obviously have a motive to deny making an offensive comment in private. Thompson, however, has a motive as a Crockett supporter to paint her opponent in an unflattering light. She also appears to have an expansive definition of what constitutes an offensive statement. In the same TikTok video, Thompson complained that Talarico described Crockett’s political strategy as involving “attack ads.” As she explains, “Using this language when you have the privilege of being a white man, when people across the political spectrum are also using the ‘angry Black woman that’s aggressive’ trope to attack her, is microaggressive.”\n\nAllred did not have to record and share his response to Talarico, nor was he required to take the allegation at face value. He chose the most inflammatory response. “We’re tired of folks using praise for Black women to mask criticism for Black men,” he said, describing Talarico’s comment as “taking off the mask, telling us who you really are and what you really think.”\n\nEverything about this episode reveals levels of pathological incompetence. Crockett and her supporters are prying open fissures that will scar whichever candidate emerges. They are expressing themselves in social-justice jargon that might be effective in a student-council race at Wesleyan but sounds completely alien to most Texans.\n\nMore grim than this particular episode for the Democrats’ electoral prospects in Texas is that, over the past decade, candidates have not typically even tried to appeal to a majority of the state’s voters, because the incentives run in the other direction. Candidates can easily mobilize donors and activists across the country if they go viral on social media. Democrats do this not by highlighting local issues, nor by distancing themselves from the unpopular national party, but by inspiring people who either fervently support the party or wish it were even more progressive.\n\nAnd when these candidates fail to win office, their fealty to party doctrine brings its own rewards. Texas Democrats have routinely raised massive sums, turned themselves into national political celebrities, lost, and then gone on to work in the progressive movement. Wendy Davis is the archetype: She ran for governor in 2014 in a campaign emphasizing abortion rights; she was featured in a New York Times Magazine cover story; and she lost by 20 points. She went on to found a nonprofit and now works as a political-fundraising consultant.\n\nBeto O’Rourke ran a close but losing race for Senate in 2018. Then, two years later, he ran for president, a campaign in which he adopted uncompromising progressive stances such as confiscating assault weapons. In 2022, O’Rourke ran for governor and lost by double digits. He currently heads a nonprofit organization called Powered by People.\n\nJulián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor who served as housing and urban development secretary in the Obama administration, was once considered a promising future Democratic talent in Texas. Instead, he ran for president in 2020, during which he endorsed Medicare for All and a pullback of border enforcement. He is now the CEO of a nonprofit group dedicated to empowering Latinos.\n\nThis year, the party has another chance to try something other than nominating a conventional liberal who loses and then gets to run an NGO. The Trump administration has created a national backlash at least as large as the one in 2018, when O’Rourke came within a few points of victory. Latino voters have turned especially hard against the administration’s indiscriminate mass-deportation policy.\n\nThe task has a unique urgency. Federal courts represent the last major impediment to Trump’s authoritarian consolidation, and the Senate is the gateway to controlling those courts. Should Republicans hold the upper chamber, they will have two more years to fill the judiciary—including the Supreme Court—with pro-MAGA jurists. Democrats can stop them if they retake the Senate, but this requires winning deep-red states, of which Texas is among the most promising.\n\nAt least in theory, anyway. The closest thing Democrats have to a viable nominee looks to be Talarico, a 36-year-old state representative and former minister who rocketed to prominence last summer when he impressed the podcaster Joe Rogan with his invocation of religious themes. On policy, Talarico has positioned himself as a conventional Democrat, and his efforts to expand his appeal beyond the base consist mostly of biography and messaging style.\n\nBut Talarico’s half-hearted gestures to winning are about 50 percentage points more heart than his opponent has put into the enterprise. Crockett, a representative from a deep-blue district that includes much of Dallas, has attained fame with snappy put-downs of Republicans, many of which have gone viral on social media. Crockett once described Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, as “Governor Hot Wheels”; dismissed complaints about DEI as the laments of “mediocre white boys”; and said Latinos who voted for Trump have “almost like a slave mentality.”\n\nCrockett was lured into the race by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, NOTUS reported in December. The GOP Senate arm conducted a series of polls showing Crockett, who had amassed high name recognition and Democratic enthusiasm, performing strongly in a hypothetical race. Crockett has said the polls, and others that confirmed their findings, helped encourage her to jump into the race, to the delight of Republicans.\n\nCrocket has suggested that she can help drive turnout of infrequent voters. The belief that there is a hidden reservoir of left-wing voters who will bother to show up at the polls only if a sufficiently progressive candidate activates their interest is a decades-old myth. In reality, nonvoters have views that are less ideologically coherent than those of regular voters—which is to say, they think more like swing voters than base voters.\n\nLast month, Crockett told The Washington Post that she doesn’t believe in what she called the “mythical Republican crossover,” and framed her campaign as more of a fun journey than a laser-focused attempt to flip a Senate seat. “My theory of the case is this: If you believe we’re going to lose anyway, then what difference does it make if it’s me or anybody else?” Crockett said. “If you think it’s a losing cause, then who cares? But at least you could say we tried something new and we learned something from this experience.”\n\nEven in a state party that has conditioned itself to the notion that winning an election is less important than the friends and donors you make along the way, that is a shocking confession.\n\nYou might suppose that Democrats would recoil from a candidate who broadcasts indifference, at best, to winning over the votes you need to form a majority in a state Trump won by 14 points in 2024. Yet Crockett has continued to attract endorsements, including from Allred, once seen as a relatively moderate candidate, and who ran five points ahead of Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nRather than allay the concerns about her electability, Crockett has treated them as illegitimate and even racist. “I really do think that the host said the quiet part out loud, which basically was: If a white man couldn’t do it, then why would a Black woman even have the audacity to think that she could?” Crockett told the Post. “We’ve tried, I don’t know however many white men, and they’ve all lost. The only thing we know for sure is that a white man can lose.”\n\nCrockett’s supporters have made the charge she is floating more explicit. “When they talk about electability, it’s dog whistles, and it’s allusions to speaking about her race, speaking about her being a woman,” Shea Jordan Smith, a Crockett supporter and Democratic political strategist, recently told The New York Times. “They want to call her ghetto and Black and trash so bad, but they don’t say that.”\n\nThe comedians Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang breezily observed on a podcast last month that donating to Crockett is a waste of money. A procession of comments proceeded to label them racist. One TikTok post called the remark “structurally violent,” because the pair were telling “Black people, or people in general, not to financially support a Black woman who is running for office.” It received more than 250,000 likes. Yang and Rogers issued obsequious apologies, and Rogers promised to “be better.”\n\nBut electability is neither a code word for, nor tantamount to, white-male-ness. Female candidates do not generally face an electoral penalty. Black candidates who meet the electorate where it is on messaging and policy can win swing voters. Barack Obama won millions of voters who later flipped to Donald Trump.\n\nOne fatal flaw of progressive identity norms, which treat women and people of color as experts on racism and sexism whose charges of bias cannot be refuted, is that they insulate bad arguments from scrutiny. The belief that swing voters in Texas are too racist and sexist to be compromised with implies that defeat is the only morally acceptable option.\n\nAllred seems to have flung his wild charges at Talarico in genuine anger. But you cannot say that Allred acted stupidly. He is running in a contested primary for a House seat in an overwhelmingly Democratic district, so he probably made his political future more rather than less secure. And if he eventually loses his seat—always a risk in a state that Republicans control and gerrymander at will—what more promising candidate could there be to run a shiny new nonprofit organization?","summary":"Once again, the party’s statewide candidates seem to have grander ambitions than victory.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/democrats-texas-senate-talarico-crockett/685895/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/xP6ruJUCBrzmaIyCwDvot33rP2o=/0x0:2000x1125/720x405/media/img/mt/2026/02/2026_02_03_Chait_Texas_final/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 20:26:07","author":"Jonathan Chait","authors":["Jonathan Chait"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":399815062,"title":"Jeff Bezos used to be in love with The Washington Post. What happened?","text":"Lots of people are angry at Jeff Bezos because of the massive cuts he&apos;s ordered at his Washington Post. But a decade ago&comma; Bezos was widely celebrated for his ownership of the Post&comma; which he had bought for $250 million in 2013.Under Bezos&apos; ownership&comma; the Post made huge investments in tech and staff. And readers loved the results — especially during the first Trump era&comma; when the paper turned profitable.Now things are very different: The Post says it has been losing gobs of money for the past few years&comma; and Bezos has made a series of moves interpreted as a shift toward Trump — which spurred reader revolts&comma; which made things even worse. And all of that led to this week&apos;s cuts.I talked to Erik Wemple&comma; a New York Times media reporter who previously worked at the Post for 14 years&comma; to try to reconcile the two eras of Bezos and the Post&comma; and to get a sense of what might happen next. You can hear our entire chat on my Channels podcast; what follows is an edited excerpt from our conversation.Peter Kafka: What shape was the Post in when Bezos bought it in 2013?Erik Wemple: The Graham family&comma; which had owned the Post forever&comma; was an amazing steward for the paper. But they had to scale back their newsroom&comma; because the internet had blown holes in classified ads. Classifieds used to be huge at The Washington Post.At the time Bezos bought it in 2013&comma; it was not dysfunctional. These were really good journalists&comma; but the paper was in a bit of a funk. It wasn&apos;t a reclamation project&comma; but it had seen better days.It was faded when he bought it.Correct. And when Bezos came in 2013&comma; he really wowed the staff. We all asked him questions. He answered those questions with tremendous enthusiasm and competence. He seemed really energized by this.What did he think he was going to do?When he came in&comma; he was energetic&comma; but deferential on the particulars of running the newspaper. He&apos;s like&comma; \"You know what? I&apos;m not in this business&comma; but I do know how to organize discussions about the future of a business.\" And that&apos;s what he did. I was in one of them; it was really remarkable.He had these things that he believed in. He was important in guiding conversations. And it was really remarkable because he backed it up with money. He invested in the newspaper. He invested in political coverage&comma; big time. Investigative went up. International got a huge&comma; huge boost. And the technology did too.This is exactly what you want from your billionaire tech owner: Give us a bunch of money. Improve our tech. Also&comma; stay away. Don&apos;t tell us what to do.That was exactly the sentiment. And one of the things you mentioned in there is really worth pausing on for a second&comma; which is the lack of intervention&comma; the lack of meddling. He just sort of looked on. And the newsroom really&comma; really&comma; really roared. Especially in the first Trump period.So not only does this produce great journalism&comma; it seems like it becomes a business success story — the paper becomes profitable again. Then&comma; after Trump left the White House&comma; there was a lot of hand-wringing about what happens after the Trump bump. People expected audiences to decline across lots of different publications&comma; and that happened&comma; so it makes sense that the Post would struggle a bit. But the numbers you hear about the reported losses — $77 million in 2023&comma; $100 million in 2024 — are staggering. I still don&apos;t understand how you can swing to losses like that just because your traffic goes down. What am I missing?I share your knowledge gap.One of the things that has been reported and pretty well substantiated is they may have over-indexed on staff growth. They vaulted up over a thousand in early 2021&comma; up to 1&comma;100. So I think they got ahead of themselves&comma; and they had to pair that back. That&apos;s one of the things.Another consideration is that the digital advertising market sort of dried up&comma; so that was a big deal.It&apos;s all somewhat of a mystery&comma; but I don&apos;t doubt that there are meaningful losses.Can this just be as simple as the Post overhiring? Lots of companies have done that — the tech guys did during the pandemic.No&comma; I don&apos;t think so. Especially if you look at the more recent past&comma; when they tinkered with the opinion side and shot themselves in the foot.In October 2024&comma; the Post announced it would not be endorsing a candidate in the presidential election. And that happened after the Washington Post editorial board had drafted an editorial in favor of Kamala Harris. And hell broke loose — a subscription desertion of hundreds of thousands.That&apos;s an astonishing number. I remember thinking that it couldn&apos;t be real.The cause and effect could not have been more direct. People said&comma; \"No way. I&apos;m not giving my money to this organization.\"The Post has continued to do lots of news reporting that is critical of the Trump administration. Which made me curious about this line in editor Matt Murray&apos;s explanation of the cuts this week. He praises the work the paper has done&comma; and then points out problems&comma; and says \"even as we produce much excellent work&comma; we too often write from one perspective&comma; for one slice of the audience.\" It almost sounds like what David Ellison and Bari Weiss say about remaking CBS News. Does that mean we should expect the Post&apos;s news reporting to change in some sort of ideological way?If Matt Murray or any of his top editors had actually edited that memo&comma; they would&apos;ve asked for specifics. And they would&apos;ve put a big question mark alongside that and ask&comma; \"What the hell are you talking about here? Why are you speaking in such elliptical language? Why are you trying to whisper to the newsroom some message that you&apos;re not willing to articulate?\"We need to ask him exactly what he&apos;s saying. I think that that is coded language&comma; and I think that could be political.It&apos;s a strange thing for the executive editor to be saying. It&apos;s almost as if he&apos;s asking for some force to adjust the newsroom cadence and its sensibility — when he has the power to do that.(Editor&apos;s note: Business Insider contacted the Post for comment&comma; but didn&apos;t hear back immediately.)Why does Jeff Bezos own The Washington Post? It seems to be nothing but a headache for him the last few years. It doesn&apos;t seem like it helps him curry favor with Donald Trump. It&apos;s not like he&apos;s using it to buy the \"Melania\" documentary for $75 million. What is the upside for him&comma; and why does he continue to own it&comma; do you think?Erik Wemple: I have no idea. That is something all of us in the media trade have been trying to figure out. It is entirely a black box.Many years ago&comma; he seemed to be deriving a great deal of satisfaction from this. There was a close bond between The Washington Post Establishment and Bezos. I&apos;m pretty sure it isn&apos;t as strong as it once was.So I think that the enjoyment he got from his association with his institution has probably faded.But in 2024&comma; he said&comma; \"We saved The Washington Post once&comma; and we&apos;re going to save it a second time.\" So there&apos;s another challenge&comma; right? I guess that that would be something that he would derive some pleasure from. And I would imagine that if he wanted to get really involved and engaged&comma; the way he was back in 2013-2015&comma; the newsroom would welcome that.A lot of the success stories we hear about in digital media these days are specifically publications that are focused largely or entirely on Washington&comma; DC: Politico&comma; Axios&comma; Punchbowl&comma; Semafor. Some of them have direct DNA from The Washington Post. Is there any chance of the Post reclaiming any of that&comma; either through an acquisition or just by focusing on Washington and policy?They have this Washington Post Intelligence thing now&comma; which is sort of akin to that. But I don&apos;t know if there are new streams of revenue opening up at the Post. And I think that that&apos;s one of the reasons that the staff is so disaffected and so disappointed in the current management — they don&apos;t see any sort of progress towards new business.They&apos;re just seeing cuts.I think they&apos;re seeing cuts. And also a fair amount of silence. I don&apos;t think that they&apos;re getting the feedback from management that they deserve.","summary":"After Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2013, the billionaire was considered a model owner.

William Lewis, publisher of The Washington Post, and blue-eyed boy of its owner, Jeff Bezos, scarcely attended meetings with the editorial staff of the venerable newspaper since he took over in early 2024. But he set alarm bells ringing across the newsroom with less-than-constructive comments to journalists such as “People are not reading your stuff”, openly calling for staff who “do not feel aligned with the company’s plan” to leave, and reportedly describing some of them as “activists, not journalists.”\n\nDriving internal corporate disenchantment with the journalistic practices of the nearly 150-year-old newspaper was an apparent deepening ideological clash between the management and the long-standing, well-considered political position of the Post on a number of issues. For example, Mr. Bezos’s decision to end the established practice of endorsing a presidential candidate before the U.S. election — thus effectively avoiding the image of the newspaper supporting Kamala Harris in November 2024 — raised eyebrows among insiders and external observers alike. Last year, he said that the opinion pages would defend “two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”.\n\nIt should have come as little surprise then that the Post has now led what is widely being described as a “bloodbath” for quality journalism. In what will be remembered as a pivotal moment in the struggle of the U.S. media to stand up to challenging economic conditions and a president who routinely denigrates the free press of the country, Editor-in-Chief Matt Murray, reportedly told employees this week that the newspaper was undergoing a “strategic reset to better position the publication for the future”. To this end, he announced sweeping layoffs of close to one-third of all editorial staff across departments, including international desks and correspondents worldwide, the books and sports divisions, and metro and cultural coverage.\n\nAt first glance, the proposal — apparently the motivation for this large-scale termination exercise — to narrow the focus of the broadsheet exclusively to politics and national security coverage might work in theory; yet upon closer inspection it fails the common sense test. Even if we accept the premise of the management that it is unprofitable to pursue the idea of a broad news offering — in the face of evidence to the contrary, offered by The New York Times, for example — how is the bottom line served by a strategy that rips away some of the finest international reporters and desk editors who are critical to producing quality journalism in politics and national security? A simple example highlights the contradictions inherent: shutting down reporting hubs in Ukraine — as reports suggest the Post has done — would directly impinge upon the newspaper’s coverage of the machinations of the Donald Trump-led White House as it seeks to curry favour with Russia or reset ties with Europe by brazenly undermining NATO unity.\n\nThe deep learning for media houses across the free and democratic world is this: overzealous corporate owners of newspapers who are prone to genuflection to their political masters will happily seize the excuse of falling subscriptions or profits, even of a publication with a rich, hoary legacy of quality journalism, to re-bundle it as a prosaic, pliant publication that might offer a steady income stream to shareholders.\n\nEditorial leaders who hope to avoid this fate would do the opposite of what the combative Mr. Lewis suggested, which is to pre-empt an exodus of readers and financial losses by reassessing what the core readership of the publication cares about and double down on multi-pronged offerings built on the latest and most suitable technology platforms.\n\nThe fate of the Post is a cautionary tale and its moral is this: while democracy may die in darkness, the free press dies in broad daylight.\n\nnarayan@thehindu.co.in","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-free-press-dies-in-broad-daylight/article70596249.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/x3qq9m/article70597444.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2026-02-04T220348Z_839532254_RC24FJAGCXO6_RTRMADP_3_WASHINGTON-POST-LAYOFFS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 20:09:10","author":"The New York","authors":["The New York"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":399816838,"title":"Washington Post top editor admits morale issues plagued paper long before brutal layoffs","text":"Washington Post executive editor Matt Murray admitted he has work to do to boost morale at the \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" paper after the company laid off hundreds of staffers Wednesday. The Post announced during a somber Zoom webinar it is shuttering the sports desk in its current form, dialing back its international coverage, shrinking its Metro staff and eliminating its books section in a layoff round that affected one-third of the company. Staffers are stunned and upset, but Murray doesn’t believe those feelings are anything new. \"I think morale has been a challenge at the Post for a while. It was a problem when I showed up, and it remains one in some ways now,\" Murray told Fox News Digital. WASHINGTON POST CLOSES SPORTS DEPARTMENT, CUTS OTHER SECTIONS AS PART OF SWEEPING LAYOFFS Murray, tasked with delivering the news to Post staffers, said much of the journalism industry is grappling with morale issues because of \"cost pressures\" and the constant changes to the way people consume media. Murray said Post leaders have tried to be forthright about the challenges that resulted in layoffs, and he’s hoping to \"turn the page.\" \"That's going to be partly on me,\" Murray said. \"But people, I hope, would feel ‘they're really tackling some stuff that's been building up for a while, and we're in a different position.’ It'll be up to us to bear that out in the coming months, but I'm pretty confident we can do that.\" One of the ways Murray hopes to boost morale among remaining employees is to promote their work. He said the Post will continue to \"produce an awful lot and break a lot of scoops and stories,\" and internal changes will help journalists \"get more mileage and leverage out of those stories.\" \"That also happens to be the most fun thing you can do in a newsroom, so I want to continue to try to help encourage people to develop, to find and get great stories. And we're going to continue to stand behind those stories and put them out there,\" Murray said. WASHINGTON POST'S TOP EDITOR BACKS JEFF BEZOS AS CRITICS LASH OUT OVER STRUGGLING PAPER'S LAYOFFS \"The Post has been dealing with different kinds of problems for some number of years now,\" he added. \"We want to be in a different period, [after] this painful exercise, and that's a period of collaboration, growth, innovation and reinventing the place for the future.\" Indeed, the Post has been battling internal morale issues for several years, while grappling with large financial losses. There have been multiple leaders, and therefore directions, since billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' $250 million purchase of the Post from the Graham family dynasty in 2013. Publisher and CEO Will Lewis angered many in 2024 when he bluntly told staffers, \"We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff. Right. I can’t sugarcoat it anymore.\" Previous rounds of layoffs and cost-cutting measures have also aggravated the rank-and-file, and Bezos famously upset liberals in 2024 by scrapping the Post's planned endorsement of Kamala Harris. The last-minute move sparked massive subscription cancellations and sparked ire inside and outside the newsroom. Bezos announced last year the Post's editorial pages would promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" going forward and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles, further antagonizing his critics. Things were so bad that, in July, Lewis urged staffers who didn’t \"feel aligned\" with the paper's direction to take a buyout and leave. In addition to rounds of layoffs and buyout offers, the Post has faced an exodus of top talent in recent years, many of whom fled to outlets like The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNN and The Atlantic. WASHINGTON POST CEO URGES STAFFERS WHO DON'T ‘FEEL ALIGNED’ WITH PAPER'S NEW DIRECTION TO TAKE BUYOUT While times have been tough at the Post, Wednesday's layoffs have sparked even more backlash. Ukraine correspondent Lizzie Johnson announced she was \"just laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone\" in a post that has nearly 13 million views on X as of Thursday afternoon. Thousands of comments, including many from fellow journalists across the industry, pointed to her situation to blast the Post and its billionaire owner. When asked about Johnson being let go specifically, Murray said he has \"a lot of appreciation\" and understands her frustration. \"Lizzie's a terrific reporter who's done great work in a very difficult situation for us, and I'm incredibly grateful to her and in awe of her courage and her talent. I don't blame her for being upset. That's a natural reaction, and it's understandable,\" Murray said. \"We have different employees in different sensitive situations. And we've been as proactive as we can be in anticipating and dealing with all of those, and we are going to help everybody in the best circumstances that they can,\" he added. \"They’ve been out there risking their lives for us.\" WASHINGTON POST STAFFER SAYS MORALE IS DOWN, COLLEAGUES THINK MANAGEMENT IS LYING: ‘A LOT OF SAD HERE’ Murray said these types of cuts are \"obviously tough on a human level,\" but he’s confident the Post needed to drastically slash its headcount to land on \"sounder footing.\" \"We are still a large, robust newsroom with hundreds and hundreds of journalists here, some of whom are the best in the world,\" he added. \"And, so, I think we're well-positioned once we get past this difficult moment and have a strong foundation for the future.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital’s Joseph A.

As a Democratic Party fundraiser, he helped rally lawyers for Kamala Harris' failed 2024 presidential campaign against Donald Trump. His clients have included major Wall Street banks and the National Football League.\n\nKarp's nearly 18-year run atop Paul Weiss unravelled in days after he surfaced in news reports this week about his links to Epstein. As recently as Monday, Karp had internal support within the firm, a person familiar with the matter said. By late Wednesday evening, he had decided to relinquish his chairmanship, resulting in Barshay ascending to lead the firm. Karp brought Barshay to Paul Weiss from rival firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore in 2016.\n\nKarp met Epstein through his work representing Leon Black, co-founder and former chairman of Apollo Global Management, a Paul Weiss spokesperson said this week. “During the course of that representation, which spanned several years, Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct. Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets,” the spokesperson said.\n\nEmails released by the Justice Department show Karp trading messages and meeting with Epstein for years until early 2019. In March 2019, Karp reviewed a draft court filing concerning a bid to reopen a non-prosecution agreement Epstein had secured more than a decade earlier.\n\n\"The draft motion is in great shape. It's overwhelmingly persuasive.

The only way you can get around to talk to 30,000 people.\"\n\n\"Think about me sitting at a waiting line at United,\" Sen. Sanders added. \"No apologies for that. That's what campaign travel is about. That's what we've done in the past. We're going to do it in the future.\"\n\nAnd, of course, there's the climate hypocrisy. Sanders supports the economy-killing \"Green New Deal\" and calls climate change an \"existential threat\" to the world. Yet he will fly a private jet, which has a massive carbon footprint. Sacrifices are the things we little guys have to make to save the planet.\n\nAn oligarchy is a system of governance in which power is held by a small, elite group, decisions are made to benefit the few, and citizens have little say in the system. Instead, power is concentrated in the hands of unelected elites who control institutions such as the media, the courts, and education. They have rules that protect the insiders and disadvantage their opponents, and there's limited accountability for the elite and their friends.\n\nWhich party does that sound like? Democrats are the ones who installed Kamala Harris as the nominee without a single vote; they're the party that owns most of the media, has activist judges, and runs our schools. They believe they're above the law (see Don Lemon) while using the full weight of the law to attack Republicans.\n\nAs with everything the Democrats say, claims of \"oligarchy\" are pure projection, and Bernie Sanders proves it.\n\nEditor’s Note: The 2026 Midterms will determine the fate of President Trump’s America First agenda. Republicans must maintain control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nHelp Townhall continue to report on the Democrats’ radicalism and inform voters as our nation faces a crossroads.

Gavin Newsom’s new memoir?","text":"In 2004, Gavin Newsom, at the time the mayor of San Francisco, posed with his then-wife Kimberly Guilfoyle for a magazine photograph that quickly became infamous.\n\nIn the photo, the couple lay entwined on a fancy carpet, wearing dinner attire, in a posh San Francisco home owned by the oil rich Getty family with a sweeping view of the Pacific Ocean visible behind them.\n\nWhen the magazine published the story, members of Newsom’s own staff were taken by surprise by the photograph, according to a 2024 look back on the incident by New York Magazine. One Newsom aid who spoke to that magazine recalled immediately recognizing it was an embarrassing photo that would be around “for a long time.”\n\nMore than two decades later, Newsom is still trying to shake off the image of anointed California elitist that the photograph so roundly captures. He’s reportedly continuing to texturize that image through a forthcoming memoir that this week received coverage in select national media outlets.\n\nIn the book, “Young Man in a Hurry,” Newsom reportedly describes an ascension to adulthood that was more fraught than the photograph — and a long and well-documented association with the Gettys in business and in politics — would imply. This week brought stories in Vogue, The New York Times, Politico and The New Yorker, written by reporters who had received advanced copies of the book.\n\nThe Sacramento Bee asked a Newsom spokesperson for a copy but was not provided one.\n\nNewsom doesn’t have much in common with voters in states like Ohio or Pennsylvania, Dan Schnur, who teaches political communications at University of California Berkeley and University of Southern California, said.\n\n“There’s no way that he’s going to be able to eliminate that gulf,” Schnur said. But, “maybe he can shrink it, just a little bit.”\n\nHence the memoir.\n\nBook tour comes before campaign trail\n\n“If a year from now, he’s campaigning in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the local media includes one of these anecdotes along with the Getty stories, maybe it provides him opportunity with otherwise skeptical voters,” Schnur said.\n\nNewsom is starting with more southern voters, according to Politico, which reported on Thursday that the governor will launch his book tour in Nashville, Tennessee, later this month.\n\nNews of Newsom’s book comes five months after former Vice President Kamala Harris’ memoir on her failed presidential campaign, Schnur noted, and a little more than a week after a memoir from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — another rumored 2028 candidate.\n\nFor Newsom, this week’s memoir headlines come as he continues to ride a high-profile national moment. In January, the governor made headlines during a trip to an economic conference in Davos, Switzerland — perhaps the most elite gathering there is — where he accused President Donald Trump of trying to silence him and then used his appearance to excoriate the president as an authoritarian.\n\nNewsom’s effort, in conjunction with the California Legislature, to redraw the state’s political maps to counter Trump and Republicans’ efforts in Texas also continues to reverberate. On Wednesday, Newsom celebrated the U.S. Supreme Court’s rejection of Republicans’ appeal of that law.\n\nNewsom’s book has been described by the journalists who’ve read it as leaning more toward the personal than the political, with the storytelling ending before his tenure as governor began.\n\nMentor Willie Brown expects an honest account\n\nAnd that makes sense to former governor Gray Davis, a Newsom supporter who said the current governor operates off “pure guts” and the strength of his own convictions. Newsom is by any account an accomplished politician, as the two-term governor of the nation’s largest state and a global economic powerhouse, Davis said.\n\n“He’s entitled to write a book about his life as he perceives it,” Davis said. “His challenges will come as a surprise to people; they will see his life was not just smooth as silk.”\n\nDavis has not seen a copy of the book. Neither has Willie Brown, the longest-serving speaker of the California Assembly, who reportedly plays a big role in it. In his latter political act as mayor of San Francisco, Brown gave Newsom the appointment to the board of supervisors that started his political career.\n\n“Newsom’s selection isn’t much of a surprise,” San Francisco Chronicle columnists wrote at the time. “He’s got the right look, the right political connections and money.”\n\nBrown told The Bee that Newsom didn’t ask for the job. “I had to talk him into taking the job, frankly,” he said. Brown anticipates an accurate and not overstated memoir from his one-time political mentee, he said.\n\n“He’s had a long time now to become acquainted with the voters and for them to become acquainted with him” Brown said. “I don’t know anything about him or his career that would be distasteful.”\n\nBut according to the published media reports, Newsom takes on in the book some of the public scars he accumulated over the course of his career. Those include a high-profile affair with the wife of his chief of staff, after his marriage to Guilfoyle ended, as well as his struggles with alcohol, according to the reporting on the book. He also describes his mother’s death, a medical suicide before the concept was legally sanctioned, in stark terms. “There was no peace that blanketed her,” Newsom writes in the book, according to Politico.\n\nSome news accounts have noted omissions in the book. Newsom said baseball gave him the chance to attend Santa Clara University, the New York Times reported, but leaves out that he received a letter of recommendation from a family friend on the school’s board of regents, and another from former governor Jerry Brown. CalMatters has also previously reported that Newsom embellished his career with the college’s baseball team, a charge Newsom rebuffs.\n\nBut Willie Brown, the former mayor and speaker was not worried that Newsom would overly burnish his own story in his book. “In some cases they overstate,” Brown said of politicians who write biographies, “in some cases they understate, and in many cases they are not accurate. I’m sure he will say who he is.”","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article314589131.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/public/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/butkf0/picture314589805/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_CHofF_05_HA_02062024.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 18:52:08","author":"Andrew Graham","authors":["Andrew Graham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":399788014,"title":"Trump says he needs election wins to feed ‘own ego’","text":"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump, who was elected twice to the nation’s highest office but still refuses to concede his 2020 defeat, said Thursday he needed to win at polls to satisfy his ego.\n\n“They rigged the second election.

He's dumb, but he's also totally, weirdly, sort of disconnected. His ideas don't connect,’ he said in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail on Tuesday.\n\nCarolla, who lives in California, revealed that he once hosted Newsom on his show in 2013 for a political conversation and found the then-lieutenant governor strangely disconnected. \n\n‘I'm not speaking, you know, hyperbolically because I hate him and I think he's ruining our state,’ Carolla said. ‘He is a sociopathic guy. When you talk to him, he doesn't provide answers, he talks in circles, it's all double talk.’\n\nAs a podcaster, Carolla said he interviews a lot of people and learned to appreciate someone who was thoughtful and spoke honestly.\n\n‘You know, when you interview Gavin Newsom, you go, I have no idea who this guy is. Sociopath. I don't think he knows who he is, he's a chameleon. He'll say anything in front of anyone at any time. All the time. His story will change all the time,’ he reflected.\n\nCarolla spoke to the Daily Mail after performing at the Trump-Kennedy center last weekend and ahead of his appearances in Orlando on Thursday and Naples, Florida this weekend. \n\nVogue Magazine was ridiculed online after contributing editor Maya Singer described the governor as 'embarrassingly handsome' in a profile and 'at ease with his own eminence.'\n\nCarolla noted that Newsom liked to pretend he grew up in a poor household with his single mother, even as his father worked closely with the wealthy Getty family in San Francisco and managed their trusts.\n\n‘He grew up a rich kid. He's always been a rich kid. He's a sociopathic jerk who's semi-retarded and just makes bad policy that destroyed California,’ he said.\n\nNewsom launched his own podcast after the 2024 election, interviewing Charlie Kirk, Steve Bannon, and other conservative personalities. He has also seized the opportunity to appear for interviews with other podcasters. \n\nThroughout his political career, Carolla noted, Newsom had relied on his good looks and chameleon abilities to succeed.\n\n‘For some reason, dumb women or many women, not just the dumb ones, mistake whatever his look and his vibe is for being competent,’ he said.\n\nCurrently Newsom leads many of the early polls of the 2028 presidential race on the Democratic side, as he has taken an increasingly combative tone with President Donald Trump.\n\nCarolla predicted that once voters learned more about Newsom’s record in California they would quickly lose interest.\n\n‘Once people start really delving into the corruption that is California, mix that with the wildfires, mix that with his atrocious record and, you know, sleeping around with his ex-campaign manager's wife and all that kind of stuff, he's not gonna go anywhere,’ he said.\n\nNewsom would face additional scrutiny, Carolla predicted, from his failed $24 billion project to reduce homelessness and his high-speed rail project that was billions of dollars over budget.\n\n‘Only super leftist dumbos who live in California will buy into this because it's an aesthetic that they're buying into,’ he said.\n\nBut Carolla admitted that Newsom would probably make it farther in the 2028 Democratic presidential primary than former Vice President Kamala Harris who lost to Trump in 2024.\n\n‘I don't think she's a sociopath. like Gavin Newsom, but she doesn't know anything. She has no policy, she flip-flops. Everything she says, she then walks back later on. She's an idiot, and we got a nice sample of her mentality, which is really low, and I don't think America wants that loser again,’ he said.","summary":"Comedian and podcaster Adam Carolla predicted that Americans are about to find out the truth about California governor Gavin Newsom as he prepares for a book tour ahead of his likely run for president.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15528149/Adam-Carolla-delivers-brutal-warning-betting-Gavin-Newsom-exposes-sociopathic-act.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/02/05/14/106115141-0-image-a-7_1770300815253.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2026/02/04/2265500862255709539/1024x576_MP4_2265500862255709539.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-05 18:27:12","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":399788816,"title":"Epstein emails lead Brad Karp to resign as Paul Weiss law firm chairman","text":"KARP, FIRM HAVE BEEN CRITICISED FOR DEAL WITH TRUMP\n\nKarp, who began his career at Paul Weiss in the early 1980s and had chaired the firm since 2008, attended dinners with Epstein and sought his help getting his son a job with a Woody Allen film production, according to the firm and a Reuters review of emails that were among millions of documents the Justice Department released as part of the Epstein files.\n\nA litigator who helped increase Paul Weiss' annual revenue under his leadership to more than US$2.6 billion in 2024, Karp built a reputation as a defender of Wall Street while also championing social justice causes.

Take this opinion piece by Margaret Sullivan as an example. Sullivan worked as the Post's media reporter for a few years and she is outraged about the layoffs.\n\nWould you inherit a rare Stradivarius violin, polish it up for a few years, and then decide to take a hammer to it?Would you somehow acquire the Hope diamond, set it in a blue velvet case, and then toss the whole thing into the Potomac River?These incomprehensible acts are not too far afield from what Jeff Bezos is doing these days with the Washington Post, where self-inflicted wounds are wreaking what may be permanent damage to a great newspaper......he is doing so at a time when strong, fact-based journalism could not be more important in America and around the world.\n\nA Stradivarius doesn't lose $100 million a year. Neither does the Hope diamond. These things are valuable because...they're valuable. The Post is not valuable because in the past three years it has lost more than a quarter billion dollars.\n\nA couple of things about this. First, the Post just fired about 300 people including the entire sports writing staff, the book section and many of their overseas journalists. People obviously like sports and books but is the world desperately in need of strong, fact-based sports reporting? It just feels like the hype over what's being lost here exceeds the reality by quite a bit. There are other sports outlets covering the topic. Democracy will not die in darkness over this.\n\nSecond, Sullivan is refusing to say what she really means, which is that the Post was a center for resistance journalism in Trump's first term and she wishes they would be again. That's what she really means by strong, fact-based journalism. She makes that explicit in the very next paragraph.\n\nHe should reverse course. He can preserve a great news organization and maybe even recover his own legacy as the paper’s steward – a legacy that was looking good for years until he took a strange, Trump-related bad turn...When Trump, in his first administration, threatened the Post and disparaged its owner personally, Bezos didn’t buckle....this billionaire should turn himself around, heal the self-inflicted wounds, and help Washington Post journalism survive and thrive at this crucial time for American democracy.\n\nIt's not very subtle. Sullivan, who has always been a left-wing hack, wants Bezos to also be a left-wing hack. Re-join the anti-Trump team and take the losses for democracy. That's exactly what she means. \"Strong, fact-based journalism\" is code speak for money losing, anti-Trump agitprop.\n\nAll of the articles I've read are like this. They all basically say Bezos should take a hit for the team. The team being the left-wing writers and the left-wing audience all of whom he has been subsidizing. They praise the Post's epic journalism and then in the next paragraph they admit it's all about being anti-Trump. That is in fact what makes it epic. Another example:\n\nWhatever the Post is worth today is immaterial to Bezos’ wealth. It’s barely even what you’d call a rounding error...A man worth more than $240 billion does not care even a little bit, in pure dollar terms, about a $100 million annual loss running a prestige business...The Post itself doesn’t affect Bezos’ vast fortune much, but what it represents does. One of the employees he laid off on Wednesday was the paper’s Amazon reporter, Caroline O’Donovan. More critically, even under Bezos’ ownership, the Post frequently published stories that upset the Trump administration, whose vindictive approach to regulation could pose obvious problems for Amazon and Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin.Bezos understood this risk more than a year ago, when he drove away 250,000 paying subscribers by stepping in to prevent the paper from endorsing Kamala Harris. Bezos then transformed the Post’s opinion section, away from a broad-based page and into a propaganda arm devoted to promoting “personal liberties and free markets.”\n\nThe Post's opinion section wasn't a \"broad-based page.\" It was a dumpster fire of anti-Trump writers like Jennifer Rubin, Greg Sargent, Dana Milbank, E.J. Dionne and Perry Bacon. When the Post was succeeding during Trump's first term, this is what was driving the train. It wasn't great sports journalism or foreign correspondents, it was the constant stream of anti-Trump invective. All of the authors mourning the paper's death this week think Bezos should have kept funding that at a loss for life.\n\nOne more. This one is written by Ashley Parker for the Atlantic. She writes at length about what a wonderful place the Post was for employees, but when it comes to the politics she avoids saying it plainly.\n\nI don’t pretend to have the answers to the Post’s financial woes, or a successful business model for a local paper that is also the nation’s hometown paper. But I can tell you what will be lost if these two men—who don’t seem to understand what the Post was, what it still is, and what it could be—continue to treat it like a distressed asset or a bargaining chip with a president who, ultimately, does not respect bargaining supplicants.\n\nAfter ranting about the failure of leadership for a bit, Parker offers this paragraph which seems to be simultaneously saying the Post could appeal to more people and that the Post should stick faithfully with it's current audience (of Trump-hating progressives). \n\n...general-interest publications can be profitable. The New York Times has shown there is money to be made by diversifying, expanding, experimenting, offering something for everyone. (News! Audio! Games! Cooking! Video! Long-form!) The publication you’re reading now is profitable, and has nearly 1.5 million subscribers. Other specialty publications, such as Axios and Punchbowl News, have succeeded by tripling down on the needs and interests of their core audience. The Post, instead, is abandoning its current audience in search of one that may not exist.\n\nSo there's money to be made in expanding and trying new things, but also, a different audience may not exist. Which is it? Parker wants clear leadership from Bezos but she can't seem to decide in which direction.\n\nUltimately, they're all saying the same handful of things. They want the Post to be an anti-Trump outlet for progressives and they want Jeff Bezos to pay for it. The fact that he's saying no to this demand is an outrage or a tragedy or maybe both. The level of entitlement radiating from these people is blinding.\n\nKeith Olbermann is an exhausting, left-wing kook and also not really so different from the authors quoted above. If Ashley Parker is the left's presentable, award-winning superego, Olbermann is it's raving id. He wants Democrats to use the government to destroy Jeff Bezos as a punishment for Bezos turning his back on progressives at the Post. It's interesting how the same basic message sounds a lot more straight-forward when presented as the rage bait it really is.\n\nAFTER HE KILLED THE WaPOST, WE MUST END THE JEFF BEZOS CARTEL.Bezos killed that paper to spend the $75m to lie to Trump that his wife was an attractive \"movie star.\" Dems must use anti-trust to bankrupt himGET THE NEW THURSDAY COUNTDOWN PODCAST: https://t.co/C4JDFEQDrX pic.twitter.com/0DGubvNNvC— Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) February 5, 2026\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

The passwords shown included “waytooonline,” “thebabysitterisweird” and “project2025isreal,” with “headquarters” being revealed as the correct one. \n\nThe video ended with just the word “TOMORROW,” which quickly sparked questions about whether Harris, a top potential 2028 contender, is officially announcing another bid for the White House. \n\nA number of users on X had mixed reactions to the post.\n\n“oh we’re gonna lib the f--- out,” said Josh Sorbe, the press secretary for Senate Judiciary Democrats.\n\nPolitical consultant Michael Duncan wrote, “Please be a podcast please be a podcast.”\n\nOne user posted that she “only got 107 days last time so it’s only fair she gets 3 years this time,” while another added, “It’s happening, yall!” with a screaming gif.\n\n“omg shes about to tease her new album….,\" someone else joked.\n\nMeanwhile, several allies and supporters of President Donald Trump celebrated the speculation.\n\n“Christmas is coming SUPER early this year!” conservative influencer Nick Sortor posted.\n\nEric Daughtery, a popular MAGA commentator, called Harris “probably the Trump campaign’s greatest weapon in 2024,” adding: “So glad to have you back.”\n\n“Republicans approve this message,” another user wrote, attaching a graphic of Vice President JD Vance wearing a 2028 hat.\n\nThe Trump War Room account responded with “LET’S GOOOO.”\n\nOn Thursday, the vice president’s rapid response account has since been rebranded as “Headquarters,” a new media initiative in partnership with the People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy group. The project is intended to serve as a new “Gen-Z led progressive content hub,” according to a post on the account.\n\nIn a launch video on X, Harris said that Headquarters will be “where you can go online to get basically the latest of what’s going on, and also to meet and revisit with some of our great, courageous leaders.”\n\n“I’m really excited about it,” she added. “So stay engaged, and I’ll see you out there.”\n\nHarris, who has not announced an intention to run, has emerged as one of the top Democratic hopefuls in early polling for the 2028 election. She has been pitted against California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, among others.","summary":"Her campaign account's first post since her 2024 election loss triggered widespread speculation.","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/its-happening-rumors-swirl-of-this-democrats-run-for-president-in-2028.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/QMAERMQIIVH5ZMWY6SCVD5XE6U.jpg?auth=acfd69fc3188c089777d0c0a25c137e4587afcb780397ba59c1e7e0d4cb12dbd&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 18:17:29","author":"Rachel Cohen","authors":["Rachel Cohen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":399802970,"title":"Trump, 79, Gets Trolled for Shaky Health by Comeback Rival","text":"Kamala Harris is trying to reenter the national spotlight by weighing in on the national conversation about Donald Trump’s health.\n\nThe former presidential candidate, 61, has breathed new life into her dormant 2024 campaign social media accounts, rebranding them from “Kamala HQ” to simply “HQ” and announcing in an online video that she is launching a “Gen-Z led progressive content hub.”\n\nHarris’ team quickly fired back—on a subject that appears to particularly bother the president. “This type of pain, or…?” the HQ account wrote alongside a photo of Trump’s hands, where prominent dark bruising is visible.\n\nThe bruising—typically most noticeable on Trump’s right hand—has been extensively documented by the Daily Beast and is often obscured by a thick, frequently mismatched layer of concealer. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has insisted the marks stem from aspirin use and because Trump “shakes hands on a daily basis [more] than any other President in history.”\n\nBut Harris’ HQ didn’t stop there. The account followed up with two videos of Trump delivering remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, where he rambled about the 2020 presidential election and questioned whether he would make it into heaven.\n\n“I really think I probably should make it,” Trump said Thursday. “Mentioned 38,000 times in the Epstein files btw,” the Harris account captioned the clip.\n\nHQ also took aim at White House Communications Director and presidential attack-dog Steven Cheung—posting only a close-up image of his face, without commentary.\n\nHarris’ rebrand, a joint effort with the progressive nonprofit People For the American Way, is likely an attempt to reposition herself ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run, Politico reported.\n\nThe former vice president has stopped short of making any official announcements, but told the BBC last fall that she is “not done” with her presidential ambitions. her campaign still owes money from her 2024 failure, and some Democrats have been keen to see her stay out of the race. She decided against a run for governor of California.\n\nHarris, however, may have another Trump-troll to contend with: current California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Tensions have reportedly mounted between the two Democrats—who were sworn in on the same day two decades ago—as they each position themselves for a likely 2028 bid.\n\nA recent Yale Youth Poll of 3,426 registered voters—including 1,706 aged 18 to 34—found Newsom leading Democratic preferences for 2028 with 25 percent support and an 85 percent electability rating, followed by Harris at 18 percent.","summary":"Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty ImagesKamala Harris is trying to reenter the national spotlight by weighing in on the national conversation about Donald Trump’s health.\n\nThe former presidential candidate, 61, has breathed new life into her dormant 2024 campaign social media accounts, rebranding them from “Kamala HQ” to simply “HQ” and announcing in an online video that she is launching a “Gen-Z led progressive content hub.”\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-79-gets-trolled-for-shaky-health-by-comeback-rival-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/IBOR4IG2F5FWDP46QMVR5PSCN4.jpg?smart=true&auth=8492c075f524835b7ff54cf0e5f0ec2ba11459f482595ac34f4201afb9ff7f24&width=1200&height=675","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 18:17:24","author":"Laura Esposito","authors":["Laura Esposito"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":399800356,"title":"Virginia Democrats agree to new map that gives Republicans just one seat","text":"In the 2024 presidential election, Virginia voters supported former Vice President Kamala Harris with 51.8% of the vote compared to 46.1% for President Donald Trump.\n\nIn an X post, Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a Democrat, announced that the 10-1 map secured the 21 votes needed to pass the state Senate. Another photo posted on X showing Lucas next to Democratic Virginia House Speaker Don Scott said the two bodies agreed to a 10-1 map.\n\n“Donald Trump knows he is going to lose the midterms, he knows it,” Lucas said after an agreement was reached.\n\nThe official map will be released on Friday, but it still needs voter approval in an April referendum.\n\nA spokesperson for Gov. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) said state elections officials have said the map will be used in the midterm elections, according to the Virginia Scope.\n\n“The Governor’s priority has been upholding the integrity of Virginia’s elections,” the spokesperson said. “Her team has been working throughout this process to make sure any proposed map could actually be implemented on the quick timeline.”\n\nThe path forward is complicated, as legal challenges have already arisen in the redistricting efforts. \n\nLast week, a Tazewell County Circuit Court judge ruled that the legislature’s constitutional amendment to redistrict the congressional map was improperly passed.\n\nThe judge said there were procedural errors in the special session used to advance it after the first of the two sessions to vote on the map occurred during early voting for the 2025 elections.\n\nDemocrats are appealing the decision, and the case could reach the Virginia Supreme Court.\n\nIf the appeal succeeds, voters may decide in the April 21 referendum whether to amend the state constitution to allow the legislature to redraw the map, possibly in time for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nIn Virginia, establishing a partisan gerrymander necessitates a constitutional amendment through a ballot measure because the state’s congressional map is currently drawn by a constitutionally mandated independent commission. This legal process for bypassing independent redistricting mirrors the requirements found in California.\n\nVirginia’s redistricting debate has unfolded against a backdrop of intense nationwide battles over congressional map lines, driven in part by both parties’ efforts to shape the House before the 2026 midterm elections. \n\nLucas said Trump has called on states such as Texas to approve Republican-favored maps. \n\n“We made a promise to level the playing field,” Lucas said. “Trump started this mess, and Virginia is going to finish it.”\n\nNeighboring Maryland has also tried to redraw congressional lines to favor Democrats, but the measure has faced opposition. Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Democrat, has been a roadblock in passing such a map, citing legal concerns.\n\nEarlier redraws in Republican-led Texas enacted a map designed to yield additional GOP seats. Legal disputes over the new congressional map made it all the way to the Texas Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the GOP-favoring map.\n\nDemocratic voters in California approved a ballot initiative that would redraw its congressional districts in a way that flipped up to five Republican seats. After facing challenges from the Trump administration, the Supreme Court allowed the new map to be used in the 2026 elections.","summary":"Virginia Democrats announced on Thursday that they agreed on a proposed congressional map that would include 10 Democrat-leaning seats and just one Republican-leaning seat.

He will officially step into Iger’s shoes next month, while Walden will be elevated to a new position as chief creative officer.\n\nAnother factor that may have played a part in the decision to tap D’Amaro was Walden’s handling of Jimmy Kimmel’s brief suspension in the fall, according to Variety.\n\nSources told the outlet that the Kimmel saga was widely viewed within the company as a public relations debacle disaster.\n\nA Disney source rejected the account, telling The Post: “That is completely false and just uninformed speculation from people who weren’t involved in the decision.”\n\n“Dana’s expanded remit and long-term role reflect the Board’s confidence in her leadership,” the person added.\n\nKimmel was suspended after a monologue about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in which the host accused “the MAGA gang” of politicizing the shooting and aligning themselves with the killer.\n\nKimmel also drew backlash for remarks critics viewed as mocking or minimizing the way Kirk was being memorialized, saying some conservatives were treating him “like a martyr, like Martin Luther King Jr.”\n\nThe comments sparked outrage from conservative groups and station owners, leading several ABC affiliates to pull the show.\n\nWithin days, Disney suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” amid political pressure and threats of regulatory scrutiny, only to reinstate the program following public backlash and extend Kimmel’s contract.\n\nWalden was credited by Kimmel himself with helping him navigate the fallout and think through the controversy during his suspension.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has waged an aggressive legal campaign against major media organizations including Disney. He has filed multi-billion-dollar defamation lawsuits during his latest campaign and while in office.\n\nJust a month before the inauguration last year, Disney agreed to pay $15 million to Trump’s library plus $1 million in legal fees after ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos misstated the outcome of the E. Jean Carroll civil verdict on air.\n\nMonths before the ABC settlement, CBS’s corporate parent Paramount agreed to a $16 million payment to Trump to settle a claim that “60 Minutes” deceptively edited an interview with Harris in order to make her look more favorable and boost her chances of winning the election.\n\nTrump has also launched multi-billion dollar lawsuits pending against the BBC, the New York Times, the Des Moines Register and the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by The Post’s corporate parent News Corp.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Harris and the White House.","summary":"One possible disadvantage for Walden may have been her decades-long friendship with Harris, who got trounced in the 2024 election by Donald Trump.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/02/05/business/disney-exec-dana-waldens-friendship-with-kamala-harris-may-have-affected-ceo-chances-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/02/120464436.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rlYt2AHP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-05 17:54:10","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.257},{"id":399767748,"title":"Harris relaunches her old 'Kamala HQ' account as an online organizing project","text":"Kamala Harris is relaunching - part of her social media presence.\n\nThe former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday rebooted the KamalaHQ account, which has over 1 million followers on X and more than 5 million on TikTok, as just Headquarters, which in a partnership with the left-leaning People for the American Way she's calling \"an online organizing project for next generation campaigning.\"\n\n\"Conservatives build permanent organizing infrastructure.

HARRIS, NEWSOM, STIR 2028 SPECULATION AT MAJOR DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEETING A Democratic strategist in the former vice president's political orbit told Fox News Digital that Harris \"has always said that she’s going to continue to be involved and be a strong voice for Democrats as there’s so much to push back on from the damage Trump and Republicans are doing to this country. Her revived engagement on these platforms does that, and it adds another Democratic voice in the digisphere, which we need more of.\" \"Plus, it keeps her options open for the future,\" added the strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely. 21 DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 Harris was mostly out of the headlines for a couple of months following the end of the Biden administration early last year. But she started stepping back into the political spotlight last spring and summer, including headlining Democratic National Committee fundraisers. Her announcement last summer that she would pass on running for governor this year in her home state of California also increased speculation regarding a potential 2028 White House run. And Harris, who hasn't closed any doors to running again, is currently in the middle of the second leg of her book tour around her best-selling memoir \"107 Days,\" which was the length of her 2024 presidential campaign.

From Nigel Farage saying it's \"utterly ludicrous\" for women to be able to access abortions at 24 weeks to podcasts discussing whether or not incel culture is the fault of women, it's getting harder to ignore the rise of misogynistic rhetoric. As the world seems to move further away from the #MeToo movement and closer to Gilead, how can we cope? My way involves rewatching videos of Olivia Attwood . I was first introduced to the glorious world of Attwood during COVID, when my university flatmates and I decided to binge season three of Love Island . Over 43 episodes, her quick, unfiltered wit, unabashed messiness and enormous capacity to feel everything deeply made her one of my favourite people, not just on the dating show but in the entire celebrity world. And she has remained at the top. Whenever I've been on a bad date and need advice, a good laugh or to simply rage about society, there's always a Liv Attwood clip that helps. The one I've been watching on repeat for the past few days is from an episode of her podcast, Olivia's House , where she and Grace Campbell discussed a Diary Of A CEO video in which host Steven Bartlett and his guest, Alok Kanojia , discussed incel ideology. In the video, which resurfaced recently and went viral, Kanojia seemed to suggest that the reason more men had started to go down misogynistic roots was because women were not having children with them and they were scared their DNA would die out. Bartlett's spokesperson told The Cut that he \"does not adopt the opinion of his guests, nor is the format intended to pass judgement on personal viewpoints\" and \"to suggest that a host is responsible for every view expressed by a guest is a fundamental misunderstanding of the long-form interview format\". But he did not challenge the idea. Instead he asked whether systems should be put in place to \"make sure\" men would meet partners. My initial reaction to this exchange was just to roll my eyes and turn the podcast off. There was a knotted and sick feeling in my stomach as well, but that's almost always there. It has popped up each time I went out for a drink and noticed every single woman was holding her glass in way that made drinking from it hard but stopped someone slipping in rohypnol. And again, when I had to run off a train just before the doors closed because a man decided to follow me home. It has been there since I was 11 and I realised the men staring at my newly grown boobs either didn't notice or didn't care that I was still wearing my school uniform. I've grown used to that feeling and I'm no longer surprised when men view women as little more than their sexual organs. But after I let the conversation sit with me a little longer, it was hard to get past how disgusted I really was. Bartlett may not have out and out agreed with with Kanojia, but by engaging in the conversation, he gave his ideas a platform. He facilitated a discussion in which male dissatisfaction was pinned on women and the choices they made with their own bodies. In doing so, while he features guests from across the entire political and cultural spectrum, he gave this views legitimacy. He made it sound normal. Attwood and Campbell's reactions to the podcast were much better than mine. \"We had that system,\" Attwood said in an artful put down. \"It's called the 1960s.\" Campbell added: \"It's called The Handmaid's Tale.\" Their defence against the Diary Of A CEO episode stoked something inside of me. In two sentences, Attwood and Campbell had articulated that what happened on that podcast was not okay and a world in male loneliness is valued more than female bodily autonomy is a thing of either the past or a dystopian hellscape. Or at least it should be. But it's 2026, and men are continuing to give their opinions of women's reproductive health. Nigel Farage is pushing for abortion laws to be restricted in the UK, which we've already seen happen in America. Charli XCX had one of the biggest albums last year, but in a recent interview , she was still asked about having children and told she would change her mind after she said no. Let's not forget about Andrew Tate, who pushes the idea that a woman's purpose is to have children. The era of #MeToo has morphed into one where nearly half of young men view Tate positively. An era in which Sarah Everard was murdered by a police officer and the Met's response was not that more needs to be done to protect women but that women should flag down a bus if they feel unsafe. It's an era where women are still expected to be perfect if we are to be afforded sympathy or even to be listened to. If we were too drunk, it's our fault we weren't sober enough to say no. If we're dressed too sexily, then what did we expect? If we're too loud, too vocal, too independent, it's our fault that men become incels. And then there's Olivia Attwood, who was always herself on Love Island and has gone on to have huge shows that champion women, like Getting Filthy Rich. There's women like Kerry Katona , who rightfully point out that what she puts on OnlyFans isn't any worse than what's shown in TV dramas. Women like Charli XCX whose 'brat' album started a craze of fans embracing loud, unapologetic lifestyles. I'm also reminded of Vicky Pattison something she said on a podcast last year. \"If you're worrying and putting your life on hold in some desperate attempt to look a certain way, you're just going to regret it. \"Eat the pizza. Kiss the boy. Book the flight. Whatever it is, just do it, instead of trying to reach a goal that is unattainable, because they always move the goalposts.\" Pattison certainly lived this lifestyle when she was on Geordie Shore. The former reality TV star spoke about her time on the show briefly when she was on Strictly Come Dancing. After foxtrotting to Sam Fender, she said he felt like she hadn't done much to \"make the North East proud\" in her career. Well, she may not feel like she's done Newcastle proud, but I will always be impressed by women like Pattison, Charli XCX and Attwood who had the bravery to be loud and rambunctious in the public eye. Goalposts might shift. What counts as 'high value' may become more and more restrictive. The 'Manosphere' might continue to get louder everyday. But as long as there are modern day feminist icons like Olivia Attwood and Vicky Pattison, eating pizza, kissing boys and just living their lives the way they want to on TV, they continue to prove that you don't need to be the 'ideal woman' to be lovable. You don't have to be perfect to be respected. A spokesperson for Diary Of A CEO said: \"The Diary Of A CEO is a long-form, conversational podcast designed to explore the perspectives and experiences of its guests in their own words. Inviting a guest is an act of inquiry, not endorsement. Steven Bartlett does not adopt the opinions of his guests, nor is the format intended to pass judgment on personal viewpoints. To suggest that a host is responsible for every view expressed by a guest is a fundamental misunderstanding of the long-form interview format. DOAC features guests from across the entire political and cultural spectrum. In recent months alone, guests have included Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and a yet to be published conversation with Zohran Mamdani. The podcast’s archive is a matter of public record and disproves this claim instantly.\" Like this story?

But Secrets loves nothing better than upending conventional thinking, particularly when there is money to be made.\n\nNew polling and analysis from the experts at J.L. Partners suggests that Harris (who has just overhauled her social media presence in a sign that she is preparing to run) is desperately underpriced on betting markets.\n\nLast night, she was running at 6% on Kalshi, a prediction market that covers everything from the Super Bowl result to whether President Donald Trump will sign an executive order this week. The numbers put her behind Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who led the field at 31%.\n\n“For most of last year, she topped polls of Democratic primary voters and registered Democrats overall,” J.L. Partners wrote in its latest American Pulse newsletter. “For most of 2025, we were telling our clients this was a function of name recognition – it isn’t unusual for the former nominee to top the polls, especially of disengaged voters, because they are the most well-known.”\n\nSo far, so conventional. But the firm has begun polling a much tighter cohort of Democrat primary voters (based on their voting record and declaring themselves eight or above on a 10-point scale of likelihood to vote), using criteria that weed out the name recognition effect.\n\nThe results show Harris ahead of Newsom in the nomination race, 30% to 21%. Pete Buttigieg is third on seven points, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) on four, and Shapiro on four. Ocasio-Cortez comes in on three (tied with Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL)), which suggests that the firm has indeed selected out name recognition effects.\n\nAnd there is another point. Harris’s support is built on black voters.\n\n“Among white Democratic primary voters, she is tied with Gavin Newsom on 25 per cent apiece,” the newsletter says. “But with Black Democratic primary voters, she has a twenty-nine point lead over Newsom, with 39% to 10% (no one else breaks 5%). Making up one in three voters in presidential primaries on the Dem side according to Third Way, that is a sizeable and influential group that could propel Harris to victory.”\n\nNot only does she have a polling lead, but she is well ahead with perhaps the most important constituency of all in picking Democratic nominees.\n\nHarris has not ruled out another run (telling an interviewer at the end of last year, “I am not done”). And she is in the middle of an extensive book tour promoting her campaign memoir, 107 Days. Tonight, she is in Montgomery, Alabama, with dates running all the way into April — a handy way of remaining in voters’ minds.\n\nThis morning, she rolled out her revamped KamalaHQ social media presence, rebranding it as Headquarters and saying that it will be an “organizing project for next generation campaigning.”\n\nSecrets would never promote gambling or encourage readers to indulge. But it does seem as if Harris might be worth a flutter. Even if she does not win the nomination, she will almost certainly surge at some point (and this morning, her Kalshi odds were up to 8%), allowing the astute investor an opportunity to cash out.\n\nMandy’s hotline to No. 10\n\nSecrets is reminded of an anecdote from last year when Lord Peter Mandelson (Mandy to his friends and/or enemies) was living it up as British ambassador to the United States. He was holding court on the terrace of the glorious Lutyens-designed residence, offering British journalists his take on U.S.-U.K. relations, weeks before he was fired for his connections with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhen his cellphone rang in the middle of the chat, it was easy for reporters to identify the caller. He had, after all, left the phone face up on the gin-and-tonic table before him. It was Morgan McSweeney, No. 10 Downing Street’s chief of staff.\n\n“No,” Mandelson said as he answered. He could not talk because he was surrounded by journalists.\n\nBut there was another wordless message for his audience: Mandelson was demonstrating that he had a hotline to Sir Keir Starmer, U.K. prime minister.\n\nSo while coverage of the Epstein files in the U.S. this week has focused on sex crimes and a who’s who of the moneyed elite (with Trump barely mentioned in the headlines, despite cropping up time and again in the files), in Britain, it has plunged Starmer into a deep crisis. The prime minister may have moved fast to strip Mandelson of his last remaining privileges, yet there is no escaping Starmer’s close ties to the disgraced politician, and the crisis rumbles on at the heart of the government.\n\nMcSweeney was a protégé of Mandelson, one of the most important figures in the Labour Party of the past four decades. McSweeney repaid the favor by pushing hard to have his mentor installed in Washington.\n\nAnd Mandelson’s key attribute, alongside his smooth charm, was being able to say he had a hotline to No. 10, bypassing the usual Foreign Office structure, with its pen-pushing bureaucratic class, to get things done with Trumpian speed, as journalists saw when his phone rang.\n\nHis cellphone rang again a little later. This time, it was Reinaldo, Mandelson’s husband, apparently asking when he could get rid of the journalists so they could have dinner.\n\nKat Cammack brings the jokes\n\nSecrets is a little sluggish today after staying out too late at the Washington Press Club Foundation’s annual congressional dinner. It is a tough audience for the speakers. A roomful of well-lubricated politicians and journalists is not necessarily always in listening mode after dinner.\n\nNancy Pelosi, former House speaker, was all but drowned out by chit-chat. Luckily, Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL) came armed with plenty of jokes at her colleagues’ expense.\n\n She riffed on motherhood.\n\n“It absolutely changes you,” she said. “Though not nearly as much as it changed Mike Johnson when he walked in on me breastfeeding baby Auggie. The man still can’t look me in the eye.”\n\nAnd she took aim at her colleague Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), who sat at the end of the top table, ribbing him about running for governor while serving as a congressman.\n\n“You, sir, are single-handedly bringing down the unemployment rate in the African American Community,” she said.\n\nEveryone heard that line, and the anxious gasps that followed.\n\nLunchtime reading\n\nThe British fixer to the elite who made connections for Epstein: A secretive British fixer acted as Epstein’s connection to Westminster and Silicon Valley elites, visiting his island and working to disguise his pedophile history. Ian Osborne, 42, exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein, offering to introduce him to tech billionaires and British politicians.\n\nTo win back the House, Democrats take the fight to deep-red areas: “In a change versus status quo election, in the overwhelming majority of instances, the absence of formal political experience is not a weakness, it’s a strength,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said in a recent interview at his party’s headquarters, sitting at a table scattered with maps of the House battlefield.\n\nYou are reading Washington Secrets, a guide to power and politics in D.C. and beyond.

The shrinking of the Post comes as major traditional media outlets in the United States face intense pressure from President Donald Trump, who routinely denigrates journalists as “fake news” and has launched multiple lawsuits over coverage of his presidency.\n\nBezos, one of the world’s richest people, has become close to Trump in the Republican’s second term. His Amazon behemoth controversially paid Trump’s wife, First Lady Melania Trump, a reported $40 million for a documentary this year, along with another $35 million for marketing.\n\nMurray said the shifts at the Post reflect the radically changing economy for news media.\n\nThis “will help to secure our future...and provide us stability moving forward,” Murray said in a note to employees. He cited changes to the news ecosystem, from individuals who “generate impact at low cost” to AI-generated content, as well as financial challenges that have already produced rounds of cost-cutting and buyouts at the Post.\n\n“The company’s structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often wrote from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.” On Facebook, Marty Baron, the Post’s executive editor until 2021, said: “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations.”\n\nThe Post did not disclose the number of job cuts, but the New York Times reports approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off. Most of the paper’s journalists overseas were let go, including its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.\n\nSports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported. Murray said the Post would now focus on politics, national security, technology, investigations, and business, among other topics.\n\nBut a reporter who covered Amazon—currently valued at $2.6 trillion—was let go.\n\n“These layoffs are not inevitable. A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future,” the labor union representing many Post journalists said in a statement. It called for supporters of the paper, acquired by Bezos in 2013, to rally outside its Washington headquarters at noon on Thursday.\n\nThe White House’s communications director, Stephen Cheung, issued a typically scornful message.\n\n“Just a reminder that printing fake news is not a profitable business model,” he posted on X.\n\nBaron, the Post’s former executive editor, said that Post owner Bezos had resisted “brutal pressure” from Trump in the past, but it was battered by “ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.” Bezos reined in a liberal-leaning editorial page and blocked an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election—breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence, and seen as bowing the knee to Trump.\n\nIn response, loyal readers “fled the Post. In truth, they were driven away,” Baron said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Harris and the paper lost around $100 million in 2024 as advertising and subscription revenues fell. In May 2024, Post publisher Will Lewis told staffers the paper lost $77 million over the preceding year and lost half of its audience since 2020. In stark contrast, The New York Times announced Wednesday that it gained more than one million digital subscribers in 2025, bringing its total to nearly 13 million and confirming its dominant position in the US media market. — AFP","url":"https://kuwaittimes.com/article/39462/business/bezos-led-washington-post-announces-painful-job-cuts/","image":"https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2026/02/05/355491.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 16:49:00","author":"Kuwait Times","authors":["Kuwait Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kw","sentiment":0.013},{"id":399764078,"title":"Watch: Kamala Harris relaunches KamalaHQ as Gen-Z-focused ‘Headquarters’ to counter far-right extremism","text":"Former US Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has unveiled a new media initiative, Headquarters, reviving and rebranding the popular KamalaHQ social media accounts more than a year after her election defeat to Donald Trump, calling it the “new Gen-Z led progressive content hub.”Announced on Thursday, the project is a partnership with liberal advocacy group People For the American Way, founded by legendary television producer Norman Lear. The initiative aims to “mobilise pro-justice, pro-fairness, pro-democracy young people against far-right extremism,” according to the organisation.The rebranded platform will operate across X and TikTok, where the former KamalaHQ accounts boast a combined following of over 6 million, and will expand to YouTube, Substack and other digital platforms.

Stay engaged, and I’ll see you out there.”Harris will serve as chair emerita of Headquarters in an honorary capacity and will not have editorial control. Content and programming decisions will be handled by the Headquarters team and the leadership of People For the American Way.Several members of the original KamalaHQ team are returning for the new venture. The project will be advised by Rob Flaherty, former deputy campaign manager for Harris’s 2024 campaign, along with Parker Butler and Lauren Kapp, who led KamalaHQ. Arlie Shugaar will join People For the American Way as director of platforms.“Conservatives build permanent organising infrastructure. Progressives often dismantle theirs after Election Day,” said Svante Myrick, president of People For the American Way. “Headquarters is the end of that cycle.”The relaunch also comes amid speculation about Harris’s future in public life, following her nationwide tour last year to promote her memoir, 107 Days, during which she hinted she was not done with public service.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-kamala-harris-relaunches-kamalahq-as-gen-z-focused-headquarters-to-counter-far-right-extremism/articleshow/127945121.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-127945121/127945121.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 16:49:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.227}]}
