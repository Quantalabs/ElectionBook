I study a lot of things and always make great decisions and they turn out to be correct.”\n\nGen. Dagvin Anderson, the chief of U.S. Africa Command, visited Somaliland last month, buoying local hopes for a deal with the US, as some of Trump’s key MAGA loyalists rally behind the little-known region.\n\nOne of Trump’s most ardent allies in Congress, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) is the sponsor of the “Republic of Somaliland Independence Act,” with cosponsors including Reps. Tom Tiffany (R-Wis.), Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) and Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.).\n\nTrump has spent recent weeks railing against Somalia and its citizens ripping off US taxpayers in Minnesota, where state government officials have pinned the blame on Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in last year’s election.\n\nSomaliland, a former British protectorate, has been de facto independent of the formerly Italian-ruled bulk of Somalia since 1991 and has built a relatively stable democracy with peaceful transitions of power — unlike the Mogadishu-based central government, which has been beset by civil war.\n\nMogadishu is the birthplace of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who opposes autonomy for the northern region, declaring, ” As long as I’m in Congress, no one will take over the seas belonging to the nation of Somalia.”\n\nThe breakaway nation has strong relations with neighboring Ethiopia, but other countries such as Turkey advocate against its independence. \n\nTrump said in August that he was considering granting Somaliland recognition, saying at the time: “We’re looking into that right now. Good question, actually. And another complex one, as you know. But we’re working on that right now — Somaliland.”","summary":"Israel on Friday became the world's first country to recognize Somaliland's split from anarchic Somalia, with Netanyahu planning to deliver a message to Trump at their Monday Mar-a-Lago meeting.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/26/us-news/trump-not-ready-to-embrace-somaliland-independence-unlike-netanyahu/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-whw9tw1hw-1766786304271.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1766768319&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/o1XAAVkp-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-26 22:26:10","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.128},{"id":389273526,"title":"Republicans support legalizing weed even as Trump's base frets of brain drain","text":"Read More: Gavin Newsom's struggle with black voters jeopardizes White House dreams as he braces for clash with Kamala Harris\n\nBy VICTORIA CHURCHILL, US POLITICAL REPORTER\n\nPublished: 18:35 GMT, 26 December 2025 | Updated: 19:08 GMT, 26 December 2025\n\nNearly half of Republican leaders in the US Senate are out of touch with the slight majority of Republican voters when it comes to the issue of marijuana.\n\nA majority of Americans – and every group in society – back legalization of marijuana, per a JL Partners poll conducted exclusively for the Daily Mail earlier this month.\n\nSome 51 percent of Republicans support legalization, compared to 53 percent of poll respondents overall and 62 percent of Democrats.\n\nJL Partners polled 1,000 registered voters via an online survey on December 20 and 21.\n\nThe results also showed that 58 percent of men support legalization, compared with 50 percent of women.\n\nRespondents between the ages of 30 and 49 favored legalization the most, with 61 percent of respondents in that age range supporting the proposal. \n\nDonald Trump signed an executive order to free up federal restrictions on marijuana on December 18, despite deep reservations from his fiercest allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Senator Budd led 21 of his Senate Republican colleagues in sending a letter to the President urging him to reconsider his decision.\n\nDonald Trump displays an executive order reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug in the Oval Office last Thursday\n\nA majority of Americans – and every group in society – back legalization of marijuana, per a JL Partners poll conducted exclusively for the Daily Mail earlier this month\n\nBudd was joined on the letter by fellow Republicans including John Barrasso of Wyoming - the Senate majority whip - Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, John Cornyn of Texas, Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Jim Banks of Indiana, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Crapo of South Dakota, Rick Scott of Florida, Jim Risch of Idaho, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nIn the letter, senators note that 'evidence shows that marijuana is harmful to its users.'\n\nThe letter also warned of damage from marijuana use on 'brain health' and 'permanent IQ loss.'\n\n'[F]acilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans,' the letter read.\n\nWhen signing his executive order, Trump said that he promised to be 'the president of common sense and that is exactly what we are doing.'\n\nHe said that 'so many people' reached out to him to endorse the idea, particularly from people suffering from the pain as a result of cancer.\n\n'It doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form,' he said.

Four outrageous stories from Trump’s first year back that you may have forgotten about","text":"In 2019, former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon told PBS’ Frontline program how President Donald Trump was engaged in a deliberate strategy to overwhelm the press and his critics by rolling out massive and controversial policy changes while distracting them with trolling to keep them from ever focusing on any one thing that could matter.\n\nHe described the tactic as “flooding the zone.”\n\n“Every day, we hit them with three things. They'll bite on one, and we'll get all of our stuff done, bang, bang, bang,” he said. \n\nNearly a year into Trump’s second term, their “flood the zone strategy” has been in full effect. \n\nHis administration has unveiled sweeping changes to how America’s government operates in ways that have had and will have dramatic effects on how everyday people live for years to come. But those changes have come in such rapid-fire succession that nearly 365 days after Trump was sworn in on a freezing January day last year, it’s hard to even begin to remember what he’s done.\n\nHere are some of the wildest stories from the White House in 2025: \n\nFive days after his swearing-in, Trump committed a Friday-night massacre of the independent inspectors general who root out waste, fraud and abuse within federal agencies and departments.\n\nThe late-night purge removed the inspectors general at nearly every Cabinet-level agency without warning and in violation of a longstanding law requiring the president to notify Congress of his intent to fire any such official 30 days before actually doing so.\n\nOnly the watchdogs at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security were permitted to remain in their jobs. \n\nTrump, who fired a number of inspectors general during his first term in an effort to kneecap their ability to investigate wrongdoing by his appointees, defended the illegal move as “very common” while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the first weekend golf outing of his second term.\n\n“I don’t know them … but some people thought that some were unfair or some were not doing their job. It’s a very standard thing to do,” he said.\n\nThe purge took out Senate-confirmed watchdogs at the departments of Defense, State, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Energy, Commerce, Treasury and Agriculture, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, Small Business Administration and the Social Security Administration. The move allowed Trump fill the positions with loyalists. \n\nLess than a month in the White House, Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for an official visit. \n\nNetanyahu’s trip was his first appearance there in quite some time, as Trump’s predecessor, former president Joe Biden, had declined to invite the Israeli leader due to election-year sensitivities around Israel’s brutal campaign of bombing civilian targets in Gaza to retaliate for the October 7, 2023, terror attacks by Hamas.\n\nJust weeks earlier, the Biden and Trump teams had shared credit for what was billed at the time as a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas, though the agreement quickly collapsed.\n\nBut as Netanyahu stood beside him in the East Room, Trump offered up another plan for the war-torn territory that sent Middle East experts’ heads spinning as the president claimed the U.S. would “take over” Gaza, displacing the 2.1 million Palestinians living there while the territory is rebuilt as “the Riviera of the Middle East.” \n\nThe president’s shocking proposal to put the Gaza Strip — territory that Israel has occupied since the end of the 1967 Six-Day War — under American control came at the start of a madcap marathon press conference in the East Room following a bilateral meeting with Netanyahu, the first foreign leader Trump has hosted since returning to the White House last month. \n\nHe claimed that “everybody” he had spoken to about the plan “loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”\n\n“I've studied this very closely over a lot of months, and I've seen it from every different angle, and it's a very, very dangerous place to be, and it's only going to get worse. And I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous ... praise. And if the United States can help to bring stability and peace in the Middle East, we'll do that,” Trump added. \n\nHis comments drew widespread criticism around the world, with Saudi Arabia saying it “unequivocally rejected” the forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, and Hamas branding the idea “ridiculous and absurd.”\n\nThe White House walked back the idea less than a day later, and the president’s aborted plan was later superseded by the ceasefire agreement negotiated between Israel and Hamas with the aid of Egypt, Qatar and other regional powers in October. \n\nDuring his 2024 campaign against former Biden, and later former vice president Kamala Harris, Trump was fond of telling supporters that he would be their “retribution” if he was elected again.\n\nSince taking office, he’s made good on that promise in ways that critics say have strained the rule of law and undermined the independence of the Department of Justice. \n\nBut Trump took an unprecedented step on his “retribution” tour in April by ordering the Department of Justice to investigate one of his most prominent first-term critics — for anything that can be found to investigate. \n\nThe order singled out Miles Taylor, a veteran of multiple Republican administrations who served as chief of staff to then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly during the president’s first term. During that time, Taylor infamously penned an anonymous New York Times op-ed — and later a book — describing efforts by Trump administration personnel to shield the government from Trump’s worst instincts.\n\nWhite House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said at the time that the order stripped Taylor “of any active clearance that he has in light of his past activities involving classified information” even though Taylor’s writings weren’t alleged to have included anything classified at all.\n\n“It's also going to order the Department of Justice to investigate his activities, to see what else might come up in that context, given his egregious behavior during your previous administration,” Scharf added.\n\nThe same day, Trump signed a similar order directing a probe of Chris Krebs, the security expert who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during his first term. Krebs had incurred Trump’s ire in the immediate wake of the 2020 election — which Trump lost to Joe Biden — by stating publicly that the election was the most secure in the country’s 250-year history. \n\nHe also said there was “no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised” during the 2020 election, directly contradicting Trump’s false claims of fraud. \n\nThat order further targeted Krebs’ employer, the cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, by ordering the stripping of security clearances “held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.” \n\nEight months later, neither Taylor nor Krebs has been accused of any crime, but Trump has continued to escalate his campaign of revenge against critics and adversaries by ordering the Justice Department to prosecute ex-FBI director James Comey and New York State Attorney General Letitia James, among others.\n\nThose efforts have thus far been stymied by federal judges who dismissed a pair of indictments against both Comey and James on the grounds that the ex-White House official who Trump installed as a prosecutor in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, had been unlawfully appointed. \n\nLess than a month after he swore to “preserve, protect and defend” the U.S. Constitution, Trump took to social media to push back against the myriad challenges to his blitzkrieg of executive actions and threats to federal agencies from the then-Elon Musk-ed Department of Government Efficiency by invoking a movie quote from a film about Napoleon, who justified his despotic regime as the will of the people of France.\n\nWriting on X and Truth Social on February 15, Trump said: “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.”\n\nTrump, whose efforts to gut federal funding, fire thousands of aid workers and unilaterally redefine the 14th Amendment had been swiftly blocked by federal courts across the country in the opening salvos of what has become a series of months-long legal battles, appeared to be lifting a line 1970 film Waterloo, in which actor Rod Steiger’s Napoleon states that he “did not ‘usurp’ the crown.”\n\n“I found it in the gutter, and I picked it up with my sword, and it was the people … who put it on my head,” he says. “He who saves a nation violates no law,” Steiger said.\n\nFour days later, Trump went even further by crowning himself “king” of his former home, New York City, after the Department of Transportation purported to order the withholding of federal funds to New York unless it nixed the congestion pricing plan that the Democratic-led city government implemented.\n\n“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD,” he wrote February 19 on Truth Social. “Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!”\n\nThe White House’s X account then shared his statement with a mock cover of Time magazine featuring a portrait of the president wearing a crown with the caption “long live the king.”\n\nThen-White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich also shared an AI-generated image of the president wearing a crown and regal cape.\n\nIn response, ​​New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority sued Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and federal transportation officials, arguing the Trump administration unlawfully and “precipitously — and for blatantly political reasons— purported to ‘terminate’ the program, as then-candidate Trump proclaimed he would do in his first week in office.”\n\nA federal judge later blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds in retaliation for the congestion pricing scheme, and the MTA’s lawsuit seeking to permanently enjoin the administration from doing so remains ongoing.","summary":"A selection of the craziest stories from Trump’s first year back in office","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-president-2025-white-house-drama-b2888565.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/17/22/42/GettyImages-2196824430.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mfdInaz9-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-26 18:06:55","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":389257712,"title":"Bari Weiss defends decision to pull 60 Minutes episode on El Salvador prison","text":"CBS News’ editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, defended her decision to pull a 60 Minutes episode on allegations investigating a notorious prison in El Salvador, arguing that the network’s priority was to ensure its coverage was “comprehensive and fair”.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff on Christmas Eve, Weiss said news organizations needed to do more to win back the trust of the American public and vowed that “no amount of outrage” would “derail us”.\n\n“We are not out to score points with one side of the political spectrum or to win followers on social media,” according to the memo, signed by Weiss and other CBS News leadership and published in full by several media outlets. “We are out to inform the American public and to get the story right.”\n\nThe internal battle over the story exploded into public view after CBS announced the segment would not be a part of the show, despite extensive promotion. Weiss’s last-minute decision to hold the episode sparked outrage and charges of censorship amid Donald Trump’s second administration, though some conservative commentators generally aligned with the president have defended the move. In a private email sent to 60 Minutes correspondents that was subsequently made public, CBS correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, who spent weeks reporting the episode, called the decision a “political one”.\n\nIn the memo to staff, Weiss acknowledged the uproar her decision had caused internally and externally – but she rejected the accusation that politics played a role in her determination to hold the segment.\n\n“Such editorial decisions can cause a firestorm, particularly on a slow news week,” Weiss wrote. “And the standards for fairness we are holding ourselves to, particularly on contentious subjects, will surely feel controversial to those used to doing things one way. But to fulfill our mission, it’s necessary.”\n\nWeiss has said she was concerned about the episode airing without a sufficient response from the Trump administration. But Alfonsi said it had been “screened five times” as well as cleared by CBS attorneys along with its standards and practices department. She also said her team had unsuccessfully requested comment from the White House, the US state department, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” Alfonsi wrote.\n\nThe episode has since appeared online, after it was published by a streaming platform owned by Global TV, the network that has the rights to 60 Minutes in Canada. In it, Alfonsi visits the prison in El Salvador and interviews deportees who offered powerful testimony about torture and abuse inside the notorious prison where the Trump administration had sent more than 200 Venezuelan migrants from the US in what a federal judge recently ruled was a violation of their due process rights.\n\nCBS’s decision to hold the episode comes amid a widening feud between the Trump administration and 60 Minutes – one of journalism’s most venerated institutions known for hard-hitting investigations. During the 2024 election, Trump declined to sit for an interview with 60 Minutes, then sued the network over how the show handled an interview with his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. In a highly controversial move, Paramount, the parent company of CBS, agreed to pay Trump $16m to settle the lawsuit.\n\nEarlier in December, Trump fumed on Truth Social that the network had treated him “far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before”.\n\n“If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” the Republican added. A week earlier, he assailed the show for an interview with his ally turned critic, the outgoing Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he called a “very poorly prepared Traitor”, and said of parent company Paramount: “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.”\n\nWeiss’s management of CBS has come under sharp scrutiny since she was installed as CBS News’s editor-in-chief by Paramount’s CEO, David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, a Trump ally and donor who is one of the world’s richest people. Paramount also acquired Weiss’s Free Press, the conservative-friendly publication she founded after leaving the New York Times as a columnist, in a reported $150m deal.\n\nHer appointment was met with frustration and concern by CBS’s editorial staff while media watchdogs questioned Weiss’s qualifications to lead the storied news network and raised concerns about further media politicization. Weiss, who built a reputation as a provocative opinion writer and media operator, has no experience working in broadcast television.\n\nParamount is now waging an extraordinary hostile takeover bid to gain control of Warner Bros Discovery, which had reached a deal to sell its storied film and television properties to Netflix. Trump has made clear that he plans to be involved in the acquisition’s regulatory review process.","summary":"CBS News editor-in-chief argues in memo that network’s priority was ‘comprehensive and fair’ coverage\n\n\nWho is Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News?\n\nCBS News’ editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, defended her decision to pull a 60 Minutes episode on allegations investigating a notorious prison in El Salvador, arguing that the network’s priority was to ensure its coverage was “comprehensive and fair”.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff on Christmas Eve, Weiss said news organizations needed to do more to win back the trust of the American public and vowed that “no amount of outrage” would “derail us”.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/dec/26/bari-weiss-60-minutes-el-salvador-prison","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e619dbbc8ce2d36af522eb582ae8c2985dd676/713_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 17:55:20","author":"Lauren Gambino","authors":["Lauren Gambino"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.254},{"id":389249566,"title":"Democrats and Republicans tied on economy heading into 2026, survey finds","text":"For Republicans, the findings serve as a bit of a wake-up call. The party has traditionally held the advantage in voters’ opinions on the handling of the economy, a matter that has remained at the forefront of voters’ minds for the last few election cycles. \n\nPresident Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris made the economy a focal point of their campaigns, with the victorious president promising to lower costs on Day One and revitalize the economy through an “America First” agenda. \n\nBut polling suggests that voters are not pleased with the results they have seen so far from the GOP trifecta in Washington. In August, a Third Way survey found that Republicans held a substantial lead over Democrats in handling the economy, with 42% to 36% support. They held a slight lead over inflation and trailed Democrats by only two percentage points in handling the cost of living.\n\nThe August poll came out after congressional Republicans successfully passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and signed it into law, legislation that the GOP has hailed as the largest tax cut for Americans despite opposition over the drastic cuts to Medicaid. \n\nThe think tank found that nothing that occurred in the first six months of Trump’s second term on Capitol Hill and in the White House did much to alleviate voters’ concerns about the state of the country. However, many had eyes on how voters’ temperaments improved in the days and months following Trump’s signing the Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4. \n\nSix months later, voters are trending toward Democrats on the economy after they were underwater in the think tank’s summer survey, and they hold an 11-point lead on the cost of living compared to the survey released in August. Much of that has come after Trump’s tariffs have affected key voting blocs, such as farmers and small business owners.\n\nBut that does not mean Democrats can take a large victory lap. The centrist think tank found that, while Democrats are holding slight leads on key economic matters, they are unable to match what is needed to have a resounding victory in 2026.\n\n“President Trump and congressional Republicans have ceded the advantage on these issues they held just one year ago,” Third Way wrote in its analysis. “The question is whether congressional Democrats can fully convince Americans that they will be focused on cost-of-living and not that scandal of the week.”\n\nSeveral Democrats have largely attributed their 2024 losses, including Trump’s defeat of Harris, to the party’s failure to address kitchen-table matters and instead focusing on social and cultural matters. A handful of lawmakers came out in the aftermath of last year’s election to blame their party’s messaging on the economy and criticize the emphasis put on matters such as abortion or the LGBTQ community. \n\nAffordability has proven to be a winning message for Democrats this year. In November, Democrats dominated the three top elections of the 2025 cycle, with victories in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races and a historic win for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral contest. \n\nDespite Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) favoring centrist agendas, and Mamdani turning heads with his democratic-socialist policies, all three candidates hammered hard on the economy and affordability to flip key areas and significantly outperform the GOP.\n\n“Democrats really never dominated on trust on the economy, what we’ve been able to do is fight it to a draw in periods that have been very good for us electorally,” Matt Bennett, Third Way’s EVP of public affairs, told Politico Playbook. “What we need to do is at least keep it close, and I think that’s where we are.”","summary":"Voter confidence in Democrats and Republicans regarding the handling of the economy is evenly split, according to recent polling, highlighting the challenge both parties face on a central matter ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

It was completely jarring.\n\n\"It's dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel.\"\n\nShowing the videos was suggested as amounting to a \"hate crime\" in one document seen by the Telegraph.\n\nThe politics lecturer was accused of causing his students, aged 17 and 18, \"emotional harm\".\n\nThe teacher launched a grievance procedure against the college but was effectively forced to resign from his £44,000-a-year post, receiving a £2,000 payoff.\n\nThe Free Speech Union said it believes laws initially intended to protect children from serious criminals were being twisted to go after adults with unfashionable opinions.\n\nThe teacher's case was an example of child safety protocols \"being weaponised to silence someone for political reasons\", the Union said.\n\nHenley College began its investigation in January 2025 following two complaints by students in his class which accused him of \"biased\" and \"off topic\" teaching.\n\nThe teacher was alleged to have shown videos of Donald Trump and his campaign \"propaganda\" and other videos which were \"unrelated\" to what was being taught.\n\nThis made a student \"feel quite uncomfortable\".\n\nThe teacher said: \"It was just terrifying; just mind-boggling. We were discussing the US election, Trump had just won and I showed a couple of videos from the Trump campaign.\n\n\"Next thing, I was accused of bias. One of the students said they were emotionally disturbed and claimed to have had nightmares.\"\n\nThe teacher, a practising Catholic, admits he is a Republican supporter but said he was \"not an extremist\" and that his views are mainstream.\n\nIn return, he said the college itself has a \"complete Left-wing bias\" and does not \"tolerate anything about Donald Trump\".\n\nOn the college's referral to the safeguarding Local Authority Designated Officer, a report said the teacher's views \"could be perceived as radical\" and told the school they should refer him to Prevent.\n\nThe report added that his behaviour \"could cause harm to a child\" and that there could be a \"criminal offence\" that could amount to a \"hate crime\" and that promoting his views could be considered \"radicalisation\".\n\nThe teacher said: \"I felt completely insulted at the suggestion I was a danger to children.\n\n\"It impacted my mental health. I had to see a counsellor. It upset my physical health. It was absolutely appalling. It really overwhelmed me.\"\n\nBy April he was accused of misconduct in a formal letter. His alleged offence was to have caused students \"emotional harm\" by showing them \"inappropriate content\" and videos and presenting \"potentially extremist views\" with a \"lack of balance\".\n\nIt cited complaints made by his students as evidence.\n\nOne of the videos in question was a music video, Daddy's Home by Roseanne Barr, a US comedian and Trump supporter, with Tom MacDonald, a Canadian known as the Maga Rapper.\n\nThe YouTube video was suggested to him by one of his pupils.\n\nThe teacher said he could not understand how showing this video could lead a student to be \"emotionally disturbed\".\n\nHe had been switched to teach politics in September 2024 amid staff shortages, previously teaching business studies at the college and receiving praise for his work.\n\nHe believes a group of students targeted him following this change.\n\nNow, the teacher is working part-time as a supply teacher while hunting for a full-time post.\n\nHe has extensive family ties to the US but insists his Republican views are not extremist.\n\nThere was also balance in the videos he showed, he claimed, adding that he had shown videos of Kamala Harris to the class too.\n\nFive Trump-related videos had been shown to the class before the complaint was made, he said.\n\nIn April, while being accused of misconduct, he wrote a letter to US vice president JD Vance complaining of \"communist-style silencing\" at his school but received no reply. He was unsure if Mr Vance ever received the letter.\n\nHe contacted the Free Speech Union, which claimed in his defence that he was a victim of \"bullying and harassment\".\n\nThey pointed out that the accusation he had shown a \"genocide video\" to children was false as the video was part of set teaching materials provided by the Holocaust Education Trust.\n\nHenley College said: \"The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\n\n\"We are committed to safeguarding the wellbeing of all our students and staff, and follow statutory safeguarding procedures in line with Keeping Children Safe in Education 2025.\n\n\"Allegations are handled with due care, in accordance with statutory guidance, with appropriate support provided to all involved.\"","summary":"Oxfordshire lecturer accused of causing students 'emotional harm' and forced to resign from £44,000-a-year post","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-teacher-referred-to-counterterrorism-programme-after-showing-trump-videos-to-politics-class-b1264013.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/12/19/12/7c23bd6e411faa421a289627b40db52eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzY2MjMwNTY4-2.81990300.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 15:31:15","author":"Sami Quadri","authors":["Sami Quadri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.622},{"id":389252910,"title":"Who thinks Republicans will suffer in the 2026 midterms? Republican members of Congress","text":"The midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run – a total of 43 in the House, plus 10 senators. Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 – a full year before her term was set to expire.\n\nThere are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nRather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats – or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive – many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.\n\nAs of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions – Republicans in 2018 and 2020 – this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.\n\nThere is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.\n\nAs a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.\n\nWhy do members leave Congress?\n\nMany planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members. \n\nFor example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.\n\nSometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons other workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.\n\nOther members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina. \n\nBut some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on. \n\nIn a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.\n\nWhat’s unique about 2026?\n\nIn addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.\n\nThe shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies. \n\nIn Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats – nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation – are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.\n\nAll decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.\n\nIn 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.\n\nCurrently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates. \n\nDemocrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.\n\nAs a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough potential danger to abandon the fight in advance.\n\nRetirement vs. resignation\n\nOne final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one. \n\nHouse conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House. \n\nThis also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.","summary":"The president’s party almost always loses seats in the midterms.

For example, a British professor was forced out of his job and compared to terrorists for showing his students videos of the U.S. president.\n\nOxfordshire’s Henley College forced out a teacher who showed clips of Donald Trump’s inauguration to his A-level students, per GB News. Accused of “emotional harm” and a possible “hate crime” by deranged child protection officials, the former teacher was reported to the UK Government's Prevent counter-terrorism program. \n\nIt is unclear how many students were supposedly traumatized, as the original complaint was apparently from one person. But the griping eventually got out of control, to the point of costing the teacher his job.\n\nFirst of all, Donald Trump is the most powerful world leader, so of course, in a politics course (which this was), it would make sense to watch videos of him. Secondly, even if we were to accept the preposterous premise that Trump is an evil dictator, just for the sake of argument, isn’t seeing photos and videos of dictators educational? Have these young people never watched a speech by Hitler or seen a photo of Stalin? Have they never been made to deal with photographic evidence of such atrocities as the Nazi death camps, Mao’s Great Famine, Pol Pot’s killing fields, or Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre?\n\nRelated: Trump Strikes ISIS in Nigeria, Shielding Persecuted Christians\n\nHow did we get to the point where UK college students, whose grandfathers won WWII, are distraught by merely listening to a leader with whom they disagree? The current prime minister of Britain is a globalist tyrant, but I’m not going to collapse in tears because I listened to a clip of him lying.\n\nGB News reported: \n\nThe lecturer, who is in his 50s, was effectively compelled to leave his £44,000-a-year position at Henley College following the referral, ultimately accepting a £2,000 settlement… Among the footage shown was Mr Trump's inauguration and five campaign-related videos. One clip was a music video called Daddy's Home featuring comedian Roseanne Barr and Canadian performer Tom MacDonald… The lecturer maintains he presented balanced content, including Kamala Harris videos, as part of lessons on politics and propaganda following the President's election victory.\n\n“They likened me to a terrorist. It was completely jarring. It's dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel,” the sixth-form college teacher described his experience. He was “completely insulted at the suggestion I was a danger to children” and ended up going to counseling after losing his three-decade career.\n\n“We were discussing the US election, Trump had just won and I showed a couple of videos from the Trump campaign. Next thing, I was accused of bias,” the professor explained. “One of the students said they were emotionally disturbed and claimed to have had nightmares.”\n\nThe teacher, a Catholic with right-leaning views, had previously been lauded for his business classes. More recently, he started teaching politics, and unfortunately, across the West, politics is increasingly divisive.\n\nDocuments reviewed by The UK Telegraph show accusations that the teacher’s “behaviour could cause harm to a child” and “could be perceived as radical.”\n\nIt is no wonder a British WWII veteran recently wept on TV and said his country now is not the country for which he fought and for which so many died.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of key news this holiday season with our special Christmas sale.

This incident led to accusations of posing a risk to children and even resulted in a referral to a government counter-terrorism program.\n\nThe teacher, in his 50s, from Oxfordshire, shared with his students footage of Trump’s inauguration as part of a lesson on U.S. politics. However, this educational decision took an unexpected turn, as reported by the Telegraph.\n\nHenley College, a sixth-form institution in Henley-on-Thames with over 2,000 students, flagged the situation to the local child safeguarding authority. This prompted further action, resulting in the teacher being referred to Prevent, the UK government’s counter-terrorism initiative, as a matter of priority.\n\nChoosing to remain anonymous, the teacher expressed his shock to the Telegraph, stating, “They likened me to a terrorist. It was completely jarring.” He further described the ordeal as “dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel,” highlighting the bewildering nature of the situation.\n\nThe teacher, who does not wish to be identified, told the Telegraph: ‘They likened me to a terrorist. It was completely jarring.\n\n‘It’s dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel.’\n\nShowing the videos was suggested as amounting to a ‘hate crime’ in one document seen by the Telegraph. \n\nThe politics lecturer was accused of causing his students, aged 17 and 18, ’emotional harm’.\n\nThe teacher did not take the terrible allegations lying down however, launching a grievance procedure against the college.\n\nDespite this, he was still effectively forced to resign his £44,000-a-year post but received a £2,000 payoff.\n\n The Free Speech Union has said they believe the laws that were initially intended to protect children from murderers and rapists were being twisted to go after adults with unfashionable opinions.\n\nThe teacher’s case was an example of child safety protocols ‘being weaponised to silence someone for political reasons’, the Union said. \n\nHenley College began its investigations in January 2025 following two complaints by students in his class which accused him of ‘biased’ and ‘off topic’ teaching.\n\nThe teacher was alleged to have shown videos of Donald Trump and his campaign ‘propaganda’ and other videos which were ‘unrelated’ to what was being taught.\n\nThis made a student ‘feel quite uncomfortable’. \n\nThe teacher said: ‘It was just terrifying; just mind-boggling. We were discussing the US election, Trump had just won and I showed a couple of videos from the Trump campaign.\n\n‘Next thing, I was accused of bias.

And now, the nation is in a full-scale legislative war over the argument of whether males should be allowed to play women's and girls' sports. In 2025, that war escalated to historic heights. President Donald Trump returned to office and unleashed a volley of countermeasures to \"save women's sports.\" But many Democrats fought back, even as a majority of their base sided with Trump on the issue, per multiple polls. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM And on the front lines, activists, athletes, celebrities and journalists dug a deepening cultural divide. Emotional arguments made their way to school board meetings, live interviews, the chambers of the capitol building, and plenty of social media threads. January Weeks before Trump's inauguration, The New York Times put out a poll that found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. \"Thinking about transgender female athletes — meaning athletes who were male at birth but who currently identify as female — do you think they should or should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports?\" the survey asked. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women. HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE It was seen as one of the scapegoat issues highlighted for the Democrats' sweeping 2024 election defeat. One of the first bills the GOP-controlled House of Representatives passed in the new year was the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act\" on Jan. 14, which sought to establish a national policy that only females could compete in women's and girls' sports at tax-payer-funded institutions. The bill passed the House with the support of two Democrat representatives. But party leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were hard nos, making unsubstantiated arguments that the bill would somehow enable sexual predators to give genital exams to children. No language in the bill included any mention of genital exams. The argument proved to alienate some Democrat voters, as the party saw waning public support and net losses in voter registration throughout the first month of the year. February Trump signed the \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order on Feb. 5 to tackle the issue, as the bill wouldn't reach the Senate for another month and a half. The NCAA complied the very next day, changing its policy to only allow biological females to compete in women's sports across the college sports landscape. But a handful of Democrat-controlled states did not comply, and instructed their public schools to continue following state policy that allows males in girls' sports. California, Maine, Minnesota and Illinois were among those states. Maine's defiance of the order allowed for almost immediate consequences, when a trans athlete won an indoor girls' track and field state championship. The incident ignited attention from the Trump administration and a heated political feud within the state. Maine lawmaker Laurel Libby was censured by the Democrat-controlled state legislature, and quickly became a symbol for conservative resistance in the state. Trump engaged in an in-person spat with Gov. Janet Mills during a bipartisan meeting of governors at the White House on Feb. 21 after threatening to cut funding from the state. There, Mills defied Trump's order to enforce the executive order right to his face, so the president threatened to cut federal funding to Maine right to her face. Trump's department of Education launched a Title IX investigation into the state later that day. But some Democrat-controlled states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, complied with the order, passing reforms to their high school policies that complied to only allow females in girls' sports. March Senate Democrats united to block the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act\" on March 3, via the filibuster. It left the floodgates open for states to defy Trump's executive order, and ensured thousands of American public schools continued to let males in girls' sports. Minnesota's legislature blocked a similar bill that would have protected girls' sports on the state level that same week. Later that week, at Trump's Joint Address to Congress, former girls' high school volleyball player Payton McNabb was a guest attendant, sitting right next to second lady Usha Vance. When Trump introduced McNabb and her story of suffering permanent brain damage when she was spiked in the face by a transgender opponent, only the GOP side of the room applauded her. The Democrats remained seated and silent. It was one of the many controversial points of etiquette exhibited by Democrats during the speech, alongside not applauding childhood cancer patient DJ Daniels, and Rep. Al Green, D-Tex., being escorted out for shouting and pointing his cane at Trump early in the speech. Just days after that, California Gov. Gavin Newsom threw a wrench into the debate when he, as one of the top figures within the Democrat party, hosted Charlie Kirk on his podcast and admitted to believing trans athletes in women's sports was \"deeply unfair.\" The comments pushed the conversation around the Meanwhile, the feud within Maine had only just begun. Libby filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn her censure on March 11. It would eventually go all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Trump administration made a series of unmet ultimatums with Maine's educational agencies. Behind the scenes, Maine's Department of Education was actively instructing schools not to follow Trump's executive order, as seen in public records obtained by Fox News Digital. By the end of the month, the state had been referred to the Department of Justice after noncompliance. The March exchanges between Trump and Maine even included a temporary funding freeze to the Maine University System, before the system proved that it hadn't been allowing males in women's sports, and wouldn't be going forward in compliance with the NCAA's new policy. But another institution got a much more consequential funding freeze. The University of Pennsylvania saw $175 million in federal funds frozen as part of an investigation into the state's handling of infamous trans swimmer Lia Thomas in 2022. It would be one big domino in reaching a historic resolution, which came later in the year. April On the first day of April, California's Democrat-controlled state legislature blocked two bills that would have banned males from girls' sports in the state. Every Democrat voted against it, with Assembly member Rick Chavez Zbur arguing that one of the bills \"is really reminiscent to me of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s.\" Zbur said this while in the presence of a descendant of a holocaust survivor, who had to excuse herself from the chamber, according to GOP Assembly member Kate Sanchez. Newsom, who had admitted he didn't think males in girls' sports was fair the previous month, told reporters he \"didn't pay any attention\" to the bills the following day. \"Well, I didn't pay any attention to the committee yesterday. I was, literally, spent most of the day talking about LA fire recovery with our teams. And progress is being made there, by the way, but we're starting to run up into some of those ‘abundance’ conversations around permitting that's already starting to take shape, where most of my focus was yesterday,\" Newsom said. Meanwhile, April 1 also saw the neighboring state of Nevada's high school sports league take action to change its policies to ban trans athletes from high school sports, complying with Trump's On the second day of April, a budding hero was born when footage of fencer Stephanie Turner kneeling to protest a trans opponent at a USA Fencing event went viral. Turner was penalized and disqualified for refusing to face the trans athlete, and became a sudden martyr at the heart of the national \"save women's sports\" movement. Turner's protest became a global news story that ignited widespread backlash against USA Fencing and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC). It would eventually culminate in a federal investigation and hearing the following month. And on that same day, Trump's administration cut USDA funding directly to Maine, escalating the ongoing feud with the state. Just two days after that, the Department of Education and Department of Justice announced it would be jointly launching a Title IX task forced dedicated to protection of women's and girls' sports and private spaces across the country. The move sent a message that the Trump administration was doubling-down on addressing the issue, as states continued to defy the White House. On April 16, the Trump DOJ announced it was suing Maine for refusing to comply with Trump's executive order. Turner was present at the press conference to announce the lawsuit. The suit is set for its first hearing in January. Later that month, Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison went on the offensive, announcing he was suing Trump and the DOJ in order to protect the state's policies that allow males in girls' sports. May On May 7, the House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) brought the legislative war to the halls of congress with a hearing titled \"Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports.\" Marjorie Taylor Greene used the platform to hammer national governing bodies, specifically subpoenaing USA Fencing Board Chair Damien Lehfeldt. Lehfeldt, who had previously avoided voluntary testimony, was forced to defend his organization’s inclusion policies while sitting just feet away from fencer Stephanie Turner and former volleyball player Payton McNabb. The hearing put the growing partisan rift on display. Republicans tore into Lehfeldt's social media history and the organization's policy, while lauding McNabb and Turner as heroes for their activism. Democrats didn't direct any questions toward Turner or McNabb, and instead only made exchanges with other witnesses in defense of policies that enable trans inclusion, while also criticizing Trump on other issues. On May 20, the Supreme Court ruled in the legal battle between Libby and Maine's Democrat-controlled legislature. In a 7-2 emergency ruling, the High Court ordered the Maine House to immediately restore Libby’s voting rights, which had been stripped since February after she refused to issue a \"forced apology\" for a social media post identifying a transgender athlete. Libby, who had been silenced for over 80 days and missed hundreds of legislative votes, including on the state budget, hailed the decision in an interview with Fox News Digital as a \"civil rights win\" for both her constituents and for women’s sports advocates nationwide. On the high school front, the spring sports season saw multiple controversies garner national attention as trans athletes advanced to state championships in multiple girls' sports. In Minnesota, a trans softball pitcher garnered national notoriety amid dominant performances throughout the season and going into the playoffs, and prompted a lawsuit by three anonymous female players. In California, a trans track and field athlete's dominance caused postseason meets to devolve into political rallies. As the athlete progressed through the postseason, and close to a championship, the situation eventually caught Trump's attention. On May 27, Trump escalated the situation with a Truth Social, writing a \"transitioned male athlete\" was \"practically unbeatable\" and called the situation \"NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS.\" He even wrote that he was \"ordering local authorities, if necessary, to not allow\" the athlete to compete and threatened to cut off California’s federal funding \"maybe permanently\" if the state didn't fall in line. Within hours of Trump’s post, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) buckled under the pressure, announcing a desperate \"pilot entry process\" for the state championships. The new rule dictated that any \"biological female\" who narrowly missed qualifying because of a transgender competitor would be allowed to compete anyway. Furthermore, the CIF declared that if a trans athlete won a medal, the highest-finishing biological girl would also receive a gold medal. The rule change would result in shared podium finishes when the athlete ultimately won two gold medals and one silver at the state championships in Clovis on the final day of May, capping off a championship meet that featured multiple competing protests, an airplane banner that advocated for the protection of girls' sports, and even the arrest of a pro-trans protester for alleged assault of an opposing protester. June In the aftermath of the track championships, on June 2, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Trump DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, issued a hard June 9 deadline for every public school district in California to \"certify in writing\" that they would not follow the state’s gender identity rules. Meanwhile in Minnesota, the transgender pitcher was leading a dominant postseason run, securing their school's first-ever state tournament berth with a shutout victory in the sectional final. The trans athlete would go on to lead their team to the state title, and the online reaction would domino into a much larger cultural event. On June 9, Olympic gymnastics legend Simone Biles ignited a viral social media feud with Riley Gaines. Reacting to the Minnesota controversy and Gaines’s advocacy, Biles posted a scathing message on X, calling Gaines \"truly sick\" and suggesting she \"bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male.\" The post backfired on Biles, drawing a mountain of backlash from conservative athletes and fans who accused Biles of abandoning the very women she inspired. Biles' own former Olympic teammate, MyKayla Skinner, even publicly condemned Biles as a \"bully.\" Biles ultimately settled for apologizing to Gaines. Amid the chaos of the feud, it was revealed that USA Gymnastics deleted its transgender participation policy. It foreshadowed a much larger change that would come to USA Gymnastics the following month. July On July 1, the University of Pennsylvania reached a resolution agreement with the Trump administration’s Department of Education after a Title IX compliance battle rooted in the Lia Thomas controversy. UPenn agreed to bar transgender athletes from women’s teams and to revise its women’s swimming record books, erasing Thomas’s marks from the program’s history. The settlement carried a blunt political message: if an elite university could be forced to retroactively \"correct\" what the government said was a Title IX violation, any school in the country could be next. San Jose State University, which was embroiled in a similar national controversy in 2024 over Blaire Fleming, has also been under investigation since February. SJSU came under heavy scrutiny in July amid Fox News Digital reporting of how an investigation into misconduct allegations was carried out. The White House, Department of Justice and multiple members of congress condemned the handlers that enabled the situation at SJSU. On July 3, the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States agreed to take up multiple high-profile cases involving state bans on transgender athletes. The cases — Little v. Hecox from Idaho and West Virginia v. B.P.J. from West Virginia — asked the justices to decide whether laws prohibiting transgender girls and women from competing in girls’ and women’s sports violate the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and federal civil rights law, Title IX. On July 9, just like it had against Maine in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against the California Department of Education (CDE) and the CIF, alleging that the state’s policies allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports violated Title IX. The lawsuit also clarified what the Trump administration wanted the fight to be about: not just \"sports fairness,\" but civil rights enforcement. Arguably the biggest quake of the year on the issue happened on July 21. That day, the USOPC updated its athlete safety policies to comply with Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. USA Fencing, the subject of widespread criticism after Turner's protest, was one of the first US Olympic organizations to publicly announce it had updated its gender eligibility policy to comply with the USOPC's new guidance. By the end of July, the movement to \"save women's sports\" had all the momentum. But resistance remained. August On Aug. 1, Wagner College quietly reached a resolution with the Trump administration to address the fact that the school rostered the transgender fencer that Turner protested earlier in the year. The private Staten Island school agreed to revise its athletic policies to comply with the administration’s interpretation of Title IX, barring males from women’s teams and aligning itself with the NCAA’s updated standards, similar to the resolution with UPenn. The Wagner resolution was notable not because of the school’s size or athletic profile, but because it reinforced a growing pattern: universities were increasingly choosing settlement over resistance. But resistance came via the trans athletes themselves. A pair of trans athletes began to file their own lawsuits against institutions in response to allegedly being kept out of women's events. Trans athlete Evelyn Parts sued Swarthmore College for alleged removal from the women's track and field team, but the lawsuit also claimed Parts was added back onto the team later in the season, despite the NCAA's new guidelines. Another trans athlete sued a smaller school that was not part of the NCAA, Westcliff University and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletes (NAIA), alleging removal from the women's volleyball team. Later in the month, Trump suggested that the U.S would push for mandatory gender testing at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, framing the move as a necessary safeguard to protect women’s sports on the world stage. The statement marked the administration’s clearest signal yet that its definition of sex would not stop at American schools or governing bodies, but would be carried into global competition. That philosophy went into effect on the global level that same month. World Boxing, the international governing body for the sport of boxing, announced a new policy mandating sex testing to ensure only females compete in the women's category. The change came a year after the world watched Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, two boxers who previously failed sex tests, win women's Olympic boxing gold medals in Paris, prompting global backlash. September Two girls' high school volleyball players in California thrust their school district into a national spotlight when they stepped away from their team in protest of a trans athlete, and later filed a lawsuit against the school district over their alleged experience with the trans athlete over the previous three years. One of the girls, a Muslim American, added a new layer to the debate by pointing out that sharing a locker room with, and changing in front of, a male was a violation of her religious beliefs. Many critics on social media pointed out how the Democrats' ongoing support of trans athletes in girls' sports was now also compromising a person who belonged to a group they also claimed to champion in recent years. Newsom's office ultimately addressed the situation and suggested the state's growing wave of trans athletes competing in girls' sports, and opposition to it, was not his responsibility. \"CIF is an independent nonprofit that governs high school sports. The California Department of Education is a separate constitutional office. Neither is under the Governor’s authority. CIF and the CDE have stated they follow existing state law — a law that was passed in 2013 and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (not Newsom) and in line with 21 other states. For the law to change, the legislature would need to send the Governor a bill. They have not,\" Newsom's office told Fox News Digital. Another high-profile Democrat distanced themselves from the topic that same month. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in her book \"107 Days\" set the record straight on her stance on the issue. \"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,\" Harris wrote. Toward the end of the month, a lawsuit brought by Gaines and a group of other current and former female college athletes against the NCAA over their experience competing against Thomas and other trans athletes reached a crucial procedural turning point. U.S. District Judge Tiffany R. Johnson issued a ruling on Sept. 25 that dismissed most of the plaintiffs’ claims against the NCAA and other defendants, but allowed a central Title IX claim against the NCAA to proceed to the next phase of litigation. Gaines' attorney Bill Bock told Fox News Digital that a key condition to settle the lawsuit would be the NCAA agreeing to a consent decree. October In early October, a coalition of Minnesota school board members launched a formal appeal to state authorities to bar transgender athletes assigned male at birth from competing in girls’ sports, urging compliance with a recent federal Title IX finding that the state’s inclusive policy violated federal nondiscrimination standards. Signers — representing roughly 40 school districts across the state — sent a letter to the Minnesota Department of Education, the Minnesota State High School League, the state attorney general, and the governor calling for state policies to align with the federal government’s position and avoid the loss of education funding. Minnesota had been one of the states most resistant to complying with Trump on the issue, and dying on that hill was starting to garner backlash from educators within the state, just as it had in Maine and California. Weeks later, the Supreme Court cases set to define the future of transgender athlete bans continued moving forward. In Little v. Hecox, a federal judge rejected an attempt by transgender plaintiff Lindsay Hecox to dismiss the case before the justices could rule, despite arguments that the dispute was moot. The decision ensured Idaho’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act would remain before the Supreme Court alongside West Virginia v. B.P.J. Culturally, the movement to \"save women's sports\" gained another high-profile ally. Olympic gymnast MyKayla Skinner announced she had joined XX-XY Athletics, a brand and advocacy group dedicated to protecting women’s sports based on biological sex. In late October, USOPC leadership publicly acknowledged that sex-testing policies used internationally were being discussed at the highest levels, while stopping short of endorsing mandatory testing in the U.S. The comments signaled that even as the administration pushed for harder biological standards ahead of the 2028 Olympics, Olympic leadership remained cautious — aware the global and legal stakes were only rising. Then, in the final days of the month, seemingly out of nowhere, Ocasio-Cortez went after Gaines, who had just given birth, in a series of disparaging social media posts. Gaines initially posted a photo featuring Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Gaines wrote, \"We’re being destroyed from within.\" Ocasio-Cortez responded, \"Maybe if you channeled all this anger into swimming faster you wouldn’t have come in fifth,\" referencing Gaines' fifth-place tie with Thomas at the 2022 NCAA championships. Ocasio-Cortez later suggested Gaines should \"get a real job.\" Gaines challenged the congresswoman to a debate on the subject, to which Ocasio-Cortez never accepted. November Early in November, reports indicated the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was actively considering changes to its transgender eligibility framework, moving away from its long-standing hands-off approach that left decisions to individual sports. The shift came amid growing pressure from international federations that had already adopted sex-based eligibility rules, and with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics looming. On Capitol Hill, 130 congressional Democrats filed an amicus brief at the Supreme Court urging justices to strike down state laws barring transgender athletes from women’s sports. The brief argued such bans violated Title IX and equal protection, formally aligning Democratic leadership with the legal effort to preserve trans inclusion as the high court prepared to hear the lawsuits of Idaho and West Virginia. The list of signees included Ocasio-Cortez, Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi and other members of the Democrat party's left wing like Ilhan Omar and Jasmine Crockett. The Democrats who had suffered so much scrutiny for dying on the hill of trans athletes in women's sports dating back to the last election cycle weren't backing down. They doubled-down. At a World’s Strongest Woman–affiliated competition, backlash erupted after a transgender athlete competed in the women’s division. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced an investigation into the event, examining whether allowing a male athlete to compete violated state law. Meanwhile, USA Fencing, which had been the target of months-long backlash following the Turner incident, put out a statement suggesting it was looking to turn the page after a change to its gender eligibility policy and leadership. \"We recognize the challenges of the past several months and are focused on moving forward with integrity, transparency, and a clear vision for the future,\" read a statement provided to Fox News Digital December As 2025 came to a close, December proved to be a quieter month on the culture war's front lines. The Supreme Court cases remained center stage in the conflict, and saw a handful of famed athletes jump into the fight. Super Bowl-winning head coach Barry Switzer and 31 Olympians signed an amicus brief in support of the legal defense to \"save women's sports.\" The signees also include 12 Olympic medalists, including eight gold medalists. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The brief has a total of 124 signatures, which also includes the family members of athletes who signed. The cases are set for oral arguments on Jan. 13, 2026, and could prove to be the most consequential turning point to date in the nation's new obsession over who gets to compete in women's sports.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper and journalist Alex Thompson co-wrote \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" an account of the cover-up that features high-level Democratic sources. The book, which was released in May, was mocked by critics who noted CNN and other mainstream outlets downplayed or were even hostile to the suggestion that Biden could be losing his grip before the infamous debate against President Donald Trump. Tapper’s network was among the most egregious offenders. Videos of Biden freezing up or appearing confused at various events went viral throughout 2024, but the White House aggressively pushed back, saying some of them were edited in a misleading fashion or didn't show what they purported. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: MEDIA EMBRACED BIDEN WHITE HOUSE'S 'CHEAP FAKES' NARRATIVE LEADING UP TO ILL-FATED DEBATE The term \"cheap fakes\" was popularized, and press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted from the podium that fact-checkers and mainstream outlets also embraced the term. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz pushed the White House’s narrative last year about a video of Biden appearing to freeze up at a fundraiser with Jimmy Kimmel, saying Biden had merely \"looked out at the crowd for a few seconds\" before walking offstage with President Barack Obama, adding that \"Republicans and right-leaning media outlets\" \"used this moment to say that President Biden froze.\" Moments later during a panel discussion, CNN commentator and former Kamala Harris adviser Jamal Simmons called Biden's fundraiser moment an \"obviously selected video.\" \"These are cheap fakes, [as] the White House and Biden people are calling them,\" Simmons told CNN's Erin Burnett. However, Tapper suggested he felt differently when promoting his book, which featured numerous anecdotes of Biden appearing confused, tired and out of step, all while his team publicly proclaimed he was completely fit. In one infamous moment confirmed by George Clooney, Biden appeared to forget who the famous actor was when they spoke face-to-face. \"The Biden White House falsely — when people showed that clip and asked what was going on — said it was a ‘cheap fake.’ They did this all the time when there was video that seemed to show Biden acting in an odd or unusual, seemingly out-of-it way, they would call it a ‘cheap fake.’ It was not fake. It was actual video,\" Tapper said in May. Prior to Tapper’s about-face, CNN also cited experts expressing concern about \"ageism,\" including in the aftermath of the Robert Hur report that portrayed Biden as forgetful and confused during an interview. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: PRESS DISMISSED HUR REPORT ON BIDEN'S MEMORY ISSUES LONG BEFORE CONCERNS BECAME UNDENIABLE Ex-CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy repeatedly hammered proponents of the idea that Biden was in mental decline in his \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter before leaving CNN last year. Some conservatives took aim at Tapper directly, alleging he was part of the cover-up and tried to \"re-write history\" with his book. In October 2020, Tapper touted the Biden talking point, even showing a clip from the DNC convention of a 13-year-old Biden supporter with a severe stutter who turned to the Democratic nominee for inspiration, during a tense exchange with then-Trump 2020 campaign advisor Lara Trump (now a Fox News host), who drew attention to Biden's cognitive decline at a campaign event. \"How do you think it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment like that?\" Tapper asked indignantly after showing a clip of Lara Trump commenting on Biden struggling for words. CREDIBILITY CRISIS: WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS SPEAK OUT ON WHETHER BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE WAS DELIBERATELY HIDDEN \"First and foremost, I had no idea that Joe Biden ever suffered from a stutter,\" Lara Trump responded. \"I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline – \" \"Okay,\" Tapper quickly interrupted while talking over her. \"It's so amazing to me — a ‘cognitive decline.’ I think you were mocking his stutter. Yeah. I think you were mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline. I would think somebody in the Trump family would be more sensitive to people who do not have medical licenses diagnosing politicians from afar.\" After Lara Trump insisted Biden's cognitive decline was \"very concerning,\" Tapper cut the interview short. \"Thank you, Lara. I'm sure it's from a place of concern. We all believe that,\" Tapper sarcastically told her before ending the interview. Tapper has since said he feels \"humility\" about his past work on Biden and praised conservative media outlets for discussing what was in plain sight. Tapper has even suggested that he covers Trump’s age more aggressively to make up for overlooking Biden. While Tapper’s book helped bring the issue to the forefront, CNN was hardly alone in its gentle coverage of Biden. The Washington Post used the term \"cheap fakes\" line to shield Biden from scrutiny as early as July 2022 in a fact check accusing a Republican National Committee social media post of painting \"a misleading picture of mental fitness\" based on a viral moment Biden had while in Israel. It defined \"cheap fakes\" as \"the practice of misrepresenting events that take place in a video by adding or leaving out context.\" SHIELDING BIDEN: JOURNALISTS SHED LIGHT ON THE MEDIA'S COVER-UP OF A WEAKENED PRESIDENT Fast-forward to June 2024, when The Post published a lengthy report combating Republicans sharing embarrassing clips of Biden during his trip to Normandy, including when he awkwardly paused while bending to sit down as others remained standing. \"Such deceptively edited videos, known as ‘cheap fakes,’ have become staples of Republican attacks against the president,\" The Post told readers at the time. NBC News accused Republicans of pushing a \"false\" narrative by claiming Biden was wandering aimlessly at the G7 summit. \"Experts have warned that while advanced technology like generative artificial intelligence can spread misinformation, so-called cheap fakes that often use only minor or selective editing can be more effective at spreading false narratives,\" NBC News wrote. NYT, MSNBC, PBS JOURNALISTS PRESSED ON HOW THEY COVERED BIDEN'S AGE: WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO ‘SOUL-SEARCHING’ The New York Times ran a story with the headline \"How Misleading Videos Are Trailing Biden as He Battles Age Doubts,\" insisting the viral clips were either \"edited or lack[ed] context,\" and CBS News released a report sounding the alarm on \"cheap fakes\" and their impact on the upcoming election, echoing the White House's claim that Biden is \"victim to a simpler version of ‘deepfakes.’\" MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace condemned the \"highly misleading and selectively edited videos,\" calling out the \"insidious\" trend from right-wing media.

He didn’t like what he saw.\n\nBy Kate McGee\n\nEarly this year, Texas House Republicans were at war with each other who their next speaker would be. A new megadonor emerged siding with hardline conservatives. But his splashy entrance into the conservative political arena exposed him to some divisive tactics led by conservative powerbroker Tim Dunn. Now he’s had a change of heart. From the story: \n\nFor five hours, Tim Dunn and his advisers walked Alex Fairly through the network of consulting, fundraising and campaign operations they have long used to boost Texas’ most conservative candidates, target those who they deem too centrist and incrementally push the Legislature toward their hardline views.\n\nThe two men talked about political philosophy and strategy. They discussed the Bible at length. Fairly was impressed, he said, if not surprised by the sheer magnitude of Dunn’s “political machine.”\n\n“I think most people underestimate how substantial and how many pieces there are that fit together and how coordinated they are,” Fairly said in an interview with The Texas Tribune.\n\nDunn ended the tour with an ask: Would Fairly be willing to partner with him?\n\nIt was a stunning sign of how suddenly Fairly had emerged as a new power broker in Texas politics. Three years ago, few outside Amarillo had heard the name Alex Fairly. Now, the Panhandle businessman was being offered the chance to team up with one of the most feared and influential conservative figures at the Capitol. \n\nHistory repeated itself when the Guadalupe River swept away Camp Mystic. Why few lessons were learned after the 1987 flood.\n\nBy Alejandra Martinez and Zach Despart\n\nIn 1987, 10 youth campers were killed by rapidly rising floodwaters in Kerr County. That flash flood is strikingly similar to the July 4, 2025 flood that claimed the lives of 27 girls at Camp Mystic and more than 100 others. From the story: \n\nThirty eight years and two weeks later, about 25 miles west of the bus washout, the Guadalupe jumped its banks again during heavy rain. Just like in 1987, locals and visitors were caught off guard in the middle of the night by the rapidly rising river. And once again, young campers on summer break drowned in the raging flood.\n\nThis time, the water killed at least 135 people in Kerr County and other counties in Central Texas.\n\nBut despite the ample warnings that the Guadalupe would flood the region again and the decades of time to act, the Fourth of July flood this year revealed that little had been done to protect the community against future storms.\n\nAfter the 1987 flood, river gauges were installed to provide real-time information to forecasters and emergency managers. But as the years passed, political will and funding for flood warning infrastructure diminished. An effort to get flood sirens never came to fruition; local governments were repeatedly passed over for grants by the state; and the county eliminated its own flood protection tax.\n\nIn rapidly diversifying Tarrant County, a summer of GOP redistricting hits Black and Latino representation\n\nBy Eleanor Klibanoff\n\nAs part of an effort to create more GOP House seats, the Texas Legislature embarked on a bonus round of redistricting this year. Despite explosive growth turning Tarrant County into a racially diverse swing district, it was redrawn to have whiter, more Republican representation. From the story: \n\nIn a county where 47% of voters went for Kamala Harris in 2024, there will likely be just one Democrat on the county commissioner’s court, and one corner of the county represented by a Democrat in Congress. The new districts virtually guarantee Republican candidates their seats, without having to court communities of color they picked up in Tarrant County.\n\nIt’s an evisceration of political power that community leaders fear will set them back decades. It’s especially painful that this is coming right as these communities have finally seen their political clout grow to match their increasing population numbers, Lillie Biggins said.\n\n“We don’t have a voice except through our elected officials,” she said. “If you earn something, you’ve earned it. But if you’re demanding it [or] just taking it — that’s not how this is supposed to work.”\n\nA Houston mother held by ICE must choose: indefinite detention or be deported without her family \n\nBy Uriel J. García\n\nMargarita Avila, a Houston mother of nine, was detained by ICE after an altercation that led to no charges. Her close-knit family members weigh their futures if she is deported. From the story: \n\nJeremiah crumpled his card, which bore a note written in Spanish in his child’s scrawl: “Mother, I love you, and thank you for having me.” He leaned against his other sister, 27-year-old Ester Avila, who hugged him as she wiped her tears away.\n\nIt was the first time any of them could remember Margarita missing a Mother’s Day. She had been sitting in a cell in an immigrant detention center since March as the Trump administration was preparing to deport her to Belize, where she left two decades ago because of threats to her family.\n\n“It’s really hard to see everything my wife is going through,” José said. “It hurts not being able to be with my wife — and seeing my kids sad — because their mother is always around.”\n\nMargarita Avila, 50, is among the tens of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. targeted for deportation in President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump has said his administration is going after “the worst of the worst” in an attempt to deport 1 million immigrants annually. But six months into Trump’s second administration, at least 70% of the more than 56,000 immigrants detained across the country didn’t have a criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonprofit that collects and analyzes federal government data.\n\nHow the political tide turned on Mark Welsh, the four-star general ousted as Texas A&M president\n\nBy Kate McGee and Nicholas Gutteridge\n\nShortly after videos of a Texas A&M professor teaching gender identity were posted online, the popular university president was forced to resign. But that was just the final straw for the political officials and university system regents who were clamoring for a more explicitly conservative leader. From the story: \n\nDuring the short meeting at the Capitol, Gov. Greg Abbott peppered Mark Welsh with questions about the comments Texas Scorecard had dug up, and about Welsh’s views on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Abbott was apparently unsatisfied with Welsh’s answers, according to five people briefed on the encounter.\n\n“There’s no doubt the governor was looking for somebody that was conservative in nature, and I think that he felt that maybe Mark was not as conservative as he was hoping he would be,” Regent Bob Albritton said.\n\nBut the regents felt Welsh was the right leader for the moment. They wanted a steady leader who could calm the waters after a tumultuous summer of back-to-back personnel scandals that led Welsh’s predecessor to resign.\n\nOver the next two years, Welsh repaired relationships with many students, faculty, and alumni. But the skepticism about the “Obama appointee” and his conservative bonafides never went away. This September, a video was posted on social media of a student confronting a professor over the teaching of gender identity at A&M. Welsh defended the professor privately to the student, which was also caught on video, setting off right-wing outrage. Soon after, Albritton, who is now chair of the regents, called Welsh to tell him he could either resign or be fired.\n\nBlamed for the nation’s historic measles outbreak, West Texas Mennonites have hardened their views on vaccines\n\nBy Lindsey Byman\n\nThe small West Texas town of Seminole was the epicenter of a global measles outbreak this year. Some in the community of Mennonites who live there say they’re less likely to get vaccinated today and more skeptical of government mandates. From the story: \n\nBut outside of the West Texas town of 7,000, health experts watched in horror as the once-dormant disease spread like a drop of blood in water across Seminole and the outlying counties, hitting at least three other states and breaching international borders. It killed two children, both Mennonites like Anita Froese. It sickened at least 762 Texans — more than half of whom live in Seminole’s Gaines County — and hospitalized 99 statewide. The West Texas outbreak was the nation’s largest in more than 35 years.\n\nBut for the Mennonites at the center of it, the scrutiny was worse than the disease itself. Today, Froese and others say they’re no more likely to get vaccinated, and they’re even less trusting of the government and health officials who they feel targeted them and blamed them for causing the outbreak.\n\nMennonites questioned why measles forced their religious community into the national spotlight. They didn’t know why TV crews clamored to film them grieving little girls who they believed died from underlying conditions or negligent hospitals rather than measles. They didn’t understand the messages from outsiders demanding they leave the country for exercising their right to not vaccinate.\n\n“You’re looked at as this ignorant people that’s almost fueling this thing, like we’re having measles parties, and that was never the case,” said Pastor Jake Fehr of Mennonite Evangelical Church.\n\nThey couldn’t save their daughters’ lives in the July 4 floods. Now they’re dealing with the grief and the guilt.\n\nBy Emily Foxhall\n\nRJ and Annie Harber have leaned on faith, their community and each other to move through each day after losing their daughters and RJ’s parents. But memories of that night still haunt them. From the story: \n\nRJ faced an impossible choice: He could try to save his kids and almost surely die trying, maybe killing them too, or he could turn back. He could trust the house would hold and the river wouldn’t top the roof and that his daughters would ride out the flood, rattled but alive.\n\nTrees flew past RJ. Then a car came right at him. He started to realize the river could easily take him.\n\nIf RJ could get himself back to Annie, maybe they’d all make it through this alive. He turned the kayak around.\n\n“I had to make a decision,” he said. “And it haunts me every single day.”\n\nOnly later, around 4:15 a.m., would he see one of the texts his youngest daughter sent. “I love you,” it said.\n\n“I love you,” RJ messaged back from a house on higher ground where he and Annie sheltered with other neighbors. “Go to the roof.”\n\nEast Texans united to stop a water sale to Dallas suburbs — for now\n\nBy Jess Huff\n\nAfter a deal to pipe water from Lake O’ the Pines to North Texas came to light, residents voiced opposition everywhere they could to block it. From the story: \n\nLake O’ the Pines is one of the state’s 188 reservoirs built for drinking water. The lake’s almost 18,700 acres of surface water stretch across five northeast Texas counties: Marion, Harrison, Upshur, Morris, and Camp.\n\nBuilt in the 1950s, deep in the thick pine forest near the Louisiana border, the lake has provided drinking water to seven cities surrounding the lake: Avinger, Daingerfield, Hughes Springs, Jefferson, Lone Star, Ore City and Pittsburg. Over the next 70 years, Lake O’ the Pines became a defining force in the region’s economy and culture. Boats regularly dot the lake while visitors cast lines for ​​bass, catfish and crappie.\n\nChristopher Lepri, a Jefferson resident, said selling the water would result in a decline in tourism, growth and property values.\n\n“Lake O’ the Pines is East Texas’ lifeblood, and that lifeblood should never be for sale,” Lepri said at one town hall meeting. “If Lake O’ the Pines is drained or sold, there would be a decline in tourism, growth and property values.”\n\nAfter El Paso joined Abbott’s border crackdown, the number of dead migrants in the New Mexico desert surged\n\nBy Uriel J. García, Yuriko Schumacher and Pat Lohmann of Source New Mexico\n\nSince El Paso joined Operation Lone Star in 2022, migrant remains discovered in the desert west of the city have increased every year, even as they have declined in every other border sector. From the story: \n\nHistorically, Border Patrol’s El Paso sector — which includes all 180 miles of New Mexico’s border with Mexico and 84 miles of El Paso and Hudspeth counties in West Texas — has had among the fewest migrant deaths across the southern border.\n\nThat changed in late December 2022, according to an investigation by The Texas Tribune and Source New Mexico, when the city of El Paso joined forces with Gov. Greg Abbott to participate in his signature border mission, called Operation Lone Star.\n\nBy 2024, the El Paso sector had become the deadliest place for migrants to cross along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nFrom January 2023 to August 2024, 299 human remains were reported in the El Paso sector, the most of any sector along the southern border, according to the most recent data available from federal government data. That’s more than double the number of cases reported during the 20 months prior, when 122 remains were recorded before El Paso had adopted Operation Lone Star.\n\nSince El Paso joined Texas’ border mission in 2022, migrant remains discovered in the El Paso sector have increased every year, even as they have declined in every other part of the border.\n\nFive years after shedding Confederate moniker, a West Texas high school may be Lee High again \n\nBy Carlos Nogueras Ramos\n\nThe Midland school district rebranded Robert E. Lee High as Legacy High in 2020, part of a nationwide trend to distance public places from the Confederacy. From the story: \n\nFive years ago, she was proud of the Midland Independent School District. Its board of trustees had voted to rename a school carrying the name of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, which she considered a stain on the community, to Legacy High School.\n\nThat pride may soon give way to shame. A new configuration of the Midland school board is set to consider reverting the school’s name to Midland Lee, affixing Lee’s legacy once more. A vote may come as early as Tuesday.\n\n“My daughter is going to this school, and she’s an athlete, representing the school, not just in Midland, but when we travel,” La’Toya Mayberry said of her youngest, Erinn, a junior varsity basketball player. “What does this say to her that you want to restore a name that meant whites only?”\n\nHow building a new hospital cost this rural Texas town a place to deliver babies\n\nBy Eleanor Klibanoff\n\nA small Texas town promised locals it would build a new hospital at no additional cost to tax payers. But a series of issues plaguing rural health care providers led to leaders having to eliminate the labor and delivery unit. From the story: \n\nFacing a budget shortfall and rising costs, the hospital board had decided to cut what has long been its costliest service.\n\nOlney’s shiny new hospital, designed to serve the region for the next 100 years, would not be able to deliver babies.\n\nThe decision divided the typically tight-knit town of about 3,000 people, angering residents, frustrating local employers and economic development leaders, and pitting the doctor who still wants to deliver babies against the hospital board members who have to balance the budget.\n\n“We cannot make it make sense for us, financially,” Dale Lovett told The Texas Tribune in an interview. “We all want the same thing, to deliver babies and offer every service we can, but it wasn’t an option.”\n\nTrump vowed to end “wasteful” federal spending. Beloved Texas school programs got caught in the middle. \n\nBy Jaden Edison\n\nSweeping and sudden funding changes this year put two revered after-school programs for low-income Texans and a rural teacher training initiative at risk of closure. From the story: \n\nBut two weeks before their arrival on Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump’s administration threw one of many curveballs lobbed during the first months of his second term. The U.S. Department of Education notified state education officials on the last day of June that it would pause the disbursement of nearly $7 billion in funds for teacher development, support for students learning English, and before- and after-school programs predominantly serving low-income families, pending a review of how schools had put the money to use. That notice went out a day before states expected to begin receiving the money.\n\nFor Texas, it meant a potential loss of nearly $670 million. For Na’Siah Martin and H’Sanii Blankenship, it potentially meant losing the Boys and Girls Club, a space that has aided their growth as both leaders and individuals. Martin, 18, graduated from Navarro Early College High School in June and has participated in the club since elementary school. Blankenship, a 17-year-old incoming senior at the same school, has participated in the club for about as long as Martin.","summary":"As 2025 draws down, the Tribune reflects on some of its most memorable storytelling of the year.","url":"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/12/26/texas-tribune-2025-best-reads/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0806-Texas-Capitol-RB-01.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 11:00:00","author":"Rebekah Allen","authors":["Rebekah Allen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.089},{"id":389167008,"title":"Trump promised to lower prices — it hasn’t worked out that way","text":"There was an event held at Donald Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, during the 2024 presidential campaign that I think about with some regularity. It involved the former-and-future president speaking to reporters while surrounded by tables showing various grocery items and the increase in their prices during President Joe Biden’s administration. \n\nTrump mostly talked about how bad his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would be for the country, eventually meandering around the tables and reading from the labels. (“I haven't seen Cheerios in a long time,” he remarked. ) The imagery was incongruous: The billionaire president emerging from his high-end golf club to observe that the prices for things he doesn’t buy had surged during the pandemic. He never really explained how he might bring prices down; he just insisted he would.\n\nIn most cases he hasn’t. \n\nonSome of these surges in costs are directly downstream from the tariffs Trump imposed on imports.\n\nA review of nearly 170 items tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) indicates that seven in ten have seen prices increase since January. Trump has gone from being the guy outside the system complaining about things getting worse to being the guy in charge and getting blamed for still-rising costs. \n\nWhat hasn’t changed for Trump, though, is that he’s still the guy who likes to slather buildings in gold and visit his private clubs and resorts (which he’s done on 123 of the 340 days of his second term, as of December 23). He’s the guy spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build a ballroom at the executive mansion, while the price of ground beef skyrockets.\n\nBeef is one of the categories that’s seen the highest price increases since January, according to consumer price index data for urban areas through November (the most recent date available). Some of the other largest increases are in the costs of tax preparation, the price of jewelry and the prices of audio equipment and coffee. The prices of those items serve as a reminder of another way in which Trump is poorly positioned to talk about tackling inflation: Some of these surges in costs are directly downstream from the tariffs Trump imposed on imports.\n\nAn analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAgain, not all prices have increased. The price of eggs, for example, is down substantially since January — though that’s in large part because an outbreak of avial flu caused the price of eggs to soar in 2024.\n\nIn only one category tracked by the BLS have prices dropped on average: transportation, which benefits from a decline in fuel prices. Everywhere else, including in topline indices themselves, prices are still increasing.\n\nAn analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis isn’t surprising, of course. Prices tend to go up; while deflation — prices going down — carries its own problems. But Trump promised repeatedly that he would halt or reverse price increases, promises that were obviously unattainable.\n\nIn some cases, the items with the largest price increases in 2025 are ones whose prices were already increasing over the course of 2024. Often, though, prices only started to spike this year, while Trump was president. \n\nYou can see both in the charts below, showing the 24 categories in which the price index increased the most in 2025.\n\nAn analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nYou can likewise see that the items for which prices decreased exhibited both patterns: some drops began only this year, while others (like gas prices) began to fall in 2024.\n\nAn analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAs you might expect, Trump mentions the price of eggs a lot. (Such as during his address to the nation last week, for example.) On the subject of inflation overall, though, he tends to be dismissive, clearly not wanting to talk about it. He’s blamed discussions of affordability on Democrats and the media — and suggested that it’s overstated.\n\nPerhaps he thinks it is. He doesn’t go grocery shopping. He doesn’t buy Cheerios. And if he did, he wouldn’t have any trouble paying for it. \n\nBut for the rest of us, it isn’t that simple. Many Americans voted for Donald Trump believing that the economic pressure they faced from post-pandemic price increases would evaporate because Trump insisted that it would.In most cases, it hasn’t.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-prices-affordability-groceries-consumer-price-index","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1766526957/251223-donald-trump-groceries-affordability-es/251223-donald-trump-groceries-affordability-es.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 11:00:00","author":"Max Burns","authors":["Max Burns"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":389153452,"title":"UK teacher is accused of posing risk to children and referred to counter-terror programme for showing Trump videos to his US politics class","text":"A UK teacher was accused of posing a risk to children and referred to a government counter-terrorism programme after showing videos of Donald Trump to his US politics class. \n\nThe Oxfordshire teacher in his 50s said he was 'likened to a terrorist' after he showed the videos, one including Mr Trump's inauguration, to A-level students, the Telegraph reported.\n\nHenley College - a sixth form in Henley-on-Thames with more than 2,000 students - reported the teacher to the local child safeguarding authority.\n\nThe local authority then decided that he should be referred further to Prevent, the Government's counter-terrorism programme, as a 'priority'.\n\nThe teacher, who does not wish to be identified, told the Telegraph: 'They likened me to a terrorist. It was completely jarring.\n\n'It's dystopian, like something from a George Orwell novel.'\n\nShowing the videos was suggested as amounting to a 'hate crime' in one document seen by the Telegraph. \n\nThe politics lecturer was accused of causing his students, aged 17 and 18, 'emotional harm'.\n\nThe teacher did not take the terrible allegations lying down however, launching a grievance procedure against the college.\n\nDespite this, he was still effectively forced to resign his £44,000-a-year post but received a £2,000 payoff.\n\n The Free Speech Union has said they believe the laws that were initially intended to protect children from murderers and rapists were being twisted to go after adults with unfashionable opinions.\n\nThe teacher's case was an example of child safety protocols 'being weaponised to silence someone for political reasons', the Union said. \n\nHenley College began its investigations in January 2025 following two complaints by students in his class which accused him of 'biased' and 'off topic' teaching.\n\nThe teacher was alleged to have shown videos of Donald Trump and his campaign 'propaganda' and other videos which were 'unrelated' to what was being taught.\n\nThis made a student 'feel quite uncomfortable'. \n\nThe teacher said: 'It was just terrifying; just mind-boggling. We were discussing the US election, Trump had just won and I showed a couple of videos from the Trump campaign.\n\n'Next thing, I was accused of bias. One of the students said they were emotionally disturbed and claimed to have had nightmares.'\n\nThe teacher, a practising Catholic, admits he is a Republican supporter but said he was 'not an extremist' and that his views are mainstream.\n\nIn return, he said the college itself has a 'complete Left-wing bias' and does not 'tolerate anything about Donald Trump.' \n\nOn the College's referral to the safeguarding Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO), a report said the teacher's views 'could be perceived as radical' and told the school they should refer him to the counter terrorism programme, Prevent.\n\nThe report added that his behaviour 'could cause harm to a child' and that there could be a 'criminal offence' that could amount to a 'hate crime' and that it was possible that promoting his views could be considered 'radicalisation'.\n\nThe teacher said: 'I felt completely insulted at the suggestion I was a danger to children.\n\n'It impacted my mental health. I had to see a counsellor. It upset my physical health. It was absolutely appalling. It really overwhelmed me.'\n\nBy April he was accused of misconduct in a formal letter, his alleged offence was to have caused students 'emotional harm' by showing them the 'inappropriate content' and videos and presenting 'potentially extremist views' with a 'lack of balance'.\n\nIt cited complaints made by his students as evidence towards this. \n\nOne of the videos in question was a music video - Daddy's Home by Roseanne Barr, a US comedian and Trump supporter, with Tom MacDonald, a Canadian known as the Maga Rapper.\n\nThe YouTube video was suggested to him by one of his pupils.\n\nThe teacher said he could not understand how showing this video could lead a student to be 'emotionally disturbed'. \n\nHe had been switched to teach politics in September 2024 amid staff shortages, previously teaching business studies at the college and receiving praise for his work.\n\nHe believes that a group of students targeted him since this take over.\n\nNow, the teacher is working part time as a supply teacher while hunting for a full-time post.\n\nHe has extensive family ties to the US but insists his Republican views are not extremist. \n\nThere was also a balance involved in the videos he was showing, he claimed contrary to their allegations, adding that he had shown videos of Kamala Harris to the class too.\n\nFive Trump related videos had been put on for the class before the complaint was made, he said. \n\nIn April, while he was being accused of misconduct, he wrote a letter to US vice president JD Vance, complaining of 'communist-style silencing' and his school but he received no reply, unsure if Mr Vance ever received the letter.\n\nLooking for further support, he contacted the Free Speech Union (FSU) who claimed in his defence that he was a victim of 'bullying and harassment'.\n\nThey pointed out that the accusation that he had shown a 'genocide video' to children was bogus as the video was part of the set teaching materials provided by the Holocaust Education Trust.\n\nHenley College, said: 'The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\n\n'We are committed to safeguarding the wellbeing of all our students and staff, and follow statutory safeguarding procedures in line with Keeping Children Safe in Education 2025.\n\n'Allegations are handled with due care, in accordance with statutory guidance, with appropriate support provided to all involved.","summary":"The Oxfordshire teacher in his 50s said he was 'likened to a terrorist' after he showed the videos, one including Mr Trump's inauguration, to A-level students.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15413933/UK-teacher-accused-posing-risk-children-referred-counter-terror-programme-showing-Trump-videos-US-politics-class.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/26/10/105027039-0-image-a-10_1766743667012.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 10:43:41","author":"Editor,Jake Holden","authors":["Editor","Jake Holden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.662},{"id":389233042,"title":"13 facts you didn't know about Love Actually!

You have a pre-conception in places in the world where life is very hard that love wouldn't be one of the things that people's minds are on, whereas my experience when I go to Africa is that that's completely not true.'\nIn another interview shared by the channel, Richard expressed he was also sad to lose the storyline with Anne Reid, which was there to get across that everyone in life 'has their own complicated tale of love'.\nKeira Knightley and Thomas Brodie-Sangster's age gap\n\nView gallery\n\nKeira's character, Juliet, marries Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), but Peter's best man, Mark (Andrew Lincoln), is secretly in love with her (Keira and Andrew pictured)\n\nView gallery\n\nAnd while her script involved a very mature and grownup storyline, she was aged 17 and was just five years older than Thomas (seen), who played the youngest love story in the movie\nKeira's character, Juliet, marries Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), but Peter's best man, Mark (Andrew Lincoln), is secretly in love with her. \nThis led to a famous scene where he confesses his feelings using cue cards on her doorstep, ending with a brief kiss before he leaves, and she returns inside to her husband. \nAnd while her script involved a very mature and grownup storyline, she was aged 17 and was just five years older than Thomas, who played the youngest love story in the movie. \nThomas played Sam, the young stepson of Daniel (played by Liam Neeson) - a boy grieving his mother who learns to play drums to impress his crush, Joanna (played by Olivia Olson), culminating in an airport dash to confess his feelings.\nAfter his airport dash, Thomas and Joanna share a kiss, which is believed to have been Joanna very first kiss in real life. \nAnd this wasn't the only time Thomas and Olivia starred as characters in love as they also had a romantic storyline on Phineas And Ferb, where Thomas voiced Ferb and Olivia voiced Vanessa Doofenshmirtz. \nFerb has a long-standing crush on Vanessa, the daughter of Dr. Doofenshmirtz. \nTheir story line evolves from chance encounters during their childhood to a confirmed romantic relationship when they are teenagers in a flash-forward episode.\nColin Firth's lake scene led to injury\n\nView gallery\n\nThe lake in which Colin Firth and his co-star Lúcia Moniz swam in was only 18 inches deep and they had to kneel down, pretending to be in deeper water\nColin plays writer Jamie, who retreats to Portugal after finding his girlfriend cheating with his brother. \nHe falls for his Portuguese housekeeper, Aurelia (played by Lúcia Moniz) and their romance blossoms despite having a language barrier. \nTheir day-to-day romance culminates the iconic scene where she jumps into a lake to save his dropped papers. \nThis lead to a proposal where he learns Portuguese to ask her to marry him. \nBut during their lake accident the two actors were actually swimming in 18 inches of water and had to kneel down to pretend the water was deep. \nColin was also injured during this scene as the lake was over run with mosquitos.

Elected after two impeachments and a felony conviction, sworn in indoors amid brutal cold, and unleashing an unprecedented executive-order barrage in his first 100 days, Trump also entered office as the oldest president ever at inauguration. A Musk-backed “DOGE” initiative further blurred lines between government and private tech. These milestones redefined modern presidencies. First president who is also a felon Trump became the first US president to win election after a felony conviction. In 2024 May a New York jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election, as detailed in court records and Associated Press. Sentenced on January 10, 2025, to an unconditional discharge (no jail time, fines, or probation due to his incoming presidency), the conviction didn't disqualify him under the Constitution's eligibility clauses. Congress certified his electoral-vote victory over Kamala Harris on January 6, 2025, paving the way for his inauguration. ALSO READRead FE 2026 Money Playbook: Your Ultimate Investment Guide for the new year First to be elected after two impeachments Trump is the only US president elected after two impeachments by the US House. The House impeached him first on December 18, 2019, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over Ukraine aid withholding (acquitted by Senate February 5, 2020). The second came on January 13, 2021, for incitement of insurrection post-January 6 Capitol riot (acquitted February 13, 2021). No prior president faced even one impeachment pre- or post-election, per Congressional Research Service records. Oldest President at Inauguration At 78 years and 7 months on January 20, 2025, Trump broke Joe Biden's record as the oldest president sworn in, surpassing Biden's 78 years and 2 months from 2021. This milestone fuelled scrutiny over presidential fitness, prompting Republican-led pushes for a 25th Amendment review clause (though none materialised) and ongoing health disclosures under the Americans with Disabilities Act precedents. The first indoor inauguration in modern memory Severe cold in the Washington DC forecast prompted the White House to move much of the January 20 ceremonies indoors, a step Trump himself announced, making the 2025 ceremony notable as an indoor inauguration (with related parade elements relocated to nearby arenas). Media coverage and inauguration-day dispatches documented the exceptional logistics and security arrangements that accompanied the move, Reuters reported. Executive orders at a breakneck pace Perhaps the most consequential \"first\" was the pace of executive action. During his first 100 days back in office Trump signed well over 140 executive orders, a number that, by multiple counts, exceeded the prior modern record for orders in that 100-day benchmark and dwarfed most recent predecessors.

DOGE: From meme coin to Department of Government Efficiency One of the stranger storylines of 2025 was the rise of a Musk-linked tech effort inside the federal government known as “DOGE”, a name borrowed from the Dogecoin meme that began as a joke in online crypto culture. Short for the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE showed up repeatedly in press coverage and was even mentioned by Trump, including ideas about returning some of its claimed \"savings\" to Americans. Later reports claimed that DOGE personnel were working inside federal agencies and using AI and data-analysis tools, sometimes in ways that sparked controversy. Depending on who you asked, DOGE was seen as a serious attempt to speed up the government, a flashy PR experiment, or a troubling expansion of surveillance inside the state. He broke down White House's structure Trump dismantled traditional White House hierarchies, installing family scions like son-in-law Jared Kushner as senior advisor and creating ad-hoc \"war rooms\" for policy blitzes, bypassing Chief of Staff structures. By March 2025, he fired interim Chief Susie Wiles and restructured into flat \"task forces\" led by loyalists like Stephen Miller, as per Axios, contrasting siloed directorates under Bush or Obama. ALSO READUS National Trust vs Trump: Lawsuit filed against White House ballroom’s construction Why these firsts mattered Taken together, these firsts changed the tenor of US governance in 2025. A president taking office despite a felony conviction raised novel legal and political questions about accountability, pardon power, and public trust. An indoor inauguration underscored both the administration’s messaging priorities and the practical constraints of weather and security. And the executive-order blitz fundamentally shifted how policy was made, privileging speed and unilateral action while prompting a wave of litigation and state-federal pushback. Meanwhile, integrating private-sector tech teams like DOGE into government operations raised fresh debates about oversight, civil-service norms and surveillance. Overall, 2025 will be remembered as a year in which precedent was repeatedly tested. The core takeaway is simple: these \"firsts\" didn’t just make headlines, they reconfigured how power was exercised and scrutinised in modern America under Trump.","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/trumps-2025-historic-firsts-felon-president-oldest-leader-indoor-inauguration-and-executive-frenzy/4079221/","image":"https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/12/rachael-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-26 09:36:11","author":"Disha Jana","authors":["Disha Jana"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.091},{"id":389123244,"title":"Google reveals the top trending searches of 2025","text":"As 2025 winds down and the new year is around the corner, Google has unveiled its Year in Search, spotlighting the events, people and pop-culture moments that prompted the biggest spikes in search interest.\n\nCharlie Kirk topped this year’s list as the No. 1 trending search in the US.\n\nThe Turning Point USA founder was shot and killed while speaking at a campus event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, fueling a nationwide surge in search activity.\n\nRounding out the top five were Netflix’s hit film “KPop Demon Hunters,” the viral plush collectible Labubu, Apple’s iPhone 17 and the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which was signed into law in July.\n\nOther major spikes in search activity included New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, the AI platform DeepSeek, the government shutdown, the FIFA Club World Cup, and tariffs, according to Google.\n\nTop trending US searches of 2025\n\n1.

The Labor Department reported last week that consumer prices rose 2.7% in November compared with a year earlier. That’s an improvement from the September rate of 3%.\n\nMany economists had predicted a steeper rise. But even core inflation, “which strips out volatile food and energy prices,” The Wall Street Journal reported, came in below expectations at 2.6%. Deeper data showed progress in both housing and food costs, important markers to many voters. Food prices rose at a much slower pace in November (2.6%) than in September (3.1%). The same was true for housing costs, which were up 3.6% in September but only 3% in November.\n\nThe markets responded positively to the news. The Dow rose more than 180 points last Friday. The S&P 500 was up nearly 0.9%, and the Nasdaq reflected a healthy increase of 1.3%.\nDemocrats have been banging away at the Trump administration of late on the “affordability” issue, sensing a political advantage.\n\nThis is ironic from numerous perspectives.\n\nInflation was an afterthought for years until it again flourished under President Joe Biden. Abetted by a Democratic spending spree as the nation emerged from the pandemic, Biden presided over the worst inflation in four decades, with prices rising consistently from the start of his presidency until inflation reached 9% in June 2022. The Biden White House for months pretended the problem didn’t exist. And even as inflation began to slowly recede in 2023, it remained above 3% for much of his last year in office.\n\nIn addition, Democrats offer little in the way of policy prescriptions that will actually make anything more “affordable.” Instead, their go-to solutions typically involve additional government interventions in the marketplace — rent control, price controls, subsidies for energy usage — that disguise higher prices rather than create the economic conditions for growth and increased competition that will down prices and ensure more widespread prosperity.\n\nIt is true that, thanks to the government shutdown during October and into November, the latest data is not as comprehensive as usual. We’ll learn more next month when December numbers are released. But that doesn’t mean the November numbers are irrelevant. “It’s possible that this does reflect a genuine drop-off in inflationary pressures,” Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics’ chief North America economist, told NBC News.\n\nRising prices contributed to Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump last year. Voter malaise over the economy remains a threat to Trump and the GOP as the midterms approach. The November report is good news for the administration, but Trump and Republicans can best combat the Democratic “affordability” onslaught by emphasizing a tax and regulatory agenda that encourages economic growth and middle-class job creation.\n\nLas Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service","summary":"The November inflation numbers are in, and they’re a disappointment for Democrats.

She warned that similar incidents would become commonplace within the US unless lawmakers took decisive action against Islamic extremists and sources of funding, and called upon followers to repeat Dipu Chandra Das's name.Speaking about the lynching in Bangladesh, Loomer warned that it was \"Coming to America soon if we don’t start demanding our lawmakers speak out about Islam and the Islamic-funded effort on the right to mainstream Jew hatred, anti-Christian hatred.\" She also alleged that certain American media personalities were deliberately attempting to downplay Islamist narratives that fuel radicalism and extremism, taking the name of Tucker Carlson, whom she referred to as \"Tucker Qatarlson\".

It’s delicious. But, the scent can be overbearing at times,\" said Loomer.LAURA LOOMER ON LYNCHING OF HINDU MAN IN BANGLADESHIn her latest post in which she referred to Dipu Chandra Das, the Bangladeshi Hindu who was lynched, Laura Loomer urged her followers to demand American lawmakers \"speak out about Islam\", warning that similar sentiments were well on their way to spreading from South Asia to the West unless decisive action was taken.Laura Loomer had previously warned of the \"Islamist takeover of America\" after the electoral victories of several Indian-origin Democrats like Zohran Mamdani and Ghazala Firdaus Hashmi.Dipu Chandra Das was a Bangladeshi garment worker and the sole earner of his family who was lynched by an Islamist mob who had levelled accusations of blasphemy against him. The incident took place in the midst of violent anti-India protests across Bangladesh following the assassination of firebrand student leader Osman Hadi.The incident led to outrage within India and Hindus across the world.

Warnock was elected Georgia’s first Black senator in 2021 and has been a pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church for about two decades.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN’s Dana Bash had her panel look at the odds of prominent Democrats winning the party’s 2028 presidential nomination based on prediction market company Kalshi.\n\nBash said Newsom’s odds “shot up,” showing that he has a 36 percent chance at being the Democratic presidential nominee. \n\n“And in fact, he shot up in August when he started the fight for, which he won, for Prop50 to change the [congressional] maps in response to the fact that Texas changed the maps mid-decade. AOC is very far behind him. And [former Vice President] Kamala Harris even behind AOC,” Bash said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez had a 9 percent chance at the nomination and Harris trailed with 7 percent. \n\nBloomberg opinion columnist Nia Malika Henderson later chimed in: “The other person I might add to that is Raphael Warnock out of Georgia, who is [an] incredibly talented politician, has won in Georgia, just recently gave a speech about spirituality and affordability at the Center for American Progress. So, he is the one I think, to that list of 500 people, I would add him.”\n\nNBC News’ Kristen Welker mentioned Warnock’s Center for American Progress speech on Meet the Press earlier this month and asked how faith can address “the deepening divides” in America. \n\nWarnock said, “There’s kind of a spiritual heaviness in the land as people see a deepening and widening chasm between what they need from their government. Everything is basic as the safety of their children when they leave them…on a school campus all the way to healthcare. And as that chasm broadens, I think a kind of cynicism and despair sets in.\n\n“And rather than people turning toward each other, they are tempted to turn on each other. And that creates just the kind of atmosphere where strongmen emerge, promising to solve all of our problems in one fell swoop. We have to resist that and recognize that the way to our own wholeness and well being is to affirm the humanity of our neighbors,” he added. \n\nWarnock later added, “Donald Trump, if he’s better at something than anybody else, it’s dividing us.”\n\nHe then went on to attack Trump’s economic agenda, saying that people’s “cost for health are doubling while Congress engages in everyday political games. They’re seeing their utility costs go up, their grocery costs go up.”\n\nWhile affordability still remains an issue for many Americans, inflation is cooling. The Consumer Price Index, which tracks changes in the prices consumers pay for goods and services, found that prices rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate in November, down from 3 percent in September.\n\nTrump later lashed out at Warnock on Truth Social, writing, “Warnock spent the entire show using Religion to try and divide the Country! If a Republican, in particular ME, made those statements, it would be FRONT PAGE NEWS. He ended by saying that he was going to his Church to preach now, and while I think that’s fine, I do say, ‘What ever happened to separation of Church and State?’ That would be the first thing they would use against us but, actually, it’s something that never much bothered me.”\n\nIn response to his attack, Warnock said in an Instagram video, “Mr. President, my faith is not a weapon, it’s a bridge, and I invite you to Bible study. Maybe you can meet the Jesus I know. In the meantime, I’m going to keep fighting for the people.”\n\nWhile some are predicting nominees for the 2028 presidential election, Democrats have a more pressing matter — the 2026 midterm elections. To gain control of Congress, Democrats will have to win a net gain of about four seats in the Senate and five seats in the House.","summary":"Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia was named as a possible candidate to be the 2028 Democratic presidential nominee","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/2028-election-democrats-nominee-raphael-warnock-b2890565.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/26/2/28/Screenshot-2025-12-25-at-9-47-50-PM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0fhoPgjO-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-26 03:09:12","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":389075410,"title":"Most iconic Hollywood couples who've matched after Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet stole show","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Dec 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump launches 'powerful and deadly' strike on ISIS in Nigeria and warns of more if attacks persist\n\nTravis Kelce addresses retirement decision in emotional pregame interview ahead of potential last dance at Arrowhead\n\nInfluencer Estee Williams reveals her baby daughter is on life support after suffering terrifying cardiac arrest\n\nTaylor Swift spreads Christmas cheer as she supports fiance Travis Kelce and the Chiefs in their festive fixture\n\nThe ugly, unavoidable truth everyone must face after the alleged murder of Rob and Michele Reiner... by their son: KENNEDY\n\nMagic elves of Alaska REVEALED: As new photo emerges, indigenous filmmaker reveals truth of 4-foot tall beings... with superhuman strength\n\nBBQ chain shutters half its restaurants as it slumps into Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nTen US housing markets are crashing like the Great Recession - most are in Florida and Texas but one is a surprise\n\nDisturbing clues emerge from Portuguese hometown of MIT assassin amid search for motive: 'He was always a little strange'\n\nPictured: Beloved uncle and amputee who was crushed to death while trying to pay for McDonald's drive-thru breakfast\n\nObama Foundation chief breaks silence on controversial design of Obama's 'eyesore' presidential library\n\nAll the signs he's cheating on you.

Like, I just love carrying babies,' she said.\n'And it was lovely. But I was a bit on edge thinking, oh, gosh, like, I want to get past the 12 weeks. I want to get past this.

Every, every symptom under the sun. I was like, I think I'm pregnant.' \n'And then we went for what was a 20-week scan, but we were actually 22 weeks, and that was just the worst day of my life. Like horrendous.\n'And I just knew something was wrong in the scan, and he just kept going over the same thing, over the same thing...

That's a $2,000 increase from the $1,000 incentive the Trump administration has been offering since the start of his second term.\n\n\"Well, it's home for the holidays season so, you know, not only are we returning those kiddos back to their families that Biden lost, we also are saying that if you voluntarily want to go home now to your country, if you're in this United States of America illegally, we will give you $3,000 through the holidays to send you home,\" Noem said in a Fox News interview. \"We will buy you a ticket, give you $3,000 to go home, and that includes people that have not been detained, maybe have interacted with us, are detained, and don't have criminal charges against them.\" \n\n\"Raise your hand, we'll help you get home, we'll facilitate it, and you might get the chance to come back to this country the right way someday,\" Noem added. \"If you wait until we interdict you and detain you, and arrest you, and have to deport you ourselves, you'll never get the chance to come back. So go on the CBP home app, and get the information, and we'll make sure you get home in time for Christmas.\"\n\nICE also dropped a festive ad about the offer, one that featured Santa donning some ICE gear.\n\n\"Avoid ICE Air and Santa's Naughty List!\" the social media post read. \"Self-deport today with the CBP Home app, earn $3,000 and spend Christmas at home with loved ones. Holiday incentive is valid through the end of 2025.\"\n\nBut some find this problematic, and wonder why we're spending this money \"rewarding\" illegal immigrants.\n\n\"Can you imagine if Joe Biden started rewarding illegal immigrants with $3,000 checks on their way home? Oh how it would be mocked! Noem takes $$ from you and sends it to illegal immigrants b/c she cares more about population purity than any other value.\"\n\nCan you imagine if Joe Biden started rewarding illegal immigrants with $3,000 checks on their way home?

It costs American taxpayers at least $150 billion annually to house, feed, and educate illegal immigrants.\n\nWhatever we spend to deport them will pale in comparison to the vast sums of money we'd pay to keep them here.\n\nFEMA even used money to put illegal immigrants up in fancy hotels while kicking North Carolinians displaced by hurricanes out of their hotels into the winter weather.\n\nThis mess was created by the Biden administration, and the Trump administration is cleaning up the mess.\n\nThat's something one social media user pointed out.\n\n\"She's busy fixing the mess the last administration put us in. Funny how detractors say nothing about four years of open borders, 300k lost children, and hundreds of dead illegal aliens trying to get across the border at the hands of cartels. Noem has the fortitude to take that on,\" one social media user wrote.\n\nShe's busy fixing the mess the last administration put us in.

The Biden administration tried to create a mess so catastrophic that it would be impossible for the next administration, Democrat or otherwise, to fix it. Of course, we all know Kamala Harris would've continued the Biden-era policies and made things even worse.\n\nFixing the immigration problem is hard because Democrats made it hard.\n\nBut Bier doubled down, writing, \"No personal responsibility. Always blaming others for your ineptitude, failures, and lack of principle. Lots of lies. No leadership.\"\n\nNo personal responsibility.

Bier (@David_J_Bier) December 22, 2025\n\nNo, this is what leadership and responsibility look like. And this is exactly what we voted for.\n\nEditor’s Note: Thanks to President Trump, illegal immigration into our great country has virtually stopped. Despite the radical left's lies, new legislation wasn't needed to secure our border, just a new president.\n\nHelp us continue to report the truth about the president's border policies and mass deportations.

I'm on skis everyday, which I love. I bought myself some fun gifts I'm about to open. My family is back in Minnesota - they're all together, my aunts, uncles, cousins. They're currently playing Yahtzee - I've talked to them all on the phone multiple times today,' she said. \n\n'Yeah. We're doing well. I just wanted to say Merry Christmas to all.'\n\nThe missive took a turn when Walz brought up the increase in ICE enforcement in her home state and Minneapolis. \n\n'Today, I’m holding all of our neighbors that ICE has been terrorizing near and dear to my heart and sending them love and light as well as all of our unhoused folks, and just anybody that may be struggling right now, I’m holding very close to me and I hope you can all do so as well. \n\n'This past year has been a tough one for all of us, but I am so proud of all the work I have done in this awesome community and everything you guys do every day.\n\n'And, yeah - happy holidays. Happy holidays. Have a wonderful, wonderful holiday with those you care about and yeah. I'll see you soon,' she concluded.\n\nWalz emerged as a messenger for the Democratic party after last year's election. Her father and Kamala Harris were running mates.\n\nNow a social media star, her content revolves around pop culture, fitness, and progressive politics. \n\nWalz's post predominantly target Gen Z women - a demographic Harris won by a smaller margin than former President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump called her father 'retarded' after The New York Times reported that criminals in her home state stole more than $1billion from Medicaid-funded social programs run by the state.\n\nMany of the suspects came from Somali immigrant communities.\n\n'The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both,' Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time, on Thanksgiving.\n\nThe younger Walz took to TikTok to defend her father afterwards, accusing Trump of inspiring his 'cult members' to name call and attack her family in a since-deleted video to TikTok.\n\n'The president calling my dad what he did has unleashed a f***ing s***storm regarding offensive language towards me and my family,' she said. \n\n'You can call me whatever you want, you can call my dad, my mom. When it's Gus, f*** to the no. F*** to the no,' she said, naming her brother, who has a non-verbal learning disability. \n\n'He dealt with people calling him that last August and now there's a resurgence,' she said, referring to the viral moment during last year's Democratic National Convention where Gus was seen crying and saying 'that's my dad' as the governor accepted the vice presidential nomination.\n\n'I have people DMing me saying absolutely horrendous things.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nThe 2026 campaigns for governor, a raft of other statewide offices, 52 congressional seats and 100 slots in the state Legislature officially began last week with the onset of candidate filing. It could be one of the oddest election cycles in California’s 175 years as a state, albeit one that puts the state’s convoluted politics in the national spotlight.\n\nThere are so many Democrats running for governor that it’s theoretically possible for a Republican to win the office, despite the state’s deeply blue political profile, especially with the possibility of even more Democratic hopefuls jumping into the mob — as a herd of kangaroos is dubbed in Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, both incumbent members of Congress and aspirants will be running in districts that have been radically gerrymandered to shrink Republicans’ tiny delegation even more, as Democrats seek to regain control of Congress.\n\nThe possibility of a Republican governor, although very scant, stems from the state’s top-two primary election system. All candidates, regardless of party, will appear on the same June 2 primary election ballot, and the two with the highest percentages of the vote — no matter how small those shares may be — will face each other in the November election.\n\nWith upwards of a dozen Democrats now running and the possibility of others, it’s possible the two Republicans in the mix so far — Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former television commentator Steve Hilton — could theoretically finish one and two with perhaps as few as 10-15% of the votes each.\n\nIt’s not likely if the Democratic cohort shrinks in the next few months as the weakest contenders drop out, lacking enough money or poll support to continue. However, the lack of a natural Democratic frontrunner and the seeming lack of party leadership strong enough to cull the herd bolster the mathematical possibility of a GOP upset.\n\nHad former Vice President Kamala Harris or U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla decided to run, either would have been the immediate frontrunner. But by opting out, they left a vacuum.\n\nAt the moment, former Congresswoman Katie Porter is leading the Democratic pack, albeit with scarcely double-digit support in the polls. She and former Controller Betty Yee are the only two women now running with Harris. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former state Sen. Toni Atkins out . Porter also gained recognition during her unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat last year.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer is currently the most visible contender, spending some of his immense wealth on television and internet ads to depict himself as a populist who rails against “Sacramento politicians” and promises to reduce electric bills — not unlike how Donald Trump achieved success.\n\nBeyond Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Biden cabinet member Xavier Becerra appear to be the strongest Democratic strivers. However, everyone is still waiting to see whether Attorney General Rob Bonta or Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso will opt in.\n\nHaving so much uncertainty this late in the game is very unusual. However, at some point, perhaps around February or March, when the Democratic field finally begins to shrink, it will be possible to sort out the truly viable candidates from the wannabes and do some realistic handicapping.\n\nUntil then, as Willie Brown, the former state Assembly speaker and San Francisco Mayor and one of the state’s most astute politicians, put it to Politico:\n\n“The field is not considered of a quality that you as a Democrat would expect in California. We’re still pretty much carried away with stardom, with individuals who have some impact … We don’t have any candidates like that at the moment.”\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

He remains the Democratic party’s favorite elder statesman from the North.\n\nA poll conducted by JL Partners exclusively for the Daily Mail has revealed that Bernie Sanders is the most favored political figure among Democrats, earning a net favorability rating of 65 points, surpassing all others.\n\nWhile Santa Claus enjoys a net favorability of 59 points, Sanders edges him out, particularly noteworthy during the festive season when Santa’s popularity traditionally peaks.\n\nAlthough former Vice President Kamala Harris is viewed favorably by 78 percent of Democrats, her higher unfavorable ratings result in a net favorability of 62 points, placing her just behind Sanders.\n\nThis JL Partners survey included 383 likely Democratic primary voters for the 2028 presidential primaries, conducted from December 17 to 19, with a margin of error of 5 percent.\n\nAmong other Democrats, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led the pack with a net favorability of +46, followed by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker at +41, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz at +40, and California Governor Gavin Newsom at +37.\n\nFurther down the list, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker registered +23, former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke came in at +20, and Maryland Governor Wes Moore brought up the rear at +14.\n\nJL Partners’ poll this year also revealed a number of fascinating results about how Americans view the holiday season and other Christmastime traditions.\n\nAmericans’ favorite Christmas song this year was revealed to ‘It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,’ chosen by 26 percent of overall respondents, making it a rare point of agreement across party lines as 29 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of Democrats both selected it as their top choice.\n\nThe most irritating Christmas song was widely considered to be ‘Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,’ disliked by 35 percent of respondents, with Republicans and Democrats united in their annoyance.\n\nIn terms of traditions people are ready to leave behind, ugly Christmas sweaters led the way at 22 percent, followed by Elf on the Shelf at 15 percent and matching family pajamas at 14 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-running debate over whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie leans toward ‘no,’ with 47 percent disagreeing compared to 37 percent agreeing.\n\nMen were evenly split on the issue, while women more decisively rejected the idea by a 50 percent to 30 percent margin.\n\nThe current president was seen overall as the worst politician to sit next to at the holiday table, although Republicans, predictably instead name Biden as their least desirable seatmate.\n\nRepublicans said they would most like to sit next to Trump at Christmas dinner, while Democrats preferred Barack Obama and Kamala Harris.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThere&#8217;s one person in America who garners more affection from Democrats than&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Politician Gaining More Favor Among Democrats Than Santa Claus first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/the-politician-gaining-more-favor-among-democrats-than-santa-claus/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The-politician-Democrats-like-even-more-than-Santa-Claus.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 19:39:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.119},{"id":389075466,"title":"Holly Ramsay and Adam Peaty hold hands to join her family on a Christmas morning walk as his estranged mother and father step out alone two days before their big A-list wedding","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nBlake Lively\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nU.K. Showbiz\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Dec 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump launches 'powerful and deadly' strike on ISIS in Nigeria and warns of more if attacks persist\n\nTravis Kelce addresses retirement decision in emotional pregame interview ahead of potential last dance at Arrowhead\n\nInfluencer Estee Williams reveals her baby daughter is on life support after suffering terrifying cardiac arrest\n\nTaylor Swift spreads Christmas cheer as she supports fiance Travis Kelce and the Chiefs in their festive fixture\n\nThe ugly, unavoidable truth everyone must face after the alleged murder of Rob and Michele Reiner... by their son: KENNEDY\n\nMagic elves of Alaska REVEALED: As new photo emerges, indigenous filmmaker reveals truth of 4-foot tall beings... with superhuman strength\n\nBBQ chain shutters half its restaurants as it slumps into Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nTen US housing markets are crashing like the Great Recession -

Caroline wrapped up warm in a white duffle coat while Mark got some fresh air to walk their family dog.\nHolly and Adam are set to tie the knot at Bath Abbey on December 27 but Caroline won't be there. \nCaroline has been barred from the service following an increasingly toxic and inconveniently public row that began in November, when she was not invited to her soon-to-be daughter-in-law's hen party. \nIn the wake of the snub, public woes unravelled, with shock claims on each side about the fallout - including allegations that Holly and Adam made Caroline choose a different outfit for the wedding as they did not like her choice. \nIt's since been reported that tensions between the two families began during Holly and Adam's engagement party, which was filmed for Gordon's upcoming Netflix documentary.\nGordon was filmed over nine months as he opened five new restaurants in London, alongside juggling his personal life.\nThe engagement party, which took place last December, will see Holly and Adam with his family during happier times, before their toxic fallout occurred and he disinvited all but one of his relatives from the wedding.\nBut according to The Sun, the cracks were already starting to show at the time, with Caroline having several grievances at the party.\nA source told the publication: 'Adam's family were at the engagement party, when relations were much better.

She really fits in with the glam world – she's blonde and very pretty.'\nEarlier this week it was claimed that Adam and Holly have reportedly sparked outrage after banning the public from a historic church for their wedding day.\nAccording to a new report, the ceremony itself will last just 90 minutes, yet the couple have allegedly block-booked the abbey so no other weddings can take place. \nTourists are expected to be denied entry, with security stationed around the site to prevent onlookers from taking photos.\nWhile hiring the abbey for a wedding typically costs around £2,500, the pair are thought to be paying several thousand more to secure exclusive use of the venue.\nAnd a picture of a notice posted at the abbey states it is 'closed all day for a wedding' on December 27. \nThe decision has not gone down well with locals, with one resident telling the publication: 'It seems rather selfish to be hiring the abbey for the whole day when your wedding service only lasts for an hour and a half or so.'\nThe Daily Mail has contacted Adam and Holly's representatives for comment. \nThe toxic family feud currently overshadowing Holly's imminent wedding to Adam was brushed aside on Monday evening as they dined with friends out at her father's Mayfair restaurant.\nWith guests already arriving ahead of the ceremony, Ramsay dined out on prawns and caviar-coated sushi at Ramsay's Lucky Cat eatery, where a lavish meal from the 'chef's table' costs as much as £180 per person.\n\nAdam Peaty and Holly Ramsay open up about their relationship\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 1:25\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\nCaroline has been barred from the service following an increasingly toxic and inconveniently public row that began in November (Adam and Holly seen together)\n\nView gallery\n\nAdam and Caroline are seen together\n\nView gallery\n\nThey will marry at Bath Abbey on December 27 with the historic venue reportedly closed to the public for the day \nThe influencer was joined by Eve Winnington, the wife of Australian swimmer Elijah Winnington and a close friend of the couple.\nTaking to Instagram, Winnington shared a bathroom selfie with Ramsay alongside various images of her pre-wedding meal.\nThe bride-to-be appeared to favour a healthy £135 seafood platter on the night, with a selection of sushi, salted edamame and sweet and sour prawns adorning her table.\nPeaty stunned followers last month when it was revealed he had uninvited his relatives from his wedding, after his mother Caroline was not invited to Holly's swanky hen do.\nAdam PeatyHolly Ramsay\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHolly Ramsay and Adam Peaty hold hands to join her family on a Christmas morning walk as his estranged mother and father step out alone two days before their big A-list wedding\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHollywood's biggest Grinches: Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and more stars who HATE Christmas\n\nInfluencer Estee Williams reveals three-month-old daughter is on life support after suffering terrifying cardiac arrest: 'Please keep her in your prayers'\n\nBruce Willis' wife Emma Heming posts emotional essay on complications holidays bring amid Die Hard star's dementia battle\n\nLiev Schreiber goes shirtless on rare family vacation with bikini-clad wife and all three kids after mystery hospitalization\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly Ripa opens the door to her New York City luxury apartment to show off her Christmas decorations\n\nWhy we are crushing on retro!

Choose to be with someone who allows you to laugh at yourself and them.”\n\n As she continued, she emphasized the importance of being with someone you can enjoy all of life's moments with. “Choose to be with someone you like going to the grocery store together, taking a walk together, and doing something fancy together,” she continued.\n\n “There are different phases in your life,” Harris noted. “Depending on what phase you're in, maybe you're going to choose that you want to have that kind of Friday night relationship or you want that Sunday morning relationship,” she said through her own laughter, prompting Bizu to laugh alongside her. \n\n “Sometimes they go together and sometimes...,” Bizu interjected, before Harris added, “And sometimes you can get both, and sometimes it’s oil and water.”\n\n She acknowledged that the differences are still “okay.” She then added, “Be in those phases where you are having fun. Be in those phases where you have a sense of I just want something more.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Harris stressed the importance of people being “honest” with themselves and of figuring out whether the phase and relationship they’re in are what they “actually want.” She said, “But the first step is to be honest about what you’re in. And not try and make it something that it’s not because that usually doesn’t work out so well.”\n\n The advice comes amid Harris' 11-year marriage to her husband, Doug Emhoff. The couple met in 2013, when they were set up on a blind date by Harris' friend, Chrisette Hudlin. The couple tied the knot in August 2014 in Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\n However, Harris revealed in an interview with CBS News' Sunday Morning in January 2020 that the date wasn't technically blind — on her end — since she Googled her future husband before she met him.\n\n Harris recalled in her memoir, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey, that Emhoff, 61, was straightforward with her after their first date. \"The morning after our first date, Doug emailed me with a list of his available dates for the next couple of months,\" she wrote.\n\n The email read: \"I'm too old to play games or hide the ball. I really like you, and I want to see if we can make this work.\"\n\n In the years since their first date, they’ve shared how they prioritize their relationship, even as Harris served as vice president. According to Emhoff, the pair starts and ends their days together.\n\n \"We try to approach those moments as husband and wife, not vice president and second gentleman,” Emhoff told PEOPLE in November 2023. \"It’s really our time to be a couple ... time talking about kids, family and very little about the workings of our days.”","summary":"\"Choose to be with someone who allows you to laugh at yourself and them,\" the former vice president said on the 'Rich Little Brokegirls' podcast","url":"https://people.com/kamala-harris-shares-sweet-and-cheeky-dating-advice-11876194","image":"https://people.com/thmb/ctr-T95gSu4wj_p-5R6bjdMW9A0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kamala-Harris-122525-7681e163710c496295e8c13b4d525b5d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 18:37:57","author":"Charna Flam","authors":["Charna Flam"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.357},{"id":389019868,"title":"Gavin Newsom Mocks Trump, Kristi Noem and Kash Patel in Christmas Posts","text":"California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom released a series of Christmas memes on social media aimed at President Donald Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel. The posts, shared by Newsom’s press office on X, used satirical wish lists to mock them. Why It Matters Newsom has turned his social media channels into a platform for political counterattacks, leaning on memes, parody captions and capitalized slogans modeled after Trump’s online persona. The approach has drawn heightened attention from political strategists and appears to be paying off, with polls showing Newsom’s profile rising since early 2025. What To Know Each meme features a festive border and stylized “Dear Santa” list. The post targeting Trump includes the line, “More Crypto, Please! (I’ve only grifted an estimated $1.2 billion since becoming President!),” referencing recent reports on the president's fundraising and digital asset ventures. It is signed, “Love, Donald Trump.” The meme targeting Noem presents two “wishes”: “Another Rent-Free House for My Puppy!” and “Another Taxpayer-Funded Private Jet!” The “puppy” reference alludes to Noem’s admission in her memoir that she shot and killed her 14-month-old dog, while the private jet line refers to reports that she used a state-owned house without paying rent and traveled on flights funded by taxpayers. A third meme, attributed to Patel, reads, “Another Fleet of Tax-Payer Funded BMWs! (Gotta look sharp!),” referencing prior travel and expense claims. Each post was captioned with commentary from Newsom’s office, using all-caps and phrases like “Merry Griftmas” to mock the officials. The memes followed an earlier Christmas message from Newsom’s press office that used all caps and nicknames to mock Trump and several Republican officials, including Noem, Vice President JD Vance, Patel and House Speaker Mike Johnson. Styled like Trump’s social media posts, it included all-capped exaggerated insults and was signed “GCN,” mimicking Trump’s use of “DJT.” Newsom ended the year in a strong position, largely due to his direct and aggressive approach to Trump. While most Democrats limited their response to statements, the California governor challenged federal immigration raids in court, opposed diversity rollbacks and positioned himself as one of the party’s most outspoken critics of the president. He also secured one of the few legislative wins for Democrats: a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional map, aimed at helping the party flip up to five House seats in the midterms. What People Are Saying Newsom, at a news conference in August: “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.“ Mike Madrid, political strategist, to Newsweek: “Democrats are looking for a fighter. It’s not about ideology anymore. You can be centrist or progressive — what matters is that you stand up and hit back.“ Doug Gordon, Democratic strategist, to Newsweek: “His aggressive social media speaks to and energizes a small group of people who spend a lot of time online. But social media is not real life, and most voters will never see it.“ What Happens Next A December CNN poll showed Newsom leading among potential Democratic candidates mentioned by voters for the 2028 presidential race. Of the 14 percent who named a Democrat, 6 percent chose Newsom, ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris at 3 percent and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 2 percent.","summary":"The California governor mocked Trump and some of his allies with Christmas postcard memes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-mocks-trump-kristi-noem-and-kash-patel-in-christmas-posts-11270326","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2245710484.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 18:03:33","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":389032440,"title":"Katie Couric rejects 'bothsidesism' in news coverage, says people don't want 'just the facts'","text":"Katie Couric spoke out against \"bothsidesism\" in news coverage and insisted people don't want \"just the facts\" in the current media environment.

With more than 10 months to go before Election Day, primary season is already in full swing, and several gubernatorial races across the country have been marked by unpredictability and drawn significant attention.\n\nIncumbent Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won reelection by nearly 20 percentage points in 2022, is term limited and cannot run for a third consecutive time — paving the way for a contested GOP primary to succeed him.\n\nLong-regarded as a hotly-contested swing state, Florida is now a Republican stronghold that Trump carried by 13 points in 2024. Therefore, it is widely believed that the candidate that emerges as the party’s nominee for the governor’s mansion following the Aug. 18, 2026 primary will win the November general election. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the Sunshine State’s contest as “Solid R.”\n\nTrump had endorsed Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds for governor in February — five days before Donalds entered the race — cementing the 47-year-old congressman as the race’s early odds-on frontrunner. In addition to the president, Donalds also has received the support of Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott, a handful of his congressional colleagues, multiple members of Trump’s cabinet and billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nDeSantis, however, has yet to make an endorsement and may still back another GOP primary candidate. An anonymous source familiar with Florida politics told the Daily Caller in November that the state’s sitting governor is “point-blank trashing” Donalds to donors. Donalds, along with the vast majority of Florida’s congressional Republicans, notably endorsed Trump over DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. (RELATED: Trump, DeSantis Could Be Destined For Head-To-Head Rematch In Key GOP Primary)\n\nRepublican Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, a key DeSantis ally whom the governor appointed to the state’s No. 2 job in August, has signaled that he is open to entering the gubernatorial race but has also yet to either declare his candidacy or decline to run.\n\nEarly in 2025, observers speculated that DeSantis’ wife Casey DeSantis may run to succeed her husband, but such talk has subsided. Mrs. DeSantis has yet to state her intention either way.\n\nDonalds’ only current primary challenger to have held electoral office is former Florida state House Speaker Paul Renner, a self-styled “pro-Trump, pro-DeSantis Republican.” Despite this, DeSantis has come out in vocal opposition to Renner’s longshot campaign, calling his former legislative ally’s decision to run “ill-advised.”\n\nAlso in the GOP primary race is James Fishback, the 30-year-old CEO of investment firm Azoria Partners and a vocal critic of H-1B visas, who is campaigning to Donalds’ right. Fishback in February came under scrutiny after proposing the viral idea that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) send $5,000 dividend checks to households using money saved by the initiative.\n\nStopping short of entering the race, Collins in a Nov. 20 X post took a dig at Donalds writing, “In my first 100 days as Lieutenant Governor, I’ve already outperformed the guy in Congress still trying to convince people he’s ready to lead Florida.”\n\n In my first 100 days as Lieutenant Governor, I’ve already outperformed the guy in Congress still trying to convince people he’s ready to lead Florida. https://t.co/XBkMwV1hT3 — Jay Collins (@JayCollinsFL) November 20, 2025 \n\nIn response to a user asking him to say Donalds’ name, the lieutenant governor replied “H1-Byron,” appearing to repeat a line of attack also used by Fishback to paint the Trump-endorsed candidate as too lenient on the issue of immigration.\n\nDemocratic candidates vying to succeed DeSantis include former Republican Florida Rep. David Jolly — a former MSNBC contributor widely associated with the “Never Trump” movement — and Jerry Demings, deep-blue Orange County’s mayor and former sheriff. The Democratic Party has not won Florida’s governor’s mansion since 1994.\n\nSimilar to Florida, Ohio is a former swing state that is now firmly in the Republican column, with Trump carrying it by double digits in 2024. The Buckeye and Sunshine states are also similar in that Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, like DeSantis, is term-limited and cannot seek reelection.\n\nHowever, unlike Donalds, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, the Trump-endorsed candidate seems to have cleared the GOP field, with the Ohio Republican Party opting in May to endorse him. Ramaswamy, who ran against Trump and DeSantis in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, has also received the endorsements of Musk, Vice President JD Vance — a native Ohioan — and both of Ohio’s senators. (RELATED: Six Primaries That May Determine The Future Of The GOP After Trump)\n\nTrump originally announced that Ramaswamy would work with Musk to jointly run DOGE, but as the president began his second term, Ramaswamy instead pivoted to running for governor and never ended up joining the initiative.\n\nThe businessman currently is the only well-known GOP candidate running for Ohio governor. Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost have both in the first half of 2025 dropped out of the GOP gubernatorial primary with the former endorsing Ramaswamy.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton seems poised to win the nomination as Democratic Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan passed on a run and Sherrod Brown announced a bid to return to the upper chamber instead. Acton notably presided over the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 — which many critics have slammed as too heavy-handed.\n\nWhen asked by Daily Caller Senior Editor Amber Duke if she had regretted closing Ohio’s schools in the name of COVID, Acton replied, “No, actually, what we were following was the pandemic playbook.”\n\nRamaswamy has himself hammered Acton on the issue, writing in a June post to X, “Dr. Amy Acton, the Chief Lockdown Officer of Ohio, led us to be the *first state in the nation* to close our public schools, while private schools remained open. … Acton owes our public school students an apology & shouldn’t come anywhere near the levers of power again.”\n\n Dr. Amy Acton, the Chief Lockdown Officer of Ohio, led us to be the *first state in the nation* to close our public schools, while private schools remained open. Shockingly, 5 years later, she still views “sweeping school closures as utterly necessary” (direct quote from this… https://t.co/XbNsXAv442 — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) June 28, 2025 \n\nHowever, recent polling shows that despite Ohio’s strong Republican lean, a Democratic upset in what many are saying is shaping up to be a “blue wave” year may just be on the horizon. A December 2025 Emerson College poll found Acton with a one point lead over Ramaswamy, with 46% of support to his 45%. Emerson College’s poll from four months earlier showed Ramaswamy with a 10-point lead over the Democrat, 49% to 39%.\n\nCook Political report rates the race as “Likely R.”\n\nAs term-limited Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom likely gears up to mount his highly-anticipated 2028 presidential run, the state has the potential to elect a Republican to succeed him in 2026.\n\nAlthough California is a heavily Democratic state, its top-two primary could conceivably result in an all-Republican general election matchup if a crowded Democratic field splits the vote, allowing top GOP candidates — Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton — to finish first and second. (RELATED: Can California’s Unusual Voting System Actually Allow It To Elect A Republican Governor?)\n\nNo clear Democratic frontrunner has emerged, with just six months before voters cast their ballots in the June 2, 2026 all-party primary. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s failed 2024 presidential nominee, announced in late July that she would not seek the California governorship two years after losing the race for the White House — something Richard Nixon tried and failed to do in 1962.\n\nA handful of well-known Democrats remain in the race to take up Newsom’s mantle including, most notably, former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter — who made headlines for appearing to abuse her staff and for allegedly dumping scalding hot mashed potatoes on her then-husband’s head — and Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell — a prominent Trump foe who announced his candidacy on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in late November.\n\nSwalwell was absent for more House votes than any one of his current colleagues, according to data analyzed by the New York Post. The Trump administration in November referred the congressman to the Department of Justice for alleged mortgage fraud.\n\nOther Democrats vying to replace Newsom include former Biden-era Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer, to name a few.\n\nWhile multiple recent polls show the possibility of a fiercely split Democratic primary field locking the party out of the general election, Cook Political Report still rates the race “Solid D.”\n\nBianco told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a December interview that the lack of a Democratic frontrunner shows that the party is in “shambles” and has “no leadership.”\n\n“If you look back in history, there’s always a secession plan. There’s always someone else in line. That’s how Newsom got in there,” Bianco added. “But the problem for them [Democrats] now is Newsom is the biggest narcissist, probably, in the world and, in his eyes, there is no one capable of filling his shoes.”\n\nMeanwhile, California’s neighbor Arizona, the adopted home state of slain Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, presents the Republicans’ best chance to unseat an incumbent Democratic governor.\n\nDemocratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is seeking a second term in office after defeating her Republican opponent by only 17,000 votes in 2022. Hobbs has faced numerous controversies while in office, including a “play-to-pay” campaign finance scandal and her reported lack of transparency about her legal donations.\n\nIn addition, the vulnerable governor had a dismal 39% approval rating, compared to a 40% disapproval, according to an Emerson College poll released in mid-November.\n\nHobbs will take on the winner of what is now a three-way Republican primary, scheduled for Aug. 4, 2026. Cook Political report rates Arizona’s gubernatorial race a “Toss Up.” (RELATED: Unpopular Democrat Gov. Katie Hobbs In Serious Reelection Trouble, Poll Shows)\n\nThe three Republicans currently vying for the GOP nomination to take on Hobbs in the general election are Republican Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robson and Republican Arizona Rep. David Schweikert. Trump has co-endorsed Biggs and Robson while Kirk had solely endorsed Biggs prior to his Sept. 10 assassination. Schweikert entered the race months after both of the other two candidates.\n\nEmerson College’s mid-November poll showed Hobbs trailing the two Trump-endorsed candidates by one point each and Schweikert by four points. Biggs had a massive lead over both of his primary opponents with 50% of support compared to Robson’s 17% and Schweikert’s 8%, according to the same poll.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Caller’s Ashley Brasfield at TPUSA’s AmericaFest in December, Biggs said that he is “acting like I’m the only one that has [Trump’s] endorsement,” highlighting his close relationship with the president.\n\n .@BrasfieldAshley: Trump has endorsed you and another candidate in the race, do you think that the president will just endorse you in the primary eventually?@andybiggs4az: “I don’t know… but I’m also acting like I’m the only one that has the endorsement. Here’s why- Trump and… pic.twitter.com/k50VTfX12j — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) December 23, 2025 \n\n“Trump and I go back to the first election … he knows I’ve been in the foxholes,” Biggs, who’s been in Congress since 2017, told Brasfield. “I’ve gone through two impeachments with him and about five investigations where I was one of the lead defense counsels, so to speak, for him on all of those. And he knows that. And even know he’ll call me and we’ll talk and we have that relationship ongoing.”\n\n“You can say anybody’s endorsed by you but if you don’t have a relationship with him, it doesn’t really matter,” the GOP frontrunner added.\n\nFinally, Michigan proves another prime chance for Republicans to flip a governor’s mansion from blue to red — but this time because of a left-leaning independent candidate who might play spoiler.\n\nDemocratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, like Newsom, is both a rumored potential 2028 White House candidate and barred from running for a third term due to term limits. Cook Political report rates the race to succeed Whitmer as a “Toss Up.”\n\nThe open Democratic primary to succeed the incumbent governor features three main candidates, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson. Whitmer has stated she has no plans to endorse any candidate in the primary.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Michigan Rep. John James is the heavy frontrunner to capture the GOP nomination, with his most prominent intraparty rival being former Republican Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox.\n\nTrump has yet to endorse a candidate in the GOP primary, but has previously endorsed James during his successful runs for the House as well as his unsuccessful runs for U.S. Senate in both 2018 and 2020.\n\nHowever, the presence of independent Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan — a former lifelong Democrat who left the party in 2024 — on the ballot may swing the race in James’ favor.\n\nA Plymouth Union Public Research poll released in mid-October showed James in the lead with 35% of support among likely voters, compared to 31% of support for a generic Democrat and 12% for Duggan. Similarly, an EPIC-MRA poll released in early November showed 34% of support for James, 33% for Benson and 20% for Duggan.\n\nDuggan blasted his former party in October, telling Politico, “Everything the Democrats have to say is terrible about Republicans.”\n\n“I am waiting for the Democratic Party to step forward and say, ‘Here’s our affordable housing proposal. Here’s our mental health treatment proposal,'” the independent gubernatorial candidate added at the time. “It’s just been so frustrating to watch the Democratic Party lose its way.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Zilch. Nada. Not even the hint of a merry moan.\n\nAnd I'll admit, as a Christmas singleton, I'm feeling horrendously smug about the whole thing.\n\nYou'd think all that enforced togetherness over the holidays would lead to more sex, not less. No work, no deadlines, the children distracted with new gifts.\n\nAnd yet, for many couples, December is the least sexy month of the year.\n\nWhy? Well, Christmas delivers a perfect storm of libido killers.\n\nAnd, dear reader, availability is not the same thing as arousal.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nFirst, there's the stress of Christmas itself.\n\nThe hosting. The cooking. The cleaning. The present buying. The playing peacekeeper between feuding family members. The strategically not seating your Trump-supporting uncle next to your niece who loudly and proudly voted for Kamala Harris. The negotiating which divorced parent gets Christmas lunch and who's stuck with the post food-coma dinner. Add in the long car trips with kids fighting in the back seat and - by the end of it all - most couples want sleep, not sex.\n\nThen there are the more… shall we say, mechanical blockades.\n\nA stomach full of Christmas roast doesn't exactly inspire a round of bedroom gymnastics.\n\nHeavy meals bring bloating and bodies that feel sluggish and anything but seductive. Pile on top poor sleep, and a calendar packed back-to-back with boozy celebration, and suddenly nobody's feeling particularly frisky.\n\nAlcohol, while festive, is a notorious saboteur.\n\nA drink or two might relax you. Nightly overindulgence, however, does men absolutely no favors in the performance department and leaves women exhausted and foggy.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest libido killer of all is the emotional pressure.\n\nChristmas is fabled as romantic. Magical. A time to reconnect, bond and 'make the most of it.'\n\nAs a result, December sex starts to feel a lot like birthday sex. The build-up is enormous. The expectations sky-high. The reality rarely lives up to the hype.\n\nWhen sex becomes something you feel you should be doing, rather than something you genuinely want, it becomes performative.\n\nYou start monitoring when and whether it happens, worrying about why it hasn't, and quietly judging what it all 'means' for your relationship.\n\nAnd so begins the spiral. Oh yes, I know it well.\n\nMeanwhile, you're together constantly. Sat side by side on the couch, scrolling separate phones - before falling into bed late, full, tipsy, overstimulated and vaguely resentful.\n\nIt's not that the attraction has disappeared. There's just no space for it to breathe.\n\nBut here's the good news: January tells the truth.\n\nWelcome to what I like to call the 'holiday horny hangover.'\n\nOnce the decorations come down and normal life resumes, one of two things happens.\n\nFor many couples, desire roars back. The pressure lifts. Routines resume - and so does the intimacy. (Who would have thought routine can be sexy?) Once you stop forcing it, you realize the December drought wasn't a dead bedroom. It was exhaustion.\n\nBut it's not a New Year bonk-a-thon for everyone, I'm afraid.\n\nFor some, January brings sobering realization.\n\nIt wasn't just the lack of sex over Christmas; it was the relationship itself.\n\nExtended time together exposed cracks that had been papered over with busy schedules and separate lives.\n\nIt's no coincidence that January is peak breakup season. Ask any divorce attorney and they'll tell you the same thing. Their phones light up in the first week of the year.\n\nSo how do you stop your sex life being as dry as the turkey?\n\nI'm glad you asked.\n\nFirst, lower the bar. Dramatically.\n\nSex doesn't need lingerie and soft lighting. A deep kiss, a cuddle or lying naked together absolutely counts. Connection comes first.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the much-maligned quickie.\n\nIt's often dismissed as lazy or unromantic, but one of my married friends swears it's what saved her marriage. After her second child, she realized her sex life had gone AWOL. \n\nSo, she and her hubby made it a fun little game to see when and where they could get away with a quickie. Inside while the kids were outside playing. In the shed, when the kids were perched in front of the TV. In the car, when they 'ducked out to pick up groceries.'\n\nSoon enough, these sneaky sessions became something they actively looked forward to.\n\nFull disclosure: I find a quickie ridiculously hot.\n\nMaybe it's the naughtiness. Maybe it's the spontaneity. Probably both.\n\nChanging up the setting of sex also works wonders. A hotel night, a different room, anywhere but the bedroom. New environment, new energy.\n\nAnd who decided sex had to be a nighttime activity?\n\nDaytime intimacy beats late-night exhaustion every time. Studies even suggest morning sex boosts mood for the rest of the day - and I, for one, know what I'd pick over my morning coffee.\n\nThen there's the underrated art of touching without expectation. Massage. Hair stroking. Holding hands.\n\nWhen sex isn't the goal, it often happens naturally.\n\nNow, this next one doesn't sound as fun, but the payoff is worth it: Ease up on the booze.\n\nOne drink can help. Five will scuttle the ship. Gents, I'm looking directly at you.\n\nAnd finally, don't panic if December is quiet.\n\nA dry spell over the holidays doesn't mean your relationship is broken. It might just be bloated, stressed and slightly hungover.\n\nBut if the thought of January together fills you with dread rather than relief, that's information worth listening to. Add another month of no sex, and it may be time to ask the bigger questions.","summary":"Behind all the tinsel and turkey, a surprising number of couples are getting absolutely zero action between the sheets.

The president is now 79. When he made his comeback to the White House in January he became the oldest person to be inaugurated president. Why It Matters Joe Rogan has a massive influence on hundreds of thousands of American voters, especially young men. The comedian boasts 20.6 million subscribers on his YouTube channels, and his podcast ranks number one among the most popular on Spotify. According to last year’s data, a majority of the show’s audience (56 percent) were young adults aged 18 to 34, and 80 percent were men—the same demographics that voted for Trump last year, when Rogan invited him on the show. According to the Center for American Women and Politics, 55 percent of men voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election, while 43 percent voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Joe Rogan on June 7, 2025, in Newark, New Jersey. While his audience is politically diverse, with 32 percent of listeners identifying as Republicans and 27 percent as Democrats, 54 percent of weekly listeners leaned toward Trump in last year’s presidential election in a late October poll cited by EMarketer; only 26 percent favored Harris. Rogan also invited Harris to be a guest on his show in the lead-up to the election last year, but then refused her conditions of a one-hour sit-down interview, whereas he wanted a three-hour long one. What To Know On the eve of the 2024 presidential election, Rogan threw his support behind Trump, saying that he was convinced to do so in one of his interviews with billionaire Elon Musk, then a close Trump ally. Trump swiftly played the endorsement as a win, and much was said about the weight that Rogan’s backing would have had on his listeners, especially young men. At the time, Trump said the podcaster’s support was “great” news. But like the Tesla CEO, Rogan proved to be a bit of a flimsy friend for the president, repeatedly criticizing him and his actions since the beginning of the year. One of the sticking points has been Trump’s aggressive anti-immigration crackdown and his mass deportations in the U.S.—including some who had no criminal records in the country. “I did not ever anticipate seeing that on TV on a regular basis,” Rogan said in a podcast episode in October talking about footage of immigration enforcement officers “ripping parents out of their communities.” “I really thought they were just going to go after the criminals,” he said. “If you have been here for 25 years, you have a family, your kids go to school here, you speak the language…you’re just illegal, but you’re a contributing member to the community that up until now has been protected,” he added. “This is crazy.” He also criticized the Trump administration for Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension earlier this year from ABC after comments on the shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, and what he called restrictions on freedom of speech in universities. In his December 23 podcast episode, Rogan attacked Trump for his decision to update all the plaques in the Presidential Walk of Fame with highly subjective new ones. Framed portraits of President Donald Trump flank an image of former U.S. President Joe Biden's signature and an autopen along The Presidential Walk of Fame at the White House on September 25, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Biden is currently the only president who does not have a portrait, having a photo of an autopen signature instead—a reference to Trump’s frequent allegation that the former president was not fit for office by the end of his term. “There’s nothing nuttier than the plaques under the presidents’ names…How is this real? How are you allowed to do that?” Rogan said. “The autopen photo of Joe Biden? Crazy,” he added. Rogan said that clearly every president was allowed to do that, but had not used this authority before. What People Are Saying Activist and author Amy Siskind commented on the podcast episode, writing on X: “When you’ve lost the Joe Rogan show.” Journalist Gretchen Carlson wrote on X, commenting on the conversation between Rogan and Segura: “Uh, you guys made it real!” The Daily Beast wrote on X: “Joe Rogan has come to terms with the fact that the man he endorsed for president in 2024 is not all there one year later.” Tom Segura said in the December 23 podcast: “This presidency, though, does feel like a parody of a real thing. Like, it doesn’t even feel real.” Joe Rogan responded: “There’s a lot of stuff that doesn’t feel real.” What Happens Next The new bronze plaques Trump installed in the White House’s Presidential Walk of Fame are likely to remain until the end of his second mandate. In the December 23 episode, Rogan suggested they should stay as a museum. “It should be the facts of his presidency; what happened during his term,” he said. “They should have the Trump wing. This is what happened when he was president.”","summary":"Rogan described Trump&#039;s decision to install new, very subjective plaques in the Presidential Walk of Fame as “nuts.&quot;","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-rogan-trashes-donald-trump-11269970","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2219529296.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 17:21:36","author":"Giulia Carbonaro","authors":["Giulia Carbonaro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":389032266,"title":"Trump Posts Tribute to ‘Home Alone 2’ Casting Biden and Harris as Villains","text":"On Christmas Day, the Team Trump Instagram account shared a social media post depicting President Donald Trump as Kevin McCallister from the 1992 film Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, in a holiday-themed tribute to his cameo in the movie.

Police initially described the death as 'unexplained, but not suspicious,' before it was later attributed to heart failure and a fatty liver. The news sent shockwaves through the music world, turning a day of celebration into one of global mourning.\nIn the years that followed, Michael's younger sister Melanie Panayiotou sought to keep his memory alive by penning a heartfelt message every Christmas — a quiet ritual that became her way of marking the day that had taken her brother. The tradition took on an even deeper poignancy when tragedy struck again.\nMelanie died aged 59, three years to the day after George's passing. According to reports, she was found at her £6.2 million Hampstead home — a property previously owned by her brother — on Christmas Day. A post-mortem later certified her cause of death as complications linked to diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious condition associated with diabetes.\nSources said Melanie had become increasingly reclusive in the years after George's death, struggling with grief that compounded earlier heartbreaks, including the loss of their mother, Lesley, in 1997. Once a vibrant presence who travelled the world with her famous brother and immersed herself in London's nightlife scene in the early 1990s, she was said to be deeply changed by the cumulative losses in her life.\nFollowing Melanie's death, their sister Yioda took over the Christmas tradition, continuing to honor George's memory, and Melanie's too, on a day forever marked by love, loss and remembrance.\n\nView gallery\n\nGeorge Michael's death on Christmas Day 2016 forever changed the meaning of the holiday for his loved ones and for millions of fans around the world; seen in 1985\nCharlie Chaplin \nCharlie Chaplin, the silent-screen genius who made the world laugh through tears, died on Christmas Day, forever linking his passing to a date meant for joy.\nThe iconic actor, filmmaker and composer was 88 when he died peacefully in his sleep on December 25, 1977, at his home in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, following a stroke. \nSnow dusted the banks of Lake Geneva as one of cinema's most influential figures slipped away quietly, far from the country that had once made him a star.\nChaplin had settled in Switzerland decades earlier after a bitter rupture with the United States.\nIn 1952, while traveling abroad, he learned that his U.S. reentry visa had been revoked amid accusations of Communist sympathies. \nFurious and humiliated, Chaplin vowed never to return. He rebuilt his life in Europe, where he lived out his final years in relative peace - and where he died on Christmas morning.\nBut even death did not bring him rest.\nTwo months later, a cemetery worker made a shocking discovery: Chaplin's grave had been disturbed, his coffin stolen under cover of darkness. \nIn a grotesque twist that stunned the world, grave robbers demanded a ransom of 600,000 Swiss francs from his widow, Oona Chaplin, threatening harm to the couple's children if she refused to comply.\nAfter months of investigation, police traced the calls to local phone booths and arrested two men - Roman Wardas, a 24-year-old Polish immigrant, and Gantscho Ganev, a 38-year-old Bulgarian national.\nChaplin's coffin was eventually recovered from a farmer's field some 14 miles away and reburied, this time reinforced with concrete to prevent further desecration. \n\nView gallery\n\nCharlie Chaplin, the silent-screen genius who made the world laugh through tears, died on Christmas Day, forever linking his passing to a date meant for joy\nCarrie Fisher \nCarrie Fisher died just days after Christmas, a loss that rippled through Hollywood and shattered a family already waiting to be reunited for the holidays.\nThe beloved actress and writer was 60 when she passed away on December 27, 2016, four days after suffering a cardiac emergency while flying home from London to Los Angeles. \nHer cause of death was determined by the Los Angeles County coroner to be sleep apnea and other undetermined factors. \nFisher had been returning to celebrate Christmas with her family when she went into cardiac arrest aboard the plane shortly before it landed at LAX.\nPassengers rushed to help, administering CPR as the aircraft descended. She received emergency treatment upon landing and was rushed to UCLA Medical Center, where she was admitted in critical condition.\nFisher never regained consciousness.\nHer death was confirmed in a statement released on behalf of her family by spokesperson Simon Halls, who shared words from Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd.\n'She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly,' the statement read, adding that the family was grateful for the outpouring of support during their grief.\nIn the hours after her death, Fisher's mother paid tribute to her daughter in a message filled with quiet heartbreak, thanking fans for embracing Carrie's gifts and talents and expressing gratitude for the love guiding her 'to her next stop.'\n\nStar Wars actress Carrie Fisher dies aged 60\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:47\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\nCarrie Fisher died just days after Christmas, a loss that rippled through Hollywood and shattered a family already waiting to be reunited for the holidays; seen in 1977\nDebbie Reynolds \nDebbie Reynolds' death came with a cruel symmetry that stunned Hollywood - arriving just one day after the loss of her beloved daughter, Carrie Fisher, as the year drew to a close.\nThe legendary actress, whose infectious smile and boundless energy lit up the golden age of Hollywood, was 84 when she died on December 28, 2016, after suffering a stroke. \nReynolds had been rushed to a Los Angeles hospital hours earlier, her son Todd Fisher later confirming her death.\nFor decades, Reynolds sang and danced her way into the hearts of moviegoers, becoming an enduring symbol of joy and resilience on screen. \nShe rose to stardom at just 19 years old after landing the role of Kathy Selden in Singin' in the Rain, a performance that would cement her place in cinema history. \nOver the years, she starred alongside legends including Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Tony Curtis, Donald O'Connor, Fred Astaire and Dick Van Dyke, carving out a career defined by warmth, wit and extraordinary talent.\nBut it was motherhood that Reynolds often described as her greatest role, and the loss of Fisher proved unbearable. \nHer death came less than 24 hours after Fisher's, turning what was meant to be a family Christmas into one of Hollywood's most devastating holiday tragedies.\n\nDebbie Reynolds dies a day after her daughter Carrie Fisher\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 1:07\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nView gallery\n\nDebbie Reynolds' death came with a cruel symmetry that stunned Hollywood - arriving just one day after the loss of her beloved daughter, Carrie Fisher, as the year drew to a close; seen in 1955\nCarlos Marín \nCarlos Marín's death in the final days of the year marked a sobering reminder of the toll the pandemic took on the music world.\nThe Il Divo star was just 53 when he died in December 2021 after a battle with coronavirus, passing away in hospital in Manchester.\n Marín fell ill on December 7 and tested positive for Covid shortly afterward before being admitted to Manchester Royal Infirmary, where his condition rapidly deteriorated.\nHe was later placed into a medically induced coma and connected to breathing machines in intensive care.\nReports at the time said the singer had been vaccinated, though few details were made public as concern for his condition grew among fans across the globe.\nMarín's death was confirmed by his devastated bandmates, who shared tributes mourning not only the loss of a colleague, but a brother. \n'There will never be another voice or spirit like Carlos,' they wrote, praising his kindness, warmth and unmistakable talent.\nFor 17 years, Marín had been one quarter of Il Divo, traveling the world alongside his bandmates and lending his powerful baritone to millions of records sold and countless live performances. \n\nView gallery\n\nCarlos Marín was just 53 when he died in December 2021 after a battle with coronavirus, passing away in hospital in Manchester; seen in 2006\nNatalie Cole \nNatalie Cole's voice carried generations, but her life quietly slipped away as one year ended and another was about to begin.\nThe Grammy-winning singer died from congestive heart failure on New Year's Eve in Los Angeles, passing away at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with her son, Robert Yancy, by her side.

Hawthorne was best known for his razor-sharp portrayal of Sir Humphrey Appleby in Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister, performances that made him a household name and a defining figure in British television.\nHe later earned international acclaim for his turn as King George III in The Madness of King George, a role that brought him an Academy Award nomination and showcased his extraordinary ability to blend vulnerability with authority.\nHawthorne's passing marked the loss of a performer whose wit, intelligence and precision left an indelible mark — a quiet goodbye during a season already heavy with reflection. \n\nView gallery\n\nSir Nigel Hawthorne died on December 26, 2001, while undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer; seen in 1979\nGerry Anderson\nGerry Anderson's imagination shaped childhoods, and his passing came quietly in the reflective days after Christmas.\nThe legendary television producer and creator, best known for Thunderbirds, died peacefully in his sleep on December 26, 2012, at the age of 83. \nHis death followed several years living with mixed dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, a diagnosis that had been made public earlier that year.\nThe news was announced by his son, Jamie Anderson, who described his father's final moments as calm and dignified. \nTributes quickly poured in from across television, radio and the arts, reflecting the profound emotional connection audiences had formed with Anderson's work.\nActors who helped bring Thunderbirds to life spoke openly of their grief, describing his creations as 'a big part of people's lives.' \nBroadcasters, comedians and performers echoed the sentiment, with many noting that Anderson's worlds had made childhood 'an incredible place to be.'\n\nView gallery\n\nGerry Anderson, best known for Thunderbirds, died peacefully in his sleep on December 26, 2012, at the age of 83 (seen in 2004)\nVincent Schiavelli\nVincent Schiavelli's unmistakable presence brought depth, humanity and quiet sadness to the screen.\nThe beloved character actor died in late December 2005 at the age of 57 after a battle with lung cancer. \nHe passed away at his home in Polizzi Generosa, a small Sicilian town near Palermo that held deep personal meaning for him and was the birthplace of his grandfather.\nSchiavelli was laid to rest in the local cemetery, returning in death to the place that had inspired his later years. He had written lovingly about the town in his 2002 book Many Beautiful Things, weaving together stories, food and memory in a way that mirrored his thoughtful approach to acting.\nKnown for his distinctive features and soulful performances, Schiavelli appeared in dozens of films and television series, often stealing scenes with quiet intensity. His death came as the year drew to a close — a soft but deeply felt goodbye to an actor whose work lingered long after the screen faded to black.\n\nView gallery\n\nVincent Schiavelli died in late December 2005 at the age of 57 after a battle with lung cancer; pictured in 2003\n\nSue Lyon's life was forever shaped by a role she took on as a child — and her death arrived in the stillness of Boxing Day.\nThe actress, who became internationally famous at just 14 for playing the title role in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, died in December 2019 at the age of 73. Her performance in the controversial 1962 film earned her a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer and instantly placed her at the center of Hollywood attention.\nThough she went on to star opposite Richard Burton in The Night of the Iguana, Lyon's career never again reached the same heights. Her personal life, marked by five marriages and public scrutiny, often overshadowed her work. One relationship in particular, she later said, had a lasting impact on her professional opportunities.\nLyon died in Los Angeles on Boxing Day, leaving behind her daughter, Nona. Her passing prompted renewed reflection on the complicated legacy of a child star whose talent was undeniable, but whose life unfolded under pressures few could have navigated unscathed.\n\nView gallery\n\nSue Lyon, who became internationally famous at just 14 for playing the title role in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, died in December 2019 at the age of 73; seen in 1963\nWilliam Demarest\nWilliam Demarest's death came quietly in the reflective days after Christmas, closing the book on one of Hollywood's most enduring character actors.\nDemarest died on December 28, 1983, at the age of 91, following complications from pneumonia and cancer. Though rarely cast as the leading man, his gruff voice, sharp timing and unmistakable presence made him a familiar face across decades of American film and television.\nHe appeared in more than 100 movies and countless TV roles, working with legendary directors like Preston Sturges and later finding a new generation of fans as Uncle Charley on My Three Sons. By the time of his death, Demarest had become a living bridge between Hollywood's golden age and the television era that followed.\nHis passing during the final week of the year felt fittingly understated — a gentle exit for an actor whose greatness lived in the margins, the moments and the memories he left behind.\n\nView gallery\n\nWilliam Demarest died on December 28, 1983, at the age of 91, following complications from pneumonia and cancer; seen in 1967\nViolet Carson\nFor millions of viewers, Violet Carson was a constant, and her death came just after Christmas, marking the end of an era in British television.\nCarson died on December 26, 1983, at the age of 85. She was best known for her iconic portrayal of Ena Sharples on Coronation Street, a role she played for two decades and one that made her one of the most recognizable faces in the UK.\nWith her hairnet, shopping bag and unflinching moral authority, Carson's Ena became a symbol of post-war British life — sharp-tongued, deeply principled and impossible to ignore. She helped shape the tone of the long-running soap, proving that television characters could feel as real and permanent as neighbors.\nHer death in the quiet days after Christmas was mourned not just as the loss of an actress, but as the farewell to a character who had lived in British living rooms for a generation.\n\nView gallery\n\nViolet Carson was a constant, and her death came just after Christmas, marking the end of an era in British television (pictured in 1925)\nEarl Hindman\nEarl Hindman died on December 29, 2003, at the age of 61, after a battle with lung cancer. \nHindman was forever associated with his role as Wilson on Home Improvement as the wise, off-screen neighbor.\nBefore becoming one of television's most beloved running jokes, Hindman built a respected career on stage and screen, earning an Emmy for Ryan's Hope and appearing in films such as The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.\n\nView gallery\n\nEarl Hindman died on December 29, 2003, at the age of 61, after a battle with lung cancer; seen in 1999\nCarrie FisherLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFrom George Michael to Carrie Fisher: The stars who tragically died between Christmas and New Year\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHollywood's biggest Grinches: Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and more stars who HATE Christmas\n\nInfluencer Estee Williams reveals three-month-old daughter is on life support after suffering terrifying cardiac arrest: 'Please keep her in your prayers'\n\nBruce Willis' wife Emma Heming posts emotional essay on complications holidays bring amid Die Hard star's dementia battle\n\nLiev Schreiber goes shirtless on rare family vacation with bikini-clad wife and all three kids after mystery hospitalization\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly Ripa opens the door to her New York City luxury apartment to show off her Christmas decorations\n\nWhy we are crushing on retro!

The margin of error was 5 percent.\n\nAmong other Democrats, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led the pack with a net favorability of +46, followed by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker at +41, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz at +40, and California Governor Gavin Newsom at +37.\n\nFurther down the list, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker registered +23, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke came in at +20, and Maryland Governor Wes Moore brought up the rear at +14.\n\nJL Partners' poll this year also revealed a number of fascinating results about how Americans view the holiday season and other Christmastime traditions.\n\nAmericans' favorite Christmas song this year was revealed to 'It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,' chosen by 26 percent of overall respondents, making it a rare point of agreement across party lines as 29 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of Democrats both selected it as their top choice.\n\nThe most irritating Christmas song was widely considered to be 'Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,' disliked by 35 percent of respondents, with Republicans and Democrats united in their annoyance.\n\nIn terms of traditions people are ready to leave behind, ugly Christmas sweaters led the way at 22 percent, followed by Elf on the Shelf at 15 percent and matching family pajamas at 14 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-running debate over whether Die Hard is a Christmas movie leans toward 'no,' with 47 percent disagreeing compared to 37 percent agreeing.\n\nMen were evenly split on the issue, while women more decisively rejected the idea by a 50 percent to 30 percent margin.\n\nThe current president was seen overall as the worst politician to sit next to at the holiday table, although Republicans, predictably instead name Biden as their least desirable seatmate.\n\nRepublicans said they would most like to sit next to Trump at Christmas dinner, while Democrats preferred Barack Obama and Kamala Harris.","summary":"There's just one figure in the country Democrats like more Santa Claus - and he too speaks often of bearing gifts.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15411727/The-politician-Democrats-like-Santa-Claus.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/24/23/105008555-0-image-a-6_1766620608740.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 15:28:43","author":"Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":388974826,"title":"\"Nicki you're winning\" - Tokyo Toni defends Nicki Minaj amid the rapper facing backlash over her support for Trump ","text":"Tokyo Toni has defended Nicki Minaj after the rapper faced major backlash over the last few weeks for her vocal support for Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. In a TikTok shared on December 24, Tokyo Toni openly supported Nicki Minaj and her support for Trump and the Republicans. Toni spoke in the context of seeing an image titled \"Nicki Trump\", and sent a message to the rapper, saying:\"I seen a picture saying Nikki Trump, let me say this to Nikki first, Nikki, you're winning. You're one of the most smartest people I've met, aside from myself and my mother. Nikki is strategic. I'd rather have you in my back pocket, then no way around it all.\"She continued:\"Whether I like you or not, let me put you in my back pocket. I'm put you in my back pocket. I'm gonna put the UN in my back pocket. I'm put all the important people in my back pocket. The public isn't important. You're not important to nobody, not to politicians, not to celebrities. They don't speak to you for you or about you.\"Further, Tokyo Toni claimed it was a \"smart\" move on Nicki Minaj's part to keep President Trump in her \"backpocket\". She added:\"No, they don't speak up for religion. Well, Miss Minaj Onika, smart, smart. See, I don't hear one mouth saying, well, 50 Cent, mess with him just as hard you.\"The discourse about Nicki Minaj's political beliefs began after the rapper showed her support for President Trump and the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement. Minaj also spoke about the alleged deportation of Christians in Nigeria in a United Nations event, which has generated controversy, as there have been doubts about the facts of the matter. Further, she was also a guest at the 2025 America Fest, where she had a live conversation with Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk.Tokyo Toni has previously showed her support for Nicki Minaj after latter supported TrumpJD Vance Speaks At Turning Point USA's AmericaFest Youth Conference In Phoenix - Source: GettyThis is not the first time Tokyo Toni has been vocal in her support for Nicki Minaj despite the rapper facing backlash about her support for President Trump. Earlier this month, on December 12, Toni shared a TikTok video where she claimed Minaj did nothing wrong by supporting the Republican president. She said:“Let me make this real quick, OK? First, Nicki Minaj. She ain’t do nothing wrong but follow Donald Trump. I don’t hear a mother-f*cking soul say sh*t about 50 [Cent] loving Donald Trump, hanging with Donald Trump, taking pictures with Donald Trump, telling Donald Trump to keep another Black man down, in jail. B**ch, please. She did the right thing. I’m about to follow him, too.\"Toni's mention of 50 Cent refers to the rapper claiming he will vote for Trump ahead of the 2024 Presidential elections. Cent has been a clear supporter of the Republican over Vice President Kamala Harris, who was his running mate in the last elections. Further, she mentioned Cent asking the President to keep a \"black man down\", referring to the rapper saying Diddy won't be pardoned by Trump. Further, Tokyo Toni also questioned why people were \"mad\" about Trump. She also addressed Trump's controversial policies about immigrants and the ongoing ICE raids that have been happening all over the United States. She said:\"F*ck you mad about? Get the f*ck off welfare! What did he really do to anybody? Wasn’t y’all crying about they was coming, taking your welfare, and [how] y’all ain’t getting nothing? Now he get them out of here, now y’all are crying? ...

Pro-growth policies matter. You can see it clearly at the state level, where red states are doing a far better job keeping inflation under control than blue states.\n\nA new White House analysis of inflation data underscores the divide. States President Trump carried in 2024 have an average year-over-year inflation rate of 2.5%, while states Kamala Harris won are running at 3.0%.\n\nHousing inflation in conservative states stands at 3.4%, compared with 3.6% in liberal states. Food and beverage costs follow the same pattern: 2.5% in red states versus 2.7% in blue states.\n\nThe gap is even bigger in energy.\n\nConservative states are at 3.5%, while liberal states are stuck at a painful 5.2%. Anyone who has filled up a tank in California already understands why. When it comes to transportation, red states are seeing just 0.7% inflation, while blue states are dealing with 2.5%.\n\nLook at those numbers and tell me politics doesn’t matter. It almost starts to look intentional, as if blue states are content to create higher prices and hope Trump takes the blame.\n\nStranger things have happened.\n\nEven at the metro level, the pattern holds. Cities in more conservative regions such as Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Detroit, and St. Louis are posting all-items inflation of about 1.9%. Liberal metro areas are running much hotter at an average of 3.0%. Housing costs widen the gap even further, with inflation in blue strongholds nearly double that of their red-state counterparts, 3.9% versus 2.3%.\n\nHow about energy? I’m glad you asked. Left-leaning cities are still paying for the legacy of Bidenomics. San Diego saw energy inflation surge to 8.7%, with Riverside close behind at 7.9%. Conservative metros kept energy increases far more restrained, and overall inflation barely moved past 2%.\n\nHow does this happen? I have a theory.\n\nStates that embrace free-market policies, keep taxes low, and avoid burying businesses in regulation post better inflation numbers across the board. Liberal states are trapped in a cycle of high taxes, runaway spending, and green mandates, which is why they are still dealing with the consequences of the policies they cheered during the Biden years.\n\nAre Democrats really going to pretend this is a coincidence or some geographic fluke? This comes down to who is in charge. States with Republican governors posted an average inflation rate of 2.3%, compared with 3.0% in Democratic-led states. Republican-controlled legislatures came in at 2.4%, again well below the 3.0% average in Democrat-run legislatures. States with unified Republican control recorded inflation of 2.3%, beating liberal-run states by 0.7%.\n\n🚨 IT'S OFFICIAL: Jaw-dropping new data CONFIRMS Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent's claim that red states have LOWER inflation than liberal states\"The gap is even wider for bills...energy prices? 5.2% in blue, 3.5% in red states!\"\"Transportation: 2.5% in blue states, versus just… pic.twitter.com/fgoHTNJ9R2— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) December 24, 2025\n\nSo before Democrats try to pin inflation on Trump, they might want to look a little closer to home. Biden’s economic legacy is still crushing blue-state economies, while red America has already turned the page.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/12/25/this-should-end-the-inflation-debate-right-now-n4947506","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/207/d009602b-58e6-4fd3-9870-fb0c719fd2e1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-25 13:58:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.308}]}
