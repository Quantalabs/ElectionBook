You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nProgressives raise hell—and big money\n\nA new poll of young Americans signals trouble for the Democratic establishment. \n\nAmong Americans ages 18 to 29, the approval rating for congressional Democrats has plummeted 19 percentage points since spring 2017—from 42% to merely 23% this spring—according to Ipsos’ poll for the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are holding steady: 28% approval in 2017 and 29% now.\n\nSo what do voters, young and older, want instead? Fundraising offers a hint. \n\nAs Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and other progressives advocate for a new direction, a fresh wave of insurgent candidates is raking in serious cash, signaling that many in the Democratic base are done waiting for bold leadership.\n\nAccording to data from the Federal Election Commission, three progressives seeking to primary incumbent Democrats raised over $70,000 in the first quarter of 2025, excluding the campaigns’ loans, offsets, and figures labeled “other other receipts” in FEC data, and subtracting any refunds the campaigns may have issued.\n\nTwo of the three challengers outpaced their district’s incumbent: Kat Abughazeleh, running in Illinois’ 9th District, raked in $378,596, followed by Elijah Manley, in Florida’s 20th, with $273,389. The third is Saikat Chakrabarti ($71,239, in California’s 11th), who was formerly Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff and whose fundraising lags far behind the incumbent he’s challenging: former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nAll three challengers present themselves as unapologetic fighters.\n\nManley, a 26-year-old substitute teacher and progressive activist, raised 18 times what incumbent Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick did last quarter. He’s also sitting on over 40 times more cash on hand. Her poor numbers are likely tied to corruption allegations, but Manley’s haul speaks volumes either way.\n\nThen there’s Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old journalist and activist who raised the most of the three—and in just one week.\n\nThat’s in large part thanks to her viral campaign-kickoff video, in which she challenged the Democratic Party to “grow a fucking spine.” The message clearly resonated among a segment of the Democratic base restless with aging leadership. \n\nThe thing is, while Abughazaleh has spoken a lot about Illinois’ 9th District not having had a competitive primary in decades, incumbent Rep. Jan Schakowsky is reportedly planning to announce in May that she won’t seek another term. So change is coming to the district either way. And Abughazaleh—who moved to Illinois last year and doesn’t yet live in the district, which is technically allowed—is sure to face competition from other Democrats with more of a tie to the area.\n\nStill, her message has clearly resonated with donors—and they’re not alone. \n\nA Change Research poll found that 90% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer a moderate fighter over a quiet progressive, while an astonishing 95% would choose a progressive fighter over a quiet moderate. This preference holds across virtually all demographics.\n\nThe message is clear: Democrats don’t just want new blood. They want someone with a pulse.\n\nBoom promised, bust delivered\n\nStaring down a possible future of higher inflation and cost-raising tariffs, Americans have slapped President Donald Trump with his worst-ever approval rating on the economy, according to the new CNBC All-America Economic Survey.\n\nJust 43% of Americans approve of his economic performance, while 55% disapprove, putting him 12 points underwater on net.\n\nWhile Trump can still count on Republican voters’ support (for now), independent voters have turned sharply against him, with approval down 23 points from his average rating in his first term, according to CNBC. Democrats gave him a punishing -90-point net rating on the economy.\n\nThe economy has long been voters’ top concern, and 2024 was no exception. Heading into the election, most voters told Gallup they trusted Trump more than Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris on the economy, no doubt believing he’d lower inflation and grocery prices as he repeatedly promised. \n\nOf course, we’ve seen how that’s turned out.\n\nSince returning to power, Trump has unleashed a storm of erratic economic moves: slapping tariffs on key allies, spooking investors with social media tirades, and trying to bully Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into slashing interest rates. The result? Confidence in his economic leadership has cratered, according to this new data.\n\nAnd few expect a rebound. CNBC finds that 49% of Americans—including 83% of Democrats and 54% of independents—think the economy will get worse over the next year, the bleakest reading since 2023, which also tracks with broader recession warnings.\n\nEven Republicans may be losing faith in his economic stewardship. CNBC’s poll finds that many more GOP voters approve of Trump’s overall job performance than of his tariffs.\n\nHe promised a boom. He’s delivering a bust. Wonder how that’ll play out for him in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nAmericans worried about free press\n\nEveryday Americans are worried about potential restrictions on the free press—but their level of worry largely depends on which side of the aisle they sit on.\n\nAccording to new Pew Research Center data, 69% of adults are concerned about possible restrictions on press freedom, a right enshrined in the First Amendment. That includes 43% who are “extremely” or “very” concerned. \n\nWhile the numbers are almost identical to what Pew found in 2024, the partisan split on concern has shifted. In 2024, more Republicans (47%) than Democrats (38%) were extremely or very concerned about possible restrictions on press freedom. But under Trump, that has basically flipped: 60% of Democrats are now extremely or very concerned, compared with just 28% of Republicans.\n\nThough former President Joe Biden wasn’t perfect on press freedom, it’s nothing compared with the way Trump has gone after the media, especially in his second term. Trump’s not just bashing reporters—he’s weaponizing the federal government against them. He’s suing CBS News for $10 billion and has pushed the Federal Communications Commission to investigate that network and others. He demanded that Congress strip nearly all federal funding from public broadcasters NPR and PBS. And he’s tried to control which outlets get access to the White House.\n\nHe’s even aimed his rage at polling organizations, demanding they shut down if their numbers don’t flatter him. But what does he expect? He’s tanking the economy while his incompetent Cabinet fumbles behind the scenes. Of course, Americans aren’t thrilled with how things are going.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the people most worried about press freedom are the ones paying attention. Pew found that 49% of Americans closely following Trump’s presidency are “extremely” or “very” concerned about restrictions, compared with just 29% of those less tuned in.\n\nThere’s a silver lining, though. Despite—or maybe because of—Trump’s attacks, support for press freedom is rising. Pew found that 77% of Americans now say a free press is “extremely” or “very” important to society’s well-being, up 4 points from 2024.\n\nTrump may want a media that exists solely to serve him. But so far, the country isn’t buying into that fantasy.\n\nAny updates?\n\n The House GOP wants to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid and food stamps to fund tax cuts for the rich. It’s a giveaway the ultrawealthy may love, but voters, not so much. A survey model from Data for Progress finds that support for slashing Medicaid is below 15% in all 435 congressional districts. \n\n Trump’s online store may be hawking “Trump 2028” hats, but there’s a good chance those things wither in an overseas warehouse because Americans really, really don’t want him to (unconstitutionally) seek a third term. Three-quarters of Americans, including 53% of Republicans, oppose him trying to run again, according to a new Ipsos survey for Reuters.\n\n Most Republican women (64%) say managing their physical health is a top priority, but they’re also more likely than the average American to source health information from Facebook and Pinterest, according to a new Morning Consult poll. That second part may be why the pollster finds that GOP women are more likely than Democratic women to believe dubious health ideas, like falsely believing early childhood vaccines cause autism: 8% of Democratic women believe that misinformation, but 22% of Republican women do.\n\nIndependent voters are souring on Trump, especially over his tariff policies, but that doesn’t mean they’re warming to the Democratic Party. Just 15% of independent registered voters view the Democratic Party favorably, while a staggering 71% view it unfavorably, according to Civiqs as of Friday.\n\nEven more troubling, those numbers have worsened since Election Day. Despite Trump basically bulldozing parts of the federal government, independents don’t seem to be convinced Democrats are the better option. That could be due to many factors: uninspiring leadership, inconsistent messaging, and a lack of urgency from some Democrats in confronting Trump.\n\nIt’s also likely that for many independents, the candidate matters more than the party. With the right messengers—and more backbone—Democrats have a shot at winning over independents.\n\nAndrew Mangan contributed research.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

Who knows how he’s lost weight? We know that Robert Kennedy Jr., his health minister, doesn’t approve of people taking Ozempic because he thinks it shows a lack of moral power. \n\n'So, who knows how Trump has lost weight? But I found the suit color very interesting. And for someone like me, who is a boss, is a huge believer in getting people together as opposed to doing things remotely.'\n\nCheung, 42, directly tagged British-born Coles in his X post, but she did not respond. DailyMail.com has contacted The Daily Beast for comment. \n\nCheung, who made his bones in communications at the Ultimate Fighting Championship, previously served in the White House during Trump's first term as director of strategic response.\n\nHe was responsible for delivering tart responses to the press as communications director for the Trump campaign, which modelled the candidate in taking a sledgehammer to political rivals.\n\nAs in his initial run, Trump fed off intense media coverage, whether good or bad, even while publicly attacking the media as 'fake news' and calling it an 'enemy of the people' during his 2024 campaign rallies.\n\nWhen controversies arose, Cheung delivered a series of responses during the campaign, as when he called Kamala Harris 'despicable.'\n\nThat came just days before the election after Harris cited a report claiming Trump had said something admiring about Hitler. \n\nCheung shot back with a statement calling her a 'stone-cold loser who is increasingly desperate because she is flailing, and her campaign is in shambles.' \n\n'That is why she continues to peddle outright lies and falsehoods that are easily disproven. \n\n'The fact is that Kamala's dangerous rhetoric is directly to blame for the multiple assassination attempts against President Trump and she continues to stoke the flames of violence all in the name of politics. \n\n'She is despicable and her grotesque behavior proves she is wholly unfit for office.'\n\nWhen news broke that Iran had hacked his campaign, Cheung issued a statement blaming Harris. \n\n'This is the continuation of election interference by Kamala Harris and Democrats who will stop at nothing, including emboldening China and Iran attacking critical American infrastructure, to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House,' he said.\n\nOften his comments channeled his boss, as when Judge Tanya Chutkan issued an order in his January 6 case. \n\n'Radical Democrats are hell-bent on interfering in the presidential election on behalf of Lyin’ Kamala Harris. \n\n'With just over two weeks until Election Day, President Trump is dominating this race and Crazed Liberals throughout the Deep State are freaking out,' he said. \n\nHe called the case 'a sham and a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely—as should ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.","summary":"Steven Cheung slammed Daily Best exec Joanna Coles as a 'piece of s***' with a 'pea-sized brain' after she spoke about Trump's apparent weight loss on the CNN show.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14653573/donald-trump-communications-director-Steven-Cheung-slams-CNN-Daily-Beast.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/27/22/97760389-0-image-m-11_1745790754360.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 22:39:31","author":"Editor,Geoffe Earle,Laura Parnaby","authors":["Editor","Geoffe Earle","Laura Parnaby"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":315440170,"title":"Trump's first 100 days: Steamrolling government, strong-arming allies and igniting trade wars","text":"In his first 100 days, President Donald Trump exerted his power in a sweep and scale that has no easy historical comparison.\n\nHis actions target the architecture of the New Deal and the Great Society, but they hardly stop there. He is also rewriting the Reagan Republican orthodoxy of free trade and strong international alliances. All of it is in service of fundamentally altering the role of government in American life and the U.S. place in the world.\n\nTo implement parts of his vision, he deployed the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, to dismantle the federal workforce, deciding only after the fact if the cuts had gone too far. \n\nTrump also has unilaterally declared the power to remake the post-World War II alliance with Europe that has largely maintained peace for nearly 80 years. The Republican president has made extraordinary emergency declarations to rewrite the rules of global trade, setting off panic in markets and capitals around the world. And he has ordered the removal of immigrants to a prison in El Salvador without judicial review. \n\nWhat's more, he has taken direct aim at law, media, public health and culture, attempting to bring all to heel, with some surprising success. \n\nMany of his actions were promised during his campaign but he put them in place with a blunt force aggressiveness. \n\nHere is a look at the most consequential first 100 days of an American presidency since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nTrump has tried to bend the U.S. economy to his will. But one force is unbowed: the financial markets.\n\nTrump says the outcome of his tariffs will eventually be “beautiful.” So far, it’s been an difficult three months with consumer confidence plummeting, stock markets convulsing and investors losing confidence in the credibility of Trump’s policies. It has become a time of anxiety instead of his promised golden age of prosperity.\n\nTrump has managed to reshape the economy through executive power, largely bypassing the Republican-controlled Congress. He has imposed hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, including on America’s two largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. Chinese goods are getting taxed at a combined 145%.\n\nThe trade penalties increased tensions with the European Union and sent Japan and South Korea rushing to negotiate. Despite clear evidence of American economic supremacy, Trump claimed that the U.S. has been ripped off by trade.\n\nThe president says his tariffs will create domestic factory jobs, cover the cost of an income tax cut plan that could exceed $5 trillion over 10 years, repay the $36 trillion national debt and also serve as leverage to renegotiate trade on terms favoring the United States. But his tariffs could reduce an average household’s disposable income by $4,900, according to The Budget Lab at Yale University.\n\nTrump has used his office to promote investment announcements that have yet to make much of an economic impact. Trump talked up a $500 billion investment in artificial intelligence by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. He invited Hyundai executives to the White House for the announcement of a new steel mill in Louisiana. But factory construction slipped in February and outside forecasters have increased the likelihood of a recession this year\n\nHe has rewarded the coal and oil sectors by attacking alternative energy, yet his tariffs pushed up the price of the steel and other materials that the energy industry needs to build out production. \n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said Trump will take full ownership of the economy in the final three months of this year, when the administration policies are fully in place.\n\n— By Josh Boak \n\nTrump promised to take on what he called waste, fraud and abuse in government. He tapped Musk to lead the effort.\n\nMusk turned his plan for a Department of Government Efficiency into one of the most polarizing and consequential pieces of Trump’s first 100 days.\n\nThe billionaire entrepreneur approached the task with a tech mogul ethos: break things, then see what you want to fix. Firings were widespread and indiscriminate. Programs were eliminated with limited analysis. The human consequences were left for others to sort out.\n\nMusk’s team accessed sensitive databases and burrowed into little-known departments responsible for managing the government workforce and federal properties. \n\nRepublicans have long dreamed about scaling back the bureaucracy. But even veterans of Washington’s budget battles were stunned by the speed and ferocity of Musk’s work.\n\nDOGE also made mistakes. Claims of massive savings did not add up. Musk wildly inflated estimates of how much taxpayer money is lost to fraud. His broadsides against Social Security, which he described as a “Ponzi scheme,” rattled retirees.\n\nIt is unlikely that Musk will accomplish his grand-scale goals. His plans for slashing $1 trillion out of the budget were pared back to $150 billion. \n\nTrump and Musk lavish praise on each other. But Musk’s time in the administration is limited and Trump has begun talking about Musk's work in the past tense.\n\n“This guy did a fantastic job,” Trump said during a recent Cabinet meeting.\n\n— By Chris Megerian\n\nCracking down on illegal immigration was the anthem of Trump's campaign, and it is the issue where he has the greatest support.\n\nHe has followed through by implementing some of the hardest-line immigration policies in the nation’s history, even as the promised mass deportations have yet to materialize. \n\nTrump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants with limited due process, then used it to send hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador in defiance of a court order.\n\nHis administration has balked at the Supreme Court's order, issued with no noted dissents, that it must work to return Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia after he was wrongly deported to El Salvador.\n\nTrump sent troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily deported immigrants using military flights. He declared gangs foreign terrorist organizations and barred migrants arriving at the southern border from seeking asylum in the United States. Officials converted a Biden-era app known as CBP One, which about 900,000 people had used to schedule appointments to legally enter the U.S., into a mechanism for urging immigrants to self-deport.\n\nThe administration pledged to end birthright citizenship for people who were born in the U.S., while proposing “gold cards” that would allow foreigners to buy American citizenship for $5 million.\n\nOfficials have sought to expel immigrants from many countries who had been given temporary legal status, and they canceled the Social Security numbers that some had been legally issued by moving them to lists of dead people.\n\nBefore El Salvador, the Trump administration sent immigrants to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, while also requiring Canadians to register when crossing into the U.S. Officials pressured the IRS to surrender sensitive data for hundreds of thousands of people who are in the U.S. illegally, which could make it easier to find them.\n\nIllegal border crossings dropped precipitously. In March, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement said 7,181 people were apprehended nationwide between border crossings -- a 14% decrease from February and a 95% drop from March 2024.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that 46% of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, while about half say he has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThe administration is nonetheless considering evoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows the president to deploy the military on U.S. soil, including to help detain immigrants. —By Will Weissert \n\nTrump entered office pledging to bring “retribution” for his supporters.\n\nHe made good on that on his first day and virtually every week since, with actions taking aim at the prosecutors who investigated him and the law firms that employed them. He went after former officials who criticized him or asserted, correctly, that he had lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump ordered the suspension of the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed onto a letter during the 2020 campaign stating that the saga of Biden's son Hunter's laptop bore the hallmarks of a Russian influence campaign. \n\nTrump's Justice Department fired the prosecutors who investigated him as part of special counsel Jack Smith’s team and demanded the names of FBI agents who participated in investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nExecutive orders targeted some of the country’s elite law firms, in some cases because they employ or once employed prosecutors who investigated Trump. Those orders have sought to punish the firms by stripping the security clearances of their attorneys, barring them from federal buildings and terminating federal contracts.\n\nSome firms have successfully sued to halt enforcement of key provisions of the orders, but even more have cut deals with the White House, agreeing to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal services to causes championed by Trump.\n\nThe nation’s top universities have not been spared, either. \n\nThe administration pulled $400 million in research grants and other funding for Columbia University over the school's handling of protests against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza; Columbia agreed to changes demanded by the Trump team.\n\nSome $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania was suspended over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.\n\nHarvard, which has $9 billion in government funding at stake, refused to comply with Trump's demands. The administration responded by freezing grants and opening an inquiry about the university's tax exempt status.\n\nThe president has singled out individuals, too. Presidential memos call for scrutiny of Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official from the first Trump administration who has become a rump critic, and Chris Krebs, a former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency who angered Trump after he declared the 2020 election to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump extended his reach to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform. He instructed the Justice Department to conduct an investigation. — By Eric Tucker\n\nTrump has consistently said he would follow an order from federal judges. But that has not stopped talk of a possible constitutional crisis over defying the courts.\n\nHis executive orders reshaping the federal government are facing more than 150 lawsuits on issues from fired federal workers and immigration to transgender rights. \n\nJudges have ruled against the administration dozens of times, blocking parts of his agenda for now. The administration has argued that individual judges should not be able to issue nationwide injunctions.\n\nTrump issued an extraordinary call for the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against him the case of Venezuelan immigrants accused of being gang members. That prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who did not mention the president by name but said impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreements over court decisions.\n\nThe administration has also pushed back in court, quickly appealing multiple orders to the conservative-majority Supreme Court.\n\nTrump so far has a mixed record at the Supreme Court in a flurry of emergency appeals. The justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration. They also have rejected Trump’s broad arguments in several cases, including the one involving the Venezuelans and another in the Abrego Garcia case.\n\n— By Lindsay Whitehurst \n\nTrump has rejected the post-World War II order that has formed the basis for global stability and security.\n\nHe has rejected long-standing alliances and hinted at scaling back the U.S. troop presence in Europe. Longtime allies such as Germany and France have suggested they no longer can depend on Washington.\n\nTrump also pledged a swift end to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, so far to little effect. \n\nHe set a new standard for hosting a leader of another country when he openly chided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump has repeatedly, and inaccurately, said Ukraine started the war; it began when Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\nHis actions have led allies in Europe, along with Canada, Japan and South Korea, to question their reliance on the U.S. and whether commitments that have long endured apply no more.\n\nTrump has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make dramatic cuts of people and programs at the State Department. Rubio has complied and said some in the department have followed a “radical” ideology. \n\nThe president has upended other multilateral organizations. He immediately withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization, canceling participation in the Paris Climate accord on global warming and took action against the International Criminal Court.\n\nHe has effectively shuttered the United States Agency for International Development, long seen as an example of an effective tool to provide humanitarian aid and to build goodwill, even though some programs were beset by corruption.\n\nAt the same time, he has repeatedly called for the U.S. to annex Greenland, which is a Danish territory, to retake control of the Panama Canal and to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.\n\n— By Matthew Lee\n\nCongress is proving to be almost no match for this White House.\n\nTrump is testing, challenging and even bullying the Congress in unparalleled ways -– slashing government agencies, deporting legal immigrants, investigating perceived enemies and churning the economy -- and all but daring lawmakers to object.\n\nWith unified Republican control of the White House and Congress, the GOP has a rare opportunity to muscle through an ambitious partisan agenda. \n\nBut Trump has shown he does not necessarily want or need Congress to accomplish his goals. \n\nThe president has issued almost 10 times as many executive orders as the first five presidents combined, bypassing Congress. DOGE is slashing programs, jobs and entire agencies, including the Department of Education, that by law receive funding under the purview of Congress, which holds the power under the Constitution to allocate money to the agencies. \n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., the second in the line of presidential succession, portrays himself as the “quarterback” for the “coach” – Trump — who is calling the plays. In the Senate, Republican senators confirmed some of his more contentious nominees over nominal objections. \n\nDemocrats are warning of the creep of authoritarianism into American. democracy. “Our Founding Fathers were very aware that a strong executive could essentially crowd out democracy and become an autocrat,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \n\nBehind the scenes, many Republicans are trying to push back, for local imperatives such as agriculture and trade, but so far, most are acquiescing to the president.\n\n— By Lisa Mascaro\n\nFor the past three months the Pentagon has been rocked by the removals of top military leadership, including its only female four-star officers, its Joint Chiefs chairman — a Black general — and its top military lawyers.\n\nThe defense chief, Pete Hegseth, has been floundering in controversy. \n\nHe was a key participant in the Signal chat set up by national security adviser Mike Waltz, sending details of sensitive military operations over the nonsecure channel. Hegseth also used a second Signal chat to send similar information to a group that included his wife and brother. That was followed by the purge of his top staff: He removed or shifted at least five of them, including three whom he said were under investigation for leaks.\n\nTrump has said the military had gone “woke” and he acted swiftly to reverse long-standing policies.\n\nHe issued an executive order to remove transgender service members, which has been stalled by the courts. Hegseth ordered the military to eliminate any programming, books or imagery that celebrates diversity.\n\nMore change is coming. \n\nHegseth, long an opponent of women in front-line combat jobs, has ordered a broad review of military standards to ensure they are the same for women and men. Tens of thousands of career defense civilians are set to either voluntarily depart the agency or be pushed out through a reduction in force.\n\nThe internal changes come as the military is reshaping for a potential future China fight, and just as it is potentially about to receive an infusion of funds as Trump weighs an almost $1 trillion budget for the department.\n\nSocial media posts that celebrated military women or cultural diversity are gone. Instead the services are publicly promoting increases in enlistments, even though the latest totals reflect new recruiting programs and improvements that began long before Trump was elected.\n\nThe military has dedicated significant resources to Trump’s broader order to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. He has transferred control of a thin strip of land along the border to the Defense Department so troops can arrest immigrants for trespassing on military land.\n\n—By Tara Copp and Lolita C. Baldor\n\nAt the Department of Health and Human Services, 10,000 jobs are gone. Billions of dollars in research sent to scientists and universities was shut off. Public meetings to discuss flu shots and other vaccines have been canceled.\n\nFluoride in drinking water may be the next to go, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nKennedy has done a blitz of his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign at day cares, schools and health centers around the country where he has promised to work with Trump’s other agency leaders to prohibit soda from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, limit dyes in the food supply and call for fluoride to be removed from drinking water.\n\nKennedy’s resistance to launching a vaccination campaign as a growing measles outbreak has worsened, so far infecting hundreds and leaving two young children dead, has elicited concerns from doctors, public health experts and lawmakers.\n\nThose worries deepened after he eliminated thousands of jobs across the nation’s public health agencies, including at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. The move, department officials projected, will save taxpayers $1.8 billion.\n\nBut some have escaped steep cuts. Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced an unusually steep rate increase for private health insurers that provide plans for older Americans through Medicare Advantage.\n\nIt will cost an extra $25 billion.\n\n— By Amanda Seitz\n\nTrump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market. \n\nHe created a National Energy Dominance Council, led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and remove regulatory barriers that may slow that down. \n\nTrump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, but he has moved even more aggressively in his second term to roll back major environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, motor vehicles and manufacturers.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations, including a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change. Zeldin’s plan would rewrite the EPA’s 2009 finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the legal underpinning for a host of climate regulations.\n\nZeldin says the changes, including more than 30 announced on a single day last month, will drive a dagger through the heart of what he calls “climate-change religion.” \n\nEnvironmentalists and climate scientists call the so-called endangerment finding a bedrock of U.S. law and that any attempt to undo it has little chance to succeed. \n\nWhile Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind, he has tried to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal, granting nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. \n\nEnvironmental groups and public health advocates say the plan could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health.\n\n— By Matthew Daly\n\nDana Gioia, a poet and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, liked to say that a key to maintaining support for the NEA and other federal organizations was ensuring they backed projects in as many congressional districts as possible.\n\nIt was a bipartisan formula that lasted for some 60 years, through Democratic and Republican administrations, until Trump's second term.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding that artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others in the cultural community had long counted on. Acting without congressional authorization, he has declared that institutions ranging from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to the National Endowment for the Humanities have become fronts for a “woke” agenda that threatens to undermine what he calls “our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.”\n\nThe organizations he has attacked mostly date from the mid-1960s, at the peak of President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” domestic programs, when public support for government was high and the elevation of the arts a national priority. The Kennedy Center, the NEA, the NEH and the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences all were established with broad backing from the two parties.\n\nThe humanities \"are the languages, religions, laws, philosophies, and customs that make us distinct,” reads a statement on the NEH website. “They are our history and our cultures, the ideas and movements that have shaped societies throughout time.”\n\nThe NEH and others also cite practical benefits; arts and culture are good for economy.\n\nThe NEH homepage includes a headline stating that the endowment “supports the humanities in every state and U.S. jurisdiction.” The NEA’s website highlights a recent government study showing that the arts added $1.2 trillion to the economy in 2023 and, at a time when Trump has placed steep tariffs on countries worldwide, notes that “the total value of the nation’s arts exports was nearly $37 billion greater than the value of arts imports from other countries.”\n\n—By Hillel Italie\n\nMany journalists figured a second Trump term would be a challenge for their industry. Few recognized how much.\n\nThe new administration has aggressively, even innovatively, waged combat against the press since taking office. It has fought against CBS News and The Associated Press in court, sought to dismantle the government-run Voice of America and sent the Federal Communications Commission after perceived media rivals.\n\nThe White House has established rapid-response social media feeds that maintain a constant flow of rejoinders to “hold the fake news accountable.”\n\n“The Trump administration is on a campaign to do everything it can to diminish and obstruct journalism in the United States,\" said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor.\n\nThe future of Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and similar services that for generations have delivered unbiased news to countries where it is in short supply is being haggled over in court. \n\nTrump sued CBS News because he believed “60 Minutes” edited a segment last fall to the advantage of election opponent Kamala Harris. It remains hanging over the network’s head, although the newsmagazine has produced several hard-hitting segments on the administration over the first 100 days, provoking Trump into an angry social media response on April 13.\n\nTrump’s FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, is investigating CBS News, too, along with ABC News, NBC News, NPR, PBS, Comcast and, most recently, the Walt Disney Co., the latter for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\nThe AP sued the administration after it reduced the outlet’s access to presidential events for not following Trump’s lead in renaming the Gulf of Mexico, winning a court ruling that the government could not punish the organization for free speech. The administration says it intends to appeal. The administration has sought changes in the press corps that covers him, introducing new media that some suggest is often a euphemism for friendly outlets, and wants more control over who questions Trump.\n\nFox News is again the go-to source to hear Trump’s thinking, or that of people trying to influence him. \n\nThe young administration’s biggest embarrassment came when it unwittingly invited a journalist into a group chat where military plans were discussed. Even worse, it was a figure Trump reportedly dislikes: Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\nTrump press aides miss few opportunities to push the boss’ point of view, tweak the media or both simultaneously: They say they do not respond to questions from reporters who cite personal pronouns in their bios.\n\n—-By David Bauder\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

How are we going to provide a decent standard of living for a younger generation, which, everything being equal, will be poorer than their parents?”\n\nThe self-described democratic socialist rattled off some of his go-to policy goals, such as a higher minimum wage, his desire to reform campaign finance and to repair a broken healthcare system. \n\nSanders’ comments come after he and Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) have swung through the country holding town halls in traditional Republican stronghold places as part of their “Fighting Oligarchy Tour.”\n\nSanders has blasted the Democratic Party for abandoning the working class and said that was one of the reasons that former Vice President Kamala Harris lost to President Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nDemocrats such as Sen.

We had 30,000 people in Folsom, California, which is kind of a rural area,” Sanders shot back. “I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are.”\n\nSanders also acknowledged that he is a fan of targeted tariffs despite disagreeing with Trump’s strategy of slapping broad-based ones on foreign imports. \n\n“You’re talking to somebody who helped lead the effort against NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], against PNTR [Permanent Normal Trade Relations] with China,” the Vermont senator said.\n\n“I understood back then that these were trade agreements written by corporate America,” he went on. “If you have selective tariffs, carefully thought out to protect American workers, yes. What Trump has done is, in my view, is very, very wrong.”\n\nTrump has slapped a 10% baseline tariff rate against virtually all foreign imports, a 25% automotive tariff, 25% tariff on steel and aluminum, and 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico that don’t comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nThe president has also levied 125% across-the-board tariffs against China with limited carve-outs. He is currently trying to negotiate lighting trade deals with foreign countries in lieu of customized rates he’s planning to enact on July 8 if talks don’t pan out.","summary":"Sen.

Trump's presidential campaigns in 2016, 2020 and 2024 all ended with rallies in the battleground state of Michigan. Trump's visit to Macomb County this week follows his final 2024 campaign rally in Grand Rapids, where he joined the crowds just after midnight in the final hours before his victory over then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The event is billed as a celebration of Trump's \"LEGENDARY start to his presidency,\" according to the Republican National Committee's website. The rally will be held at Macomb Community College in Warren and will kick off at 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday. TRUMP TO HOLD RALLY TUESDAY IN CELEBRATION OF FIRST 100 DAYS, LEAVITT SAYS Trump wraps up his 100th day in office with more executive orders signed than any other president over the same period since President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Trump has signed at least 137 executive orders, ranging from dismantling the Department of Education, establishing the Department of Government Efficiency, and stripping diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives from the fabric of the federal government following the Biden administration. ‘Very critical week’ for Russia and Ukraine peace talks Trump returned from Rome on Saturday after attending Pope Francis' funeral mass at the Vatican with first lady Melania Trump. Trump met with Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelenskyy during the trip as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to rage and negotiations for peace stall. \"There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, shortly after he met with Zelenskyy at the Vatican on Saturday. TRUMP AND ZELENSKYY HAVE 'VERY PRODUCTIVE' TALK AS THEY ATTEND POPE FRANCIS' FUNERAL \"It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’ Too many people are dying!!!\" he added. While on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end the war between Russia and Ukraine in a matter of 24 hours, but negotiations have proven difficult. Trump's Truth Social post on Saturday followed Russia launching a missile strike on Kyiv that injured dozens and killed at least 12. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the coming week will be \"very critical\" as the White House weighs whether it wants to continue working towards a peace deal. Rubio warned this month that the U.S. might \"move on\" from trying to secure a deal between Russia and Ukraine if progress was not made. \"I think this is going to be a very critical week,\" Rubio said on Sunday. \"This week is going to be a really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in or if it's time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally, if not more, important in some cases. But we want to see it happen. There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic, of course, as well. We're close, but we're not close enough.\" Trade talks expected to advance following reciprocal tariff pause Trump put a 90-day pause on reciprocal, customized tariffs he had imposed on dozens of nations this month, sparking a trade deal negotiation blitz as dozens of nations began knocking on the proverbial doors of the White House in the hopes of striking more favorable terms. TRUMP SAYS HE HAD 'GREAT CALL' WITH SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, SUGGESTS DEAL POSSIBLE The White House has met and spoken with a handful of nations looking to make deals, including South Korea last week. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said negotiations with the Asian nation have progressed quickly and that the two countries could reach a trade agreement as early as this week. \"We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today,\" Bessent said from the White House on Thursday. \"We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week.\" \"So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game, and we will see if they follow through on that,\" Bessent continued. Congress reconvenes with eyes on passing Trump-backed budget Congress will reconvene on Monday following a spring recess, with Republican lawmakers expected to resume talks on a budget plan to advance Trump's first-year agenda, including extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and carving out millions in funds for border security. SCOOP: REPUBLICANS ROLL OUT $69B FUNDING PLAN FOR NEW CBP AGENTS, BUILDING BORDER WALL IN TRUMP BUDGET BILL Democrats on Capitol Hill protested on Sunday ahead of Republicans returning to the table for budget plan talks. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker took to the steps of the Capitol on Sunday morning while flanked by supporters to protest the budget plan. \"Republican leaders have made clear their intention to use the coming weeks to advance a reckless budget scheme to President Trump's desk that seeks to gut Medicaid, food assistance and basic needs programs that help people, all to give tax breaks to billionaires. Given what's at stake, these could be some of the most consequential weeks for seniors, kids and families in generations,\" the two Democrat lawmakers wrote in a statement of the protests. Trump has repeatedly called on Republican lawmakers to pass the \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending package to advance his first-year agenda. Trump to deliver University of Alabama's commencement speech Trump is expected to travel to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on Thursday where he will deliver a commencement speech to graduating students at the University of Alabama. \"I have agreed to do the Commencement Address at two really GREAT places, the University of Alabama and, WEST POINT. Stay tuned for times and dates!!!\" Trump posted to Truth Social last week. Trump is expected to deliver his speech from the school's Coleman Coliseum arena on Thursday evening. \"The University of Alabama is honored to have been selected as one of the universities President Donald J. Trump will visit to deliver a spring commencement address,\" the university said in a statement this month. Trump-funded American flags to be installed at White House Trump previewed last week that his administration is in the midst of purchasing and installing massive flag poles to feature Ol' Glory on both the north side lawn and south lawn of the White House. Trump told the media he will personally fund the flags and said they could be ready sometime this week. TRUMP UNFURLS PLANS FOR DOUBLE 100-FOOT FLAGPOLES DURING WHITE HOUSE LAWN WALK \"We’re putting up a beautiful, almost 100-foot-tall American flag on this side and another one on the other side, two flags, top of the line,\" he told reporters on Wednesday outside the White House, adding they will be \"paid for by Trump.\" \"They needed flagpoles for 200 years. It was something I’ve often said, you know, they don’t have a flagpole per se. So we’re putting one right where you saw us, and we’re putting another one on the other side, on top of the mounds.

Some Americans, especially within Native American communities, have argued to change the focus of the holiday in part because of the bloodshed and devastation the Italian explorer left behind.While the holiday continues to be federally recognized, there has been a growing movement to also recognize Indigenous Peoples' Day, which Biden became the first president to officially commemorate in 2021, alongside—not replacing—Columbus Day.What To KnowIn his Truth Social post on Sunday, the president wrote: \"I'm bringing Columbus Day back from the ashes. The Democrats did everything possible to destroy Christopher Columbus, his reputation, and all of the Italians that love him so much. They tore down his Statues, and put up nothing but 'WOKE,' or even worse, nothing at all! Well, you'll be happy to know, Christopher is going to make a major comeback. I am hereby reinstating Columbus Day under the same rules, dates, and locations, as it has had for all of the many decades before!\"During the 2020 racial justice protests following George Floyd's death, at least seven Christopher Columbus statues were destroyed across the nation. Demonstrators targeted these monuments as symbols associated with colonization and the mistreatment of indigenous peoples. In response, officials in at least 27 additional cities ordered the removal of Columbus statues that year to prevent potential vandalism.In 2021, Biden became the first president to issue an official proclamation commemorating Indigenous Peoples Day, also on the second Monday of October to \"honor America's first inhabitants and the Tribal Nations.\"Maine, New Mexico, Vermont and Washington, D.C., have renamed the day Indigenous Peoples Day in 2019. Several states still have an official public holiday exclusively called Columbus Day and others like Nebraska or Pennsylvania celebrate both.Trump regularly praised the 15th century Italian explorer in his Columbus Day proclamations during his first administration, while notably not mentioning Indigenous peoples.During the 2020 presidential election, Trump in October spurred the crowd at a Michigan rally to boo the idea of replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day.\"So last week, Biden attacked Christopher Columbus by refusing to recognize Columbus Day. And he wants to change the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. Who likes that idea? What the heck are you saying? That's politically incorrect! What they don't understand is that they're politically incorrection. So he wants to change it to Indigenous Peoples Day. Not as long as I'm president.\"In that year's proclamation, Trump said: \"Sadly, in recent years, radical activists have sought to undermine Christopher Columbus's legacy. These extremists seek to replace discussion of his vast contributions with talk of failings, his discoveries with atrocities and his achievements with transgressions.Meanwhile, during the 2024 presidential campaign trail, Trump accused then-Vice President and Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris of wanting to \"get rid of this holiday honoring the hero that discovered a new world.\"Harris told a crowd during her 2019 presidential run in New Hampshire that she would push for the federal government to rename Columbus Day to \"Indigenous Peoples Day.\" \"Sign me up,\" Harris said in response to a voter's question about her support in the renaming initiative.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump wrote in a social media post in 2018: \"Christopher Columbus's spirit of determination & adventure has provided inspiration to generations of Americans.

But there was never a coherent plan, an objective look at the state of manufacturing, and a clear-eyed recognition of what a change would actually take.\n\nThe result is that there will be no factory renaissance because there are considerations and realities that keep things relatively steady.\n\nTrump’s And Biden’s History Of Manufacturing Jobs\n\nOne of the greatest weaknesses in policy debates and voter judgment of candidates is the lack of human memory. According to social scientists, voters have difficulty remembering even a year before an election, let alone longer times. Politicians usually frame things in terms of the previous office holder. However, it takes greater context to see how a society and its governance have shifted over time.\n\nFor example, when addressing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on U.S. manufacturing in early September 2024 as part of pre-election coverage, FactCheck.org looked at patterns under both Biden and the first Trump administration.\n\nBoth faced a similar economic dynamic. Trump came in at the end of an industrial mini-recession in 2015 to 2016, with 900,000 manufacturing jobs that had been added after the Great Recession. This is a recovery and isn’t the doing of a president, whether Republican or Democratic. The mini-recession saw a loss of 7,000 manufacturing jobs. Then there was an addition of 462,000 jobs in 2017 and 2018, followed by a loss of 43,000 in 2019.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘Major’ U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Braces Bitcoin For A BlackRock ‘Megaforce’ Price Shock\n\nTesla, Looking To Boost Sales, Has A New Killer Model 3 Lease\n\nTrump Approval Rating Tracker: Majority Don’t Approve Of Trump’s Handling Of Inflation, Border And Trade\n\nCombined job losses in 2019 and 2020 created a net loss of 188,000 manufacturing jobs before Trump’s first presidency ended in January 2021.\n\nSomething similar happened with Biden. After the slump, the industry came back and added 765,000 manufacturing jobs. The additions then stalled in his third year, slowing and ultimately showed a loss of 13,000.\n\nThe Even Bigger Picture\n\nTo understand what has happened with manufacturing, it’s necessary to look at a bigger slice of the country’s history. The graph below of all manufacturing employees from 1939 through March 2025 comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nU.S. manufacturing jobs over time.\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nHere’s a timeline of highlights:\n\nJanuary 1939 — 9,077,000\n\nDecember 1943 — 16,526,000 (height of World War II product)\n\nJune 1970 — 19,553,000 (historical high and beginning of the great outsourcing wave)\n\nFeb 2010 — 11,439,000 (nadir)\n\nAugust 2019 — 12,789,000 (pre-pandemic high point)\n\nMay 2020 — 11,610,000 (pandemic low)\n\nFeb 2023, 12,900,000 (post-pandemic recovery)\n\nMarch 2025, 12,764,000 (most recent available number)\n\nOver time, at least two major changes happened. One was the great manufacturing outsourcing wave. Companies decided they could save money by having a lot of commodity manufacturing done overseas. Not only was there cheaper labor to be had, but major locations like China didn’t have similar environmental regulations, as I’ve heard from highly placed corporate lawyers over the years. Compliance was expensive but a cleaner environment had many benefits. So, companies externalized those costs and imposed the implications on foreign populations.\n\nManufacturers Don’t Need As Many Employees\n\nAnother major factor was the focus on higher-profit manufacturing in the U.S. and the increasingly efficient ways in which it was done — automation even before the increased levels that are now possible. Below is another graph that I put together at the St. Louis Fed’s Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) site.\n\nManufacturing production per employee.\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nThe graph involves dividing monthly manufacturing output, indexed to 2017 to remove inflation effects, by the monthly number of employees in manufacturing. The higher the number, the greater the output per employee, meaning the fewer employees needed.\n\nManufacturers have no interest in low-margin manufacturing, which makes that type unlikely to return, and even if companies brought back more factories, the U.S. is highly unlikely to ever need the high levels of manufacturing employees again.\n\nAnd, even if they did bring back more factories, such facilities can take years to find a location, get through permitting, build, equip, staff, and get running. That would leave a different administration claiming credit.\n\nA wave of reshoring manufacturing jobs was never well planned, if planned at all.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Bernie Sanders has faith that the American people understand what “oligarchy” means, defending his use of the term from fellow Democrats Sen. Elise Slotkin and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who have argued that it doesn’t resonate with voters.\n\n “I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are,” Sanders said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “I think they understand very well, when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, when big money interests are able to control both political parties, they are living in an oligarchy. And these are precisely the issues that have got to be talked about.”\n\n Slotkin said in a Politico interview that she wants Democrats to stop using the word “oligarchy” because it doesn’t resonate with voters outside coastal institutions. Instead, she said the party should say it doesn’t support “kings.” She also said that Democrats need to change their public perception that they are the “weak and woke” party.\n\n Walz, who ran as Kamala Harris’ vice presidential candidate, said that Democrats should stop using words like “oligarch” and “food insecurity” in favor of alternatives, like “greedy billionaires” and “hungry.” \n\n Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow Democrat, are leading a nationwide “Fighting Oligarchy” tour that, according to Sanders’ communications director Anna Bahr, has attracted more than 250,000 total attendees to its rallies. While neither Slotkin nor Walz mentioned Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez, their comments came as their tour attracted tens of thousands of people to each event.\n\n “Plenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness,” Ocasio-Cortez posted to social media hours after Slotkin’s interview was published.\n\n “The very rich [are] getting richer, working-class people are struggling, 800,000 people sleeping out on the streets,” Sanders said Sunday. “If we don’t address that issue, the American people will continue to turn their backs on democracy because they’re looking around, and they’re saying, ‘Does anybody understand what I am going through?’ And unfortunately, right now, to a large degree, neither party does.”\n\n Sanders denied that he and Ocasio-Cortez are trying to start a third party when host Kristen Welker asked if that was their goal.\n\n “What we’re trying to do is strengthen American democracy, where faith in both the Democratic and Republican parties right now is extremely low,” he said. \n\n “We are living, Kristen, in the richest country in the history of the world,” Sanders added. “And yet you got one person, [Elon] Musk, who owns more wealth than the bottom 53 percent of American households.

If the reports are true, the Secretary of Defense has failed at operational security, and that is unacceptable. If a Democrat did this we'd be demanding a scalp. I don't like hypocrisy. We should be Americans first when it comes to security,” he told Axios.\n\nBut don’t expect other Republicans to join Bacon anytime soon.\n\nAccording to Politico, Republicans are afraid that calling for Hegseth to resign will get them on President Donald Trump’s bad side.\n\n“Everyone knows he’s a joke, but he’s the guy to do pushups with the troops,” a former congressional aide told Politico. “Plus, not many want to publicly say anything right now and get on Trump’s bad side.”\n\nNow that is the definition of cowardice.","summary":"Congressional Cowards is a weekly series highlighting the worst Donald Trump defenders on Capitol Hill, who refuse to criticize him—no matter how disgraceful or lawless his actions.\n\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is digging in after the latest bombshell report that he shared classified war plans in yet another Signal group chat—this time including his wife, brother, and personal attorney.\n\n\n\nBut instead of condemning Hegseth’s clear mishandling of sensitive military information, GOP lawmakers are circling the wagons, making the insane claim that Hegseth is being taken down by some sort of nefarious deep state within the Pentagon rather than his own bad decisions.\n\n\n\n\"The D.C. foreign policy establishment is getting desperate.

Here was the amazing protest sentence: “Longtime White House reporters say the result has been an erosion of their independence.”\n\nThe presence of a reporter who didn’t vote Democrat doesn’t “erode” the anti-Trump animus (“independence”) of liberal activist journalists. It might balance it, suggesting journalism and liberalism are not exactly the same thing.\n\nThis spurred a trend. Politico’s Ian Ward profiled these invaders under the headline “Meet the 8 MAGA Outlets Disrupting the White House Briefing Room.” It carried the usual labeling about “the divide between the MAGA-friendly media and their more mainstream counterparts.” The extreme hatred of Trump is “more mainstream.”\n\nThen came CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan, who loves to wade into MAGA crowds, trying to find the dumbest-sounding Trump supporter he can find. In this case, he went looking for the dumbest-sounding White House reporter. The headline over the video was “‘Do you consider yourself a journalist?’ CNN meets MAGA media at White House.”\n\nO’Sullivan showed clips of these pro-Trump reporters admitting their bias, and he proclaimed, “These are White House correspondents like you’ve never seen before.” Really? He spotlighted Cara Castronuova of Lindell TV asking if they’ll release Trump’s fitness routine, since he “actually looks healthier than ever before.” In 2009, a Washington Post reporter touted Barack Obama’s “chiseled pectorals.”\n\nThen O’Sullivan replayed Real America’s Voice reporter Brian Glenn asking Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, “Why don’t you wear a suit?” He suggested to Glenn he was “trolling,” but it’s a question lots of Americans would ask.\n\nNatalie Winters from Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast said, “If it were up to me, I’d kick a lot of these outlets out.” In other words, she has the same opinion as CNN, only reversed.\n\nO’Sullivan asked Winters, “Do you consider yourself a journalist?” He said many say, “You don’t deserve to be here because you’re not a real journalist.” She attacked the pro-Joe Biden media: “I’m pretty sure the people in there spent four years covering for someone who was essentially dead, and that’s being charitable. … You guys failed, and that’s why we’re here.” \n\nCNN exemplified the point last year when anchor Dana Bash was deeply troubled over bumbling-Biden videos. They were “amplified on conservative media that in some cases are just not right and in other cases are highly, highly misleading of President Biden.”\n\nO’Sullivan lectured about the “new media” people: “A lot of them are more cheerleading President Trump than challenging him.” He ended by quoting White House Correspondents’ Association leader Eugene Daniels: The public “needs news produced by experienced, professional journalists who ask tough questions and produce fair coverage.”\n\nUnder Biden, Daniels wasn’t known for asking “tough questions.” At the 2024 Kamala cuddlefest before the National Association of Black Journalists, Daniels began by gently asking if the American people were better off after four years. Daniels went on shows such as “Washington Week” on PBS and denied Kamala was ever “border czar” and insisted she was a victim: “We’ve already seen a lot of racism and sexism, and that’s going to be a huge part of this campaign.”\n\nThen there’s CNN itself. One of the most memorable tongue-bath questions came in 2009, when then-New York Times reporter Jeff Zeleny asked Obama what “enchanted” him about being president. Then-CNN anchor John Roberts praised the softball and Obama’s “thoughtful” answer. Zeleny was later hired by CNN.\n\nReporters asking softballs at the White House is nothing new. It’s OK when the “mainstream” does it for Democrats.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

This was long ago, when viewing options were limited to what was airing on NBC, ABC and CBS until Fox came on the scene in 1986.\n\nEven then, Sunday night viewing began with “60 Minutes,” followed by everything else.\n\nThat's still true for many people now. “60 Minutes” is the third most-watched TV show on broadcast, averaging a weekly viewership of 8.4 million, according to Nielsen’s season-to-date numbers shared by TV Line. That’s an impressive ranking in this massively fragmented media environment, and in a time of high distrust in mainstream news.\n\nBut it's content from topical comedy shows like “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,” which alloys comedy to the type of long-form journalistic content “60 Minutes” pioneered, that circulates more widely on social media.\n\nIn a recent “60 Minutes” interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker, Oliver characterizes “Last Week Tonight” not as news, but as a “rigorously researched comedy show.” Still, Oliver’s work is as essential to his audience’s grasp on current events as “60 Minutes” is to journalism at large.\n\nJohn Oliver performs onstage during 2023 Night of Too Many Stars benefiting NEXT for AUTISM at Beacon Theatre on December 11, 2023 in New York City.

To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience,” Owens wrote in a staff memo.\n\n“I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,\" he added. \"The show is too important to the country, it has to continue, just not with me as the Executive Producer.”\n\nOwens is only the third executive producer to lead “60 Minutes” following Jeff Fager, who was ousted in 2018 following allegations of sexual misconduct, and its creator, Don Hewitt.\n\nHis departure comes after months of legal wrangling between Donald Trump and Paramount Global, CBS’ parent company. In October Trump sued CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, which was also conducted by Whitaker. The suit, filed before Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Texas, accuses CBS of \"unlawful acts of election and voter interference through malicious, deceptive and substantial news distortion.\"\n\nIn February, Trump’s lawyers amended the suit, as cited in Variety, adding a claim for “unfair competition” under the federal Lanham Act. In total, Trump is seeking $20 billion in damages.\n\nFor those who may have forgotten, “60 Minutes” features interviews with candidates topping each major party’s ticket, coinciding with every presidential election. Trump backed out of his appearance.\n\nParamount and CBS filed two motions to throw out the suit in March, one for lack of personal jurisdiction and the other on the grounds that consumer fraud laws do not apply to editorial speech, calling the suit an “affront to the First Amendment.” \n\nOther legal experts have opined that Trump’s accusations would not hold up under scrutiny. Indeed, in early April, the corporations filed a motion to compel Trump to produce relevant documentary evidence, as required in discovery. \n\nMeanwhile, in January, Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee and Project 2025 co-author, requested that CBS hand over the unedited tapes and a transcript of the Harris interview.\n\nCBS News complied, explaining in the post containing the links, “In reporting the news, journalists regularly edit interviews for time, space or clarity. In making these edits, 60 Minutes is always guided by the truth and what we believe will be most informative to the viewing public — all while working within the constraints of broadcast television.”\n\nThat was not enough to appease Trump, who has repeatedly called for CBS’ license to be revoked. His latest eruption on Truth Social followed a “60 Minutes” interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which the Ukrainian president cites the “enormous influence of Russia's information policy on America, on U.S. politics, and U.S. politicians.”\n\n\"I believe, sadly, Russian narratives are prevailing in the U.S.,” Zelenskyy says in the April 13 episode after seeing a clip of Trump calling him a dictator. In response, Trump called for Carr to impose maximum fines and punishment “for their unlawful and illegal behavior” on his social media platform.\n\nAs for the specifics of what that “behavior” may be, Trump doesn’t specify. That’s probably because expressing an opinion is legal in the United States under the First Amendment. At the moment.\n\nNevertheless, Paramount is interested in settling with Trump. According to an earlier New York Times report, Paramount Global’s majority shareholder, Shari Redstone, wants the suit to go away so the company’s multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance Media can move forward and make the wealthy Redstone much wealthier. This requires the FCC’s approval, which has stalled before Carr.\n\nBill Owens (Piaras Ó Mídheach/Sportsfile for Collision via Getty Images). In March, Oliver Darcy reported in his Status newsletter that incoming Paramount Global president Jeff Shell communicated with Owens and CBS News president and CEO Wendy McMahon that they needed to get on board with a settlement deal. Both have been adamantly against it.\n\n“[I]t goes without saying that any settlement in which a monetary sum is paid to Trump, and especially one in which a statement of wrongdoing is included, would amount to a public surrender and forever stain the treasured reputation of ‘60 Minutes,’” Darcy added.\n\nAnd this makes the details of a recording of Owens’ emotional meeting with the “60 Minutes” team obtained by Darcy that much more alarming. “It’s clear that I’ve become the problem,” Owens is heard telling his colleagues. “I am the corporation’s problem.”\n\nOliver warned his audience that something like this might happen in a 2019 “Last Week Tonight” episode titled “SLAPP Suits.” He didn’t specifically refer to CBS News or any other legacy news organization in that segment. Instead, using his show’s headline-making legal headache as an example, Oliver illustrated why Trump’s penchant for weaponizing the legal system is dangerous to freedom of speech and expression.\n\nWe might have missed that larger point at the time, since Trump wasn’t the episode’s star. Oliver took on coal magnate Bob Murray, Trump's pal who sued “Last Week Tonight” and HBO in 2017, threatening to give the network “the fight of its existence.”\n\nThere's a reason Murray was so emboldened. “SLAPP Suits” cited Trump’s 2016 campaign rally promise to “open up our libel laws, so when they” – as in, news organizations – “write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.” \n\nTrump has a long history of suing people solely to inflict financial and psychological pain. Such claims, Oliver explains, are characterized as strategic lawsuits against public participation, hence the SLAPP acronym.\n\n“I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more,” Trump once bragged in an interview about his 2006 libel claim against a journalist named Tim O’Brien. “I did it to make his life miserable, which I'm happy about.”\n\nMurray gambled he’d enjoy a similar outcome by suing “Last Week Tonight” over its “objectionable” but accurate depiction of him in its 2017 “Coal” episode. But Murray eventually dropped his suit, and HBO prevailed. At the end of \"SLAPP Suits,\" the host celebrates with a massive, Broadway-style victory dance that makes previous punchlines at Murray’s expense look cheap and small.\n\nClips from that episode appeared in Oliver’s recent “60 Minutes” profile, reminding us of how different times were just a few years ago. \n\n“Last Week Tonight” remains respected and free to continue digging into deadly serious topics. Now it is “60 Minutes,” the newsmagazine that inspired Oliver’s brand of topical satire, that's in jeopardy.\n\nThis decisive moment in the legacy of “60 Minutes” follows Disney’s $15 million settlement with Trump, who sued ABC News and \"This Week\" host George Stephanopoulos. During a March 2024 interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos referred to a New York civil jury’s determination finding Trump liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll as \"rape.\"\n\nTrump claimed this defamed him, although the trial's presiding judge previously clarified in a memorandum that \"as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape’ . . . the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\" Nevertheless, Disney chose to settle instead of going to trial, requiring the network and Stephanopoulos to apologize, which they did on ABC News' website.\n\nTrump is also suing the Des Moines Register, its owner Gannett and pollster J. Ann Selzer for releasing a poll shortly before the Nov. 5 election showing Harris with a 3-percentage-point lead. Trump went on to carry Iowa by 13 points. Nevertheless, the claim accuses the paper and pollster of election interference and violating the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act. Lawyers for Selzer, the Register and Gannett called for the suit’s dismissal in February.\n\nThe First Amendment protections shielding journalists and satirists like Oliver have a shared origin in the 1964 Supreme Court decision in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. That ruling places the onus on the public figures to prove “actual malice\" in their libel claims. In other words, they must show that the defendants knowingly published false information or acted with reckless disregard as to the accuracy of a claim.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision that made Oliver’s middle-finger musical possible is 1988’s Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, which affirms parody and satire as protected speech and sprang from the Sullivan decision. HBO knew these precedents made a ruling in their favor likely, just as it probably understood that settling with Murray would be a terrible look for the company and Oliver’s show. After all, as Oliver points out, SLAPP suits are designed to bully people into silence.\n\nSince Murray died in 2020, there would be no way to know if HBO would have taken a different course had he sued “Last Week Tonight” while the show’s parent company, WarnerMedia, was negotiating the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOne hopes not. Although Oliver reported that the suit cost more than $200,000 for HBO to defend and required the show to triple its libel insurance, that’s still less than the reported $15 million budget allotted for each “Game of Thrones” episode in 2019.\n\nOther potential costs are too lasting and steep not to push back. A persuasive factor in Disney’s decision to settle with Trump, according to the Times’ reporting in December, was their lawyers’ concern that the case would land in the Supreme Court, where Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas have signaled an openness to overturning Sullivan.\n\nIf Sullivan falls, parody protections will be more vulnerable too.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit against ABC is different than his allegedly flimsier allegations against CBS. But as Times reporter David Enrich explains in an expansive March 3 feature, presenting a solid case affirming Sullivan's protections may not be enough to sway this court from shooting it down.\n\nHowever, Redstone’s motivation to “bend the knee,” as CNN's Jake Tapper put it on Tuesday, appears to be less related to concerns over First Amendment protections than securing a payday estimated to be worth billions. The public stands to lose a whole lot more.\n\n“This is not about one man or even about one show,” Tapper said on his broadcast. “It's about an attempt to be rid of criticism.” He then lists the latest insults against the Fourth Estate: The Pentagon reassigned offices previously held by NBC, CNN, Politico and the New York Times to the likes of Breitbart. The White House welcomed podcaster Tim Pool to a recent press conference. Pool is one of six far-right influencers implicated in a Department of Justice indictment to have been paid by Russia to spread Kremlin-friendly talking points. “I like this guy. See?” Trump gushed after Pool tossed him a propaganda softball consisting of lies about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the U.S. government erroneously deported to El Salvador. \"This is the kind of reporter we like.”\n\nAs for Redstone, at a recent documentary premiere she declined to talk to The Wrap about the chaos she's causing at “60 Minutes,” but shared, “I don’t think there’s ever a time you have to compromise what it is that you say and do, but freedom of the press involves telling both sides of the story, giving the facts, not giving opinions.” \n\n“And I think that’s our responsibility as a media company,” she concluded.\n\nWhere preserving the legacy of “60 Minutes” places in Redstone’s tiers of responsibility may be revealed in the tenor of upcoming coverage. The industry is right to be concerned about CBS News' parent company meddling in its coverage decisions.\n\nFor the time being, I’m eager to see whether Oliver has something to say about all this, regardless of whether he sets his take to harmonies and a kick line.\n\nThe \"SLAPP Suits\" episode of \"Last Week Tonight with Oliver\" is available on YouTube. New episodes air at 11 p.m. Sundays on HBO and stream on Max.","summary":"We should rewatch the SLAPP Suits episode of \"Last Week Tonight\" in the context of Trump's threat to press freedoms","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/04/27/whats-happening-at-60-minutes-matters-to-anyone-cares-about-protecting-free-speech/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/04/owens-oliver-controlroom.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 17:30:06","author":"Melanie McFarland","authors":["Melanie McFarland"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.065},{"id":315389800,"title":"Democrats' Chances of Defeating Susan Collins in Maine, According to Polls","text":"Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, is facing significant headwinds as she angles for reelection in the 2026 midterm, according to recent polling—with Democrats eyeing her seat as one of their best pickup opportunities.Newsweek reached out to Collins' press office for comment via email on Sunday.Why It MattersRepublicans currently control the Senate with a 53 to 47-seat majority. While Democrats hope to regain control of Congress in the 2026 election, it will be a tall order in the Senate with only a few Republican-held seats viewed as pickup opportunities by most analysts. Meanwhile, Democrats will be defending two Senate seats in states won by President Donald Trump in 2024—Michigan and Georgia.Although current polling suggests Collins is unpopular with Maine voters, the senator has consistently pulled off victories in her state, despite pushback from Republicans and Democrats alike. Viewed as one of the most moderate Senate Republicans, Collins frequently angers voters in her own party while also frustrating Democrats when she sides with the GOP.What To KnowCollins told reporters last November that she plans to seek a sixth Senate term.\"It's my plan,\" Collins told reporters, the Washington Examiner first reported. \"I'm focused on the appropriations process, not elections right now, but my intention is to run.\"At least two Democrats—Jordan Wood and Natasha Alcala—have already announced their intention to run against Collins. Several other higher profile Democrats, including Governor Janet Mills, are rumored to be considering throwing their hat into the ring.Wood previously worked as vice president of End Citizens United, a group working to overturn a controversial U.S. Supreme Court decision related to campaign financing. He also worked as former California Democratic Representative Katie Porter's chief of staff.Alcala was the first Democrat to join the race and hails from Madawaska in Aroostook County, which is the same county Collins is from.What Polling Shows in MaineNew polling released by the University of New Hampshire on Thursday had some bad signals for Collins' reelection bid. The survey results showed that 71 percent of respondents do not believe the GOP senator deserves to be reelected.Furthermore, the poll showed that majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans are all against Collins' reelection plans. Among Democrats, 84 percent said she does not deserve to serve another term, with 67 percent of independents and 57 percent of Republicans saying the same.The poll additionally showed Collins' favorability significantly underwater. Just 12 percent of respondents said they had a favorable view of the Maine Republican, while 58 percent said they had an unfavorable view. Additionally, 27 percent said they were neutral and said they don't know enough to say.Notably, the survey also polled the favorability of three prominent Democrats who have been floated as potential 2026 contenders. Among these, Mills was viewed the most favorably at 47 percent to 45 percent who viewed her unfavorably.Democratic Representatives Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden were also polled. Pingree was viewed favorably by 38 percent of respondents and unfavorably by 42 percent. Golden was less popular, viewed favorably by 18 percent compared to 42 percent who viewed him unfavorably. All the Democrats, however, were viewed more favorably than Collins.The poll was conducted from April 17 to 21 and included 2,850 Maine adults. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.Another recent survey by Public Policy Polling—commissioned by the Senate Majority PAC, which has links to Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York—found that only 24 percent of Mainers approve of Collins, compared to 61 percent of voters who disapprove of her.The poll additionally found that President Donald Trump, who lost in Maine by about 7 points in 2024, is more popular among Maine voters than Collins. Forty-four percent of respondents said they approve of his job performance compared to 52 percent who disapprove.The poll surveyed 569 Maine voters from March 20 to March 21. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.Maine's Recent Election ResultsFormer Vice President Kamala Harris beat Trump in Maine last year, 52.4 percent to 45.5 percent. Similarly, former President Joe Biden won the state against Trump in 2020 by about 9 points, or 53.1 percent to 44 percent.Collins won reelection in 2020 on the same ballot as Biden, beating her Democratic opponent by 8.6 percentage points, or 51 percent to 42.4 percent. In her previous 2014 election, she won by a massive 37-point margin, 68.5 to 31.5 percent.What People Are SayingNick Puglia, regional press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), wrote in a March statement to Newsweek: \"Chuck Schumer literally ran out of things to spend money on last time he tried to take down Susan Collins and she still won. In 2026, Mainers will reelect Susan Collins again and no amount of partisan polling or openly begging any Democrat to run against her will change that.\"Dan Shea, a professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, told Newsweek last month: \"It's a blue state that she can win. But the snag is that group is getting smaller and smaller. Swing voters might not be extinct in Maine, but they are on the endangered species list.\"What Happens Next?It remains to be seen whether Mills, Golden or Pingree seek to challenge Collins for her Senate seat. Collins may also face a heated primary challenge from a fellow Republican, as she has angered many voters within her party due to her criticisms of Trump.Thus far, Republicans Carmen Calabrese and Daniel Smeriglio have announced campaigns. Independent Phillip Rench is also running.","summary":"Maine appears to be one of Democrats' best bets at a Senate pick up opportunity in 2026.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-chances-defeating-susan-collins-maine-according-polls-2064775","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2634113/senator-susan-collins.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 17:17:09","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":315378854,"title":"Biden's Decline 'Cover-Up' Called Out at White House Correspondents' Dinner","text":"Axios reporter Alex Thompson called out media outlets' \"cover-up\" of former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline during an acceptance speech at the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday night.In his speech, Thompson stressed the importance of reporting, saying the failure to properly address the issue has led some people to lose faith in the media, adding that \"acknowledging errors builds trust, and being defensive about them further erodes it.\"Newsweek has reached out to Creative Artists Agency's press team on behalf of Biden for comment via email on Sunday.Why It MattersDuring the 2024 presidential election, the White House and leading Democrats repeatedly insisted that Biden was sharp, clear-headed and capable of fulfilling all presidential duties. In July, Biden dismissed concerns about his cognitive abilities, telling NBC News' Lester Holt \"my mental acuity has been pretty damn good.\"However, a disastrous debate performance in June against then-Republican nominee Donald Trump revealed Biden's declining mental acuity, and several weeks later Biden ultimately bowed out of the race, leaving Democrats with just over 100 days before the election to find a new nominee and build a winning campaign. Then-Vice President Kamala Harris ultimately took the helm; however she lost to Trump in the Electoral College and the popular vote.A series of books and tell-alls about Biden's decline have been released or are forthcoming, including Chris Whipple's latest book, which argues that Biden's top advisers were in a \"fog of delusion and denial\" about his ability to serve another term. Thompson is also co-authoring a book with CNN anchor Jake Tapper about the alleged cover-up efforts, set to be released next month.The Trump administration has had a tense relationship with the press over the past three months, taking a stricter approach to media relations than its predecessors, including shake-ups affecting the press pool and access to the White House and Pentagon, and a lawsuit from the Associated Press over terminology related to the Gulf of Mexico after Trump renamed it the Gulf of America. The changes mark a shift in power from the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) to the White House, giving the administration control over the press pool.What To Know In his acceptance speech of the Aldo Beckman Award for Overall Excellence in White House coverage Saturday night, Thompson reiterated the importance of media at a time when faith in journalism is low.\"I believe reporting and the White House Correspondents' Association is as necessary as ever,\" the journalist said at the podium, later adding that \"I believe our mission is vital in a world where people are struggling to figure out what is true and people with power are not telling the truth.\"He turned to the 2024 presidential election and said: \"President Biden's decline, and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House regardless of party is capable of deception.\"He continued: \"Being truth tellers also means telling the truth about ourselves. We, myself included, missed a lot of this story. And some people trust us less because of it. We bear some responsible for faith in the media at such lows.\"Trust in the media has fallen to a five-decade low, according to Gallup, which has tracked Americans' views on the news media since the 1970s. Gallup reported in February that 36 percent of Americans have no trust at all in the media, while 31 percent trust it and 33 percent say they do not have much faith in it.Thompson added on Saturday: \"I say this because acknowledging errors builds trust, and being defensive about them further erodes it.\"What People Are SayingFox News' official X, formerly Twitter, account shared a clip of Thompson's speech and wrote on Sunday: \"'We missed it.' Liberal media left roasting themselves — and @axios reporter @AlexThomp admits he's part of the Biden decline cover-up they couldn't spin.\"In response, Alex Thompson reshared the post and wrote: \"Stupid and bad-faith tweet.\"CNN anchor Jake Tapper said in a statement announcing his new book: \"Toni Morrison once said 'If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.' That's what inspired this book: we wanted to know more about what we all just lived through. More than 200 interviews later, Alex and I have a much better idea. And soon you all will too.\"Penguin Press, the publisher of Tapper's and Thompson's upcoming book, said in a press release: \"What you will learn makes President Biden's decision to run for reelection seem shockingly narcissistic, self-delusional, and reckless — a desperate bet that went bust — and part of a larger act of extended public deception that has few precedents.\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in April: \"I can tell you there was certainly a lack of transparency from the former president, from the entire former administration. And frankly, a lot of people in this room, when it came to the health in the competence of the former President of the United States, Joe Biden — there was one of the greatest cover-ups and, frankly, political scandals this nation has ever seen. It's been unraveled in some recent books that are being written by journalists who engaged in that cover-up in scandal, which is quite ironic.\"Then-President Joe Biden said during a PBS interview on July 11: \"I'm tested every single day about my neurological capacities in the decisions I make every day.\"Then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas under Biden said on NBC's Meet the Press in February 2024: \"The most difficult part about a meeting with President Biden is preparing for it because he is sharp, intensely probing, and detail-oriented, and focused.\"What Happens NextThompson and Tapper's book titled Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, is set to be released on May 20.","summary":"Journalist Alex Thompson said Biden's \"decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House regardless of party is capable of deception.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bidens-decline-cover-called-out-white-house-correspondents-dinner-2064771","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2634105/jake-tapper.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 16:30:03","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":315371494,"title":"Trump’s tanking poll numbers on the economy means a midterm bloodbath | Friendly Fire","text":"Julie Roginsky, a Democrat, and Mike DuHaime, a Republican, are consultants who have worked on opposite teams for their entire careers yet have remained friends. Here, they discuss the week’s political events with Star-Ledger editor Enrique Lavín.\n\nQ: How worried should we be that President Trump said Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was being “inflammatory” (for saying Ukraine wouldn’t recognize Russia’s control of Crimea) amid Russia’s nuclear threats?\n\nJulie: We should be worried, disgusted, despondent and dejected. Trump is giving away the Crimean Peninsula and 20% of other Ukrainian territory to a genocidal madman who has been very clear that his mission is to reconstitute not just the Soviet Union but the Russian Empire. \n\nOther countries will take note, which means we can say goodbye to Taiwanese independence. I predict that Trump will pull us out of NATO by the end of the year. What this means is the collapse of the Pax Americana, which has kept the western world safer than ever for the last eighty years. \n\nAnd it took less than 100 days for Trump to do all this. \n\nMike: I’m with Julie on this. Republicans grew up under Ronald Reagan talking about the Evil Empire. Or George W. Bush who hoped to reconcile with Putin but quickly learned Putin couldn’t be trusted. Or John McCain who said he looked into Putin’s eyes and saw three letters – KGB. Former Presidents Obama and Biden would agree. \n\nOnly Trump seems enamored with Putin still, so much so that his administration are on Russian talking points. This war is not Ukraine’s fault. It is not Biden’s fault. It is not NATO’s fault. It is Putin’s war.\n\nQ: Speaking of WWIII: How long before GOP leaders turn on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth? The fallout from the first leaked Signal chat had just about dissipated when fresh revelations came out this week that Hegseth shared sensitive military details in another unsecured Signal group chat with his wife, brother and personal lawyer. \n\nJulie: GOP leaders won’t turn on Hegseth as long as Trump sticks by him. And Trump will stick by him as long as Hegseth doesn’t show up to work drunk, since Trump disdains alcoholics. The more the media and Democrats call for Hegseth’s scalp, the safer Hegseth is, because this administration is not about protecting our national security but solely about “owning the libs.”\n\nMike: Julie’s right again that Republicans will stand by Hegseth as long as Trump stands by Hegseth. Trump’s patience may wear thin over time here. He is taking on water for Hegseth and he may not be willing to do that for too long.\n\nQ: President Trump’s former personal lawyer and now interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, has said she’s going to investigate Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin for not complying with federal immigration enforcement directives. Is this bluster?\n\n Julie: Karma comes at you fast, doesn’t it, Gov. Murphy? Maybe Habba can outsource this investigation to the same shills whom Murphy hired in 2017 to run a sham “investigation” into workplace complaints multiple women levied against his campaign manager Brendan Gill – which ended up punishing the whistleblowers instead of the perpetrator. \n\nTo answer your question, I don’t think this is bluster. Habba is weaponizing the Justice Department to go after Democrats, which is shameful but not unexpected. The only lesson any other Democrat should take from this is to understand that sucking up to Trump, as Murphy repeatedly has, won’t save you, so you might as well speak truth to power. As for Platkin, who has engaged in selective prosecution by shielding his allies and indicting his foes, this might be a learning opportunity. May he finally have the maturity to understand that just because you have the power to unleash law enforcement on someone doesn’t mean that you necessarily should. The most I can wish for Platkin is that Habba’s investigation into him falls apart as spectacularly as some of the cases he has recently brought. \n\nMike: Trump is using any government leverage at his disposal to push the agenda he thinks voters voted for. Certainly, there should not be criminal investigations for policy disagreements, but I am not surprised you are seeing a push to have the state government support Trump’s efforts on immigration.\n\nQ: Speaking of Habba: Brent Johnson reported in his weekly Jersey politics newsletter that several insiders believe she’ll run against Cory Booker for his U.S. Senate seat next year. How plausible is that? Mike, you told Brent we should watch state Sen. Mike Testa as a strong challenger. There are other names that have come up. What’s that race looking like this early in the game?\n\nJulie: Anything is possible but at this point, if any Republican thinks that he or she is going to knock off Cory Booker in what is turning into a midterm bloodbath for Republicans, they should probably save their energy for something else. \n\nMike: Sen. Booker is quite popular and generally has kept the strongest GOP challengers from running against him, because they fear a big loss. Sen. Testa would be the strongest to ever run against him. As a candidate, Testa flipped a Senate seat held by Democrats, and as a county chairman, he’s flipped a county run by Democrats. It’s a short list of Republicans with that track record of ousting Democrats. \n\nHabba presumably would come in with star power and the support of the president and the MAGA base, which would help her raise money, get on national TV and solidify a base quickly. That goes a long way in New Jersey, but any candidate will need to broaden the base of support from Trump’s. For as much as Trump closed the gap in New Jersey, he still lost by more than 250,000 votes last year to a terrible candidate in Kamala Harris. \n\nBooker is much stronger than Harris, so it will take a well-funded challenger who excite the GOP base while also winning 70% of independent voters and big chunk of moderate Democrats.\n\nQ: Democratic California Congressman Ro Khanna came to New Jersey for a town hall at Rep. Tom Kean Jr.’s 7th District, lambasting his Republican colleague for not holding his own town halls to face his constituents. Given that House Speaker Mike Johnson has told his conference not to hold town halls to skirt backlash, how effective is this strategy for Democrats?\n\nJulie: Going deep underground has worked well for Rep. Kean in the past but I don’t think he should be so sanguine next year. That is the same kind of arrogance that undid Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen and Leonard Lance in 2018 — and Trump’s numbers look even worse now than they did then, as I explain in this column.\n\nMike: Who is Ro Khanna? I guarantee no one in New Jersey’s 7th District knows or cares what he or she says. For all the media bluster that Tom Kean doesn’t do town halls, the voters know him and don’t care what partisan Democrats, out of state politicians or the newspapers say. Tom Kean has repeatedly won for the last 25 years in difficult districts because the voters know him and like him.\n\nQ: Speaking of Kean: Four Democrats have formally announced they’re running to challenge Kean next year. What are you seeing in there?\n\nJulie: This is a golden pickup opportunity for Democrats. The road to the House majority runs through Central New Jersey. By the time September rolls around, the supply chain will be fully disrupted, back to school shopping will be expensive and families will be suffering. Christmas shopping will be even worse. Once that kind of sentiment is baked in, it will be very hard for Republicans to shift. \n\nMike: There’s no doubt Democrats will spend millions of out-of-state dollars here to try to oust Kean. Let’s see if the Democrats can nominate a good candidate this time. Let’s remember that in 2024, this race wasn’t even close. Kean won comfortably.\n\nQuick takes on these headlines:\n\nTrump’s economic approval ratings are in the dumps (37% approval vs. 51% disapproval).\n\nJulie: It’s not just the economy. He is upside down on virtually every single issue. Public sentiment is with us. Now Democrats must harness it to restore our democracy as best we can.\n\nMike: Trump was elected mostly because of the economy – not Ukraine, not DOGE, not social causes. He has to get the economy right. Tariffs are a huge gamble.\n\nThe Trump administration was given a one-week delay to answer questions about the illegal deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nJulie: We must keep up the public pressure and return Abrego Garcia and the other illegally rendered migrants so they can have the due process to which they are entitled. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that just 45% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of immigration. It’s not going to get better the more he defies the courts. \n\nMike: Trump said he would deport non-citizen criminals, which most people support, but Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of any crime. Democrats make a political mistake dying on this hill, but Trump and the federal government must comply with the Supreme Court. \n\nTrump softened his stance on China tariffs and retreated from threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nJulie: Consumers will be in for a world of pain in the next weeks and months because of the instability but that’s what happens when you elect an unstable man to lead the nation.\n\nMike: The worst part of the tariff ups and downs is it allows for crony capitalism where government picks winners and losers, where some businesses, like Apple, get exemptions but mom-and-pop stores do not have that strength and they’ll pay the price.\n\nA note to readers: Can Americans still have a sensible and friendly political discussion across the partisan divide? The answer is yes, and we prove it every week with this “Friendly Fire” conversation. \n\nMike and Julie are deeply engaged in politics and commercial advocacy in New Jersey, so both have connections to many players discussed in this column.

'She's got millions of followers on social media, she's young, attractive. she's packing arenas. We treat her like she's on idiot on the right but the left did the same thing to Donald Trump ... I think she's for-real.'\n\nIn response, Epstein boldly shot down the statement, stating: 'I don't. I disagree with that. I think she's got incredible appeal within the progressive bubble. \n\n'But I don't think she has broad appeal beyond that. I don't think she has appealed to the centrists of the party and certainly not a majority of the American electorate.'\n\nEpstein didn't stop there. He labeled the current Democratic Party brand as 'toxic' while claiming they are 'no longer responding to voters.'\n\nHe said: 'AOC highlights what I think is becoming the culture, which is it's becoming an OnlyFans type of culture.' \n\nOnlyFans is a platform used by more than three million people, where creators - usually sexual in nature - can provide exclusive content to paying customers. \n\nEpstein used the comparison to the raunchy site to show that he believes AOC has a 'narrow' fan base, rather than a mainstream electoral appeal. \n\nHe added: 'These politicians are interested in appealing increasingly to a narrow cast of online activists, donors, foundations, activists who will all exalt them as heroes within the progressive movement, all of whom depend on this identity grievance politics, but it doesn't have broad appeal.'\n\n'I think while she's very popular within progressive activist circles, I don't see the appeal being wider than that,' he concluded.\n\nThe clip made its rounds on X, formerly Twitter, with one user agreeing with Epstein claiming: 'Indeed, AOC is super appealing to the Blue Base, but beyond that she is toxic.' \n\nAnother user slammed the congresswoman, writing: 'Everything about her is fake.' \n\nOthers called out Epstein, saying: 'Per diem 'consultant ' running his mouth on right wing propaganda network.' \n\nThe scathing critique comes as polling guru Nate Silver predicted that Democrats will choose Ocasio-Cortez as their 2028 presidential nominee.\n\nSilver made the bold claim in a video for his Silver Bulletin Substack Wednesday alongside journalist Galen Druke, who actually brought up AOC as a viable contender first.\n\n'That was going to be my f***ing pick!' Silver exclaimed. 'We both are on the AOC bus.'\n\nSilver explained that he picked AOC 'because of some of the polling, because she has this kind of progressive lane, probably not to herself, because she is younger and media savvy.'\n\nHe pointed to polls that showed her leading Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer should she try to challenge him for his New York Senate seat.\n\nSilver said he thought this could mean that she has appeal beyond the progressive left as New York Democrats are actually 'a pretty moderate lot.'\n\n'I think there's a lot of points in her favor at this very moment,' Druke argued. 'In a Yale poll just out late week, AOC has the highest net favorability rating of any of the Democrats that they asked about.'\n\nOcasio-Cortez had a 62 percent positive rating among Democrats in the survey, with former Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, trailing her slightly.\n\nDruke noted that this means that AOC 'has broad appeal across the Democratic Party.'\n\n'She has very fervent support,' he added - something that could come in her favor should she announce a presidential run and get through a crowded primary field.\n\n'I think a lot of people are gonna run in 2028 and it's going to be a contest for attention and getting those sort of people who might be in your boat to turn out and stay with you through thick and thin, and I think that's Ocasio-Cortez,' Druke said.","summary":"Julian Epstein, former House Judiciary Committee Democratic chief counsel, unleashed the scathing remarks about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 's popularity.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14652653/democrat-strategist-aoc-popularity-onlyfans-julian-epstein.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/27/14/97750491-0-image-m-33_1745761947764.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 14:56:56","author":"Editor,Noa Halff","authors":["Editor","Noa Halff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":315360654,"title":"'Dark dangerous alley': Working class feels squeeze from Trump’s economic 'medicine'","text":"Some Donald Trump voters — and others who didn’t vote in 2024 — are feeling economic pain from the president’s policies, USA Today reports.\n Dixon, who did not vote in last year’s election, said they “felt this year was going to be a dramatic change for all the better.”\n \"But there's all this darkness that's already here and it's only April,” Dixon said.\n \"Even though the cost of living is going up, my paycheck isn't going up,” she added. “ I'm working as hard as I ever have been working but… We're blessed to have the jobs that we have, but a lot of places don't give raises.”\n \"To me, the economy feels like a dark dangerous alley, walking down with all of the little money you have in the world, hoping you don't get clubbed over the head,\" Aaron Washington told USA Today. \"If you are at the bottom, it's a lot harder to punch up right now.

He is also rewriting the Reagan Republican orthodoxy of free trade and strong international alliances. All of it is in service of fundamentally altering the role of government in American life and the U.S. place in the world.\nTo implement parts of his vision, he deployed the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, to dismantle the federal workforce, deciding only after the fact if the cuts had gone too far.\nTrump also has unilaterally declared the power to remake the post-World War II alliance with Europe that has largely maintained peace for nearly 80 years. The Republican president has made extraordinary emergency declarations to rewrite the rules of global trade, setting off panic in markets and capitals around the world. And he has ordered the removal of migrants to a prison in El Salvador without judicial review.\nWhat’s more, he has taken direct aim at law, media, public health and culture, attempting to bring all to heel, with some surprising success.\nMany of his actions were promised during his campaign but he put them in place with a blunt force aggressiveness.\nHere is a look at the most consequential first 100 days of an American presidency since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nTrump has tried to bend the U.S. economy to his will. But one force is unbowed: the financial markets.\nTrump says the outcome of his tariffs will eventually be “beautiful.” So far, it’s been an difficult three months with consumer confidence plummeting, stock markets convulsing and investors losing confidence in the credibility of Trump’s policies. It has become a time of anxiety instead of his promised golden age of prosperity.\nTrump has managed to reshape the economy through executive power, largely bypassing the Republican-controlled Congress. He has imposed hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, including on America’s two largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. Chinese goods are getting taxed at a combined 145%.\nThe trade penalties increased tensions with the European Union and sent Japan and South Korea rushing to negotiate. Despite clear evidence of American economic supremacy, Trump claimed that the U.S. has been ripped off by trade.\nThe president says his tariffs will create domestic factory jobs, cover the cost of an income tax cut plan that could exceed $5 trillion over 10 years, repay the $36 trillion national debt and also serve as leverage to renegotiate trade on terms favoring the United States. But his tariffs could reduce an average household’s disposable income by $4,900, according to The Budget Lab at Yale University.\nTrump has used his office to promote investment announcements that have yet to make much of an economic impact. Trump talked up a $500 billion investment in artificial intelligence by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. He invited Hyundai executives to the White House for the announcement of a new steel mill in Louisiana. But factory construction slipped in February and outside forecasters have increased the likelihood of a recession this year\nHe has rewarded the coal and oil sectors by attacking alternative energy, yet his tariffs pushed up the price of the steel and other materials that the energy industry needs to build out production.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said Trump will take full ownership of the economy in the final three months of this year, when the administration policies are fully in place.\n— By Josh Boak\nTrump promised to take on what he called waste, fraud and abuse in government. He tapped Musk to lead the effort.\nMusk turned his plan for a Department of Government Efficiency into one of the most polarizing and consequential pieces of Trump’s first 100 days.\nThe billionaire entrepreneur approached the task with a tech mogul ethos: break things, then see what you want to fix. Firings were widespread and indiscriminate. Programs were eliminated with limited analysis. The human consequences were left for others to sort out.\nMusk’s team accessed sensitive databases and burrowed into little-known departments responsible for managing the government workforce and federal properties.\nRepublicans have long dreamed about scaling back the bureaucracy. But even veterans of Washington’s budget battles were stunned by the speed and ferocity of Musk’s work.\nDOGE also made mistakes. Claims of massive savings did not add up. Musk wildly inflated estimates of how much taxpayer money is lost to fraud. His broadsides against Social Security, which he described as a “Ponzi scheme,” rattled retirees.\nIt is unlikely that Musk will accomplish his grand-scale goals. His plans for slashing $1 trillion out of the budget were pared back to $150 billion.\nTrump and Musk lavish praise on each other. But Musk’s time in the administration is limited and Trump has begun talking about Musk’s work in the past tense.\n“This guy did a fantastic job,” Trump said during a recent Cabinet meeting.\n— By Chris Megerian\nCracking down on illegal immigration was the anthem of Trump’s campaign, and it is the issue where he has the greatest support.\nHe has followed through by implementing some of the hardest-line immigration policies in the nation’s history, even as the promised mass deportations have yet to materialize.\nTrump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants with limited due process, then used it to send hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador in defiance of a court order.\nHis administration has balked at the Supreme Court’s order, issued with no noted dissents, that it must work to return Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia after he was wrongly deported to El Salvador.\nTrump sent troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily deported migrants using military flights. He declared gangs foreign terrorist organizations and barred migrants arriving at the southern border from seeking asylum in the United States. Officials converted a Biden-era app known as CBP One, which about 900,000 people had used to schedule appointments to legally enter the U.S., into a mechanism for urging migrants to self-deport.\nThe administration pledged to end birthright citizenship for people who were born in the U.S., while proposing “gold cards” that would allow foreigners to buy American citizenship for $5 million.\nOfficials have sought to expel migrants from many countries who had been given temporary legal status, and they canceled the Social Security numbers that some had been legally issued by moving them to lists of dead people.\nBefore El Salvador, the Trump administration sent migrants to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, while also requiring Canadians to register when crossing into the U.S. Officials pressured the IRS to surrender sensitive data for hundreds of thousands of people who are in the U.S. illegally, which could make it easier to find them.\nIllegal border crossings dropped precipitously. In March, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement said 7,181 people were apprehended nationwide between border crossings — a 14% decrease from February and a 95% drop from March 2024.\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that 46% of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, while about half say he has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\nThe administration is nonetheless considering evoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows the president to deploy the military on U.S. soil, including to help detain migrants. —By Will Weissert\nTrump entered office pledging to bring “retribution” for his supporters.\nHe made good on that on his first day and virtually every week since, with actions taking aim at the prosecutors who investigated him and the law firms that employed them. He went after former officials who criticized him or asserted, correctly, that he had lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden.\nTrump ordered the suspension of the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed onto a letter during the 2020 campaign stating that the saga of Biden’s son Hunter’s laptop bore the hallmarks of a Russian influence campaign.\nTrump’s Justice Department fired the prosecutors who investigated him as part of special counsel Jack Smith’s team and demanded the names of FBI agents who participated in investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\nExecutive orders targeted some of the country’s elite law firms, in some cases because they employ or once employed prosecutors who investigated Trump. Those orders have sought to punish the firms by stripping the security clearances of their attorneys, barring them from federal buildings and terminating federal contracts.\nSome firms have successfully sued to halt enforcement of key provisions of the orders, but even more have cut deals with the White House, agreeing to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal services to causes championed by Trump.\nThe nation’s top universities have not been spared, either.\nThe administration pulled $400 million in research grants and other funding for Columbia University over the school’s handling of protests against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza; Columbia agreed to changes demanded by the Trump team.\nSome $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania was suspended over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.\nHarvard, which has $9 billion in government funding at stake, refused to comply with Trump’s demands. The administration responded by freezing grants and opening an inquiry about the university’s tax exempt status.\nThe president has singled out individuals, too. Presidential memos call for scrutiny of Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official from the first Trump administration who has become a rump critic, and Chris Krebs, a former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency who angered Trump after he declared the 2020 election to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate.\nOn Thursday, Trump extended his reach to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform. He instructed the Justice Department to conduct an investigation. — By Eric Tucker\nTrump has consistently said he would follow an order from federal judges. But that has not stopped talk of a possible constitutional crisis over defying the courts.\nHis executive orders reshaping the federal government are facing more than 150 lawsuits on issues from fired federal workers and immigration to transgender rights.\nJudges have ruled against the administration dozens of times, blocking parts of his agenda for now. The administration has argued that individual judges should not be able to issue nationwide injunctions.\nTrump issued an extraordinary call for the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against him the case of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members. That prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who did not mention the president by name but said impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreements over court decisions.\nThe administration has also pushed back in court, quickly appealing multiple orders to the conservative-majority Supreme Court.\nTrump so far has a mixed record at the Supreme Court in a flurry of emergency appeals. The justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration. They also have rejected Trump’s broad arguments in several cases, including the one involving the Venezuelans and another in the Abrego Garcia case.\n— By Lindsay Whitehurst\nTrump has rejected the post-World War II order that has formed the basis for global stability and security.\nHe has rejected long-standing alliances and hinted at scaling back the U.S. troop presence in Europe. Longtime allies such as Germany and France have suggested they no longer can depend on Washington.\nTrump also pledged a swift end to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, so far to little effect.\nHe set a new standard for hosting a leader of another country when he openly chided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump has repeatedly, and inaccurately, said Ukraine started the war; it began when Russia invaded in February 2022.\nHis actions have led allies in Europe, along with Canada, Japan and South Korea, to question their reliance on the U.S. and whether commitments that have long endured apply no more.\nTrump has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make dramatic cuts of people and programs at the State Department. Rubio has complied and said some in the department have followed a “radical” ideology.\nThe president has upended other multilateral organizations. He immediately withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization, canceling participation in the Paris Climate accord on global warming and took action against the International Criminal Court.\nHe has effectively shuttered the United States Agency for International Development, long seen as an example of an effective tool to provide humanitarian aid and to build goodwill, even though some programs were beset by corruption.\nAt the same time, he has repeatedly called for the U.S. to annex Greenland, which is a Danish territory, to retake control of the Panama Canal and to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.\n— By Matthew Lee\nCongress is proving to be almost no match for this White House.\nTrump is testing, challenging and even bullying the Congress in unparalleled ways -– slashing government agencies, deporting legal migrants, investigating perceived enemies and churning the economy — and all but daring lawmakers to object.\nWith unified Republican control of the White House and Congress, the GOP has a rare opportunity to muscle through an ambitious partisan agenda.\nBut Trump has shown he does not necessarily want or need Congress to accomplish his goals.\nThe president has issued almost 10 times as many executive orders as the first five presidents combined, bypassing Congress. DOGE is slashing programs, jobs and entire agencies, including the Department of Education, that by law receive funding under the purview of Congress, which holds the power under the Constitution to allocate money to the agencies.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., the second in the line of presidential succession, portrays himself as the “quarterback” for the “coach” – Trump — who is calling the plays. In the Senate, Republican senators confirmed some of his more contentious nominees over nominal objections.\nDemocrats are warning of the creep of authoritarianism into American. democracy. “Our Founding Fathers were very aware that a strong executive could essentially crowd out democracy and become an autocrat,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\nBehind the scenes, many Republicans are trying to push back, for local imperatives such as agriculture and trade, but so far, most are acquiescing to the president.\n— By Lisa Mascaro\nFor the past three months the Pentagon has been rocked by the removals of top military leadership, including its only female four-star officers, its Joint Chiefs chairman — a Black general — and its top military lawyers.\nThe defense chief, Pete Hegseth, has been floundering in controversy.\nHe was a key participant in the Signal chat set up by national security adviser Mike Waltz, sending details of sensitive military operations over the nonsecure channel. Hegseth also used a second Signal chat to send similar information to a group that included his wife and brother. That was followed by the purge of his top staff: He removed or shifted at least five of them, including three whom he said were under investigation for leaks.\nTrump has said the military had gone “woke” and he acted swiftly to reverse long-standing policies.\nHe issued an executive order to remove transgender service members, which has been stalled by the courts. Hegseth ordered the military to eliminate any programming, books or imagery that celebrates diversity.\nMore change is coming.\nHegseth, long an opponent of women in front-line combat jobs, has ordered a broad review of military standards to ensure they are the same for women and men. Tens of thousands of career defense civilians are set to either voluntarily depart the agency or be pushed out through a reduction in force.\nThe internal changes come as the military is reshaping for a potential future China fight, and just as it is potentially about to receive an infusion of funds as Trump weighs an almost $1 trillion budget for the department.\nSocial media posts that celebrated military women or cultural diversity are gone. Instead the services are publicly promoting increases in enlistments, even though the latest totals reflect new recruiting programs and improvements that began long before Trump was elected.\nThe military has dedicated significant resources to Trump’s broader order to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. He has transferred control of a thin strip of land along the border to the Defense Department so troops can arrest migrants for trespassing on military land.\n—By Tara Copp and Lolita C. Baldor\nAt the Department of Health and Human Services, 10,000 jobs are gone. Billions of dollars in research sent to scientists and universities was shut off. Public meetings to discuss flu shots and other vaccines have been canceled.\nFluoride in drinking water may be the next to go, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nKennedy has done a blitz of his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign at day cares, schools and health centers around the country where he has promised to work with Trump’s other agency leaders to prohibit soda from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, limit dyes in the food supply and call for fluoride to be removed from drinking water.\nKennedy’s resistance to launching a vaccination campaign as a growing measles outbreak has worsened, so far infecting hundreds and leaving two young children dead, has elicited concerns from doctors, public health experts and lawmakers.\nThose worries deepened after he eliminated thousands of jobs across the nation’s public health agencies, including at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. The move, department officials projected, will save taxpayers $1.8 billion.\nBut some have escaped steep cuts. Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced an unusually steep rate increase for private health insurers that provide plans for older Americans through Medicare Advantage.\nIt will cost an extra $25 billion.\n— By Amanda Seitz\nTrump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.\nHe created a National Energy Dominance Council, led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and remove regulatory barriers that may slow that down.\nTrump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, but he has moved even more aggressively in his second term to roll back major environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, motor vehicles and manufacturers.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations, including a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change. Zeldin’s plan would rewrite the EPA’s 2009 finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the legal underpinning for a host of climate regulations.\nZeldin says the changes, including more than 30 announced on a single day last month, will drive a dagger through the heart of what he calls “climate-change religion.”\nEnvironmentalists and climate scientists call the so-called endangerment finding a bedrock of U.S. law and that any attempt to undo it has little chance to succeed.\nWhile Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind, he has tried to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal, granting nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene.\nEnvironmental groups and public health advocates say the plan could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health.\n— By Matthew Daly\nDana Gioia, a poet and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, liked to say that a key to maintaining support for the NEA and other federal organizations was ensuring they backed projects in as many congressional districts as possible.\nIt was a bipartisan formula that lasted for some 60 years, through Democratic and Republican administrations, until Trump’s second term.\nSince returning to office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding that artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others in the cultural community had long counted on. Acting without congressional authorization, he has declared that institutions ranging from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to the National Endowment for the Humanities have become fronts for a “woke” agenda that threatens to undermine what he calls “our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.”\nThe organizations he has attacked mostly date from the mid-1960s, at the peak of President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” domestic programs, when public support for government was high and the elevation of the arts a national priority.

He is also rewriting the Reagan Republican orthodoxy of free trade and strong international alliances. All of it is in service of fundamentally altering the role of government in American life and the U.S. place in the world.\n\nTo implement parts of his vision, he deployed the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, to dismantle the federal workforce, deciding only after the fact if the cuts had gone too far.\n\nTrump also has unilaterally declared the power to remake the post-World War II alliance with Europe that has largely maintained peace for nearly 80 years. The Republican president has made extraordinary emergency declarations to rewrite the rules of global trade, setting off panic in markets and capitals around the world. And he has ordered the removal of migrants to a prison in El Salvador without judicial review.\n\nWhat’s more, he has taken direct aim at law, media, public health and culture, attempting to bring all to heel, with some surprising success.\n\nMany of his actions were promised during his campaign but he put them in place with a blunt force aggressiveness.\n\nHere is a look at the most consequential first 100 days of an American presidency since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nTrump has tried to bend the U.S. economy to his will. But one force is unbowed: the financial markets.\n\nTrump says the outcome of his tariffs will eventually be “beautiful.” So far, it’s been an difficult three months with consumer confidence plummeting, stock markets convulsing and investors losing confidence in the credibility of Trump’s policies. It has become a time of anxiety instead of his promised golden age of prosperity.\n\nTrump has managed to reshape the economy through executive power, largely bypassing the Republican-controlled Congress. He has imposed hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, including on America’s two largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. Chinese goods are getting taxed at a combined 145%.\n\nThe trade penalties increased tensions with the European Union and sent Japan and South Korea rushing to negotiate. Despite clear evidence of American economic supremacy, Trump claimed that the U.S. has been ripped off by trade.\n\nThe president says his tariffs will create domestic factory jobs, cover the cost of an income tax cut plan that could exceed $5 trillion over 10 years, repay the $36 trillion national debt and also serve as leverage to renegotiate trade on terms favoring the United States. But his tariffs could reduce an average household’s disposable income by $4,900, according to The Budget Lab at Yale University.\n\nTrump has used his office to promote investment announcements that have yet to make much of an economic impact. Trump talked up a $500 billion investment in artificial intelligence by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. He invited Hyundai executives to the White House for the announcement of a new steel mill in Louisiana. But factory construction slipped in February and outside forecasters have increased the likelihood of a recession this year\n\nHe has rewarded the coal and oil sectors by attacking alternative energy, yet his tariffs pushed up the price of the steel and other materials that the energy industry needs to build out production.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said Trump will take full ownership of the economy in the final three months of this year, when the administration policies are fully in place.\n\n— By Josh Boak\n\nTrump promised to take on what he called waste, fraud and abuse in government. He tapped Musk to lead the effort.\n\nMusk turned his plan for a Department of Government Efficiency into one of the most polarizing and consequential pieces of Trump’s first 100 days.\n\nThe billionaire entrepreneur approached the task with a tech mogul ethos: break things, then see what you want to fix. Firings were widespread and indiscriminate. Programs were eliminated with limited analysis. The human consequences were left for others to sort out.\n\nMusk’s team accessed sensitive databases and burrowed into little-known departments responsible for managing the government workforce and federal properties.\n\nRepublicans have long dreamed about scaling back the bureaucracy. But even veterans of Washington’s budget battles were stunned by the speed and ferocity of Musk’s work.\n\nDOGE also made mistakes. Claims of massive savings did not add up. Musk wildly inflated estimates of how much taxpayer money is lost to fraud. His broadsides against Social Security, which he described as a “Ponzi scheme,” rattled retirees.\n\nIt is unlikely that Musk will accomplish his grand-scale goals. His plans for slashing $1 trillion out of the budget were pared back to $150 billion.\n\nTrump and Musk lavish praise on each other. But Musk’s time in the administration is limited and Trump has begun talking about Musk’s work in the past tense.\n\n“This guy did a fantastic job,” Trump said during a recent Cabinet meeting.\n\n— By Chris Megerian\n\nImmigration\n\nCracking down on illegal immigration was the anthem of Trump’s campaign, and it is the issue where he has the greatest support.\n\nHe has followed through by implementing some of the hardest-line immigration policies in the nation’s history, even as the promised mass deportations have yet to materialize.\n\nTrump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants with limited due process, then used it to send hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador in defiance of a court order.\n\nHis administration has balked at the Supreme Court’s order, issued with no noted dissents, that it must work to return Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia after he was wrongly deported to El Salvador.\n\nTrump sent troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily deported migrants using military flights. He declared gangs foreign terrorist organizations and barred migrants arriving at the southern border from seeking asylum in the United States. Officials converted a Biden-era app known as CBP One, which about 900,000 people had used to schedule appointments to legally enter the U.S., into a mechanism for urging migrants to self-deport.\n\nThe administration pledged to end birthright citizenship for people who were born in the U.S., while proposing “gold cards” that would allow foreigners to buy American citizenship for $5 million.\n\nOfficials have sought to expel migrants from many countries who had been given temporary legal status, and they canceled the Social Security numbers that some had been legally issued by moving them to lists of dead people.\n\nBefore El Salvador, the Trump administration sent migrants to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, while also requiring Canadians to register when crossing into the U.S. Officials pressured the IRS to surrender sensitive data for hundreds of thousands of people who are in the U.S. illegally, which could make it easier to find them.\n\nIllegal border crossings dropped precipitously. In March, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement said 7,181 people were apprehended nationwide between border crossings — a 14% decrease from February and a 95% drop from March 2024.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that 46% of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, while about half say he has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThe administration is nonetheless considering evoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows the president to deploy the military on U.S. soil, including to help detain migrants. —By Will Weissert\n\nRetribution\n\nTrump entered office pledging to bring “retribution” for his supporters.\n\nHe made good on that on his first day and virtually every week since, with actions taking aim at the prosecutors who investigated him and the law firms that employed them. He went after former officials who criticized him or asserted, correctly, that he had lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump ordered the suspension of the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed onto a letter during the 2020 campaign stating that the saga of Biden’s son Hunter’s laptop bore the hallmarks of a Russian influence campaign.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department fired the prosecutors who investigated him as part of special counsel Jack Smith’s team and demanded the names of FBI agents who participated in investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nExecutive orders targeted some of the country’s elite law firms, in some cases because they employ or once employed prosecutors who investigated Trump. Those orders have sought to punish the firms by stripping the security clearances of their attorneys, barring them from federal buildings and terminating federal contracts.\n\nSome firms have successfully sued to halt enforcement of key provisions of the orders, but even more have cut deals with the White House, agreeing to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal services to causes championed by Trump.\n\nThe nation’s top universities have not been spared, either.\n\nThe administration pulled $400 million in research grants and other funding for Columbia University over the school’s handling of protests against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza; Columbia agreed to changes demanded by the Trump team.\n\nSome $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania was suspended over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.\n\nHarvard, which has $9 billion in government funding at stake, refused to comply with Trump’s demands. The administration responded by freezing grants and opening an inquiry about the university’s tax exempt status.\n\nThe president has singled out individuals, too. Presidential memos call for scrutiny of Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official from the first Trump administration who has become a rump critic, and Chris Krebs, a former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency who angered Trump after he declared the 2020 election to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump extended his reach to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform. He instructed the Justice Department to conduct an investigation. — By Eric Tucker\n\nCourts, judges and the rule of law\n\nTrump has consistently said he would follow an order from federal judges. But that has not stopped talk of a possible constitutional crisis over defying the courts.\n\nHis executive orders reshaping the federal government are facing more than 150 lawsuits on issues from fired federal workers and immigration to transgender rights.\n\nJudges have ruled against the administration dozens of times, blocking parts of his agenda for now. The administration has argued that individual judges should not be able to issue nationwide injunctions.\n\nTrump issued an extraordinary call for the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against him the case of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members. That prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who did not mention the president by name but said impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreements over court decisions.\n\nThe administration has also pushed back in court, quickly appealing multiple orders to the conservative-majority Supreme Court.\n\nTrump so far has a mixed record at the Supreme Court in a flurry of emergency appeals. The justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration. They also have rejected Trump’s broad arguments in several cases, including the one involving the Venezuelans and another in the Abrego Garcia case.\n\n— By Lindsay Whitehurst\n\nDiplomacy and international relations\n\nTrump has rejected the post-World War II order that has formed the basis for global stability and security.\n\nHe has rejected long-standing alliances and hinted at scaling back the U.S. troop presence in Europe. Longtime allies such as Germany and France have suggested they no longer can depend on Washington.\n\nTrump also pledged a swift end to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, so far to little effect.\n\nHe set a new standard for hosting a leader of another country when he openly chided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump has repeatedly, and inaccurately, said Ukraine started the war; it began when Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\nHis actions have led allies in Europe, along with Canada, Japan and South Korea, to question their reliance on the U.S. and whether commitments that have long endured apply no more.\n\nTrump has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make dramatic cuts of people and programs at the State Department. Rubio has complied and said some in the department have followed a “radical” ideology.\n\nThe president has upended other multilateral organizations. He immediately withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization, canceling participation in the Paris Climate accord on global warming and took action against the International Criminal Court.\n\nHe has effectively shuttered the United States Agency for International Development, long seen as an example of an effective tool to provide humanitarian aid and to build goodwill, even though some programs were beset by corruption.\n\nAt the same time, he has repeatedly called for the U.S. to annex Greenland, which is a Danish territory, to retake control of the Panama Canal and to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.\n\n— By Matthew Lee\n\nCongress is proving to be almost no match for this White House.\n\nTrump is testing, challenging and even bullying the Congress in unparalleled ways -– slashing government agencies, deporting legal migrants, investigating perceived enemies and churning the economy — and all but daring lawmakers to object.\n\nWith unified Republican control of the White House and Congress, the GOP has a rare opportunity to muscle through an ambitious partisan agenda.\n\nBut Trump has shown he does not necessarily want or need Congress to accomplish his goals.\n\nThe president has issued almost 10 times as many executive orders as the first five presidents combined, bypassing Congress. DOGE is slashing programs, jobs and entire agencies, including the Department of Education, that by law receive funding under the purview of Congress, which holds the power under the Constitution to allocate money to the agencies.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., the second in the line of presidential succession, portrays himself as the “quarterback” for the “coach” – Trump — who is calling the plays. In the Senate, Republican senators confirmed some of his more contentious nominees over nominal objections.\n\nDemocrats are warning of the creep of authoritarianism into American. democracy. “Our Founding Fathers were very aware that a strong executive could essentially crowd out democracy and become an autocrat,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\n\nBehind the scenes, many Republicans are trying to push back, for local imperatives such as agriculture and trade, but so far, most are acquiescing to the president.\n\n— By Lisa Mascaro\n\nFor the past three months the Pentagon has been rocked by the removals of top military leadership, including its only female four-star officers, its Joint Chiefs chairman — a Black general — and its top military lawyers.\n\nThe defense chief, Pete Hegseth, has been floundering in controversy.\n\nHe was a key participant in the Signal chat set up by national security adviser Mike Waltz, sending details of sensitive military operations over the nonsecure channel. Hegseth also used a second Signal chat to send similar information to a group that included his wife and brother. That was followed by the purge of his top staff: He removed or shifted at least five of them, including three whom he said were under investigation for leaks.\n\nTrump has said the military had gone “woke” and he acted swiftly to reverse long-standing policies.\n\nHe issued an executive order to remove transgender service members, which has been stalled by the courts. Hegseth ordered the military to eliminate any programming, books or imagery that celebrates diversity.\n\nMore change is coming.\n\nHegseth, long an opponent of women in front-line combat jobs, has ordered a broad review of military standards to ensure they are the same for women and men. Tens of thousands of career defense civilians are set to either voluntarily depart the agency or be pushed out through a reduction in force.\n\nThe internal changes come as the military is reshaping for a potential future China fight, and just as it is potentially about to receive an infusion of funds as Trump weighs an almost $1 trillion budget for the department.\n\nSocial media posts that celebrated military women or cultural diversity are gone. Instead the services are publicly promoting increases in enlistments, even though the latest totals reflect new recruiting programs and improvements that began long before Trump was elected.\n\nThe military has dedicated significant resources to Trump’s broader order to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. He has transferred control of a thin strip of land along the border to the Defense Department so troops can arrest migrants for trespassing on military land.\n\n—By Tara Copp and Lolita C. Baldor\n\nPublic health\n\nAt the Department of Health and Human Services, 10,000 jobs are gone. Billions of dollars in research sent to scientists and universities was shut off. Public meetings to discuss flu shots and other vaccines have been canceled.\n\nFluoride in drinking water may be the next to go, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nKennedy has done a blitz of his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign at day cares, schools and health centers around the country where he has promised to work with Trump’s other agency leaders to prohibit soda from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, limit dyes in the food supply and call for fluoride to be removed from drinking water.\n\nKennedy’s resistance to launching a vaccination campaign as a growing measles outbreak has worsened, so far infecting hundreds and leaving two young children dead, has elicited concerns from doctors, public health experts and lawmakers.\n\nThose worries deepened after he eliminated thousands of jobs across the nation’s public health agencies, including at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. The move, department officials projected, will save taxpayers $1.8 billion.\n\nBut some have escaped steep cuts. Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced an unusually steep rate increase for private health insurers that provide plans for older Americans through Medicare Advantage.\n\nIt will cost an extra $25 billion.\n\n— By Amanda Seitz\n\nEnergy and environment\n\nTrump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.\n\nHe created a National Energy Dominance Council, led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and remove regulatory barriers that may slow that down.\n\nTrump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, but he has moved even more aggressively in his second term to roll back major environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, motor vehicles and manufacturers.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations, including a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change. Zeldin’s plan would rewrite the EPA’s 2009 finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the legal underpinning for a host of climate regulations.\n\nZeldin says the changes, including more than 30 announced on a single day last month, will drive a dagger through the heart of what he calls “climate-change religion.”\n\nEnvironmentalists and climate scientists call the so-called endangerment finding a bedrock of U.S. law and that any attempt to undo it has little chance to succeed.\n\nWhile Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind, he has tried to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal, granting nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene.\n\nEnvironmental groups and public health advocates say the plan could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health.\n\n— By Matthew Daly\n\nArts and culture\n\nDana Gioia, a poet and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, liked to say that a key to maintaining support for the NEA and other federal organizations was ensuring they backed projects in as many congressional districts as possible.\n\nIt was a bipartisan formula that lasted for some 60 years, through Democratic and Republican administrations, until Trump’s second term.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding that artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others in the cultural community had long counted on. Acting without congressional authorization, he has declared that institutions ranging from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to the National Endowment for the Humanities have become fronts for a “woke” agenda that threatens to undermine what he calls “our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.”\n\nThe organizations he has attacked mostly date from the mid-1960s, at the peak of President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” domestic programs, when public support for government was high and the elevation of the arts a national priority. The Kennedy Center, the NEA, the NEH and the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences all were established with broad backing from the two parties.\n\nThe humanities “are the languages, religions, laws, philosophies, and customs that make us distinct,” reads a statement on the NEH website. “They are our history and our cultures, the ideas and movements that have shaped societies throughout time.”\n\nThe NEH and others also cite practical benefits; arts and culture are good for economy.\n\nThe NEH homepage includes a headline stating that the endowment “supports the humanities in every state and U.S. jurisdiction.” The NEA’s website highlights a recent government study showing that the arts added $1.2 trillion to the economy in 2023 and, at a time when Trump has placed steep tariffs on countries worldwide, notes that “the total value of the nation’s arts exports was nearly $37 billion greater than the value of arts imports from other countries.”\n\n—By Hillel Italie\n\nMany journalists figured a second Trump term would be a challenge for their industry. Few recognized how much.\n\nThe new administration has aggressively, even innovatively, waged combat against the press since taking office. It has fought against CBS News and The Associated Press in court, sought to dismantle the government-run Voice of America and sent the Federal Communications Commission after perceived media rivals.\n\nThe White House has established rapid-response social media feeds that maintain a constant flow of rejoinders to “hold the fake news accountable.”\n\n“The Trump administration is on a campaign to do everything it can to diminish and obstruct journalism in the United States,” said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor.\n\nThe future of Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and similar services that for generations have delivered unbiased news to countries where it is in short supply is being haggled over in court.\n\nTrump sued CBS News because he believed “60 Minutes” edited a segment last fall to the advantage of election opponent Kamala Harris. It remains hanging over the network’s head, although the newsmagazine has produced several hard-hitting segments on the administration over the first 100 days, provoking Trump into an angry social media response on April 13.\n\nTrump’s FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, is investigating CBS News, too, along with ABC News, NBC News, NPR, PBS, Comcast and, most recently, the Walt Disney Co., the latter for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\nThe AP sued the administration after it reduced the outlet’s access to presidential events for not following Trump’s lead in renaming the Gulf of Mexico, winning a court ruling that the government could not punish the organization for free speech.

He is also rewriting the Reagan Republican orthodoxy of free trade and strong international alliances. All of it is in service of fundamentally altering the role of government in American life and the U.S. place in the world.\n\nTo implement parts of his vision, he deployed the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, to dismantle the federal workforce, deciding only after the fact if the cuts had gone too far.\n\nTrump also has unilaterally declared the power to remake the post-World War II alliance with Europe that has largely maintained peace for nearly 80 years. The Republican president has made extraordinary emergency declarations to rewrite the rules of global trade, setting off panic in markets and capitals around the world. And he has ordered the removal of immigrants to a prison in El Salvador without judicial review.\n\nWhat’s more, he has taken direct aim at law, media, public health and culture, attempting to bring all to heel, with some surprising success.\n\nMany of his actions were promised during his campaign but he put them in place with a blunt force aggressiveness.\n\nHere is a look at the most consequential first 100 days of an American presidency since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nTrump has tried to bend the U.S. economy to his will. But one force is unbowed: the financial markets.\n\nTrump says the outcome of his tariffs will eventually be “beautiful.” So far, it’s been an difficult three months with consumer confidence plummeting, stock markets convulsing and investors losing confidence in the credibility of Trump’s policies. It has become a time of anxiety instead of his promised golden age of prosperity.\n\nTrump has managed to reshape the economy through executive power, largely bypassing the Republican-controlled Congress. He has imposed hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, including on America’s two largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. Chinese goods are getting taxed at a combined 145%.\n\nThe trade penalties increased tensions with the European Union and sent Japan and South Korea rushing to negotiate. Despite clear evidence of American economic supremacy, Trump claimed that the U.S. has been ripped off by trade.\n\nThe president says his tariffs will create domestic factory jobs, cover the cost of an income tax cut plan that could exceed $5 trillion over 10 years, repay the $36 trillion national debt and also serve as leverage to renegotiate trade on terms favoring the United States. But his tariffs could reduce an average household’s disposable income by $4,900, according to The Budget Lab at Yale University.\n\nTrump has used his office to promote investment announcements that have yet to make much of an economic impact. Trump talked up a $500 billion investment in artificial intelligence by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. He invited Hyundai executives to the White House for the announcement of a new steel mill in Louisiana. But factory construction slipped in February and outside forecasters have increased the likelihood of a recession this year\n\nHe has rewarded the coal and oil sectors by attacking alternative energy, yet his tariffs pushed up the price of the steel and other materials that the energy industry needs to build out production.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said Trump will take full ownership of the economy in the final three months of this year, when the administration policies are fully in place.\n\n— By Josh Boak\n\nTrump promised to take on what he called waste, fraud and abuse in government. He tapped Musk to lead the effort.\n\nMusk turned his plan for a Department of Government Efficiency into one of the most polarizing and consequential pieces of Trump’s first 100 days.\n\nThe billionaire entrepreneur approached the task with a tech mogul ethos: break things, then see what you want to fix. Firings were widespread and indiscriminate. Programs were eliminated with limited analysis. The human consequences were left for others to sort out.\n\nMusk’s team accessed sensitive databases and burrowed into little-known departments responsible for managing the government workforce and federal properties.\n\nRepublicans have long dreamed about scaling back the bureaucracy. But even veterans of Washington’s budget battles were stunned by the speed and ferocity of Musk’s work.\n\nDOGE also made mistakes. Claims of massive savings did not add up. Musk wildly inflated estimates of how much taxpayer money is lost to fraud. His broadsides against Social Security, which he described as a “Ponzi scheme,” rattled retirees.\n\nIt is unlikely that Musk will accomplish his grand-scale goals. His plans for slashing $1 trillion out of the budget were pared back to $150 billion.\n\nTrump and Musk lavish praise on each other. But Musk’s time in the administration is limited and Trump has begun talking about Musk’s work in the past tense.\n\n“This guy did a fantastic job,” Trump said during a recent Cabinet meeting.\n\n— By Chris Megerian\n\nImmigration\n\nCracking down on illegal immigration was the anthem of Trump’s campaign, and it is the issue where he has the greatest support.\n\nHe has followed through by implementing some of the hardest-line immigration policies in the nation’s history, even as the promised mass deportations have yet to materialize.\n\nTrump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants with limited due process, then used it to send hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a mega-prison in El Salvador in defiance of a court order.\n\nHis administration has balked at the Supreme Court’s order, issued with no noted dissents, that it must work to return Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia after he was wrongly deported to El Salvador.\n\nTrump sent troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily deported immigrants using military flights. He declared gangs foreign terrorist organizations and barred migrants arriving at the southern border from seeking asylum in the United States. Officials converted a Biden-era app known as CBP One, which about 900,000 people had used to schedule appointments to legally enter the U.S., into a mechanism for urging immigrants to self-deport.\n\nThe administration pledged to end birthright citizenship for people who were born in the U.S., while proposing “gold cards” that would allow foreigners to buy American citizenship for $5 million.\n\nOfficials have sought to expel immigrants from many countries who had been given temporary legal status, and they canceled the Social Security numbers that some had been legally issued by moving them to lists of dead people.\n\nBefore El Salvador, the Trump administration sent immigrants to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, while also requiring Canadians to register when crossing into the U.S. Officials pressured the IRS to surrender sensitive data for hundreds of thousands of people who are in the U.S. illegally, which could make it easier to find them.\n\nIllegal border crossings dropped precipitously. In March, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement said 7,181 people were apprehended nationwide between border crossings — a 14% decrease from February and a 95% drop from March 2024.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that 46% of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, while about half say he has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThe administration is nonetheless considering evoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows the president to deploy the military on U.S. soil, including to help detain immigrants. –By Will Weissert\n\nRetribution\n\nTrump entered office pledging to bring “retribution” for his supporters.\n\nHe made good on that on his first day and virtually every week since, with actions taking aim at the prosecutors who investigated him and the law firms that employed them. He went after former officials who criticized him or asserted, correctly, that he had lost the 2020 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump ordered the suspension of the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed onto a letter during the 2020 campaign stating that the saga of Biden’s son Hunter’s laptop bore the hallmarks of a Russian influence campaign.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department fired the prosecutors who investigated him as part of special counsel Jack Smith’s team and demanded the names of FBI agents who participated in investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nExecutive orders targeted some of the country’s elite law firms, in some cases because they employ or once employed prosecutors who investigated Trump. Those orders have sought to punish the firms by stripping the security clearances of their attorneys, barring them from federal buildings and terminating federal contracts.\n\nSome firms have successfully sued to halt enforcement of key provisions of the orders, but even more have cut deals with the White House, agreeing to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in free legal services to causes championed by Trump.\n\nThe nation’s top universities have not been spared, either.\n\nThe administration pulled $400 million in research grants and other funding for Columbia University over the school’s handling of protests against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza; Columbia agreed to changes demanded by the Trump team.\n\nSome $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania was suspended over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.\n\nHarvard, which has $9 billion in government funding at stake, refused to comply with Trump’s demands. The administration responded by freezing grants and opening an inquiry about the university’s tax exempt status.\n\nThe president has singled out individuals, too. Presidential memos call for scrutiny of Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official from the first Trump administration who has become a rump critic, and Chris Krebs, a former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency who angered Trump after he declared the 2020 election to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump extended his reach to ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform. He instructed the Justice Department to conduct an investigation. — By Eric Tucker\n\nCourts, judges and the rule of law\n\nTrump has consistently said he would follow an order from federal judges. But that has not stopped talk of a possible constitutional crisis over defying the courts.\n\nHis executive orders reshaping the federal government are facing more than 150 lawsuits on issues from fired federal workers and immigration to transgender rights.\n\nJudges have ruled against the administration dozens of times, blocking parts of his agenda for now. The administration has argued that individual judges should not be able to issue nationwide injunctions.\n\nTrump issued an extraordinary call for the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against him the case of Venezuelan immigrants accused of being gang members. That prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who did not mention the president by name but said impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreements over court decisions.\n\nThe administration has also pushed back in court, quickly appealing multiple orders to the conservative-majority Supreme Court.\n\nTrump so far has a mixed record at the Supreme Court in a flurry of emergency appeals. The justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration. They also have rejected Trump’s broad arguments in several cases, including the one involving the Venezuelans and another in the Abrego Garcia case.\n\n— By Lindsay Whitehurst\n\nDiplomacy and international relations\n\nTrump has rejected the post-World War II order that has formed the basis for global stability and security.\n\nHe has rejected long-standing alliances and hinted at scaling back the U.S. troop presence in Europe. Longtime allies such as Germany and France have suggested they no longer can depend on Washington.\n\nTrump also pledged a swift end to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, so far to little effect.\n\nHe set a new standard for hosting a leader of another country when he openly chided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump has repeatedly, and inaccurately, said Ukraine started the war; it began when Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\nHis actions have led allies in Europe, along with Canada, Japan and South Korea, to question their reliance on the U.S. and whether commitments that have long endured apply no more.\n\nTrump has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make dramatic cuts of people and programs at the State Department. Rubio has complied and said some in the department have followed a “radical” ideology.\n\nThe president has upended other multilateral organizations. He immediately withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization, canceling participation in the Paris Climate accord on global warming and took action against the International Criminal Court.\n\nHe has effectively shuttered the United States Agency for International Development, long seen as an example of an effective tool to provide humanitarian aid and to build goodwill, even though some programs were beset by corruption.\n\nAt the same time, he has repeatedly called for the U.S. to annex Greenland, which is a Danish territory, to retake control of the Panama Canal and to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.\n\n— By Matthew Lee\n\nCongress is proving to be almost no match for this White House.\n\nTrump is testing, challenging and even bullying the Congress in unparalleled ways -– slashing government agencies, deporting legal immigrants, investigating perceived enemies and churning the economy — and all but daring lawmakers to object.\n\nWith unified Republican control of the White House and Congress, the GOP has a rare opportunity to muscle through an ambitious partisan agenda.\n\nBut Trump has shown he does not necessarily want or need Congress to accomplish his goals.\n\nThe president has issued almost 10 times as many executive orders as the first five presidents combined, bypassing Congress. DOGE is slashing programs, jobs and entire agencies, including the Department of Education, that by law receive funding under the purview of Congress, which holds the power under the Constitution to allocate money to the agencies.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., the second in the line of presidential succession, portrays himself as the “quarterback” for the “coach” – Trump — who is calling the plays. In the Senate, Republican senators confirmed some of his more contentious nominees over nominal objections.\n\nDemocrats are warning of the creep of authoritarianism into American. democracy. “Our Founding Fathers were very aware that a strong executive could essentially crowd out democracy and become an autocrat,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.\n\nBehind the scenes, many Republicans are trying to push back, for local imperatives such as agriculture and trade, but so far, most are acquiescing to the president.\n\n— By Lisa Mascaro\n\nFor the past three months the Pentagon has been rocked by the removals of top military leadership, including its only female four-star officers, its Joint Chiefs chairman — a Black general — and its top military lawyers.\n\nThe defense chief, Pete Hegseth, has been floundering in controversy.\n\nHe was a key participant in the Signal chat set up by national security adviser Mike Waltz, sending details of sensitive military operations over the nonsecure channel. Hegseth also used a second Signal chat to send similar information to a group that included his wife and brother. That was followed by the purge of his top staff: He removed or shifted at least five of them, including three whom he said were under investigation for leaks.\n\nTrump has said the military had gone “woke” and he acted swiftly to reverse long-standing policies.\n\nHe issued an executive order to remove transgender service members, which has been stalled by the courts. Hegseth ordered the military to eliminate any programming, books or imagery that celebrates diversity.\n\nMore change is coming.\n\nHegseth, long an opponent of women in front-line combat jobs, has ordered a broad review of military standards to ensure they are the same for women and men. Tens of thousands of career defense civilians are set to either voluntarily depart the agency or be pushed out through a reduction in force.\n\nThe internal changes come as the military is reshaping for a potential future China fight, and just as it is potentially about to receive an infusion of funds as Trump weighs an almost $1 trillion budget for the department.\n\nSocial media posts that celebrated military women or cultural diversity are gone. Instead the services are publicly promoting increases in enlistments, even though the latest totals reflect new recruiting programs and improvements that began long before Trump was elected.\n\nThe military has dedicated significant resources to Trump’s broader order to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. He has transferred control of a thin strip of land along the border to the Defense Department so troops can arrest immigrants for trespassing on military land.\n\n— By Tara Copp and Lolita C. Baldor\n\nPublic health\n\nAt the Department of Health and Human Services, 10,000 jobs are gone. Billions of dollars in research sent to scientists and universities was shut off. Public meetings to discuss flu shots and other vaccines have been canceled.\n\nFluoride in drinking water may be the next to go, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nKennedy has done a blitz of his “Make America Healthy Again” campaign at day cares, schools and health centers around the country where he has promised to work with Trump’s other agency leaders to prohibit soda from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, limit dyes in the food supply and call for fluoride to be removed from drinking water.\n\nKennedy’s resistance to launching a vaccination campaign as a growing measles outbreak has worsened, so far infecting hundreds and leaving two young children dead, has elicited concerns from doctors, public health experts and lawmakers.\n\nThose worries deepened after he eliminated thousands of jobs across the nation’s public health agencies, including at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health. The move, department officials projected, will save taxpayers $1.8 billion.\n\nBut some have escaped steep cuts. Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced an unusually steep rate increase for private health insurers that provide plans for older Americans through Medicare Advantage.\n\nIt will cost an extra $25 billion.\n\n— By Amanda Seitz\n\nEnergy and environment\n\nTrump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.\n\nHe created a National Energy Dominance Council, led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and remove regulatory barriers that may slow that down.\n\nTrump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, but he has moved even more aggressively in his second term to roll back major environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, motor vehicles and manufacturers.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations, including a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change. Zeldin’s plan would rewrite the EPA’s 2009 finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the legal underpinning for a host of climate regulations.\n\nZeldin says the changes, including more than 30 announced on a single day last month, will drive a dagger through the heart of what he calls “climate-change religion.”\n\nEnvironmentalists and climate scientists call the so-called endangerment finding a bedrock of U.S. law and that any attempt to undo it has little chance to succeed.\n\nWhile Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind, he has tried to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal, granting nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene.\n\nEnvironmental groups and public health advocates say the plan could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health.\n\n— By Matthew Daly\n\nArts and culture\n\nDana Gioia, a poet and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, liked to say that a key to maintaining support for the NEA and other federal organizations was ensuring they backed projects in as many congressional districts as possible.\n\nIt was a bipartisan formula that lasted for some 60 years, through Democratic and Republican administrations, until Trump’s second term.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding that artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others in the cultural community had long counted on. Acting without congressional authorization, he has declared that institutions ranging from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to the National Endowment for the Humanities have become fronts for a “woke” agenda that threatens to undermine what he calls “our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.”\n\nThe organizations he has attacked mostly date from the mid-1960s, at the peak of President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” domestic programs, when public support for government was high and the elevation of the arts a national priority. The Kennedy Center, the NEA, the NEH and the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences all were established with broad backing from the two parties.\n\nThe humanities “are the languages, religions, laws, philosophies, and customs that make us distinct,” reads a statement on the NEH website. “They are our history and our cultures, the ideas and movements that have shaped societies throughout time.”\n\nThe NEH and others also cite practical benefits; arts and culture are good for economy.\n\nThe NEH homepage includes a headline stating that the endowment “supports the humanities in every state and U.S. jurisdiction.” The NEA’s website highlights a recent government study showing that the arts added $1.2 trillion to the economy in 2023 and, at a time when Trump has placed steep tariffs on countries worldwide, notes that “the total value of the nation’s arts exports was nearly $37 billion greater than the value of arts imports from other countries.”\n\n— By Hillel Italie\n\nMany journalists figured a second Trump term would be a challenge for their industry. Few recognized how much.\n\nThe new administration has aggressively, even innovatively, waged combat against the press since taking office. It has fought against CBS News and The Associated Press in court, sought to dismantle the government-run Voice of America and sent the Federal Communications Commission after perceived media rivals.\n\nThe White House has established rapid-response social media feeds that maintain a constant flow of rejoinders to “hold the fake news accountable.”\n\n“The Trump administration is on a campaign to do everything it can to diminish and obstruct journalism in the United States,” said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor.\n\nThe future of Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and similar services that for generations have delivered unbiased news to countries where it is in short supply is being haggled over in court.\n\nTrump sued CBS News because he believed “60 Minutes” edited a segment last fall to the advantage of election opponent Kamala Harris. It remains hanging over the network’s head, although the newsmagazine has produced several hard-hitting segments on the administration over the first 100 days, provoking Trump into an angry social media response on April 13.\n\nTrump’s FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, is investigating CBS News, too, along with ABC News, NBC News, NPR, PBS, Comcast and, most recently, the Walt Disney Co., the latter for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\nThe AP sued the administration after it reduced the outlet’s access to presidential events for not following Trump’s lead in renaming the Gulf of Mexico, winning a court ruling that the government could not punish the organization for free speech. The administration says it intends to appeal. The administration has sought changes in the press corps that covers him, introducing new media that some suggest is often a euphemism for friendly outlets, and wants more control over who questions Trump.\n\nFox News is again the go-to source to hear Trump’s thinking, or that of people trying to influence him.\n\nThe young administration’s biggest embarrassment came when it unwittingly invited a journalist into a group chat where military plans were discussed. Even worse, it was a figure Trump reportedly dislikes: Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\nTrump press aides miss few opportunities to push the boss’ point of view, tweak the media or both simultaneously: They say they do not respond to questions from reporters who cite personal pronouns in their bios.\n\n— By David Bauder","summary":"In his first 100 days, President Donald Trump exerted his power in a sweep and scale that has no easy historical comparison.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/27/trumps-first-100-days-steamrolling-government-strong-arming-allies-and-igniting-trade-wars/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trump_61652-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 12:12:57","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.065},{"id":315330286,"title":"Opinion: Amid Turmoil at ’60 Minutes,’ Alarm Bells Are Ringing","text":"The resignation of the executive producer of one of the most venerated news shows in the United States marks yet another notch in MAGA’s belt. \n\nIt won’t be the last, with President Trump on the warpath and media conglomerates cowering to avoid retribution. And more ominously, it shows that these attempts to rule over corporate overlords by fear are working. \n\nIn a parting statement to staff, 60 Minutes producer Bill Owens lamented his diminishing ability—after nearly forty years as an effective and beloved boss—to make independent news judgments about what airs on the long running show. Pointedly, he cited interference from network executives into practices that have apparently impeded its long-standing reputation for destination news reporting. \n\nIn October 2024, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS alleging bias and claiming that a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris had been deceptively edited to make her—his then-rival in the 2024 presidential election—appear “coherent and decisive.” (The crux of his complaint was that different edits of a quote Harris gave in the interview were used in different contexts.) Trump has since doubled that amount to $20 billion, adding his displeasure over recent reports about the war in Ukraine and his attempts to take over Greenland. CBS has sought to dismiss the suit as groundless, citing the First Amendment, but there are also efforts underway to settle.\n\nMost legal analysts think that, if the case ever reached a courtroom, Trump wouldn’t have a leg to stand on. But that’s not the point. “It isn’t about an interview with Kamala Harris any more than the fight with Harvard is about antisemitism,” said Jonah Blank, a former senior editor with U.S. News. “It’s about asserting dominance.” \n\nThe current contretemps is also fueled by the potential sale of Paramount Global, which owns CBS, to Skydance Media, a $28 billion merger that would shake up the media landscape. The FCC’s Trump-appointed chairman, Brendan Carr, has yet to sign off on the deal, which is more about the power and money at stake than any high-minded journalistic principles.\n\n(Carr has opened an investigation into CBS and the selective editing of the 60 Minutes Harris interview. He’s also investigating ABC News for how it fact-checked in real time the Trump-Harris debate and NBC for whether it violated equal-time provisions by having Harris on Saturday Night Live doing the cold open just days before the election.)\n\n“Bill Owens is showing us what we already knew, that Trump is successfully bullying the news media—and as long as media organizations are a small piece of larger conglomerates, we are going to see this happen again and again and again,” Blank added. \n\nWhat’s happening at 60 Minutes has indeed already happened at ABC, when the network bowed and settled a multi-million suit with Trump after anchor George Stephanopoulos falsely stated Trump had been convicted of rape. (The correct term is sexual abuse.) \n\nFollow the money, and the dominoes fall. Take the once proud Washington Post, which brought down President Nixon for corrupt behavior; the paper led the charge to shift its editorial policies to conform to billionaire owner Jeff Bezos’ concerns about free markets, rather than to stand on the side of those warning of the slide toward dictatorship—and that democracy dies in darkness. \n\n“I have been made aware of interference in our news processes, and calling into question our judgement,” long-time 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl said in an interview with Variety. “That is not the way that companies that own news organizations should be acting.” \n\nShe hopes the meaning—and the impact—of Owens’ “sacrifice” reaches their bosses. “We have a reputation to uphold,” she told Variety. “It’s one of the reasons that CBS News is valuable. It’s what 60 Minutes stands for, and we can’t lose that,” Stahl continued. “We can’t afford to lose that.”\n\nBut so much has been lost already that it will take a long time to regain the public’s trust. Whatever happens next, 60 Minutes has joined a long and growing list of Trump capitulators. There is no end to Trump’s real and imagined grievances, and now that he has the power to redress past and present wounds to his ego, there’s more to come. \n\nHe can’t let anything go.

Before settling, ABC-News decided to conveniently forget the fact that the very judge who tried the case, said that most people would call what Trump did, and what the jury found him guilty of, was in fact, “rape.”\n\nYou say, “potatoes.” I say “rape.” \n\nABC-News’ capitulation, while weak and embarrassing, also only encouraged lowlifes like Trump, because … also on Tuesday … CBS-News signaled it was about to tell its once-rivals at ABC-News to hold their beer … \n\nThe venerable 60 Minutes, which has been one of the few news programs that has continued to righteously pound away on the America-attacking Trump will now be in search of a new leader. Executive Producer Bill Owens, announced his resignation Tuesday saying:\n\n“Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,’ right for the audience.” \n\nOwens sudden departure is hinting loudly at yet another surrender by yet another billionaire to Trump. \n\nThis time Shari Redstone. The Chairwoman of the Board at Paramount which owns CBS, has been dutifully kissing any inappropriate ass she can find in the White House to ensure her sale of Paramount for gobs of billions to the son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison goes through. \n\nShe can’t have Trump mad at her for telling the truth on air, so Owens had to sacrifice herself on the Mar-a-Lago altar first. \n\nNo surprise, Ellison is yet another slimy tech bro and the buddy of the sexual-abuser Trump, who some judges refer to as a rapist.\n\nThe sexual-abuser, who some judges refer to as a rapist, has sued CBS for $20 billion claiming the network aired two different versions of an answer Kamala Harris gave about Israel and Gaza on the network’s flagship news programs, Face the Nation as well as 60 Minutes. \n\nAs if the serial-lying Trump doesn't give 17 different answers to any question every hour ….\n\nWell, rather than fight that one out and win going away, Redstone has apparently figured it is much easier to just hand the whole franchise over to Trump’s buddy, Ellison, and be done with the damn thing. And if and when that deal goes through, if you are wondering if you will ever be able to trust anything from the CBS-News division again, the answer is, no.\n\nWhile insiders at 60 Minutes like correspondent Scott Pelley are saying, “This isn't something Bill (Owens) is doing of his own volition: There was no choice in any of this,\" I am saying I’d have a whole helluva lot more respect for him, if he stood in strong and made these grotesque sellouts fire him and drag him out of the building. \n\nResigning in advance is just weak, Bill. I’ve walked a mile in your shoes during my career, and take great comfort I didn’t cave to dishonest brokers who had it out for me and the truth. Ask me about it. I’d be glad to enlighten you ...\n\nFinally, Larry David arrived on the scene to save Terrible Tuesday when he took to the editorial pages of The New York Times to politely skewer the smarmy, one-time comedian, turned Trump-propagandist, Bill Maher, with some deftly aimed satire in his short and sweet piece “My dinner with Adolph.”\n\nDavid, the genius behind Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm never mentioned Maher by name preferring instead the roughly 257 million people across the world who will end up seeing or hearing about the piece connect the dots all on their own.\n\nI’ll guess it’s behind a paywall for now, so I’ll treat you to the piece’s conclusion: \n\n“Two hours later, the dinner was over, and the Führer escorted me to the door. “I am so glad to have met you. I hope I’m no longer the monster you thought I was.” “I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came. Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn’t mean that we have to hate each other.” And with that, I gave him a Nazi salute and walked out into the night ...”\n\nMaher of course accepted an invitation to dine with the America-attacking Trump recently, and through his 500-lb. smirk bragged to everybody that breaking bread with the racist, Lysol-guzzler was actually a very normal and wholesome experience. Hell everybody should try it, but of course they can’t because not everybody can be Bill Maher. \n\nHere in part is how Maher described his dining experience, sandwiched around his usual overcooked, fatty condescending barf:\n\n“Honestly, I voted for Clinton and Obama, but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk to Donald Trump. That’s just how it went down. Make of it what you will.”\n\nOh we will, sport, no worries there.\n\nYour foolish capitulation and normalization of a woman-abusing, America-attacking thug should finish you off for good. That you tipped him at the door after being played like Stephen Miller’s used violin was pret-ty, pret-ty, pret-ty, pret-ty pret-ty …pathetic. \n\nYou’ve been a damn fool for going on a long time now, Bill. Your once-clever condescension is now full-blown, look-at-me arrogance. \n\nI know you will invariably ignore my advice to just shut up and go away for a period of about six years for some serious introspection, because I have come to understand that guys like you and Trump simply can’t help themselves.\n\nYou have the phonies in our billionaire-controlled media to do that for you …","summary":"Tuesday was a banner day in the news business as it continues its transition into authoritarian-controlled propaganda that is sold to the highest bidders, which in this case are our nation’s ever-increasing collection of hideous tech bros — otherwise known as Boosters of Trump (BOTs). \n\nIt was nothing if not a wild and disgusting day, and featured some heavy-hitters in the political, entertainment and journalism world, as well as reputable truth-tellers like Larry David, who was the only person proving capable of seeing though all the never-ending BS that has blanketed the United States of America. \n\nGood ol’ Sarah Palin appeared out of the Alaska wilderness and into a courtroom in New York City Tuesday where she once again provided some much-needed, albeit brief comedic entertainment to a starving American public. \n\nYou’ll remember Palin, who with the help of John McCain and his slippery handlers was hurled downward into the Republicans’ glass floor 17 years ago, making it possible for literally anything or ","url":"https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/media-trump/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=54882001&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C248%2C0%2C248","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 11:53:18","author":"D.

Randy Fine holds a victory party on April 1, 2025, in Ormond Beach, Fla.\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe state that stopped swinging\n\nAlthough political strategists have historically considered Florida a swing state in presidential elections, it has consistently voted Republican since 1948. \n\nIt has only voted for Democratic presidential candidates five times since 1964, for Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and twice for Barack Obama. President Donald Trump has won Florida three times in a row, most recently winning the 2024 election in all but six of Florida’s 67 counties. \n\nThe main battleground since 2000 has been the I-4 Corridor, which connects Tampa, Orlando and Daytona. In 2000, President George W. Bush won the corridor by 4,400 votes. Since Bush only won Florida by 537 votes, and thus the presidency, the area became a top priority for both political parties.\n\nSome Democrats have said Florida’s political evolution happened gradually and then all at once. \n\nIn 2012, there were almost 1.5 million more registered Democratic voters than Republicans in Florida. In 2020, Democrats’ advantage dropped to about 97,000. And by September 2024, there were almost 1 million more registered Republicans than Democrats. \n\nSteve Schale, the head of Obama’s 2008 campaign in Florida, argues that this shift happened because the Democratic Party lost the support of some white voters. \n\nRepublicans have also actively courted Hispanic voters, while Democrats falsely believed that young Hispanics would inherently lean toward their party. \n\nThis assumption has hurt the Democratic cause because, for example, some Hispanic voters in Florida, like many Cuban Americans, have long favored Republican. In fact, Trump performed so well with Hispanics in Florida in 2024 that it was the only state in which he received more of the Hispanic vote than Kamala Harris. \n\nState-level conservative success\n\nFlorida has also had a Republican governor since 1998, a state Senate Republican majority since 1995 and a state House majority since 1997. This Republican dominance has only grown since Trump’s 2016 election. \n\nIn 2018, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis received Trump’s endorsement and went from being relatively unknown in the gubernatorial primaries to the Republican nominee. He ultimately assumed office in 2019.\n\nSince then, DeSantis has successfully passed a slew of laws and policies reflecting the conservative values of what he saw as the new Floridian electorate. \n\nFor example, DeSantis passed a six-week abortion ban measure into law in 2023. \n\nWith DeSantis’ approval, Florida’s state Legislature also blocked diversity, equity and inclusion programs in state colleges in 2023 and banned lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity for public grade school students that same year. \n\nIn 2023, the Florida governor also signed a law that allowed people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. \n\nThe pandemic factor\n\nSome conservative political pundits and DeSantis supporters say that the governor’s COVID-19 policies are among the factors that have attracted newcomers to the state. \n\nAlmost 300,000 people moved from out of state to Florida between April 2020 and April 2021, equal to roughly 903 people relocating to the state each day.\n\nThe governor ordered Floridians to stay at home during April 2020, but many of his restrictions were lifted at the end of the month. \n\nDeSantis did not enforce mask mandates, vaccine requirements and other measures that were common in other states. \n\nDuring my fieldwork in Florida from 2022 through 2024, I met multiple people who moved to rural parts of the state because they did not want their lives to be severely restricted during the pandemic. \n\nOne man in his early 50s stated, “During COVID my wife and I realized how screwed we were if things got really bad. We hated the lockdowns and got scared about not having enough food. If things got really bad, we didn’t want to trust other people, we wanted to be self-sufficient. So, we decided to get a place in the middle of the woods, on our own property, that we could go to if everything went to hell.” \n\nThis couple settled on moving from out of state to a rural area of Florida, where they thought they had the best chance of avoiding future lockdown restrictions. \n\nDeSantis’ policy successes and his “freedom first” response to the pandemic have been celebrated by conservatives nationally.","summary":"Florida has undergone a dramatic political transformation over the past decade from a swing state to Republican stronghold.\n\n\nFlorida’s recent congressional special election on April 1, 2025, showcased the state’s increasingly conservative identity, when Republicans won both congressional seats.\n\n\nStill, Democrats felt hopeful about these results, since the two Democratic contenders lost by slimmer margins in the 1st and 6th districts than in other recent elections. \n\n\nAs a political anthropologist who has conducted fieldwork in central Florida, I’ve spent over five years tracking the growth of conservative political groups like the Proud Boys and Moms for Liberty, whose leaderships are based in Florida.\n\n\nI’ve seen firsthand how conservative activist networks and the growth of culture war politics, among other factors, have reshaped Florida’s political identity. \n\n\n \nFlorida’s Republican state Sen.

The headline for Ignatius' column wondered, \"Has Trump found a path to peace in Ukraine?\" — a rare sign of optimism from the Washington Post opinion section regarding Trump. The Post columnist claimed that there are \"some signs of progress\" being reported by U.S., European and Ukrainian officials on a possible peace deal between Russia and Ukraine as the war drags on for the third year. \"There’s movement, if not yet agreement, toward the essential land-for-peace formula that would frame any pact,\" Ignatius wrote, adding, \"Russia would continue to administer the five regions it occupies, though Ukraine wouldn’t formally cede sovereignty in any of them.\" TRUMP HAS HIS OWN DEADLINE, 'NO ALLEGIANCE TO ANYBODY' IN UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE DEAL The column claimed that while Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) under a potential ceasefire deal, Russia would accept Ukraine's right to a postwar \"robust security guarantee,\" which, according to Ignatius, is \"understood by all\" to mean European troops. The United States would reportedly act as a \"guarantor of a ceasefire agreement and the postwar security of Ukraine and its European partners,\" as well as provide continued intelligence support to ensure Kyiv and its allies would have advanced warning of any renewed Russian attack. \"European countries want a U.S. ‘backstop’ for their postwar ‘deterrent force’ to clarify that Trump would provide aid if Russia attacked. European officials assume that their commitment of forces would have America’s blessing and support, but they don’t yet have an explicit assurance — and without one, they might not send troops,\" Ignatius claimed. RUSSIA 'READY TO MAKE A DEAL' ON UKRAINE WAR, LAVROV SAYS The column touched on Trump's social media posts about the potential ceasefire earlier this week when he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to \"GET IT DONE,\" but also assured Zelenskyy that 'nobody is asking' him to recognize Crimea as Russian territory. Ignatius also acknowledged Trump scolding Russian President Vladimir Putin on social media Thursday after Russia's overnight bombardment of Ukraine's capital, telling Putin to \"STOP\" the bombings. \"I take Trump at his word when he says he wants to stop the ‘horrible bloodbath’ in Ukraine. In September, in his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he pledged to ‘negotiate a deal’ and ‘stop all of these human lives from being destroyed,’\" the Post columnist said.

One thing he has not done: lower Americans’ grocery bills.\n\nWhile overall inflation has trended slightly downward since Trump took office, food inflation has not. In fact, not only have grocery prices increased each month since he took office, that inflation rate itself has increased in each of the three months since Trump’s return, so that the inflation rate for groceries is now at its highest point in nearly two years.\n\n“Just 100 days in, the reality is wildly different, and voters are noticing,” said Democratic pollster and consultant Matt McDermott. “Day One was supposed to bring relief, not recession.”\n\nSarah Longwell, a Republican consultant who for years has been conducting focus groups studying Trump’s supporters, said they, too, are noticing. “There is a meaningful slice of Trump voters who voted for Trump specifically because he promised to lower prices on groceries, etc,” she said. “Many of these voters express frustration that Trump isn’t doing more to lower costs.”\n\nTrump’s response to his failure on the single most important issue to the median voter in the November election has been a favorite standby: He has simply lied about it.\n\n“Groceries have come down,” he said in an Oval Office photo opportunity on Tuesday, and then focused on eggs in particular. “The cost of eggs have come down like 93, 94% since we took office.”\n\nIn fact, eggs got expensive under predecessor Joe Biden and then got even more expensive after Trump took office because of a bird flu epidemic. For Trump’s claim to be correct, eggs would have to be selling for about 35 cents a dozen now, which they clearly are not.\n\nTrump well understood the primacy of the issue both during the campaign ― promising to lower grocery prices on “Day 1” was a common line in his rally speeches ― as well as after he had barely eked out a win over Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris.\n\n“I won on groceries. Very simple word, groceries,” Trump told NBC News in December. “When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that. We’re going to bring those prices way down.”\n\nThe following month, upon retaking office, Trump did sign an executive order on the topic of inflation, which instructed his agencies “to deliver emergency price relief, consistent with applicable law, to the American people.”\n\nIt’s unclear what, if anything, resulted from that directive, as both grocery prices and other goods have continued to get more expensive at about the same rate they had been doing so for the last year of Biden’s term.\n\nThat, though, was before Trump launched his trade war against the rest of the planet early this month. And while his most recent stance ― after a number of flip-flops ― appears to back away from the highest tariffs he has imposed on Chinese goods, the damage to the economy has already begun and cannot be averted. \n\nTransoceanic shipping traffic was scrambled by the promise of massive new taxes on American importers. This is already disrupting supply chains and is guaranteed to create shortages and possibly increase prices on imports, at least temporarily and perhaps indefinitely, within the coming months. Because the United States imports $263 billion in food ― from tomatoes from Mexico to vanilla beans from Madagascar ― those prices are also set to increase, which will drive up grocery prices even more.\n\n“Trump ran on fighting inflation. Instead, he’s fueling it,” McDermott said.\n\nThe public, meanwhile, appears to have learned enough about Trump’s trade war to conclude that they hate it. Recent polls show that Trump’s approval ratings on the economy, which were always his greatest strength during his first term and as he ran to regain the White House over the next four years, have now tanked.\n\nAmericans disapprove of Trump’s handling of inflation by 20 or more points in new surveys by Reuters and The Economist, while the latter also shows that those Americans, by a 30-point margin, say his policies have hurt them rather than helped them.\n\n“His No. 1 campaign promise was ‘I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately.’ But instead he’s raising prices with tariffs that are now the biggest middle class tax hike in decades,” said Andrew Bates, a deputy press secretary in Biden’s White House.\n\nThat Trump could not actually bring lower prices is not surprising. Deflation almost never happens, absent a calamitous economic crisis. Indeed, it was the concerted effort of the entire United States government during the Covid-19 pandemic to avoid such a calamity that caused high prices in 2022 and 2023 in the first place.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board lowered interest rates to near zero to keep money flowing, while both the Trump and Biden administrations sent Americans a total of $5.7 trillion in stimulus checks, payroll grants, and other aid ― two-thirds of which was signed into law by Trump ― to prevent consumer spending from plummeting.\n\nTrump and his allies, nevertheless, have argued that only the one-third of Covid spending approved by Biden caused all the inflation, while Trump also floats a fanciful theory that it was Biden’s emphasis on renewable energy rather than oil and gas that worsened inflation.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that his plan to vastly increase fossil fuel production in the United States will lead to lower prices on everything, while his imposition of massive import taxes ― paid entirely by Americans ― will finance all manner of programs, including cheap child care.\n\nActual economists say his promises make no sense and cannot be fulfilled.","summary":"Former US President Donald Trump during a news conference at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, US, on Thursday, Aug. 15, 2024. WASHINGTON ― Standing in front of a table stacked with food items at his New Jersey golf course last summer, Donald Trump complained that grocery prices had “skyrocketed” and promised to fix that if Americans made him president again: “When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one.”\n\nNinety-six days later, grocery prices have not come down, not even a little.\n\nIn his first 100 days in office, Trump has managed quite a bit: upending the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal workers; unilaterally sentencing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of migrants to life sentences in a notorious El Salvador prison; switching sides in the Ukraine war to favour the aggressor; and costing Americans trillions from their retirement accounts while putting the country on the path to a trade-war-induced recession.

She sometimes likes to leaf through the interviews that Peter Bogdanovich conducted with 16 auteur directors- Hitchcock, George Cukor, Fritz Lang – for a book called Who the Devil Made It.\n\n“None of that work would have been made if they did not have that fearless attitude and just f**king do it. And that was the heart of that 100-year-old business.”\n\nAs far as Bateman is concerned, that industry – “that 100-year tree” – is no longer fully alive or relevant. The antic energy and fearlessness that drove the film and television industries in the Los Angeles of her childhood has been replaced now by an invidious caution, which has led to alarmed warnings and critiques about the decline of the industry in Lotus Land. Bateman has herself written a piece with the headline: Hollywood is dead.\n\n“Greed, in short,” she replies when asked about the cause of its demise.\n\n“The film had three components that made it untouchable. Your true north was excellent work. The second thing was a financial ecosystem that worked for everyone. And we also had a great creative ecosystem. What happened was the studios going for only big-budget stuff that makes a lot of money. Then the tech companies decide they are going to use our work as material on their websites. Which they call ‘content.’\n\n“So now you have a content conveyor belt and giant-budget films and that is the focus. So that Hollywood business that we had is dead. The true north became the stock price and the studio executives chasing after the tech company model. And also, hardly anything is in person.”\n\nWhen we speak, over Zoom, Bateman is in 11th-hour preparation for the Credo 23 film festival she founded and organised along with like-minded souls – Juliette Lewis, Matthew Weiner of Mad Men and Reed Morano, the director during the first season of The Handmaid’s Tale. The boutique festival has two abiding rules: that none of the entries have any Artificial Intelligence elements whatsoever and that they meet a certain quality threshold.\n\n“The film-makers are so excited. There is one coming from England, another driving across the country to come. Social media has made people feel like they don’t matter because it quantifies people by likes and follows. It means you have a society that feels unloved and unvalued. \n\n“All to say: I think when you have an event focused on the value of an inherent talent that they time to enrich and, in this case, to make a good film, that’s a spirit that people are responding to. It values humans. The criteria are simply: no AI and make a good film. Talent isn’t discriminating.”\n\nBateman, who is 59, has navigated a decidedly unusual industry life. Her breakout acting role in television was as Mallory Keaton, the wryly amused younger sister to Michael J Fox’s Reaganite conservative entrepreneur Alex and their hippy-era parents in Family Ties, the phenomenally successful sitcom that ran from 1982-1989. With that came an early taste of genuine fame.\n\nShe’s polite but clear in her lack of interest in rehashing war tales about that role and time in her life. Apart from anything else, she wrote a provocative, zesty book about it called Fame: The Hijacking of Reality. It is not a memoir (“I f**king hate memoirs” she clarifies in the opening sentence) but a bristling, stream-of-conscious polemic about the disconcerting attractions and vapidity of that late 20th-century iteration of fame. In the 1990s, her personal fame dimmed without ever disappearing and she has spent three full decades on subsequent acting, writing and directing projects.\n\nResearching the book, she came across a comment online critiquing her appearance. It was a stranger remarking that she looked old. And it troubled her “for longer than I thought it would”, she told the actress and talkshow host Drew Barrymore after completing a second book.\n\nFace: One Square Foot of Skin, published in 2022, is 47 short stories based on people – mostly women – with whom she spoke about the subject of ageing and the beauty industry. She compares plastic surgery to a Ponzi scheme people invest in believing it will help them acquire a partner or obtain a promotion or, in the surface world of the film and television industry, prolong a career. Bateman herself had decided to allow her face to age as it will. The response to the book took her by surprise.\n\n“I knew it would strike a chord with some people. But it was immediate and huge. I got over a thousand DMs from women – and some men – and the feeling was: relief. Under this accusation that their faces were broken and had to be fixed for so long, and you don’t realise how much you were holding it in your body.\n\n“The conversation had moved to: which procedures should you get? You know? It was a fait accompli. And I felt it was insane. So, people are saying perhaps that book was a tipping point – just like this election was a tipping point for the woke mob mentality momentum. Perhaps my book changed that ‘your face is broken’ momentum.”\n\nIn addition to all of that, over the past five years Bateman has emerged as a provocative if unlikely crusader against the woke culture which, she argues, had made life in California suffocating and humourless. It’s something she touches on as she explains the subtle but crushing shifts in the way the film and television business is conducted now, as opposed to a decade ago.\n\n“Los Angeles was different too. Up until eight years ago, it had that: ‘hey man, you do you’ attitude. It can be annoying but that was LA. And then we had the invasion of the hall monitors and the party-poopers and the finger pointing and people telling you what to do. That really jacked out the spirit of this place, At the same time, you had virtually all of the film business being conducted online. Zoom links,” she says, throwing her hands up in exasperation.\n\n“Aren’t there offices in Burbank? It is like a 20-minute drive. Okay, let us look into the availability. The parties that used to take place weren’t just for fun. You could talk about films and you were in this pot of truly gifted artists. And studio executives. And producers. And marketing gurus. Now, that has completely shrunken down to some private clubs.”\n\n[ Why Jamie Dimon is right about meetingsOpens in new window ]\n\nEven through a screen and from a distance of 3,000 miles, Bateman is animated and bright. She believes a Kamala Harris presidency would have been a disaster for the US. Her thesis is that liberal left wing orthodoxies had taken command of the cultural conversation and enforced on it a series of rules that she found to be increasingly shrill and absurd. During the Covid lockdown and afterwards, that shrillness intensified, particularly, she says, in her city.\n\n“Los Angeles is not a place where people move to start a family or contribute to the success of the city. New York has that. People go there to try and prove themselves. But here it is more: hey, LA, what have you got for me? I’ve been told in my little town in Minnesota I’m the prettiest girl in town and I should go to LA. The truth is you get here and it’s like: get in line. There are never going to be enough roles or films to employ anybody. And also: you may or may not be talented as an actor.\n\n“So, there are a lot of disappointed people that it never happened for. And the last thing they want to do is go home and admit defeat. So, they stay out here. And they can turn bitter and angry. And 2020 was perfect for them because they got to become these hall monitors. And they got to keep this going for two years. So how did it feel? It felt ridiculous. You kept your thoughts to yourself. Cancellation culture. Arbitrary rules. You say this doesn’t make sense: then you’re a Nazi! It was all just screaming, in your face. I found it unbearable. And I found it incredibly un-American.”\n\nHer glee at the November election originated, she says, in an outpouring of relief that she could breathe again rather than a pronounced political affiliation. Because of her views, she has been invited on to Fox News talkshows to discuss the disintegration of the Democratic leadership and belief system. But she makes it clear she is sceptical about politicians as a rule – and took exception to the Hollywood Reporter, the long-established trade paper, depicting her as a Trump supporter.\n\n“I don’t like politics or politicians, generally speaking. I was so glad that enough people were like: we are done with this. It got really insane and I kept thinking a senator or world leader or someone will say: enough. To me, the American spirit is: come over here and live your life however you like as long as that doesn’t impinge on my right to do the same. Don’t get in my face and start telling me how I am supposed to behave or relate to other people.”\n\nIt is, of course, difficult for some among the generation of Americans who grew up with Family Ties and retain the archetypes of those characters to reconcile themselves with the contemporary reality of Justine Bateman. Her views are both lauded and vilified, according to political perspective and mirroring the prevailing mood in the country. When the conversation does turn to that show, she will allow that it was part of an irrecoverable period of utter domination for the television networks. The situation comedy had extraordinary, never-to-be-repeated, reach.\n\n[ When AI images become ‘an insult to life itself’Opens in new window ]\n\n“I was 16 and it never even crossed my mind to act for a living,” she says. “I fell into my vocation at the time. There were a handful of television stars that crossed into movies- John Travolta, Mike Fox, and Christopher Lloyd. It wasn’t done back then.\n\n“And this is part of the 100-year-old business. Cultivating these extraordinary plants that were movie stars. There has to be context for that to happen. You can’t just take all the best paintings in the world and throw them in a parking lot. So, when you throw 10,000 films online on a streaming website, you are telling people how to treat the work.”\n\nAt its peak, Family Ties was drawing in around 30 million viewers a week. Season finales could attract 50 million. All watching the same show, at the same time. Millions more watched around the world. Bateman agrees that the show subliminally communicated endless messages to its global audience about America, from its interior decor to the inherent values contained within the storylines.\n\n“Yeah, such as: the showing up for friends. The good guys – bad guys. It was very clear when someone was stealing or lying. And also: just that cowboy fearlessness and don’t sweat the small s**t, and just go for it. And pick yourself up and go again. It is not fair for me to qualify that as uniquely American, but it is woven into the American spirit.”\n\nHer contention is that the old model – dominant studios and the careful curation of actors who became – in the Hollywood walk of fame sense – movie stars – is done. The idea of the film star, born for the big screen, is still alive in the imagination of film fans, she believes. But in the torrent of content and streaming services and social media, the film industry has simply forgotten how to create them.\n\n[ Michael J Fox: ‘My wife could have said, Parkinson’s, that’s not for me. But she stuck around’Opens in new window ]\n\n“You have to have someone who is magnetic, personable, a good-to-great actor,” she says cheerfully. “And then you have to cultivate that. And then, you have to frame it and put it in context. Brad Pitt was in specific films that were released in ways that films aren’t released now.\n\n“Do people still believe in movie stardom? Sure. Are there any new ones coming through? Hardly. Tom Cruise – he has a social media account but he isn’t posting pictures of himself in his kitchen or whatever. Neither is Brad Pitt. Part of it is allowing yourself that under exposure. But ... that 100-year-old tree died.\n\n“I say all this, and there is a new tree emerging. And the new film business is going to be filled with those same kind of people as before. It’s going to be built on the same fearlessness. By people who aren’t answering to anybody.”","summary":"The film-maker and author, who starred in Family Ties with Michael J Fox in the 1980s, has strong views on plastic surgery, ‘woke’ culture and Hollywood","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/04/27/justine-bateman-this-election-was-a-tipping-point-for-the-woke-mob-mentality/","image":"https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/ZYLFRPF3BZEILC57YW4M7FRI5U.jpg?auth=4760631fe0397bc85e2482855817174f023e9cacc7844d85bb1ee2b389292229&smart=true&width=1600&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 04:45:00","author":"Keith Duggan","authors":["Keith Duggan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":315244538,"title":"Review: Charli XCX treats her Minneapolis ‘Brat’ pack to a hyper dance party","text":"“It’s okay to admit that you’re jealous of me.”\n\nAs she sang/snarled that line two songs into her Essex-thickened British accent Saturday night at Target Center, Charli XCX set the haughty and, yep, bratty attitude that defined her first Minnesota concert since becoming a pop superstar.\n\nAny aspiring singer would be jealous of the success that has been thrust upon the real-life Charlotte Emma Aitchison. Last summer’s breakout album, “Brat,” not only took over the music biz but inspired pop-culture jargon and sloganeering for Kamala Harris’ campaign. \n\nIt’s doubtful Charli could have even filled the Armory in Minneapolis last April, and here she was playing to 15,000 fans – lots of young women, lots of gay men, lots of fun — between two Timberwolves’ home playoff games at Minnesota’s NBA arena. \n\nWhile Charli’s mainstream crossover has been sudden, the 32-year-old singer has actually been grinding and hustling her way toward it for a full decade. “Brat” was her sixth album. She made many previous Twin Cities appearances, too, including club gigs, a KDWB Jingle Ball and opening for Coldplay and Taylor Swift.\n\nTo quote Swift about Charli’s big career bang, she was ready for it. She commanded the stage Saturday with impressively fierce dancing and charmingly attitudinal strutting. Audience members’ friends will be jealous hearing about all the fun they had come Sunday morning.\n\nCharli really was all there was to the show. Instead of adding a massive stage production, large live band, T-shirt gun and other accruements that come with arena-headlining status, Charli put on what amounted to a very large, very high-energy dance-club show with her as the lone star. She didn’t even have a DJ with her on stage.\n\nPlaying up her Britishness, she blared “Bittersweet Symphony” by U.K. rockers the Verve as her walk-up song before the throbbing grooves of her remixed dance track “365” came booming over the sound system.","summary":"The British electro-pop hitmaker put on a short and very un-sweet show Saturday at a packed Target Center.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/review-charli-xcx-treats-her-minneapolis-brat-pack-to-a-hyper-dance-party/601335694","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/QKXHMR524VDZ7ESY3JTCQXOBWQ.jpg?&w=1200&ar=1.91:1&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 04:02:43","author":"Nfc North","authors":["Nfc North"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.11},{"id":315225792,"title":"Concert review: Charli XCX was all style, no substance at Target Center","text":"The woman born Charlotte Aitchison has been kicking around the music industry since 2008, when she began posting songs online and exploring the London rave scene. It took a while, but she’s finally got to the point where she filled Minneapolis’ Target Center on Saturday night under her stage name Charli XCX.\n\nThe 32-year-old landed her first big single in 2012 as a guest on Icona Pop’s “I Love It” (which popped up in her encore) and returned to the charts two years later after she contributed vocals to Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy” (which was nowhere to be found Saturday, much like Iggy Azalea’s career). But Charli never really built a substantial following in the States until recently, with her sixth album “Brat” entering the charts at No. 3 last summer. (The record’s purposefully garish lime green cover quickly went viral online and only got hotter when the Kamala Harris campaign adopted the look.)\n\nIt’s tempting to lump her in with other current female pop stars like Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, but Charli doesn’t have a crossover classic like “Espresso” or “Pink Pony Club” in her repertoire. Instead, she makes polarizing electronic dance songs that are more aggressive and angry than, say, euphoric.\n\nSo it was strange to see her largely youthful crowd, with a substantial number of queer people in attendance, dancing and cheering to Charli’s bass-heavy and often discordant songs cursed with vapid lyrics. But the audience turned it into a celebration for the devoted that’s not likely to win over any skeptics.\n\nCharli performed on a massive, stark stage with two large screens and a two-level catwalk that extended into the crowd. There was no live band — she sang to a prerecorded track with plenty of canned vocals on it — or dancers, and the only other person on stage was the occasional camera operator. The set list included nearly all of “Brat” but almost nothing from her early career, not even 2014’s “Boom Clap,” her biggest solo hit. (Then again, many of those in the crowd were still in grade school in 2014.)\n\nClad in a series of revealing outfits and ever-present wraparound shades, Charli didn’t spend the show dancing as much as she did stomping around, pumping her fist, swearing incessantly and acting more like a hype (wo)man than the main attraction. When she did sing live, it was usually through heavy electronic effects. After a while, watching her onstage felt like scrolling through a particularly tedious Instagram feed full of leering influencers.\n\nAgain, the up-for-anything crowd ate up every last minute of what quickly turned into a concert heavy on style and lacking in substance.","summary":"Charli never really built a substantial following in the States until recently, with her sixth album “Brat” entering the charts at No. 3 last summer.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/04/26/concert-review-charli-xcx-was-all-style-no-substance-at-target-center/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-CHARLI-XCX-0427-01.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 03:36:37","author":"Ross Raihala","authors":["Ross Raihala"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":315195608,"title":"The Dems’ far-left agenda is just starting — and the worst is yet to come","text":"To most Americans, the big problem with the Democratic Party is that it has moved too far left in recent years. If you’re among those who believe that, brace yourself. \n\nThe worst is yet to come.\n\nA serious push is underway to move the party even further away from the political center, embrace economic plans close to pure socialism and launch radical woke culture battles. \n\nIt sounds like a bad joke, but it’s really happening. And it’s a movement that goes beyond the socialist fever dreams of Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria -Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAlthough some of the push is a reaction to Donald Trump’s election in November and his embrace of America First policies, the fury reflects more than just Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nConsider the lead sentence in a recent fundraising email. \n\n“Democratic voters want a more progressive party,” began a pitch from a far-left group called Justice Democrats.\n\nTo my surprise, a legitimate national poll supports the claim, and others hint at the same trend.\n\nSurvey USA, in a poll taken earlier this month, found that 50% of Dems said they want the party to “become more progressive,” 24% said it should “stay the same” and just 18% said “become more -moderate.”\n\nLowest approval rating\n\nI’ve been trying to wrap my head around the findings, but can only wonder how much further left Dems can go before they fall off the face of the Earth.\n\nSanders, Ocasio-Cortez and their angry fellow travelers apparently aim to find out. \n\nTheir big, boisterous rallies are all about tearing down what Sanders calls “ubercapitalism,” but history and current events show that socialism always adds to human misery. \n\nPerhaps the left’s new power couple should go on a fact-finding trip to Cuba and Venezuela to see for themselves. \n\nOr they could ask the 12 million illegal immigrants Joe Biden let in why they risked life and limb to get here if America is such a terrible, rotten place to live and work.\n\nOne thing the radicals can’t deny is that the Dem party that voters soundly rejected last November has its lowest national approval rating ever at under 30%.\n\nMost of that dismal view is because it’s widely seen as too far left already.\n\nThe reasons are obvious: The party is largely anti-police and pro-criminal, it’s riddled with antisemitism and some congressional members are foolishly fixated on defending gang members who came to America as part of the illegal migration wave. \n\nIn addition, party leaders never met a tax hike they didn’t embrace and made Elon Musk Public Enemy No. 1 for daring to try to cut fraud and waste from the bloated, debt-riddled federal budget. \n\nDems, elite universities and a web of NGOs fattened on taxpayer money are reacting as if the world would end if even a penny were cut. \n\nThese and similar positions put the party well outside the American mainstream, so what would it mean to be even more progressive?\n\nAnd where are the voters who are willing to support such madness? They’re certainly not among those common sense Americans fleeing high-tax, crime-infested blue states.\n\nThe answers about finding new voters are vague by necessity. As the Justice Democrats insist in their email pitch, “Too many Democratic leaders keep chasing the center, running Republican-lite campaigns that don’t reflect the values of the people who put them in office.”\n\nYounger, more radical\n\nSo moderation is the enemy and no self-respecting Dem should be caught anywhere near the center of the political spectrum? Got it. \n\nExcept Biden and Kamala Harris had the most far-left administration in the modern era, and the results were disastrous for the nation — and the party. \n\nYet the desire to drink more of the same Kool-Aid is especially prevalent among young Dems. \n\nThe Harvard Youth Poll released last week shows that of the 18- to 29-year-olds who voted for Harris last November, only 23% approve of what congressional Dems are doing.\n\nThis, too, is divorced from reality. Dems in Congress have opposed virtually everything Trump has proposed, including his Cabinet nominees. \n\nMost wouldn’t even stand when Trump, speaking to a joint session of Congress, saluted families who lost loved ones to migrant murderers. Nor were they moved by a 13-year-old boy with cancer the president honored.\n\nThe only time Dems have compromised this year was when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine other Dems voted to keep the government open instead of killing a GOP spending bill that would have shut down the government. \n\nSchumer was right when he said Dems would be blamed for the shutdown, but the left is so eager for a fight that it wanted him to burn it all down. \n\nFor his trouble, Schumer has been targeted by his party, with calls for AOC to challenge him in a primary.\n\nThat wouldn’t be until 2028, but the idea of using primary battles to remake the party younger and more radical is now out in the open. \n\nA prime antagonist is David Hogg, the 25-year-old anti-gun activist who was recently named a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee. \n\nThe move aimed to show young voters the party was open to their generation and ideas, but it immediately backfired in spectacular fashion. \n\nHogg said he would start a multimillion-dollar fund to challenge “asleep-at-the-wheel” incumbents in primaries.\n\nJeopardizing victory\n\nHis pledge rattled the old guard, which aims to expand its members, not trade trusted old ones for radical new ones. \n\n“No DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election, whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger,” DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a call with reporters. “Voters should decide who our primary nominees are, not DNC leadership.”\n\nAlthough Trump and congressional Republicans are the targets, the Dems determination to marginalize themselves isn’t necessarily good for the country as a whole.\n\nThe two-party system works best when the competition is over voters who are slightly to the right or left of center. The need to attract these swing voters has a moderating influence on the government as a whole. \n\nPresidents temper their agenda so that voting for it doesn’t cost their members their seats, especially in the House, where control has been shifting in recent years.\n\nTrump lost the House two years after the GOP swept the 2016 election, and Biden lost it in the 2022 midterms.\n\nFrom that point on, most of their domestic agendas were dead.\n\nThe pattern shows that voters punish presidents and parties that are seen as straying too far from the middle.\n\nThe oddity now is that Trump’s poll numbers are slipping and with the GOP holding the narrowest possible House majority, control could easily shift next year. \n\nAll of which makes the Dems’ behavior so bizarre. Most are willing to jeopardize their chances of victory in favor of moving further to the left. \n\nGood luck with that.","summary":"To most Americans, the big problem with the Democratic Party is that it has moved too far left in recent years.

A sheriff? Can a Republican become governor of California again?","text":"This column was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nAfter more than a decade being exiled from the governor’s office in California, Republicans are eyeing growing voter frustration with the dominant liberal politics of the state as a launching pad for a comeback next year.\n\nThough lacking the statewide profiles of a deluge of Democratic contenders, a pair of GOP hopefuls with devoted conservative followings has jumped into the open 2026 gubernatorial race in recent months, hoping to persuade voters that only a radical shakeup can fix California’s problems.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any other way of describing California today, other than the sick man of America,” said Steve Hilton, a former Fox News host and onetime political adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron who officially announced his candidacy on Monday. “It’s just undeniable that we’re in a terrible, terrible mess in California and we have to change direction.”\n\nHilton kicked off his campaign with an event in Huntington Beach, the city that has remade itself over the past few years into the bulwark of conservative resistance in California. He follows Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a hero of the right for defying state mandates during the COVID pandemic, who entered the race to succeed termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom in February.\n\nBoth believe that voters have grown sick of a generation of one-party Democratic rule in Sacramento and are banking on appeals to cut taxes and regulations — which they blame for making California unaffordable — to reach across traditional partisan lines.\n\n“We are being led down a path of complete government control and socialism,” Bianco said in an interview. “This is no longer Democrat versus Republican. We’re at a point where it’s sane versus insane.”\n\nBut conservative candidates face a steep climb in a state that has not elected a Republican to statewide office since Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger won a second term in 2006.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Party Chairperson Rusty Hicks said the gubernatorial race is about more than just who can deliver for Californians. Voters know the governor has a powerful platform to stand up to the Trump administration and they won’t want a Republican in a role that is also critical to the future of the rest of the country and the whole world, he said.\n\n“I certainly applaud them for continuing to try,” Hicks said. “But time and time again, we see California voters see their policies for what they are, which is not in line with the values of Californians.”\n\nSlashing taxes and regulations\n\nMore than 20 people have already filed a statement of intention to run for governor in the 2026 primary as Republicans — though few will be serious candidates and some may never qualify for the ballot at all, which requires paying a filing fee or submitting thousands of signatures from registered voters.\n\nOnly two, including Bianco, have reported raising any money for their campaigns so far. While the first fundraising report of 2025 is not due until the end of July, major donations are filed with the state on a rolling basis.\n\nLeo Zacky, a poultry farm heir and perennial candidate who received 1.3% of the vote in the 2022 gubernatorial primary and 0.1% in the 2021 recall election, seeded his campaign last month with $50,000 of his own money.\n\nMeanwhile, since launching his campaign in February, Bianco has reported more than $380,000 in major contributions — enough to solidify himself as an early frontrunner for conservative voters, but a far cry from the millions that some Democratic contenders have already raised.\n\nThat leaves an opening for Hilton, 55, a native of the United Kingdom who moved to California in 2012 with his wife, a public relations executive for tech companies. Hilton has a built-in audience from hosting the weekly commentary program “The Next Revolution” on Fox News from 2017 to 2023, and Silicon Valley connections that could provide the money he needs to spread his message more broadly.\n\nHilton said his campaign will focus on practical solutions to rebuild a “ladder of opportunity,” so that every Californian can have a great job and a great home — though many of them are ideas that the Democratic supermajority in the Legislature is unlikely to ever support.\n\nHe would eliminate the state income tax for Californians below an unspecified income level. He wants to boost housing development by simplifying building codes, ending lawsuits under the infamous California Environmental Quality Act, and promoting construction of single-family homes. He believes the state needs mandatory phonics education and more accountability for teachers based on test scores to improve student achievement.\n\nThough he has had a long career in politics, Hilton has never held elected office himself, which he argues is an asset.\n\n“I would ask people, how good are the machine politicians in Sacramento who are involved in this one-party rule? How is that working?” Hilton said.\n\nBianco, 57, was a longtime sheriff’s deputy in Riverside County who ran for sheriff in 2018 out of frustration with what he called a “pro-criminal” approach to public safety in California. During his two terms as chief law enforcement officer of Riverside County, he has been a controversial but locally popular figure, refusing to enforce Newsom’s COVID lockdown orders or apologize for his brief affiliation with the far-right Oath Keepers militia. \n\nHe said he’s now running for governor because, like many Californians, he is tired of how the government has failed a state that people otherwise love. Many of his priorities align with Hilton’s: Bianco would like to completely abolish the state income tax, get rid of laws that he said are driving farmers and ranchers out of business, and leave environmental regulation to the federal government.\n\nAnd echoing the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative, Bianco said he wants to eliminate wasteful spending such as the high-speed rail project and multibillion-dollar programs that have not reduced homelessness.\n\n“The number one job of government is public safety,” Bianco said. “All the rest of it is fluff.”\n\nThe anti-Trump bump\n\nCalifornia Republicans have been jubilant since the November election, when they flipped three seats in the state Legislature as President Donald Trump increased his vote share in nearly every county. At a party convention in Sacramento last month, they strategized over how to build on the momentum by leaning into issues such as affordability and crime that appear to be helping them gain ground, particularly among Latino voters.\n\n“That tells us that Californians, on the local level and when it comes to the laws that are being passed in Sacramento, they’re looking to Republicans,” Corrine Rankin, the newly elected chairperson of the California Republican Party, said in an interview. “They’re rejecting the failures that are coming out of the Capitol by the Democrats.”\n\nIn a February survey by the Public Policy Institute of California, only 48% of likely voters said the state is going in the right direction, compared to 51% who said it’s going in the wrong direction — underwater, albeit the highest approval in two years.\n\nTo win the governorship next year, Rankin said the state GOP would eventually unite behind a candidate who can help Californians understand how that dissatisfaction is driven by what Democrats in charge of the state are doing.\n\n“We need change here in California. Californians expect change and we’re positioned to deliver,” she said.\n\nBut the modest advances of the last election belie a GOP that is still far from competitive in California. Trump only received about 38% of the vote, losing to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by more than 20 percentage points, and Republicans lost three U.S. House seats.\n\nThe 2026 midterms, in which Democratic anger at the Trump administration could produce an even more liberal electorate, will be a difficult political environment for the California GOP to snap a statewide shutout that dates back to 2010. In 2022, no Republican candidate for statewide office came within 10 percentage points of victory, and most lost by about twice that margin.\n\nAndrew Acosta, a Democratic political consultant who is not working on the governor’s race, said there are substantive problems in California for serious conservatives to campaign on. “The Republicans have a lot of fodder if they did it the right way,” he said.\n\nBut candidates so closely tied to Trump are unlikely to overcome the deep anti-Trump sentiment in the electorate and win the governorship next year, Acosta added. “There’s zero chance of these Republicans.”\n\nBoth Hilton and Bianco are vocal Trump supporters. Hilton’s campaign even references the MAGA movement with a “make California golden again” slogan, and he rolled out an endorsement on the first day from Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the architects of Trump’s DOGE initiative.\n\nThough some Democratic candidates are already tapping into the fury at Trump to fuel their campaigns, Hilton said the focus is misplaced.\n\n“None of that helps a single person in California,” he said. “These are real issues. So if Democrat candidates want to deflect from that and become national political commentators, then good luck with that.”\n\nBianco said Democrats have done “outstanding psychological warfare” for decades convincing people that Republicans cannot win in California, which has suppressed conservative participation in elections. But things have finally gotten so bad, he said, that those frustrated voters will turn out next year and elect a Republican governor.\n\n“We can’t blame Donald Trump. Donald Trump doesn’t have anything to do with California and the laws that have been passed in the past 20 years,” he said. “I believe that the majority of people, of hard-working Californians, have conservative leanings.”\n\nCalMatters is a public interest journalism venture committed to explaining how California’s state Capitol works and why it matters.","summary":"Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco lead the field of Republicans who hope to snap a long GOP losing streak in next year’s governor’s race.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/04/26/a-fox-host-a-sheriff-can-a-republican-become-governor-of-california-again/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Chad-Bianco.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 22:55:31","author":"Alexei Koseff • CalMatters","authors":["Alexei Koseff • CalMatters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":315184134,"title":"Pam Bondi ends Biden-era policy to smoke out leaks to journalists","text":"Journalists can be subject to court orders and search warrants for their phone records, notes and testimony as Donald Trump’s administration tries to hunt down “unauthorized disclosures” to reporters, according to a new memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nThe measure reverses Department of Justice policy under Joe Biden’s administration, which intended to protect freedom of the press from government interference and unlawful intimidation.\n\nBut an internal Justice Department memo from Bondi’s office claims that dropping the policy is necessary to prevent the release of not just “classified” information but “privileged and other sensitive information” — a much broader set of information that civil rights advocates fear could open reporters to law enforcement scrutiny for typical newsgathering, including revealing sources.\n\n“Some of the most consequential reporting in U.S. history — from Watergate to warrantless wiretapping after 9/11 — was and continues to be made possible because reporters have been able to protect the identities of confidential sources and uncover and report stories that matter to people across the political spectrum,” Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press president Bruce D.

Bringing an end to the lawsuit is seen as a way to expedite the approval process, though it remains unclear how the mediator will rule.\n\nA spokesman for Paramount declined to comment but would not deny Wednesday’s mediation; a lawyer for Trump didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nShari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount, has let it be known she wants to settle the case and appease other demands by the Trump FCC to push the deal through the regulatory approval process.\n\nThat would include meeting demands by Trump FCC chair Brendan Carr to end Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, which the Trump administration believes leads to illegal racial quotas in hiring.\n\nCarr also wants assurances that CBS will abide by FCC fairness rules for networks that broadcast over so-called public airwaves (as opposed to cable) that they refrain from political bias in news coverage.Now people inside Paramount and Skydance say they can see a path forward with Redstone likely settling with Trump, and the FCC becoming fully engaged in the deal on DEI and other matters. \n\nPeople at Skydance — which will be running Paramount and CBS if the deal is approved — are said to be ready to agree to Carr’s demands on ending DEI and making sure programming meets fairness metrics. (A Skydance rep declined to comment.) \n\nConservatives have long complained about political bias in new programming at CBS and “60 Minutes.” The network flouted so-called FCC “public interest” rules that demand unbiased news programming, they say. The FCC launched its probe earlier in the year following a public interest complaint about the Harris interview, and has been throttling the Skydance deal for months as it probes the charges made by a conservative legal group.\n\n“Finally we can see light at the end of the tunnel,” said one person working on the transaction.\n\nThat path could be costly in terms of money and prestige. Legal experts have questioned Trump’s case against CBS alleging deceptively edited word-salad answers in Harris’s October 2024 interview with “60 Minutes.” Among other things, they say the lawsuit failed to meet the high bar that the interview caused damages to Trump’s election efforts. Trump, after all, won the 2024 election. CBS. meanwhile, denies that it deceptively edited the piece.\n\nPlus, by caving to Trump — agreeing to pay money to settle the matter, or possibly issuing an apology — Redstone could damage the credibility of one of the most esteemed properties in TV journalism. If the mediator rules in favor of Trump and awards him anywhere near his $20 billion in damages, it would easily eat through the roughly $2.4 billion Redstone will earn as part of the Skydance deal.\n\nRedstone is obviously looking to shell out a lot less, and get the deal approved. \n\nThat means she might just offer up an apology for the coverage that Trump believes was biased and pay a smallish settlement. \n\nInsiders are hoping for a settlement along the lines of what ABC agreed to settle a defamation case brought by Trump, when it shelled out a total of $16 million and issued a statement of regret after star anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurately stated that the president was found liable for the rape of writer E. Jean Carroll.","summary":"Paramount and representatives of President Trump are scheduled to meet Wednesday before a mediator who will determine the fate of Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/26/business/high-stakes-paramount-trump-mediation-scheduled-as-prezs-60-minutes-lawsuit-looms/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103371687.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Oj8KX3vM-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-26 20:01:43","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":315155150,"title":"We checked in on American voters almost 100 days into Trump 2.0","text":"Before his return to the White House, US President Donald Trump promised the \"most extraordinary first 100 days of any presidency in American history\".\n\nIn many ways, he's delivered.\n\nWith the swish of his black marker, Trump has signed a record-breaking number of orders, up-ending American institutions, reshaping international relationships, and sending US and global markets seesawing.\n\nSince January 20, his administration has:\n\nWithdrawn foreign aid and dismantled the US Agency for International Development (USAID)Directed agencies to shut down their offices focused on diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI) and accessibilityDiscussed plans to take control of Greenland, the Panama Canal, and even CanadaUsed a 1798 law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants, some of them to an El Salvador prison without due processCaused global economic turmoil by imposing tariffs on almost every country, before pausing most of them\n\nThe 100-day milestone has always carried cultural significance in US politics. \n\nIt's a moment to take stock of a new leader's progress and how American voters are feeling about their choice.\n\nWith Trump due to hit the 100-day milestone on April 29, 40 per cent of Americans approve of his job performance — a 7 per cent decline since February.\n\nWhile he retains high support among his base, his economic management has taken a hit, with 59 per cent of Americans disapproving of his tariffs policy, according to a poll by Pew.\n\nBefore he was elected, the ABC spoke to a sample of voters across America about whether they planned to back Trump, or his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.\n\nThree months later, we've revisited the same voters to hear how they're digesting Trump's return to the White House.\n\n'He will say something insane … but then he backs off'\n\nWhen the ABC last spoke with Christine Cloud, she was looking forward to casting her vote for Trump in the crucial swing state of Nevada.\n\nAngry about having to move in with her stepfather due to a rising cost of living, the former Democrat believed Trump would bring the price of everyday items down.\n\nNow months later, the 64-year-old retiree is \"keeping her fingers crossed\" that Trump knows what he's doing.\n\n\"Every now and then I'm like, 'I hope this is going in the right direction,'\" she said, referencing Trump's aggressive trade policy that's rattled the global economy.\n\n\"But you have to go through a little pain to get to the other side.\"\n\nDespite rising inflation, fears of a recession and a trade war, Ms Cloud is quick to say she has no regrets about voting for Trump and doesn't believe she's any worse off financially than she was when Joe Biden was at the helm. \n\n\"As long as I can still make my bills and I don't get in financial trouble,\" she said.\n\nShe's pleased with the administration's \"lightning speed\" and feels the president has fulfilled the promises he made on the campaign trail \"more so than any president I've seen in my lifetime\".\n\nBut she's not thrilled with everything she's seen in the last 100 days.\n\nShe said she cringed at the public blow-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and that talk of taking over Canada was \"just nuts\". \n\nBut she believes that behind the bluster, there's a strategy. \n\n\"He will say something insane … but then he backs off. And I think it just gets the conversation going on purpose,\" she said.\n\nOverall, Ms Cloud feels hopeful. \n\n\"Americans just aren't used to someone being bold and trying to get stuff done because we had great grandpa in charge for so long,\" she said.\n\n'Trump don't have respect for nobody'\n\nMaurice Combs, a Democrat, can't stand bullies. \n\nThe 51-year-old barber from the Deep South has spent his life trying to impart positive values to those whose hair he cuts, \"from drug dealers to politicians\". \n\nBut with Trump back in office, he's worried basic standards of human decency are being abandoned — teaching younger generations all the wrong lessons. \n\nNow, he sees a nation in decline with a bully at the helm. \n\n\"We, the people, make up the government,\" Mr Combs said from his home in Atlanta, Georgia. \n\n\"But we got a bunch of tyrants now, it's like an oligarch — do as I say, not as I do.\"\n\nFor Black communities and minority groups, Mr Combs fears dark times are ahead. \n\nHe describes the treatment of immigrants by the Trump administration as \"disgusting\".\n\n\"It feels like everything is falling down and it's falling down at the base,\" he said. \n\n\"The basis of the whole American dream, the basis of the amendments and everything that we hold true. It's a joke now … and that's the scary part.\"\n\nAs for his finances, Mr Combs says he's \"definitely\" been struggling more in the past few months.\n\nFirst he noticed a rise in groceries. Then came his insurance bill. \n\n\"I've had to cut back on a lot of things,\" he said.\n\n\"Trump don't have respect for nobody but people with money. He forgot about the small people.\"\n\nHe hopes Trump's presidency will serve as a \"wake-up call\" to Americans, and believes the only thing that can restore stability and integrity to the nation is divine intervention. \n\n\"God bless, not just America but the world. For real. Because you got a lot of nefarious people in high places making decisions … and we got billions of people on this planet,\" he said.\n\n'I don't think he sleeps'\n\nRepublican Cristina Junge is ecstatic. \n\nDuring the past 100 days, she has marvelled at the breakneck speed the president has set to fulfil promises made on the campaign trail. \n\n\"I don't think he sleeps. He's always go, go, go, go and doing, doing, doing,\" she said. \n\nThe 80-year-old retiree lives in a retirement village outside of Phoenix, Arizona — not far from the Mexican border where claims of a migrant \"invasion\" were salient in the 2024 election campaign.\n\nSo on day one in office, when Trump began making good on his promise to carry out \"the largest mass deportation\" of undocumented migrants in history, Ms Junge was delighted. \n\n\"They don't belong here because they're not even American,\" she said. \n\nA migrant herself, Ms Junge moved to the US \"the legal way\" from Colombia in the 1960s. \n\nShe believes Trump's claim that he's fighting a war against \"terrorists\", fentanyl and crime caused by undocumented immigrants. \n\nThen, days after his inauguration, Trump proclaimed the US government will recognise only two sexes, male and female.\n\n\"That was absolutely beautiful,\" Ms Junge said. \"Trump believes in family, in faith and in country … the three most important things.\"\n\nPrior to Trump's return, Ms Junge saw a nation \"headed for bankruptcy\" that didn't care for its own citizens. \n\nShe said Trump had now given young people \"a future to look to\", a more united country, and a much-needed change for the world. \n\n\"If anyone is going to unite this country it's Trump … this is a fight between good and evil and I think that good will always triumph,\" she said.\n\n'I'm just disappointed in America at the moment'\n\nAs far as Erica Sampson's concerned, Trump is not her president. \n\n\"I don't care that he has the title, he's just not my president,\" she said. \n\n\"He should be like a party clown, he would be great at kid's parties … but as someone who's the leader of America? No, that ain't it.\"\n\nWe first met the single mum at a phone bank in South Carolina. \n\nThe 37-year-old HR professional dedicated weeks of her life campaigning for Harris in the hope the nation would elect its first Black female president.\n\nToday, Ms Sampson is deflated, the frustration in her voice palpable. \n\n\"I'm just disappointed in America at the moment,\" she said. \n\n\"These are terrible times … you turn on your TV and you're constantly reminded that all that work, it just went nowhere.\"\n\nTo her mind, Trump's worst action has been the stripping away of DEI initiatives. But after all her advocacy, she's decided to just sit back and let it play. \n\nShe was hoping to buy a house for her and her three children, but with a teetering economy, she's put that dream on hold.\n\nShe describes Trump's \"my way or no way\" leadership style as being bereft of empathy or respect for the rule of law.\n\n\"It's definitely giving authoritarian and dictatorship,\" she said. \n\n\"Because he's in this position, it's like we [Americans] are an extension of him, we're like an association of him.\"\n\nBut Ms Sampson says she's not frustrated at Trump. She's frustrated by the Americans who voted for him.\n\n\"He showed y'all, and then he told y'all,\" she said. \n\n\"You didn't think he was going to do it but now that it's affecting you it's a problem. No, it was a problem when you put his name on the ballot.\"\n\n'We're nervous'\n\nFourth-generation grain and dairy farmer Les Danielson has just finished planting this year's crop of soybeans on his farm in northern Wisconsin. \n\nWith a simmering trade war, Mr Danielson has no idea if they'll be worth anything come harvest time in September when they will be bound for export to nations like Malaysia and Thailand.\n\n\"We're nervous,\" Mr Danielson said of his farming community. \n\n\"He's made a colossal bet on this trade thing, and it could greatly affect the US economy for better or worse going forward.\"\n\nMr Danielson, who voted for Harris, believes the true impact of Trump's aggressive and unprecedented trade policies won't be felt right away. \n\nBut if the worst happens, he's facing the prospect of earning no profit and sinking further into debt.\n\n\"Imagine going to your job, working all year, and at the end of the year you made no money, you actually lost money,\" he said. \n\n\"If the worst hits, farmers will basically work all year for nothing.\"\n\nTrump has urged Americans to \"hang tough\", but speculation is mounting that the president might need to re-introduce a taxpayer-funded bailout brought in during his first term to compensate farmers facing financial ruin. \n\n\"It's no secret that farmers have overwhelmingly supported Trump in the past,\" Mr Danielson said.\n\n\"A lot of them are still supportive but once you start paying high prices in stores and you receive lower prices for your products, that's where the loyalty test will really happen.\" \n\nUntil then, he's hoping that come September, some brakes will have been applied to Trump's policies and all trade alliances will be restored.\n\n'He's doing the hard work to make our country better'\n\nWhen Trump first ran for office in 2016, neither Stephen nor Holly Purcell were big fans.\n\nMs Purcell once considered herself a lifelong Democrat, but she became fed up with what she calls \"the wokeness\" in the party, and flipped Republican. \n\nShe believes Trump is \"exactly what we need right now\".\n\nMr Purcell has been a registered Libertarian for 20 years. \n\nBut it was talk from Trump of reviving America's industrial heartlands that earned him Mr Purcell's vote. \n\n\"It was refreshing.

We haven't seen any light at the end of the tunnel for decades. It'd be nice to have work coming back to our country instead of leaving it.\"\n\nAs he sees it, Trump's tough trade talk is simply the art of the deal. \n\n\"He goes way beyond where we need to be and then everyone meets in the middle so I don't think he's overstepping, he's just in the negotiation process,\" he said.\n\nOverall, the Purcells are concerned about what could come next after Trump's second term. \n\n\"I just hope Americans are proud enough to weather any kind of difficulty so that we'll be stronger in the long run,\" Mr Purcell said.\n\n'It just seems very Orwellian'\n\nNineteen-year-old university student Eva Eapen aspires to one day work in government or academia, but today she's demoralised at the prospect.\n\nMs Eapen studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), and said it had been hit with funding cuts \"left and right\".\n\n\"There's a culture of fear and distrust of authority, of institutions, of UNC, of the government,\" she said.\n\n\"It just seems very Orwellian.\"\n\nThe political science and public policy student cast her vote for the first time last year in support of Harris. She felt confident the former attorney-general would uphold the constitution.\n\nNow that Trump is back in the White House, she says America has seen a president \"wage war\" on the judiciary and show a chilling disregard for the rule of law.\n\n\"To me, that is extremely frightening,\" Ms Eapen said, referring to the government defying a court order to deport a man with legal status to a prison in El Salvador, and later calling it an \"administrative error\".\n\n\"We are in an ocean of news that all seems catastrophic but the gravity of the executive branch wilfully defying the judiciary is … to me, it's democratic backsliding.\n\n\"He is willing to erode institutions and trample amendments and reach for power in a very brazen way.\n\n\"We are slipping and sliding into a constitutional crisis … it's imminent.\"\n\n'We've been on a bullet train'\n\nPittsburgh lawyer Eric Jackson Lurie was elated when Trump was elected, and he's impressed with how quickly the president is ticking off his to-do list.\n\n\"The first 100 days, we've been on a bullet train,\" Mr Lurie said. \"He's just checking off boxes.\"\n\nTwo early actions stand out.\n\nThe first: declaring foreign gangs in the US as terrorists.\n\n\"I'm a criminal defence attorney, so I see this stuff firsthand,\" Mr Lurie said.\n\n\"Declaring them as terrorists freed law enforcement … to go after a lot of these criminal elements in this country.\"\n\nThe second: the \"common sense result\" of removing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies from government and the military.

Ideja e manjatit për të kandiduar për një mandat të tretë në Shtëpinë e Bardhë, tashmë e mbështetur edhe nga këto produkte të markuara, duket se po bëhet gjithnjë e më konkrete. “Le të rishkruajmë rregullat”, është apeli i drejtuar mbështetësve të presidentit dhe i printuar në bluza të kuqe dhe blu. Kushtetuta e Shteteve të Bashkuara, në fakt, dhe në veçanti Amendamenti i 22-të, e ndalon një lider të Uashingtonit të udhëheqë vendin tre herë: “Asnjë person nuk mund të zgjidhet President më shumë se dy herë”. Trump, megjithatë, ka lënë të kuptohet në mënyrë të përsëritur, në mënyra pak a shumë të fshehura, për qëllimin e tij për të kandiduar përsëri pas tre vjetësh si kandidat republikan. “Ka mënyra për ta bërë këtë”, tha ai, duke theksuar se nuk po bënte shaka. Drejtori i Komunikimit i Shtëpisë së Bardhë, Steven Cheung, përsëriti në një deklaratë për Axios se Trump mendon se “është shumë herët për të menduar” për një mandat të tretë. Por studiuesit thonë se po i marrin seriozisht komentet e Trump.\n\n“Ngacmimet” e Trump\n\nTrump e ka përmendur vazhdimisht idenë se ai do të kandidonte për një mandat të tretë si president. Në fund të marsit, Trump nuk përjashtoi mundësinë e rizgjedhjes në vitin 2028. “Shumë njerëz duan që unë ta bëj atë”, tha Trump për NBC News atëherë. “Por, dua të them, në thelb u them atyre se kemi një rrugë të gjatë për të bërë, e dini, është shumë herët në administratë.” I pyetur nga NBC nëse donte një mandat të tretë, Trump tha: “Më pëlqen të punoj”. “Nuk po bëj shaka”, tha Trump. “Por është shumë herët për të menduar për këtë.” “Ka metoda që ju mund ta bëni atë,” tha presidenti, duke iu referuar një mandati tjetër. “Unë dyshoj se nuk do të kandidoj më, nëse nuk thoni, ‘Ai është aq i mirë sa duhet të kuptojmë diçka tjetër’”, thuhet se u tha Trump republikanëve gjatë një takimi privat pas fitores së tij elektorale të nëntorit ndaj ish-zëvendëspresidentes demokrate Kamala Harris.\n\nMandati i tretë\n\nNë maj 2024, ndërsa fliste me anëtarët e Shoqatës Kombëtare të Pushkës, Trump tha: “Nuk e di, a do të konsiderohemi me tre mandate apo me dy mandate? Jemi me tre mandate apo me dy mandate nëse fitojmë?” Ish-këshilltari i Shtëpisë së Bardhë Steve Bannon tha në “Real Time with Bill Maher” më 11 prill se “Presidenti Trump do të kandidojë për një mandat të tretë dhe Presidenti Trump do të zgjidhet përsëri”. “Në pasditen e 20 janarit 2029, ai do të jetë president i Shteteve të Bashkuara,” parashikoi Bannon. Bannon tha gjithashtu, “Ne kemi një ekip njerëzish që kërkojnë të mundësojnë një mandat të tretë për Trump”. Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., në fillim të janarit prezantoi një rezolutë të Dhomës për të ndryshuar Kushtetutën për të lejuar Trump dhe çdo president tjetër të ardhshëm të zgjidhet për një mandat të tretë. Rezoluta e Ogles është përshtatur posaçërisht për të lejuar Trump të shërbejë një mandat të tretë, por jo për të lejuar tre ish-presidentët e gjallë me dy mandate të shërbejnë një mandat të tretë.\n\nAmendamenti i 22-të si pengesë\n\n“Asnjë person nuk mund të zgjidhet në detyrën e Presidentit më shumë se tre herë dhe as të zgjidhet në asnjë mandat shtesë pasi të jetë zgjedhur në dy mandate radhazi”, thuhet në amendament. Ai u propozua në 1947 pas vdekjes së ish-presidentit Franklin D. Roosevelt gjatë mandatit të tij të katërt dhe u ratifikua në 1951. Ai gjithashtu vendos kufij për ata që marrin presidencën, si në rastin e vdekjes së presidentit para përfundimit të mandatit të tyre. Nëse një nënkryetar merr detyrën në një mandat të papërfunduar dhe shërben për më shumë se dy vjet, ai mund të kandidojë për zgjedhje vetëm një herë. Ndryshe nga Trump, ish-presidentët Bill Clinton, George W. Bush dhe Barack Obama shërbyen të gjithë nga dy mandate radhazi. Ish-presidenti Joe Biden shërbeu një mandat.","summary":"Bluza, kapele, të gjitha me logon “Trump 2028”.

I didn’t know,’ he told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nHe was also asked if he is interested to meet the former President of the country, to which he replied, ‘It’s not high on my list. It’s really not.’\n\nIt is known to everyone that these men had a bitter rivalry in the 2020 election, which Joe Biden eventually won. Then the contest continued again on 2024 where he eventually dropped out of the race and Donald Trump emerged as the President of the United States for the second time. \n\nOur president represented our nation in the solemn funeral mass of Pope Francis at St Peter’s Basilica.

He has also questioned Trump’s mental capabilities, and marked him as the reason behind increasing inflation and shaky stock market. No one is unware of the consistent disputes between both of them. Ever since Trump began his second term, he has repeatedly bashed Biden on several occasions. \n\nThe President casually dressed for Friday for the eight-hour flight with his tie off and shirt unbuttoned, and he told the reporters that he was attending service partially because he won Catholic voters in the 2024 election.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nTrump is said to have won the Catholics by more than 120,000 votes when he locked horns against the former Vice President Kamala Harris. It was primarily Trump’s anti-abortion policies along with the appointment of the conservative judges onto the Supreme court who eventually overturned Roe vs. Wade – that put the voting bloc in his corner.\n\nIn the 2020 election, Trump and Biden nearly split the Catholic vote evenly. Biden, notably, became the second Catholic U.S. president after John F. Kennedy.\n\nDonald Trump himself identifies himself as a ‘non-denominational Christian.’ And on the other hand, First lady Melania Trump is Catholic.","summary":"Tension lingers as Trump and Biden cross paths in Rome—but not a single word is exchanged.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-and-joe-biden-sat-just-rows-apart-at-pope-francis-funeral-but-didnt-exchange-a-word","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trump-and-Biden-Avoid-Each-Other-at-Pope-Franciss-Farewell.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 16:33:31","author":"Mayukh B","authors":["Mayukh B"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":315215188,"title":"Democratic strategist explains why AOC doesn’t have ‘broad appeal’","text":"Democratic strategist Julian Epstein explained on Newsmax Friday why Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could not expand her popularity beyond the progressive left.\n\nIn a CNN/SSRS poll conducted on March 16, 10% of Democratic-leaning adults said Ocasio-Cortez best represents the core values of the Democratic Party. During an appearance on “Finnerty,” Epstein said that while AOC commands attention within the progressive “bubble,” she has failed to connect with centrist voters or the broader American electorate.\n\n“I think she’s got incredible appeal within the progressive bubble. But I don’t think she has broad appeal beyond that. I don’t think she has appealed to the centrists of the party and certainly not a majority of the American electorate,” Epstein said when host Rob Finnerty suggested Ocasio-Cortez was “the real deal,” citing her massive social media following and energetic crowds.\n\nEpstein then criticized the political culture that he said Ocasio-Cortez embodies, comparing it to an “OnlyFans-type” model that prioritizes online activism and identity politics over mainstream electoral appeal.\n\n“The problem I think that the Democrats have is that they are no longer responding to voters, which is why the brand is so toxic. You look at the approval rating of congressional Democrats. It’s in the 20s,” Epstein said. “And AOC highlights what I think is becoming the culture, which is it’s becoming an OnlyFans type of culture.”\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez remains a hero among progressive activists, Epstein predicted she would struggle to break through to the American mainstream, a challenge he believes reflects deeper problems within the Democratic Party itself.\n\n“These politicians are interested in appealing increasingly to a narrow cast of online activists, donors, foundations, activists who will all exalt them as heroes within the progressive movement, all of whom depend on this sort of identity grievance politics,” Epstein said. “But it doesn’t have broad appeal. So I think while she’s very popular within progressive activist circles, I don’t see the appeal being wider than that.”\n\nFormer Democratic Senate candidate Morgan Harper said Tuesday that Ocasio-Cortez could face challenges winning over Midwestern voters if she runs for president in 2028. Harper told Fox News that although Ocasio-Cortez promotes “economic populism,” her background and message may not easily resonate in the Midwest.\n\nOcasio-Cortez tied for third place in voter support with Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker in a hypothetical 2028 Democratic presidential primary, according to a Data for Progress poll released April 16, trailing only former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

There, Gladstone said to reporters: 'As we sit here, Travis Hunter is Jacksonville Jaguar. And really what comes to mind for me, right, thinking about the sport of football. And the power of the game itself. It is capacity to ignite belief. Belief in ourselves, belief in others, belief in achieving what many deem as impossible. \n\n'Travis Hunter, he embodies belief. He is a rare person. He is a rare player. But he is also a reminder that the boundaries of the game of football were built to be challenged. And so the decision to select him was actually a statement. A statement for how we plan to move, who were are. \n\n'And we want him to be nothing more than him. Because when he is, he elevates the space around him. From the football field, to the city, to the game of football itself. Travis Hunter is who we have been hunting up. Couldn’t be more jacked to be sitting right here beside him and to introduce you to the man of the hour.' \n\nThere were some NFL fans, even outside of the Jaguars, who thought it was an epic introduction for a generational talent. But plenty thought it was over-the-top, including Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars took Travis Hunter with the 2nd pick in Thursday's NFL Draft\n\nJacksonville Jaguars GM James Gladstone gave a lengthy speech to welcome Hunter\n\nStatement made.#DUUUVAL pic.twitter.com/qmje44HXOX\n— Jacksonville Jaguars (@Jaguars) April 25, 2025\n\n'Between the Duval thing and this the Jags seeming more like a weird cult than a football team,' Portnoy said. \n\nThe 'Duval thing' is a the 'Duval' chant Jags fans sing at NFL games. Coen tried to copy it at his own introductory press conference earlier this year but was visibly uncomfortable, making it an awkward viral meme rather than the inspiring moment it was meant to be.\n\nThere were plenty of fans in agreement with Portnoy, with one responding to the Jags video by saying: 'I’m going to tell my kids that this is Kamala Harris. Word salad much?'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Dude thinks he’s Shakespeare... what the hell is this?'\n\nA different take suggested Gladstone might have been trying too hard to underline his own authority, saying: 'That GM has read too many leadership books. Needs to chill lol but good for him on that role at a young age.'\n\nGladstone was confirmed as the Jags' GM in February, leaving his role as director of strategy at the Los Angeles Rams to steer the ship in Jacksonville.\n\nAlongside newly-appointed head coach Coen, there is certainly more reason for optimism around the franchise after their 4-13 campaign in 2024.\n\nTheir woes last season were compounded by quarterback Trevor Lawrence missing the end of the season with a concussion.\n\nNot all fans were impressed - some compared it to a 'Kamala Harris word salad'\n\nHe got concussed from a hit from Texans linebacker Azzes Al-Shaair on Dec. 1 and then underwent surgery on his AC joint on his non-throwing shoulder. \n\nWith or without Gladstone's speech, there will be huge excitement around the Jaguars with Hunter on the roster when the new season begins in September.\n\nThe NFL is going to announce the 2025 season schedule on May 14. \n\nKamala HarrisJacksonville Jaguars\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nJaguars GM's toe-curling Travis Hunter speech compared to Kamala Harris 'word salad'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Jacksonville Jaguars GM James Gladstone gave an epic Hollywood-style speech on Friday as he introduced Travis Hunter - but not everyone thought it was a good look. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14650685/Jaguars-GM-cringe-Travis-Hunter-speech-compared-Kamala-Harris.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/26/16/97726371-0-image-m-12_1745680991615.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 15:27:16","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.062},{"id":315127230,"title":"Even MAGA loyalists are getting sick of Trump’s lies","text":"President Donald Trump just can’t stop lying about egg prices.\n\n“Gas and grocery prices are WAY DOWN, just like I said they would be. Eggs are plentiful, and down 87%. NICE!” he wrote on Truth Social Thursday.\n\nThe reality is that egg prices are up and gas and grocery prices are still higher than when Trump took office. And tariffs have only just begun to hit, which will further impact prices in the coming months. \n\nReality has never deterred Trump from making bold lies, as he’s more than happy to gaslight the entire country—including his own base.

Their responses were shockingly and consistently negative.\n\nHere’s a screenshot in case the thread gets deleted—a common occurrence in conservative forums:\n\nLet’s take a closer look at some of these comments.\n\nGreed is going on. Trump is going to have to publicly put the squeeze on the individuals who are refusing to lower prices on things like gas and eggs (and many others).\n\nRemember when Vice President Kamala Harris proposed cracking down on corporate greed, and conservatives screeched about “socialism?” \n\nPrices will absolutely not drop as long as the free market is allowed to price-gouge consumers, so I wouldn’t hate it if Trump set the precedent for a little socialism. \n\nSadly Trump is talking about bulk prices. In the end, people will pay whatever they think something is worth, and everyone takes advantage. Corporate greed.\n\nLook at MAGA loyalists suddenly discovering corporate greed! Feels like progress, doesn’t it? Or will they forget all about it the second they can use high prices to attack Democrats? \n\nYeah, yeah … of course they’ll revert to form once Democrats are back in power.\n\nGroceries are still way higher than before inflation. eggs are not back either, just not $1 an egg anymore. just because they can’t stay up once they stop killing chickens. but surprisingly still $4.99 a dozen at albertsons. used to be $1.50 before inflation per dozen.\n\nIt really is fascinating how Trump has lied in such a way that even his most loyal supporters are starting to get pissed off. \n\nDespite all of the screaming about trans kids and immigrants, Trump won predominantly on his promise to lower prices. And for the first time perhaps ever, a Republican presidential candidate won the vote among those making less than $50,000 per year—people who are now really feeling prices increasing.\n\nTrump sold those voters on the promise that he would lower prices on Day 1, and as stupid as that promise was—and as stupid as Trump is—people were desperate enough to vote for it.\n\nBut these aren’t people who will suddenly forget that prices are still kicking their asses. So Trump telling them that those prices are “WAY DOWN” isn’t flying.\n\nThe good news is that’s what’s going to take down the GOP in the 2026 midterms. \n\nAs much as I want the election to be about democracy, abortion rights, due process, and all that good stuff, if we want a massive blue tsunami, it’s going to be on the economy and nothing else. \n\nI’m not saying that we should ignore the other stuff! Trump certainly didn’t ignore the base-building stuff like transphobia and anti-immigrant xenophobia. But when we message the broader electorate, it has to be economy, economy, economy. \n\nShit went up like 30%, down by 1 %… overall still up 29%… MISSION ACCOMPLISHED\n\nPeople are pissed. You can feel the disdain. \n\nUnpopular take, but accurate. He's talking as if the problem is solved and it's nowhere near solved. He's going to lose a lot of support among the fencesitters if he's just going to dust his hands off now and say, \"OK...that's enough of that.\n\nTrump’s problem is that he never gave a damn about grocery prices or helping people, so he’s having a hard time pretending to care about inflation.\n\nFor the love of god, Trump, STFU\n\nImagine that—we’re finding common ground with MAGA!\n\nYeah, just like the Democrats he thinks the people that voted for him are retards. Birds of a feather.\n\nNothing wrong with a little bit of gaslighting but celebrating now smells bad. Lower taxes and fix the tariff situation first (please).\n\nIs there anything more MAGA than “nothing wrong with a little bit of gaslighting?” \n\nThe impression is that nothing more will be done to fix the prices. We should accept crumbs instead of the whole cookie.\n\nThat has always been the Trump way! Why are people now acting shocked that he doesn’t give a damn about anyone? \n\nI think President Trump and the admin don't realize that people are keeping a really sharp eye on gas and grocery prices and NOBODY is going to believe bullshit statements about how prices are going down. This is not a smart strategy because what we see as exaggeration, most are going to interpret as a lie.\n\nIt is a lie. Also, it’s an exaggeration. The two are not mutually exclusive. \n\nI doubt he's set foot in a supermarket in decades.\n\nI mean, Trump does think that the word “grocery” is an old-fashioned term. \n\n“It’s such an old-fashioned term but a beautiful term: groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it,” he said.\n\nSo I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that he has never set foot in a supermarket—other than for a photo op. He hasn’t had to ever worry about buying groceries because someone has always done it for him.\n\nCongrats, MAGA, you are just learning this now. \n\nI wish he would stop lying about this. Inflation at the grocery store has just about come to a halt, but I am not seeing prices for anything go DOWN, other than maybe 20-30% for eggs, which are still about $ 4 a dozen here. For reference, they were $ 1-1.50/dozen during his first term.\n\nPeople are taking close note of prices because they have no choice. And they sure as hell will notice when prices start going back up because of Trump’s tariffs and the mass deportation of agriculture workers. \n\nTo be very clear, I’m still not seeing any major erosion in Trump’s support in any polling. Republicans still back him to the hilt. But this kind of unease and discontent will only grow as the economy heads south. \n\nIf anything, I’m just surprised that one of the most ardently pro-Trump corners of the internet is already having these sorts of misgivings. But, hey, I’ll take what I can get.","summary":"President Donald Trump just can’t stop lying about egg prices.\n\n\n\n“Gas and grocery prices are WAY DOWN, just like I said they would be.

'When we get back in power, the instinct will be to rebuild the old system. Rebuild USAID. Rebuild the broken institutions.'\n\n'Wrong move,' he said. \n\n'If we do that, we’re going to give Republicans a massive opening in 2032 to elect someone way worse than Trump. If we play our cards right, we’ve got a rare shot - maybe a once-in-a-generation shot - to build something better.' \n\nHe went on to say that the 'system was broken' and it isn't working for most Americans anymore. Yet, Democrats continued to defend it viciously, despite citizens wanting change. \n\n'And sure, Trump made it worse,' the former Kamala Harris advisor told the outlet. 'He’s created chaos, jacked up prices, lined his own pockets while everyone else struggles.' \n\nBut he said the 'real danger' for Democrat leaders' is saying they're going back to the old ways. \n\nEven 2028 contender and former Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, has been echoing similar statements. \n\nOn a recent episode of Flagrant, a podcast, he advised Democrats to 'revisit... what is it we're offering.' \n\n'It sounds like what we're offering if just: \"Let's go back,\"' the politician said. \n\nLast month, a CNN poll found the Democratic Party's favorability had a hit brutal low. \n\nAmong Americans overall, the Democratic Party's favorability rating stands at just 29 percent, CNN found.\n\nIt's the lowest favorability the party has seen since CNN first started conducting its polling back in 1992.\n\nIt's also a 20-point drop in approval since Trump left office more than four years ago at which time approval of the Democratic party was 49 percent.\n\nIt's also a 10-point drop from just before the November election.\n\nDemocrats are desperate to change their reputation among voters, while actively fighting against Trump, whom they have branded an oligarch. \n\nSenator Mallory McMorrow is among the Democratic brood that is looking for a party rebrand. \n\n'When I talk to people all across the state, people just don’t believe that success is possible for them anymore,' she told NBC News. \n\n'What we are laying out is that in the rubble that will be left behind by Donald Trump - who is now, between him and Elon Musk, taking a chainsaw to the government - that there will be an opportunity to build something new and acknowledge that trust in institutions is gone for a lot of people' \n\nParkland shooting survivor and DNC Vice Chair, David Hogg, also thinks the Democratic Party needs to become younger and older politicians not meeting voter standards need to move out of the way. \n\n'What we’re trying to do here is make sure that we’re holding ourselves accountable and letting people know that if there’s somebody who’s failing to meet the moment in this moment of crisis that our country is in,' they will be gone,' he said. \n\nThe DNC even announced recently that it would up investments across all 50 states, especially in red ones. \n\n'I’m done with Democrats myopically focusing on just a few battleground states every few years.

Shortly before Trump was sworn into office, Biden’s FDA proposed a rule that it described at the time as \"bold\" that \"would make cigarettes and certain other combusted tobacco products minimally or nonaddictive by limiting the level of nicotine in those products.\" Cigarettes and \"certain other combusted tobacco products\" would not be allowed to have more than 0.7 milligrams of nicotine per gram of tobacco under the proposed rule, according to the FDA. The agency said that lower nicotine levels would \"be low enough to no longer create or sustain addiction.\" While the FDA insisted at the time that the rule \"would not ban\" cigarettes, critics disagree and are optimistic that Trump will continue his push for nicotine freedom and upend the rule. TRUMP FDA NOMINEE TURNS VACCINE QUESTION ON DEM, RECALLING CONTROVERSIAL BIDEN DECISION \"The Biden legacy on tobacco policy is one of hamfisted regulations, crippling bureaucracy, and prohibition fueling massive criminal markets — from cigarettes to Chinese vapes,\" Rich Marianos, former assistant director of the ATF, executive director of the Tobacco Law Enforcement Network, told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump can put the nail in the coffin of that failed era by killing this insane ban on cigarettes and focusing resources on vigilant enforcement.\" Peter Brennan, Executive Director of the New England Convenience Store & Energy Marketers Association (NECSEM), told Fox News Digital that \"prohibitionist tobacco policy\" ends up punishing small businesses by \"taking sales out of our stores and pushing them into the streets and the illicit market.\" FDA PHASING OUT SOME ANIMAL TESTING IN 'WIN-WIN' FOR ETHICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH: COMMISSIONER \"Biden’s plan to ban all cigarettes is a real threat that is still hanging over our heads.\" Brennan said. \"We are hopeful that President Trump will help America’s convenience stores by putting a stop to this disastrous idea.\" Trump has taken several actions in the nicotine space since taking office, including withdrawing a proposed rule seeking to ban menthol cigarettes, after the Biden administration said it intended to make the ban become a reality after years of advocacy from anti-smoking groups. Months later, FDA Tobacco Director Brian King, who critics believed was a key figure behind the administration’s efforts against banning menthols and the \"war on nicotine\" was removed from his post in a move that experts who spoke to Fox News Digital praised earlier this month. \"President Trump has succeeded in his nicotine freedom crusade since taking office, repealing Biden’s misguided menthol ban and firing the FDA architect behind it,\" a Republican strategist who worked to elect Trump in 2024 told Fox News Digital this week. \"The logical next step is to officially repeal a Biden-era rule on banning low nicotine products, which will be the final blow to Biden’s war on nicotine.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the FDA for comment.

Many Latinos who once backed him now feel let down, especially because of how immigration policies have played out. According to a fresh Pew Research Center poll, about 72% of Latinos disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job, and 54% disapprove strongly. Only Black Americans showed a higher disapproval rate at 82%. This sharp drop matters because Trump had actually made surprising gains among Latino voters in the last election. Exit polls show that Latinos swung 19 points toward Trump compared to the 2020 election results. Even though Vice President Kamala Harris still captured a slight majority of Latino votes, 52% to 46%, it was a big change from Biden's 33-point lead in 2020. Overall, the Pew poll shows 59% of Americans disapprove of Trump, while 40% approve. Among Whites, the numbers are more evenly split, with 49% approving (including 39% strongly approving). Among Asian Americans, the disapproval rate stands at 69% compared to just 29% approving. Why is support for Trump among Latinos collapsing so quickly? The main reason? Immigration policies. Many Latinos who had placed their hopes in Trump feel abandoned. One big sore spot is Trump's move to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans, a decision that is currently being fought in court. Ronald Bellorin, a Venezuelan immigrant who fled to the U.S. during Trump’s first term, told the Washington Post how betrayed he feels. Today, I feel the same way I felt in Venezuela—that they're going to come take me somewhere I won't be able to escape from, he shared, tearing up as he recounted his family’s journey. I thought we would be safe here. Stories like Ronald’s are becoming more common, especially among immigrant communities who once thought Trump would be their champion. What happened to Trump's strong Latino support in places like Florida? Florida tells an interesting story. Trump had made major inroads with Latino voters there, especially among Venezuelan Americans. In Doral, Florida—often nicknamed Doralzuela because around 40% of residents have Venezuelan roots—Trump flipped the city. He lost Doral in 2016, but in 2024, he won with 62% of the vote, beating Kamala Harris by 25 points. Many Venezuelan Americans felt Trump understood their struggle with socialism back home. That's why this feeling of betrayal cuts even deeper now. John De La Vega, a Venezuelan American immigration lawyer and Army veteran, said it plainly: The Venezuelan community gave President Trump their support. This is completely different from what I thought it was going to be. How are changes to immigration programs fueling Latino anger? Beyond TPS, the Trump administration has taken action against several immigration programs that many Latinos depended on. For instance, the CBP One app, a Biden-era tool that let asylum seekers schedule appointments, is now being targeted. Migrants using the app are being told to self-deport or risk being permanently barred from entering the U.S. Another blow? The administration is also working to undo the CHNV program, which allowed over 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans sponsored by Americans to enter legally. Programs helping Colombians, Ecuadorians, Central Americans, Haitians, and Cubans reunite with U.S.-based family members are also under threat, causing even more worry in immigrant communities. Are Republicans still backing Trump despite these shifts? Yes, but there's some erosion there too. According to the Pew survey, about 75% of Republicans still approve of Trump's performance. However, about 24% now disapprove, and 14% disapprove strongly. Meanwhile, more than 9 in 10 Democrats disapprove of Trump, with just 7% approving. The growing dissatisfaction among some Republicans, especially those with ties to immigrant communities, shows that Trump's base isn't entirely immune to these policy shifts. What could this mean for Trump moving forward? Losing Latino support could have serious consequences. The Latino vote has been growing steadily in importance, especially in battleground states like Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. If Trump's immigration policies continue to alienate Latino voters, he might find it harder to hold onto the gains he made in 2024. And while strong support among White voters remains, it may not be enough to offset losses in diverse states.","summary":"As Trump nears 100 days back in office, his Latino support collapses due to immigration policies.

His social media profiles have dozens of pictures of him and leading House and Senate Democrats since 2018. The two who appear the most are Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. Alex had at least nine meetings with Schumer, whom he referred to as his \"good friend.\" Soros had at least eight visits with Pelosi, whom he has called the \"greatest Speaker of the House in American History!\" Soros has donated millions to Democrats over the past several years, albeit far less than his father. In 2020, he contributed over $700,000 to the Biden Victory Fund, making him among its top donors. For the 2024 cycle, he maxed out $6,600 in donations directly to Biden's campaign, federal filings show. Since the 2018 elections, he has poured more than $5 million into federal political coffers.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He's also contributed hundreds of thousands in cash to the Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund, Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He has given tens of thousands more to state Democratic parties and individual campaigns, many of which were maximum contributions.
