But Macron had obviously been prepping with maybe a little weight training because he gripped Trump's hand so hard you could see the outline of his fingers in the flesh of Trump's hand for several moments after,' James recalled. \n\nShe then turned her attention to Monday's display noting that the leaders' 'rictus grins being performed shouldn't divert from the real action going on at waist height' as both Trump and Macron 'wanted to register superiority here.' \n\n'Trump's power-pat on Macron's shoulder is a control and pinning gesture that also hints at a parental-style dominance,' James said. 'Macron responds at once with a hand-clamp on Trump's bicep, suggesting he is not intimidated by the President's alpha posturing.'\n\n'The two men then lock hands in a \"death clasp\" muscular clamping of the hands,' James noted. \n\n'Macron slaps his left hand over the clasp to suggest control and then performs a Trump classic, the \"Shake and Yank,\" where the clasp is suddenly and relatively violently yanked either forward or backward, de-stabilizing your \"opponent\" by taking them off-balance,' James observed. \n\nIn this instance, Macron yanked backward, with Trump leaning forward, so Macron can re-position his hand on top. \n\n'As the two men turn to face the cameras Trump keeps a grim grip on Macron's hand, forcing the shake to last for several seconds and several extra shakes longer,' James noted. 'We can see how this firm clasp is more like a tussle than a gesture of mutual respect.' \n\nJames also noted that the next foreign leader to meet Trump needed to 'study the footage in detail.'\n\nTrump will host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House on Thursday. \n\n'Trump appears to be back in power-play body language mode again and Starmer has so far shown nothing like the level of Macron's skills when it comes to dealing with it,' James warned.","summary":"President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron have again grabbed hands in such a way that the encounter has gone viral.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14431499/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-death-clasp-handshake.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/24/23/95547703-0-image-m-30_1740440839055.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2017/05/25/7899942192312830762/1024x576_MP4_7899942192312830762.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:43:30","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":293976518,"title":"Eagles express willingness to visit the White House, despite Donald Trump supporting Chiefs for Super Bowl victory","text":"The Philadelphia Eagles do plan on visiting the White House to celebrate their second Super Bowl victory, if and when they receive an invitation, according to multiple reports.\n\nBoth NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport and ESPN’s Adam Schefter simultaneously reported the Eagles would be ‘honored’ to visit the Trump White House. \n\n‘It’s one of the aspects of winning they are excited about and look forward to receiving the invitation,’ Rapoport wrote on X. \n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Eagles spokespeople and the White House for comment. \n\nThere had been speculation online the team would skip a meeting with President Donald Trump, with a number of conservatives including Megyn Kelly mistakenly slamming the Eagles for the rumored decision. \n\nNow, though, the Eagles appear headed to the Trump White House for the first time, despite previously winning the Lombardi Trophy during his first term in 2018. Responding to rumors of a potential player boycott at the time, Trump disinvited the team from the customary White House visit amid his war with the NFL over players protesting during the national anthem. \n\n‘The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow,’ read a 2018 Trump statement. ‘They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\n\n‘The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better. These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony – one that will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem.’\n\nNow, though, the political calculus surrounding the NFL and the White House appears to have shifted. Only a handful of Eagles players remain in Philadelphia from the 2018 Super Bowl-winning team: Right tackle Lane Johnson, defensive end Brandon Graham, kicker Jake Elliott and long snapper Rick Lovato.\n\nIn fact, Johnson already said he hoped to visit Trump in Washington following the Eagles’ Super Bowl LIX win over the Chiefs. \n\n‘I’d be honored to go, regardless of who the president is, but we’ll see,’ team captain and right tackle Lane Johnson said, as quoted by Sportico. ‘It’s ultimately a team decision. I’ll do what’s best for the team.’\n\nThe President attended the Eagles’ victory over the Chiefs in New Orleans but left the game early to fly back to his home in Palm Beach, Florida at an estimated cost of somewhere between $8million and $20 million taxpayer dollars.\n\nCuriously, Trump has not yet congratulated the Eagles despite previously toasting the Kansas City Chiefs for their latest Super Bowl berth. He’s also praised Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, the latter of whom ‘liked’ a pair of Trump-related social media posts during the campaign.\n\n‘I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country,’ Trump wrote on his Truth Social network ahead of his electoral victory over Kamala Harris in November.\n\nThe Hunt family, which owns the Chiefs, also has a history of supporting conservative causes. \n\nEagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, on the other hand, has a record of supporting left-leaning politicians, such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, although he previously donated to Republicans George W. Bush and Arlen Specter as well.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles do plan on visiting the White House to celebrate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Eagles express willingness to visit the White House, despite Donald Trump supporting Chiefs for Super Bowl victory first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/eagles-express-willingness-to-visit-the-white-house-despite-donald-trump-supporting-chiefs-for-super-bowl-victory/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Eagles-would-be-honored-to-visit-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:03:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.328},{"id":293980616,"title":"How Happy Are Kamala Harris Voters With Donald Trump? What Poll Shows","text":"A month since President Donald Trump has officially been in office, voters of former Vice President Kamala Harris are sharing how satisfied they are with Trump, according to a Harvard University/Harris poll.Newsweek has reached out to the White House via email for comment.Why It MattersTrump took office January 20, 2025, after a decisive victory against Harris. Harris led a slightly over 100-day campaign with her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for the 2024 presidential election, following former President Joe Biden's withdrawal in July. Ultimately, she lost to now President Trump, who was previously in office prior to Harris and Biden. Trump won 312 electoral votes, while Harris received 226. The Republican also won every swing state.Since his inauguration, Trump has implemented sweeping change via swathes of executive orders, targeting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), immigration and most recently expanding access to in vitro fertilization. Trump's first weeks in office have also been filled with Cabinet nominations, domestic tragedies including wildfires in Los Angeles, and aviation disasters. Trump also managed to secure the safe arrival of Americans imprisoned overseas.What To KnowThe poll, released by Harvard University/Harris on Monday, shows 9 percent of Democratic Harris voters are now satisfied with how Trump is doing in office and 6 percent of GOP Harris voters are now satisfied with Trump.Meanwhile, 12 percent of Trump Democratic voters are satisfied with their choice, and 85 percent of GOP Trump voters are satisfied.In addition, the poll also found 6 percent of Trump voters say they wish Harris won the presidential election, which is not much compared to 37 percent of Harris voters who say they wish Harris won.Meanwhile, the poll also shows that 8 percent of Republicans think Trump is doing worse than expected while 63 percent of Democrats think he is doing worse than expected. However, 13 percent of Democrats think Trump's doing better than expected and 66 percent of Republicans also think he's doing better.The survey was conducted online within the United States on February 19-20, 2025, among 2,443 registered voters by the Harris Poll and HarrisX. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 2.0 points.The poll comes after Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio is sounding the alarm about vulnerabilities congressional Republicans will face in next year's midterm elections.A memo from Fabrizio and his partner, Bob Ward said their polling finds that 59 percent of voters in 18 swing districts are concerned about their personal financial situation, including 61 percent of swing voters and 53 percent of President Donald Trump's voters.The memo said that polling found contests in 18 swing districts—eight held by Republicans and 10 by Democrats—are essentially tied.However, it said that in a generic ballot matchup, the survey has the \"generic Democrat winning by 5 points, so the Republicans have to play catch-up.\"The memo suggests voters, including those who chose Trump over Harris, remain concerned about their financial situation despite Trump repeatedly touting how much better off they are now that he is back in the White House. Some recent polls have shown support for Trump's handling of the economy has significantly declined since he returned to office.It comes as Republicans have been confronted by angry voters at town halls in recent days, while other polls have suggested growing dissatisfaction with the Trump administration's actions in the first month since he returned to office, including efforts to downsize the federal government that has seen thousands of federal government workers fired.What People Are SayingPolitical analyst Craig Agranoff told Newsweek last week: \"Trump's first month in office this time around is markedly different from his first term. Four years ago, he entered Washington as an outsider, disrupting the traditional political landscape with a flurry of executive orders and high-profile policy moves. This time, he's returning with experience, a clearer understanding of how the system works, and a more determined approach to advancing his agenda.\"Agranoff added: \"However, he also faces a more polarized political climate, legal challenges, and a Congress that may not always align with his priorities. The key question is whether he can translate his momentum into lasting policy achievements or if external pressures will slow his administration's effectiveness.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris in her November concession speech: \"In our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign—the fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.\"President Donald Trump said in his Inauguration speech last month: \"I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a grilling, new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before, but first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.What Happens NextWhile Trump's first 100 days in office will continue to unfold, it is unclear what other actions Trump will take or how voters will respond.","summary":"Last week's poll of more than 2,400 voters gives insight into how they feel about Trump's sweeping changes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/poll-shows-how-happy-kamala-harris-voters-are-donald-trump-2035625","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2594670/kamala-harris-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:03:18","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":293974496,"title":"Black Viewers Rally Around Joy Reid","text":"A day after winning an NAACP Image Award, one of MSNBC’s highest rated shows is done.

Reid joined the call, too. “I am not sorry and I am so proud of what we did,” she said of her award-winning show, which ran for five years.\n\nAlso on the call were frequent guests of her MSNBC show, including political analysts Tiffany Cross and Angela Rye, along with longtime organizer Rashad Robinson. \n\n“When we don’t speak up in these moments we continue to allow the line to be moved,” said Rashad Robinson, an well-known organizer who joined the call.\n\nIn a video on social media, Karen Attiah described the protest as a way to show support for Reid as well as a way to send a clear message of dissent to MSNBC.

Listen to the full interview below!\n\nListen to the full interview:\n\nListen to the full podcast:\n\nRead the full (automated) transcript below:\n\nGuy Benson: Thank you all for being here. Big thanks to AFP here at the Freedom Embassy for hosting this really important event. Looking forward to this conversation with the speaker. I want to start just on a personal note. I saw you post on social media. What was it last week? I want to say a photo with you welcoming boys to men to the capital and a buddy of mine. And he said, Mike Johnson is on a journey and I love it for him. Do you ever have moments like you’re on the plane with Trump, or you’re at UFC and you’re always in the background of these photos? Do you ever think, how is this my life? Because like, the accidental speaker thing has turned into a pretty effective speaker reality? Give us your journey up to this point, if you would.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: Well, is kid Rock and Jelly Roll and I were talking about this, so it has been a wild ride. These are consequential times. People ask me all the time about having fun in this position, and I just look at them and say, we really don’t have time for fun. I mean, I’m really very much like a wartime speaker and have been since they handed me the gavel in October 2023. This is not a job I ever aspired to. But it fell to us to to do it and lead in these very challenging times. But I’m absolutely convinced that America is coming back, and that’s what keeps us going. There are a few moments of respite in there, and those events or some of them meeting boys demand was a great treat. I’m way older than most of you in the audience, but if you were in high school in the late 80s, early 90s, that’s like the soundtrack of your life. And those guys are my age. We’re all in our early 50s. They look so much better than me, and I chose the wrong profession, but it was great to meet them.\n\nGuy Benson: So right outside here, there are the seven principles that you always talk about. If you just remind us what they are, number one. And then the question I have is obviously there is some opposition to a number of them on the left. Are you concerned about maybe some undermining of faith in those principles within certain precincts on the right as well these days?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: Yeah. So let me tell you the origin of this. When in 2019, I was elected to be chairman of the Republican Study Committee, largest caucus of conservatives in Congress, largest caucus, but certainly the most conservatives. And I was just a sophomore and I was the most senior person in the room. But my background was in constitutional law, and I had, as I’d like to say, a toolbox full of totally unmarketable skills. But what came together at that time was this this sort of recalibration of who we were as a party. This is two years into the Trump administration, and a lot of the furniture is being moved around and some broken, and some of it needed to be. But I was concerned that we would not lose our fixed points in horizon, so to speak. Right. So I stood in front of all the House Republicans in the in the conference, the caucus at the time, and I said, there’s about 158 of them. And I said, guys, if you had just a brief moment to have a discussion with a young millennial or young progressive to tell them why our philosophy and our principles are superior to theirs, what would you say if you had to convince an entire library full of conservative thought from Edmund Burke into today, down to a half page? You know, for a short, concise summary. What would you say? I said to me, I think it boils down to. Individual freedom, limited government, the rule of law, peace through strength, fiscal responsibility, free markets and human dignity. Now, under each of those things, that would be lots of subcategories. And you could unpack it depending upon the, the, the, the moment you’re in. But that, to me is the essence of who we are, not just as a party, but who we’ve been as Americans. There’s a reason America is the greatest nation in the history of the world. It’s not even close, really. Objectively, we’re the most powerful, most successful, most most free, most benevolent nation that’s ever been. And it’s because we are based on those founding principles, and we don’t want to lose sight of them as things change in our in our modern era.\n\nGuy Benson: When you look at the election that just happened, right. There’s always this it’s the most important election of our lifetime mantra. Sometimes that feels closer to the truth. And other times this was a very consequential election. And we’ve heard President Trump talk a lot about a mandate that he feels that he’s won and he swept the swing states, won the popular vote. Did some things that folks were not expecting him to do, at least the skeptics. By the same token, I don’t have to tell you how slim the majority is in your house, even in the upper chamber as well. I know that feels like more breathing room, but still awfully close. How do you look at what the voters decided in November? Does that constitute a mandate for the party generally? And what does that look like in terms of your priorities here?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: Great question. I think there is a mandate. Not only did President Trump win the Electoral College soundly, he also won the popular vote 77 million votes. We got our highest vote total ever in history of the House Republicans, 74.8 million votes. We did all that together. Some would say, oh, you rode President Trump’s coattails. But I think it was a combination of things. What we achieved in this election cycle was a demographic shift. I think a once in a generation, once in my lifetime kind of event where we had a record number of Hispanic and Latino voters, for example, and black and African-American voters, you know, Jewish voters and union workers and all these people who had not historically been in our camp. And they came over not reluctantly, but enthusiastically. They were looking for an alternative. The left went too far. The woke progressive nonsense that it’s sort of like, as I explained it in my mind, the pendulum, they push so aggressively, so quickly that it clicked and now it’s coming back. President Trump represents a force that is pushing it back to common sense and the center right kind of balance where we are and always have been in the nation, and we’re going to be a force of that as well. So we do see it as a mandate. We do see it as our responsibility to take care of business. Now, I want you to know that I’m going to travel the country nonstop last year to make sure we kept the majority and grew it, and every day, almost literally, that we were not in session. I was on the road. I did over 350 campaign events, 250 cities and 40 states. I logged enough miles to circle the globe five and a half times last year. That’s a real statistic. I was four inches taller when a speaker of the House. Okay, they beat me down mercilessly, but we did grow the majority, and I was so proud guy, because I had 220 Republicans and 215 Democrats. And then President Trump began to cull the herd. And so he took a view. And I called him like, Mr. President, you cannot take any more. We’re going to be done to win. Oh, my God, did I do that? Yes, you did, sir. We’re down to one. So now really, I mean, this is true. We have a one vote margin now. Smallest in history. Right? So for a big chunk of the first hundred days of the Congress and perhaps beyond. This is this is not an easy task, but we’re going to get it done. We are the most aggressive, important legislative agenda that we’ve had. Certainly in my lifetime, I think. And when we get this done, it will be an extraordinary achievement because the votes margin is so small.\n\nGuy Benson: Two related questions. One, on the timeline for filling some of the aforementioned Trump created vacancies. Right. A couple in Florida, there’s one in New York. As you think about a legislative agenda moving forward and you look at the calendar, what are you expecting? What are you anticipating in terms of getting those seats filled? Because Florida, I know that they’re doing everything they possibly can in New York with Stefanik. See, that’s a different that’s a different question, right. Because the governance up there, they’re not as interested in helping helping you get some folks back into your caucus, right. I know they talk a lot about democracy, but it seems like they’re pretty comfortable with a seat remaining vacant for as long as possible in upstate New York.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: That’s true. Florida. We have a date. Certain it’ll be April 1st. April fools. They don’t put too much stock into that. It will be two Republicans. We already knew who they are. Those are deep red districts and it’s reliable spaces. Mike Wall to see Matt Gaetz, to see Elise Stefanik seat in New York is different because you’re right. The liberal left Democrats run the state Assembly. And and they’ve not been kind to us there at the state Capitol. And they’re toying with the idea of extending and holding that seat open under some guise of democracy until the fall. Perhaps it’s one of the the suggestions.\n\nGuy Benson: So a delayed election for democracy.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: For democracy? Yet not. Don’t. Don’t forget about the fact that 750,000 upstate New Yorkers would be without representation in Congress for no apparent reason under existing New York law. That vacancy is supposed to be filled no later than 90 days from the date that it is is vacated. So we’ll see what happens. They haven’t changed the law yet. If we get the budget resolution passed this week, which is the plan, then it’s possible that at least Evonik would go ahead and move on to her assignment at the UN as the ambassador there, once she gets through the confirmation process in the Senate, which I think would go quickly, and then that would start the clock. And so let’s hope that we can get it filled in time and hope that the law is respected by Democrats in New York.\n\nGuy Benson: And I want to come back to this week in a second. But again, looking at priorities, you’re starting to see some softness in the polling for the president, for the party, maybe a honeymoon that he never enjoyed last time he’s had it. The polls are conflicting about whether that’s, you know, starting to maybe taper off or not. But one consistent data point that we’re seeing is that there is still this extreme concern among voters about the cost of living and the price of everything. And obviously, a mess was inherited. There’s no question about that. But at some point, you know, you’re in the driver’s seat as a Republican Party controlling the trifecta. What is it that you would say to voters who are wondering, are they really focusing on what matters the most to us, which would be the cost of living and probably immigration? Those top two plenty on immigration. What about on that number one issue that really, I think was so harmful to the Democrats in the fall?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: Yeah, it was clearly the president and all of us ran on a set of issues that were the most important to the people. We got to secure the border. We have to get the economy under control, reduce inflation. We’ve got to get American energy dominance back and restore peace through strength, reduce the regulatory state, the bureaucracy, the deep state. All those processes are underway. The president has done an heroic job with executive authority right out of the gates and accomplish quite a bit. DOJ’s working overtime and all these things are happening now. We have to codify it. So the reconciliation process is the key to getting that done. And for a lot of people. Back home who don’t follow all the machinations here, the reconciliation is the is the one. The one exception to having to get 60 votes in the 60 vote threshold in the Senate. Because we only have to have 53 Republicans in the Senate right now. Doing something with a bare majority is the way to go. So we will use the reconciliation process to check a lot of the boxes of the promises that we made, and that is how we will get to the cost of living. You know, the price of eggs is up high, but that has more to do with bird flu than anything else. Okay, there’s a lot of mixed messages out there, but obviously inflation continues to be a major problem. The way to do that is to make sure small businesses have certainty, to make sure we don’t have the largest tax increase in US history, which is what will happen by default at the end of this year if we’re not successful in this mission to get taxes down, reduce regulations and free up the free market again. And the way you do that, the way you insure prosperity, which is what we’re all about, is to get the government out of the way. This is the time to do it. And reconciliation is the is the vehicle in which we’re going to get it done.\n\nGuy Benson: Easier said than done. The way that the logistics work out is something I want to delve into. Before we do that. If you’re just joining us, we’re at the AFP Freedom Embassy speaker Mike Johnson, our guest, and there’s a few folks here that AFP has recognized as really high level activists who have done a lot of work on the ground and got a couple of questions for you from them. So let’s start. I’m sure this was done completely at random, but one of them happens to be from Louisiana. Eric is with us from your home state. Eric, take it away.\n\nEric (AFP Louisiana): Mr. speaker, my name is Eric. I recently graduated from our alma mater, Louisiana State University, and I’m focused on my future, hopefully building a career, starting a family in Louisiana. But the last few years have been difficult with the rising cost of energy, housing and groceries. How would your principles and your vision for the next couple of years on issues help me and other Louisianans achieve our goal?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: Great question. So the LSU students are so bright there. Look, I will concede to you that you got greater challenges than I had when I graduated LSU and start a family in Louisiana back in the mid 90s. There’s a lot of headwinds right now. This election really was for all the marbles. I mean, it was a crossroads for the country and we won. And so now we have the mandate, the opportunity to fix all this. The best thing that we can do to ensure liberty, opportunity, security for you and your your young family that you’ll start is to get government out of the way. And that’s what our team is for. I mean, at the end of the day, the Republican Party, we talked about the core principles, but at the end of the day, you could summarize if we’re pro-family and pro-growth, right. And those are the two ingredients that make it easier for people to start out. My my daughters just graduated law school down there at LSU in May, and she just got married in June. So this is life. I exercise for my family too. And she’s the oldest of our four. I got one that graduated undergrad and is on the way to law school. I got a son at the Naval Academy and I have a 14 year old, so they’re all looking at me with the same anticipation. All right, dad, get this. Get this fixed. We will. Right. So that I keep going back to reconciliation. But that’s the the quickest vehicle we have to achieve the desired results. And what we need is to get government out of the way. We need a smaller, leaner federal government that’s out of your life so that the free market can thrive. If you reduce taxes and regulations, you allow job creators, entrepreneurs, risk takers, the people that create the jobs to do more of what they do. And you unleash that that power of the U.S. economy that has been smothered by government regulation for too long. This is not theoretical. We did it, of course, in the first Trump administration. I was here as a freshman in 2017 when President Trump started. And we reduced taxes, reduced regulations. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world pre Covid. I mean, really, every vote was rising in every demographic. And then we had all these disruptive events so we can get back to that. We know the formula and it will help everybody who is starting out. So I would say help is on the way. Hang in there and don’t leave Louisiana, okay? You did it.\n\nGuy Benson: All right. Thank you Eric. And from your neck of the woods and your alma mater to one of the most important battleground states in the country, Wisconsin, I know AFP’s very focused on a very important judicial race up there in a matter of weeks. Mike is a small business owner in Wisconsin. Mike, what’s your question for the speaker?\n\nMike Dobell (AFP Wisconsin): Speaker Johnson, my name is Mike Dobell. I’m a small business owner from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My wife and I own a hospitality group with six restaurants, some small breweries, and 190 employees. You know, it’s super important to us to continue the tax cuts. And I know it is important to you as well, but there are some differences in opinion between the House and the Senate and just Republicans. Even in your House, you know, what’s your plan to try to bridge that gap so we can continue as we need it? We need to keep hiring and growing or we’re dying. So what’s your plan to bridge that gap?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: Well, thanks, Mike, for the question and thanks for. I know you did some heavy work there in Wisconsin. I’m sure in this audience, if you’re here, you were part of that. And that was huge. Wisconsin was a huge state for us this time around. So what we need to do, I’ll give you a little more detail about reconciliation, because it sounds like a lofty concept, but the details really do matter here. What we need to do for small business owners like you is get government out of the way and give you certainty so that you can plan and invest appropriately so that you know what’s going to happen six months from now or more. The reason that we’re putting the extensions of the Tcga, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the seminal achievement, one of the seminal achievements, the first Trump administration. The reason that’s in reconciliation is because, as we noted, those tax cuts are going to expire at the end of this year if we don’t fix it. And the reason we have to do it early in the process and not wait until the end of this year or later, is because everybody needs to see the effects of that, like ASAP, right? I mean, if you’re a small business owner, this is a very challenging time because you don’t know what to expect. The markets don’t know what to expect, the bond market doesn’t know what to expect, so putting that clarity in as early as possible is critical for everybody who is in a position like you are. And so the way to do that is with one big beautiful bill, okay. Like that’s the president’s a phrase and I’ve adopted it. In fact, I have it tattooed on my chest here. I could show you it’s that important. All right. Why? Because my some of my dearest friends, you know, Ted Cruz and I are very close friends. Lindsey Graham in the Senate. They’ve been pushing the two bills strategy in the Senate. But I want you all to know the inside baseball is my math is much more complicated in the House than the Senate. For the first time in our lifetimes, Senate Republicans have a wider margin than we have in the House, okay. And also have 160 plus additional personalities to deal with. And they they have with just their 53 over there. And I have a much more diverse caucus. So remember I’ve got people who are elected in like our 26 districts and like deep red rural states. And then I’ve got people who are elected in districts that Kamala Harris won on the ballot by 10 or 11 points, you know, D plus 12 districts. And those Republicans look at an issue set with very different lenses. Their philosophy and the principles are the same, but their constituencies are very different. And so they’ve got to be mindful of that. So my job is to find the equilibrium point between the two sides and to advance the ball as far as we can down the field for our conservative principles and get 218 votes. And now I’ve got a Salt caucus over here that they don’t have to contend with in the Senate, because the state and local tax issue is huge. The people that are elected in New York, new Jersey, California and other states. But think of it, there’s no red state senators because they’re all red state guys that have that issue to contend with. And we have multiple caucuses and interest that I’ve got to contend with. So I’m finding the right point for all those dials is going to be the trick over the next several weeks, we’ll get there. And the sooner that we do it, the better it’s going to be for you and every small business owner and large company, for that matter, around the country, because that’s going to lock in and codify the certainty that you need to be able to do what you do best, and that is grow your business and add jobs.\n\nGuy Benson: I saw a headline, I think, today at Politico, Mike Johnson’s Moment of Truth. You’ve had a few of those not ready for speaker yet. Yeah. Here’s another moment of truth. Moments of truth, maybe. But it is a big one this week because step one is this floor vote. Maybe tomorrow, maybe later in the week. Committee was sort of a sigh of relief there, but you’ve got a lot of cats to herd. Not everyone is on board from what the reporting suggests. Are you confident? And how would you how would you measure that level of confidence that you’re going to get this through? This is step one, right? Getting to the vehicle with literally no margin for error, because I think there’s at least one member who’s in. No.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: There may be more than one, but they’ll get there. We’re going to get everybody there. This is a prayer request. Just pray this through for us because it is very high stakes and everybody knows that. And as we were talking in the Hall guy a little while ago, somebody noted a couple weeks ago, the thing about having a small majority is it brings great clarity. It’s clarifying, you know? I don’t think anybody wants to be in front of this train. I think they want to be on it. And, and, and people come out with genuine conviction, you know, about the dead and the deficit and about these issues, and that is that issue. But I’m often reminded and I remind my colleagues all the time what Ronald Reagan reminded us. I’d rather get 80% of what I want than go over the cliff of the flag waving. And for those of us who believe in limited government and liberty and opportunity and security prosperity, we have to recognize that an aircraft carrier is not turned on a dime. It takes three miles to turn an aircraft carrier, right? It took us decades to get into the situation we’re in. It is not likely that we’re going to fix everything in one bill in one fell swoop. So. But if we can make great strides in these areas, and we begin to change the trajectory of the carrier, we can turn it around. And if we do that well, and we demonstrate to all these new demographics who came into the party, now that it truly is our principles, are core conservative principles that lead to human flourishing. It is. It is our principles that are better for them as individuals, families, you know, community, their state, the nation as a whole. Then we will be able to hold this as a governing majority for years to come. This can be an historic moment for our party and our principles, and I think this is the first step in what will be many steps. It’s day by day.\n\nGuy Benson: So if you’re analysis that it’s going to happen slash prayer request comes through this week. I guess part one of the question is what would the timeline then look like to get to then the reconciliation piece, which would be maybe harder, right? This is just getting on to something. The vote this week. Then it’s like, okay, what is a final bill that would become law actually look like? What timeline are you looking at for there? And then maybe one that you’re not excited to contemplate, but has to be asked if something if there’s a wrinkle this week and there’s a stumble, is there a plan B or is it is it this or nothing?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: I get a whole playbook, but I’m not going to tell you that we’re going to we’re going to we’re going to score on this one, okay. But when, when when the resolution passes, as you know, this is just the sort of the opening. This is the starting gun basically for the real reconciliation process. And so that is scheduled out. And I put out a very aggressive timetable schedule for the reasons we discussed. We need to do this quickly.\n\nGuy Benson: What do you think of 2017? You took too long. The Republicans took too long.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: That’s exactly right. We didn’t get to the tax base until late, late in the year. And so what happened was the benefit of what we had done was not fully realized by everybody before that midterm election. Only twice in 85 years has a president, a newly elected president, had his party grow or add seats in the House in that first two year cycle. So we’re going to have to defy history. And we will. I think we got a very favorable landscape and the right ingredients to do it, but we got to perform. So if we do it early to meet that aggressive timetable, what we’re going to do is pass the resolution. And then through the rest of February and all of the month of March, you’ll see the committees. What happens is we give instructions to 11 different House committees and areas of jurisdiction are all these issues, and they’ve got to work through and find their equilibrium points in those subgroups. Bring it up to the full group, get it on the floor. My calendar has us passing this by probably the first week of April and getting it to the Senate so they can do their work on it.\n\nGuy Benson: So after April 1st, perhaps.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: After April 1st. Do you see how that works? Yeah, I got a couple more votes and then we get it done. And if this works and we get it to the president’s desk by early May, that would be enough time for this to become part of the law, to give the certainty that everyone needs, and for the American people to begin seeing the benefit of this so that it’s reflected in the election outcome and in all the all of our lives. Yeah.\n\nGuy Benson: Just a couple more here. I’ve had you mentioned friend of yours, Senator Cruz, on the show. I had Senator Thune on the show recently, still making to my ears a robust, interesting case for the two bill idea. When you push back on them in private. You say, look, here’s my math and here’s why one big, beautiful bill makes sense on the House side. Are they receptive to it, or do you feel like they’re still are they still saying, actually, no, you’re you’re wrong?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: No. This is a very friendly debate. These are all very close friends. And there’s no daylight between the House and Senate Republicans. And that’s that’s a very important I mean, I there’s no animosity here at all. We’re all trying to accomplish this same exact mission. They just see it from different lenses in the Senate that we do in the House. And when I lay out all the complexities, Ted, Lindsey and John, none of them, none of them can refute that. They just go, oh, you know, that’s tough. Yeah, I know, thanks a lot. Welcome to my life. So look, I think what happens, they passed their resolution last week and whatever they’re calling that that’s a plan B. That’s fine. But I said you have to allow the House to lead on this by necessity. We need to. We have to. I have the more complicated equation to solve. Here’s another thing to that everybody needs to remember. And this will mean something to the folks in this room. We have new revenue inputs that really ought to be factored into this. I mean, the tariffs policy that the president’s pursuing is going to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office as a number, you know, some significant number. The 10% tariffs on China could be a large number, just that alone. And then what DOJ’s doing, you know, cutting down the size and scope of government pretty dramatically results in a massive cost saving, cutting out the fraud, waste and abuse. I mean, they found almost $60 billion the estimated already. And they’ve only been doing it for a few weeks. So Elon is is in the middle. He’s gotten into the belly of the beast. And I met with him a couple weeks ago at his office Monday before last, and he was explaining to me what he’s doing, and he and I got increasingly excited as we’re going through this. And I said, look, I know you’re excited because you think of this as a scientist and a data analyst. I think of it as a constitutional law attorney and a and a historian. Ellen, what we’re going to do here is restore the original intent of the framers of the Constitution, because he envisioned a small, efficient federal government. Remember, most of the power is pushed down to the states, right? Because that’s important for maintaining the checks and balances and all the risks that things we need. But they wanted a federal government that was there was small and efficient and effective and accountable. And the accountability piece will be ensured by the duly elected, elected representatives of the people and the Congress. We have oversight. The problem is, for decades, as we know, we haven’t been able to do that job well, because even though we requested the data and requested the insight, it was hidden. How many of you know the bureaucracy was not forthcoming, right? They’re not transparent. That’s the whole point. That’s the problem. That’s the deep state. When we talk about. So they were hiding from Congress. We didn’t know that USAID was funding drag shows in Peru or whatever, you know, transgender operas in Colombia or whatever, you know? I mean, it’s madness. But Elon has cracked the code. He is now inside the agencies. He’s created these algorithms that are constantly crawling through the data. And as he told me in his office, the data doesn’t lie. We’re going to be able to get the information. We’re going to be able to transform the way the federal government works at the end of this, and that is a very exciting prospect. It is truly a revolutionary moment for the nation.\n\nGuy Benson: Being here at Americans for prosperity at the Freedom Embassy, I think something that’s on a lot of minds in this room and in this building and on this team is how can the grassroots of AFP help? Because there are a lot of different pressure points in this fight. Upcoming AFP was involved in 30 million voter contacts in the last cycle alone. There’s muscle there. What’s the role for groups like this one and maybe this one specifically in this road ahead or on this journey forward?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: I have AFP tattooed on my back. This is this is a very important, very important. Lots of tattoos. No, look, this this organization does it better than anybody. And I mean that sincerely. I remember fondly the work of AP. When I was a legislator in Louisiana. I did a short stint in the state legislature before I ran for Congress. About 14 months. I was down there, and during that time we had some really heavy things that were happening, tax initiatives and other stuff. And AP got directly involved at the grassroots level and did the most. Some of the most effective mailers I’ve ever seen to state senators or state reps homes. And I saw him flip on the on the floor of the legislature because they were holding the air card, shivering in fear. This is a real story. Okay. So it matters. And the grassroots component of this is critical. And what you can do is what AARP does so well. Leading on this is to let your elected representatives in Washington know how you feel about this. Let House and Senate members know that this is important, one of the most effective ways to do it, just in the one on one kind of contact, is to talk and share your story. You know, share your story about your small business and how the tax cuts of the last Trump administration helped you grow and thrive. Talk about the challenges that you’re facing now, and why we can reduce the challenge by further deregulating your industry, right. Talk about the challenges that your family has with inflation and the cost of groceries and all that, and make it real, make it personal. Because when you’re a constituent of one of these folks. They’ve got to listen to that and it does make a difference. Talk about how your states of a border state and how the open border has been disastrous for your community. You add those things in and you make it real and make it personal. Make it specific. It’s very difficult for elected officials to just turn a blind eye to that. And and when you add the the reinforcements and the resources and the power of EFP behind it, it’s it’s a very effective thing. And we’re counting on you. Right.\n\nGuy Benson: So we’ve got to wrap here. I think you’ve got some arms to twist here for the rest of the day. But very quickly, I have to ask you this not to brag, but I think I have a pretty good Trump impression. Yours is better. I will say that. Have you ever done it for him?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson: Not directly, but he certainly knows. Not yet. He certainly knows about it. Okay, but imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Okay.\n\nGuy Benson: That’s so true. That’s so true. Yes. Speaker Mike Johnson, everyone, thank you so much for coming by.","summary":"Mike Johnson (R-LA), Speaker of the House, joined The Guy Benson Show today&#8211;brought to you by Americans for Prosperity&#8211;to break down the seven principles of AFP and their importance to conservative governance in the House and the administration.

Cuban, who during the 2024 presidential campaign served as one of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ top allies and campaign surrogates, also revealed he told Harris advisors to \"not even try\" advising him on messaging. \"Donald Trump is a great salesperson, he really is a great marketer,\" he said. Motioning with his hands, Cuban continued: \"I’d put him up there, Donald Trump, then Paris Hilton, then Dennis Rodman.\" TOM HOMAN TELLS MIGRANT TERROR GROUPS TRUMP WILL ‘WIPE YOU OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH’ The comparison drew laughs from the crowd at the \"Principles First\" summit in Washington, D.C., to which Cuban responded, \"Seriously!\" \"I mean those two below are some of the best marketers I’ve ever seen in my entire life, and Donald Trump surpassed them,\" he said. Cuban, who is a businessman, TV personality and co-owner of the Dallas Mavericks, emerged as one of Harris’ most fierce supporters during the 2024 campaign.

Why Are They Terrified Now?","text":"While Democrats in Congress howl over President Donald Trump’s cuts to wasteful and fraudulent government spending, they’ve been hit with a partywide case of amnesia.\n\nThey’re forgetting their own party once stood for fiscal responsibility, even creating their own version of the Department of Government Efficiency, an initiative called Reinventing Government—REGO for short.\n\nAlso known as the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, REGO was a federal government reform initiative launched in 1993 by then-Vice President Al Gore. REGO aimed to save the federal government some $108 billion over five years by eliminating what a press report from that era called “scores of wasteful programs and regulations.” \n\n“This report tells us how to cut waste, cut red tape, streamline the bureaucracy, change procurement rules, change the personnel rules, and create a government that works better and costs less,” Gore said as he touted REGO, while standing beside President Bill Clinton.\n\nREGO reportedly created 800 recommendations, including eliminating 12% of the federal workforce and merging some government agencies, such as the FBI with the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. \n\nIt also recommended closing hundreds of government offices outside Washington, D.C. \n\nIf all that sounds familiar, it’s because today, DOGE is calling for similar things, from streamlining duplicative programs and departments to shaving off nonessential government workers (freeing them up, as DOGE founder Elon Musk noted, for the productive private sector, which creates, rather than destroys, value).\n\nThe Left has gone far adrift from its ’90s ethos, which also included historic welfare reform passed by a Republican Congress and signed by Clinton (lifting millions of people out of poverty). So it’s no wonder that Democrats’ approval is tanking to a record low. New polling from Quinnipiac University released Wednesday found just 21% of voters approve of the way Democrats in Congress are handling their job, while 68% disapprove of their performance—including a whopping 49% of Democrats. \n\nConversely, congressional Republicans hit their highest marks in the poll’s history (since 2009), with 40% of voters approving of the job they are doing. But they can’t get complacent or take this moment for granted. As my former boss, journalist-columnist Robert Novak, joked: “God put the Republican Party on earth to cut taxes. If they don’t do that, they have no useful function.” \n\nWhile Republicans hammer out a historic tax bill that would build on the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which spurred new job growth and allowed millions of middle-class Americans to keep more of their money, they’re living out one of their central purposes: namely, to grow freedom and human flourishing.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats lost their way and seem to be doubling down on their rejected agenda and approach. Democrats still hamstring Trump’s Cabinet nominees, and Kamala Harris, who led her party to an earth-shattering defeat is defiantly still considering running again and is high on lists of possible 2028 nominees. A Harris rerun would be a gift to Republicans. \n\nAll but two House Democrats voted to let men compete in women’s sports. By a vote of 218-206 last month, the U.S. House passed a bill to restrict men from participation in women’s sports. Sadly, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who previously had courageously stood up against his own party, later caved to the bullies and voted against it. The bill is now pending in the Senate. It would provide more permanent protections, building upon Trump’s fantastic executive order for the same thing this month—but which could be undone by a future president.\n\nBafflingly, Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers just created a proposal to amend state laws to replace the term “mother” with “inseminated person” in artificial-insemination statutes. With this unabashed embrace of gender ideology, seeking to erase women and mothers, it appears Evers has been suffering from amnesia since Election Day last year, when Americans profoundly rejected this ideology. \n\nNow that we have a new health and human services secretary recently sworn in, perhaps Robert F. Kennedy Jr. can look into why the Left seems to be suffering from such widespread memory loss, not only of a time when Democrats stood for fiscal responsibility, but also of the indelible events of Nov. 5.\n\nCarrie Sheffield is a senior policy analyst at Independent Women’s Voice.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Meyer’s 98-year-old mother, Joan Meyer, was present while the chief’s officers rifled through the home. She died the following day.\n\nThis story may sound familiar. It made national news, thanks to coverage by NPR, local and network television news, and the New York Times. The Biden administration weighed in forcefully with a statement by press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre from the podium of the White House press briefing room.\n\nMeyer said what heartened him about this otherwise devastating assault was the “patriotic response” of fellow members of the news media. “An attack on one,” he said at a recent conference hosted by The Lenfest Institute for Journalism and the Aspen Institute, “is an attack on all.”\n\nDefending the rights of an independent free press — the only profession enshrined in the U.S. Constitution — is indeed an act of patriotism. Our nation could sure use more of that kind of patriotic spirit, having just marked Presidents Day of 2025. Not only is our new president intensifying his assaults on the press, the American news media have so far seemed curiously flat-footed and uncoordinated in their response.\n\nConsider the ferocity of attacks in just the past few weeks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken aim at CBS News in a case accusing the network of manipulative editing of a 60 Minutes interview of Kamala Harris, almost certainly within the network’s First Amendment rights. The Federal Communications Commission is investigating diversity, equity and inclusion policies at Comcast, and sponsorship sales practices that help to support both NPR and PBS.\n\nLast week, the Associated Press, winner of 59 Pulitzer Prizes and among our nation’s most respected nonpartisan news organizations, was banned from the press pool covering some White House events because it continues to refer to the Gulf of Mexico rather than the “Gulf of America,” as Trump has decreed. (The AP has since sued several Trump officials in connection with the ban.)\n\nTrump has been a critic and manipulator of the news media for virtually his entire public and private career, so we should not be surprised by these latest assaults.\n\nWhat is surprising — and disappointing — is the lack of collective action and response on the part of the press itself.\n\nIn the AP case, for example, what would happen if the AP’s erstwhile competitors, including Reuters, CNN, the Washington Post, and the New York Times, refused to attend similar White House events unless and until the AP’s access is restored?\n\nThis collective action would leave the White House speaking only to media properties like Fox News, OAN, and Newsmax, favored only by its base. The loss of a larger megaphone would damage the administration’s voice and offend its considerable ego.\n\nThe phrase “an attack on one is an attack on all” is drawn from Article 5 of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty that created NATO — another organization under criticism by President Trump. What would such a commitment to collective action, a “NATO for news,” mean in practical terms?\n\nNews organizations have several powerful assets with which to come to one another’s defense.\n\nThey can, of course, deploy their reporters and editors to cover attacks on fellow press as they would other abuses of power or criminal acts.\n\nNews organizations can also leverage their opinion pages to express the official views of their owners and publishers, independent of their news pages.\n\nThey have marketing, advocacy and legal resources they can and should deploy to aid the cause of a free press broadly, not only the narrower interests of their own news enterprises.\n\nPerhaps most powerfully, they can take the view that an attack on the freedoms and independence of one of us is truly an attack on all.\n\nAs fellow Philadelphia newspaper publisher Benjamin Franklin said, “We must hang together, or, most assuredly, we shall hang separately.”\n\nJim Friedlich is CEO and executive director of the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, the nonprofit organization that owns The Philadelphia Inquirer. @jimfriedlich\n\nThis essay originally appeared in The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Sargent points to myriad factors that likely cut into Latinos’ traditional Democratic support (inflation, immigration, Trump’s name-recognition advantage) but saves an especially noteworthy contributor for the very end: the Spanish-language right-wing propaganda machine.\n\n“It’s now clear that the Democratic Party’s undeniable deficit in the information wars, in which Republicans benefit from a massive media propaganda network while dominating more apolitical cultural information spaces, extends to Latino voters in a very big way,” Sargent writes.\n\nHe cites editorial shifts from Spanish-language social media, which has been choked with disinformation around immigration influxes and economic policy, and the iconic broadcaster Univision, which took a less abrasive and friendlier approach to Trump after merging with the Mexican company Televisa in 2021. That turn has been quite profitable for the TelevisaUnivision conglomerate, which recently acknowledged revenue gains from GOP advertising in the U.S. even as business has declined in its native Mexico.\n\nIt reaches even beyond that. Spanish-speaking conspiracists involved with Republican politics have wildly popular YouTube channels and radio shows. Plus, much like South Asian Americans, Latino Americans tend to communicate with family from their home countries via native-language WhatsApp groups—and spread political misinformation there. The result is a lie machine that closely targets nonwhite voters to great effect.\n\nIt’s not that Democrats don’t recognize this; they attempted, in 2024, to establish trustworthy Spanish-language websites and WhatsApp channels. Two years before that, a media conglomerate founded by two former party aides bought 18 Spanish-language radio stations from the TelevisaUnivision conglomerate, including the notoriously conservative Radio Mambí. Yet all these moves were too weak or ineffective by half—in Mambí’s case, the programming got even more Trumpist after the takeover.\n\nTo be clear, it is wrong and infantilizing to solely blame Spanish misinformation for the long-brewing changes in Latino voting trends. There are many reasons that Dems and political analysts have gotten Latino Americans wrong over the years. The demographic classification itself is extremely broad, encompassing white and Indigenous and Afro-Latinos, long-conservative anti-leftist refugees from Venezuela and Cuba, Democratic-loyal Mexican Americans, immigrants, U.S.–born citizens, bigots and progressives, Catholics and Protestants and atheists. (Republicans’ hypertargeting of certain messages toward specific Latino ethnicities, as well as their willingness to just try speaking and campaigning in Spanish, shows how well the GOP gets this.)\n\nAs with so-called Asian Americans, the Latino voting bloc is far more pluralistic than consultants and candidates often perceive it to be. False info stokes and plays off the real anxieties of these communities, whether they stem from economic security, public safety, religious beliefs, immigration status, or personal prejudices.\n\nBoth misinformation (false news that communities incidentally share among themselves) and disinformation (concerted propaganda campaigns) have had a significant impact. Surveys of Latino Trump voters from the past few election cycles show that unfounded fears over election fraud, power grabs by other demographic groups, anti-Catholic persecution, and Democratic Party pedophiles all influenced how these audiences marked their ballots.\n\nThis type of effective propagandizing isn’t limited to Spanish, and it isn’t all coming from Russia either. The past few U.S. election cycles have also seen misinformation circulate in Mandarin, Vietnamese, Korean, Hindi, Arabic, Hebrew, and Haitian Creole, among others. Not all of it was pushed from top down by foreign intelligence officials or domestic GOP operatives, but it all reflected the most common and craven Republican talking points, including that Democrats are interfering with the election process in order to bring back communism, the party is full of pedophiles endangering your children, and Black activists are coming after Trump supporters. This messaging is present at a truly staggering scale: boxes of propagandistic newspapers from South Korea and China, Arabic-language flyers from mysterious groups distributed around Dearborn, and Haitian vaccine conspiracists on YouTube.\n\nIt’s strikingly easy to reach and influence the millions of Americans whose primary languages aren’t English, or who don’t speak it at all. Foreign-language telecommunications infrastructure is nowhere near as regulated as English-language radio and TV. Chat networks like WhatsApp are encrypted and often easy to obscure from public view. Social media outlets had for years failed to devote ample resources to foreign-language users, even before they started rolling back moderation efforts altogether.\n\nIn general, many Americans who don’t speak any English live in areas that are relatively underresourced compared with wealthier and whiter neighborhoods, with the language barriers and resulting effects leaving them segregated off and dependent on their own self-sustaining communities. A plain attempt by any Republican candidate to translate and tailor their messages to these communities, to show up and acknowledge their conditions (however insincerely), and to activate them in the electoral bureaucracy makes a huge difference.\n\nThere’s been plenty of chatter among concerned liberals over the ways Democrats have failed to keep up with the new media landscape, whether we’re talking about audio-centric outreach to young men or breaking through to rural “news deserts” without local newspapers or gaming the YouTube and TikTok algorithms. But any concerted attempts at (re)constructing a revitalized liberal media ecosystem need to reckon with American diversity in ways that, ironically, the anti-diversity Republicans have figured out. That means speaking other languages, finely targeting messages through various media, and figuring out how to present effective counterinformation. It won’t be easy. But rebuilding a coalition never is.","summary":"Foreign-language propaganda is thriving.

The message came in around 10:30 p.m., and the next morning I shot back, “No”—as in, no, I’m not running. When we spoke Friday, I explained that the odds of me running for Congress were slim—like, say, 20%—while trying to make clear how unlikely a scenario it would all be. That afternoon came the story: “Molly Jong-Fast is thinking about challenging Jerry Nadler.”\nTo make things 100% clear: No, I am not running for Congress. Perhaps I should’ve seen this coming. Since Donald Trump’s victory in November, I’d spoken casually to consultants and political people about what it would mean to run for Congress and if I would even want to do it—and I’d pretty much decided against the whole thing. I didn’t think there was anything newsworthy about it, but, alas, Politico and others felt differently.\nWhy I’d even consider such a thing is because I believe this is an emergency—and I’m not the only one. “Right now, there is a distinct possibility that we do not have a free and fair election in 2028, and all of our work is to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Senator Chris Murphy told The New York Times in a piece published over the weekend. And while accepting a lifetime achievement honor at the SAG Awards on Sunday night, Jane Fonda, the legendary actor and longtime activist, asked, “Have any of you ever watched a documentary of one of the great social movements—like apartheid or our civil rights movement or Stonewall—and asked yourself, Would you have been brave enough to walk the bridge? We don’t have to wonder anymore, because we are in our documentary moment. This is it, and it’s not a rehearsal.”\nIn a time of national crisis, it’s understandable to wonder how one can best be of service in protecting democratic norms and institutions. In my case, I decided it’s better for me to be working as a journalist—offering my opinions and analysis in the pages of Vanity Fair and on social media, or commentating on MSNBC and conducting interviews on my podcast, Fast Politics. For someone else, the best thing to do is run for public office.\nBut I was struck by how many people read the Politico story and congratulated me on taking on Nadler—something, again, I am not doing. While wading through those messages, I realized that a lot of people are desperate for new representation in Washington, including those in an overwhelmingly Democratic district represented by a 77-year-old who has been a New York congressman since 1992. Even Nadler’s Democratic colleagues believed it was time for him to step aside when it came to serving as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. In December, shortly after Nadler agreed not to run to retain the coveted committee role, the Times noted that people close to the congressman “said he had been deeply hurt by the push to replace him.”\nHis successor on Judiciary, Jamie Raskin, has demonstrated his ability to make forceful arguments against Trump, having served as lead impeachment manager in the aftermath of the January 6 attack. More recently, he has addressed the “very dangerous moment” the country is in and called out “savage” cuts pushed by the Elon Musk–led Department of Government Efficiency. At 62, Raskin may not be among the younger House members, but he’s proven to be an effective communicator, making the Democrats’ case on television and social media. That public-facing role is one in which some next-generation Congressional talents, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 35, and Maxwell Frost, 28, particularly excel at.\nWe've unfortunately seen older Democratic politicians refuse to step aside for generational change; Joe Biden, who spoke in 2020 of being a “bridge” to “future” leaders of the party, still ran for reelection at age 81 despite low approval ratings (and only bowed out for Kamala Harris after a disastrous debate performance). There was also Dianne Feinstein, who died in office in 2023, at age 90, after being absent from the Senate for nearly three months and missing more than 90 floor votes.\nLet’s not forget how Feinstein, a few years earlier, clashed with politically engaged kids who were urging her to support the Green New Deal. She appeared dismissive of their pleas for climate action, at one point telling a 16-year-old who was calling on politicians to listen to constituents, “Well, you didn’t vote for me.”\nWhich brings me to the impetus for this column: I’m not running for Congress, but you should. Women, especially, need to be pushed, as a lot of times the best people for elected office have only the faintest sense that they should run.\nYes, there are people running in 2026, when Democrats have an opportunity to take control of the House and put some limits on Trump’s power. And the world’s richest man firing significant swaths of the federal government should only create more candidates. As Amanda Litman, the cofounder of Run for Something, an organization that recruits young progressive candidates, told me: “In the 3.5 months since Trump won, we’ve seen over 20,000 people express interest in running for office, nearly half of them just since inauguration—already exceeding our numbers from all of 2017. People are fired up to do something meaningful, and are sick of waiting around for leaders who can’t find their backbones.”\nRemember, we are the leaders we’ve been waiting for. Democrats need to stop being polite, stop waiting their turn, and realize, as Fonda put it, that we’re in that documentary moment as we speak. Rehearsal time is over.","summary":"But you should!","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/molly-jong-fast-congress","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67bcb15d1ab2b7a3fc14eacf/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf225-molly-congress.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 20:45:57","author":"Molly Jong-Fast","authors":["Molly Jong-Fast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":293939288,"title":"Medicaid Cuts Threaten A Key House Vote On Trump's Agenda Tomorrow—Here's Why The GOP Is Divided","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nHouse Republicans are expected to vote on a spending blueprint Tuesday that would kickstart the legislative process for enacting President Donald Trump’s policy agenda—but nearly $1 trillion in potential cuts to Medicaid has made some Republicans uneasy, threatening to derail its passage.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks with reporters as he walks to the House Chamber from his ... [+] office at the U.S. Capitol on February 24, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe fiscal year 2025 spending plan would likely lead to about $800 billion in cuts from Medicaid over the next decade, part of $2 trillion in overall spending cuts to help pay for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts plus boosts in defense and border spending.\n\nThe federal government’s Medicaid program provides health care coverage to more than 72 million Americans.\n\nWhile the resolution doesn’t explicitly call for cuts to Medicaid, skeptical lawmakers have warned there’s virtually no other way to achieve the $880 billion in cuts the resolution tasks the Energy and Commerce Committee with finding without slashing Medicaid spending.\n\nModerate Republicans in vulnerable districts and those where significant portions of their constituents are on Medicaid have expressed resistance to any Medicaid spending cuts.\n\nEight House Republicans, including Reps. David Valadao, R-Calif. and Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., who are members of the Hispanic Conference or represent districts with sizeable Hispanic populations warned in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson earlier this month that “slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in rural and predominantly Hispanic communities,” while also advocating for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—often known as food stamps—to remain protected.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents a district that voted for Kamala Harris in November, also expressed concerns about the potential Medicaid cuts and said he has asked House leadership to prove that the $880 billion in cuts the budget instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee to find “won’t overly cut Medicaid,” Roll Call reported.\n\nJohnson has previously suggested tying work requirements to Medicaid could be one way to cut the program, and Republicans have mulled limiting the amount of money given to states to administer Medicaid.\n\nHow Many Votes Can Republicans Lose To Pass The Budget Resolution?\n\nAssuming all Democrats vote against the spending plan, Republicans can afford to lose just one vote under their 218-215 majority in the House. At least one, Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., has already said she will vote against the bill, writing Sunday on X that the spending cuts did not go far enough, while Rep. Tom Massie, R-Ky., has said privately he’ll oppose the deal, according to Politico.\n\nWhat Has House Speaker Mike Johnson Said About Medicaid Cuts?\n\nJohnson said “no” when asked by Politico on Monday whether he would amend the budget to alleviate concerns about Medicaid cuts, noting that the resolution only includes topline spending goals the relevant House committees are required to use as a blueprint for making cuts and doesn’t include anything “specific about Medicaid.” The resolution, Johnson said, “is merely the starting point for the process . . . the legislation comes later.” Johnson said he is optimistic Republicans have the votes to pass the resolution Tuesday.\n\nWhat Else Is In The House Gop Budget?\n\nA $4 trillion increase to the federal debt ceiling, another potential sticking point for some Republicans, including Reps. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and Massie who have historically resisted any increase to the debt limit. The spending plan would also extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and include an additional $300 billion for the border and defense.\n\nHow Does The House Plan Differ From The Senate’s?\n\nThe Senate plan, passed last week, does not include Medicaid cuts. The Senate budget resolution omits tax policy but sets the spending agenda to enact Trump’s border, defense and energy policies, punting negotiations on tax policy to a later date and breaking up the spending plan into two separate measures.\n\nWhat Has Trump Said About The Spending Plans In The House And Senate?\n\nTrump has called for “one big, beautiful bill” as proposed by the House, he said Wednesday on Truth Social, though two days later he said he was supportive of the Senate agenda as a backup plan, telling Fox News radio “it gives you optionality.”\n\nWhat Has Trump Said About Medicaid?\n\nTrump said last week in an interview on Fox News that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid would “be strengthened . . . none of that stuff is going to be touched,” a stance that contradicts his endorsement of the House Republican budget proposal.\n\nWhat Happens If The Resolution Is Approved By The House?\n\nThe Senate will vote on the measure. If approved, it would kickstart the legislative process for enacting Trump’s agenda by setting spending goals for his various policy priorities. The relevant House and Senate committees would then draft legislation according to those goals.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRepublicans’ plans for Medicaid have a political problem (Politico)\n\nMike Johnson’s moment of truth (Politico)\n\nMedicaid Cuts Pose Budget Conundrum for Valadao and Republicans Nationwide (New York Times)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Ron DeSantis said Monday that he would not necessarily support President Donald Trump's pick to replace him, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and acknowledged the rumor of his wife, Casey DeSantis, potentially running next year. Donalds has not formally announced plans to run for governor of Florida in the 2026 race, but Trump said in a TRUTH Social post Thursday that Donalds had his \"complete and total endorsement\" if he so chooses. DeSantis, meanwhile, has been rumored to be floating the idea of his wife running for governor to donors. At a press conference in Tampa on Monday in which he discussed the creation of Florida's own Department of Government Efficiency, DeSantis declined to back a Donalds gubernatorial bid at this stage. \"Donald Trump just got into office. I want these congressmen focused on enacting his agenda,\" DeSantis said. \"They haven’t done very much yet. They’re not putting his executive orders into place. We’ll see what they do on the spending, but we have such a narrow majority that to be trying to campaign other places and missing these votes I think is not something that’s advisable at all.\" RON DESANTIS: FLORIDA WAS DOGE BEFORE IT WAS COOL \"We’ve achieved victories in Florida. We need to start achieving those victories up there, so I think people look at it and say, you know you got a guy like Byron, he just hasn’t been a part of any of the victories that we’ve had here over these last years,\" DeSantis continued. \"He’s just not been a part of it.

We could revert very quickly. That could happen. 100%,\" DeSantis, who Trump endorsed in the 2018 gubernatorial race, said. \"And so it really needs to be, 'OK, are you going to be somebody that’s going to fight for people, especially when it’s not easy? Have you been willing to get in and get involved in these big battles that we’ve had and have won over these many years?’ And if you’re not willing to do that, then I think we are going to see this state revert, so I would not take anything for granted.\" \"We’ve had hundreds of thousands of people move here specifically because of the policies that we have, and I think that’s something that you should not take for granted,\" DeSantis said. \"This is not necessarily something that just goes on auto pilot.\" KAMALA HARRIS TAKES VEILED JABS AT TRUMP, ELON MUSK IN 1ST MAJOR SPEECH SINCE ELECTION DEFEAT Asked about his wife potentially running, DeSantis gave no confirmation Monday but spoke highly of her political acumen and conservatism. \"People ask me all the time about our wonderful first lady, who has done a fantastic job as first lady of Florida,\" DeSantis said of the first lady. \"I will tell you this, you’re talking about somebody like her. I won by the biggest margin that any Republican has ever won a governor’s race here in Florida. She would do better than me.\" \"She’s somebody that has the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles that, you know, anything that we’ve accomplished she’d be able to take to the next level,\" DeSantis said. He added that the late legendary American broadcaster Rush Limbaugh once told him at a dinner in Palm Beach during his first year as governor, \"The only person I would rather have as my governor than you, is her.\" On Thursday, Trump wrote on his social media platform in part, \"Byron Donalds would be a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida and, should he decide to run, will have my Complete and Total Endorsement.

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, the liberal network’s highest-paid star, famously cut \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" to once a week in 2022 to pursue other projects despite her enormous salary. But earlier this year, as MSNBC struggled to attract viewers in the wake of the presidential election, it was announced that Maddow would host her show each weeknight for Trump’s first 100 days. Alex Wagner, who hosted the coveted 9 p.m. ET timeslot on Tuesdays through Thursdays before Maddow temporarily returned to a five-days-per-week schedule, will not return to primetime with Psaki landing the additional airtime. MSNBC CANCELS JOY REID’S SHOW AS PART OF PROGRAMMING SHAKEUP AT LIBERAL NETWORK Wagner will remain with the network as a senior political analyst. MSNBC's new president, Rebecca Kutler, has made a slew of changes since she was named the permanent replacement to Rashida Jones earlier this month. Joy Reid’s program \"The ReidOut\" was canceled and the far-left host will not remain at the network. Ayman Mohyeldin’s \"Ayman Mohyeldin Reports,\" Katie Phang’s \"The Katie Phang Show\" and Jonathan Capehart’s current weekend programs have all been canceled. Mohyeldin, Capehart and Phang will all remain at the network in new roles, with Mohyeldin and Capehart landing new shows at different timeslots and Phang will stay on as a legal correspondent broadcasting from Miami. JOY REID SAYS BLACK WOMEN NO LONGER INTERESTED IN 'SAVING AMERICA' AFTER BETRAYAL BY WHITE FEMALE VOTERS \"Inside with Jen Psaki\" launched in 2023 and was the brainchild of Kutler. The show is MSNBC’s most-watched weekend program and also currently airs on Mondays, so MSNBC giving more airtime to the former Biden administration press secretary has long been rumored. She will now anchor her primetime show four nights a week as MSNBC signals it has no plans to ditch its far-left reputation. Symone Sanders-Townsend, who was a former spokesperson to Vice President Kamala Harris, Alicia Menendez and RNC Chair turned MSNBC host Michael Steele will host a new show in the 7 p.m. ET timeslot previously occupied by Reid. The new program will be an hour Tuesdays through Thursday, but will be two hours on Monday nights, replacing the Monday edition of \"Inside with Jen Psaki\" now that she will move to the other weeknights. MSNBC also plans to add a Washington bureau and beef up domestic and international correspondents ahead of parent company Comcast’s plans to spin off several NBCUniversal cable networks, including MSNBC, into a new company called SpinCo. The move will separate NBC News from the cable network that it has long shared resources with. Ana Cabrera, Chris Jansing and Katy Tur have seen their daytime programs moved or extended as part of the widespread shakeup. Ali Velshi will also expand his weekend program, \"Velshi,\" to three hours. MSNBC is consolidating its production operations to New York and Washington, D.C. This impacted \"The Katie Phang Show,\" along with \"José Díaz-Balart Reports,\" which were based out of Miami. Díaz-Balart will remain the anchor of \"Weekend Nightly News\" on NBC. Most changes go into effect in late April, although exact dates remain uncertain. MSNBC'S FUTURE A 'BIG CONCERN' FOR STAFFERS AS COMCAST MOVES TO SEPARATE LIBERAL NETWORK FROM NBCUNIVERSAL \"This is going to be a really exciting time but also a challenging time. I think it's important that we as leaders are honest about that and about the challenges ahead. Our jobs are hard on a normal day, and these are not normal times,\" Kutler told MSNBC leaders during a meeting before changes were announced. \"We have a new company, we have new leadership, we will have new offices, and we have a non-stop news cycle. I think it's important that we all share in the exciting parts of what the year ahead is going to mean in terms of getting to build a new news organization - one that is built for us, for our needs first, to be part of a new company that is standing itself up, and that we have a seat at the table at the ground floor of that, and what that's going to look like and we get to help determine that,\" Kutler added. \"It’s going to be hard, but it's also going to be exciting and interesting and a really important time to do what all of us do.\" While there has been chatter about the new cable company ditching the MSNBC name, SpinCo CEO Mark Lazarus has told staffers to \"take that off of your worry list\" because the name will stick around.

They should be forced to pay vast sums of money for the damage they've done to our Country.\"\n\nTrump's claim that journalism he does not like is \"illegal\" and constitutes a tort justifying massive civil damages should be familiar by now. He has made such claims not only in social media posts but also in actual lawsuits against news organizations. As the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) explains in a motion filed last Friday, these chilling attempts to convert Trump's complaints about press coverage into causes of action are legally baseless and blatantly unconstitutional.\n\nLast October, Trump sued CBS in Texas, claiming that its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris constituted consumer fraud that had caused him \"at least\" $10 billion in damages. In December, he filed a similar lawsuit against The Des Moines Register and pollster Ann Selzer in Iowa, claiming a voter survey that erroneously predicted a Harris victory in that state likewise amounted to consumer fraud.\n\nFIRE, which represents Selzer in the latter case, notes that the Supreme Court has recognized several narrowly defined exceptions to the First Amendment, including \"obscenity, child pornography, defamation, fraud, incitement, fighting words, and speech integral to criminal activity.\" Trump is trying to carve out an additional exception for \"fake news,\" which would have a paralyzing impact on journalists, since they would be exposed to daunting legal expenses and potentially ruinous civil liability whenever their reporting was arguably misleading or inaccurate.\n\n\"In the United States,\" FIRE Chief Counsel Robert Corn-Revere notes in a motion to dismiss Trump's claims against Selzer, \"there is no such thing as a claim for 'fraudulent news.' No court in any jurisdiction has ever held such a cause of action might be valid, and few plaintiffs have ever attempted to bring such outlandish claims.\" While the \"fake news\" label \"may play well for some on the campaign trail,\" Corn-Revere writes, it \"has no place in America's constitutional jurisprudence.\" Trump's lawsuit, he says, is \"a transparent attempt to punish news coverage and analysis of a political campaign, speech that not only is presumptively protected but 'occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values.'\"\n\nThe object of Trump's ire is a poll that Selzer conducted for the Register shortly before the 2024 presidential election. Unlike other polls and Selzer's previous surveys, all of which found that Trump was ahead in Iowa, this one gave Harris a three-point lead. That poll, which the Register published on the Saturday before the election, turned out to be off by more than a little: Trump won Iowa by a 13-point margin.\n\n\"It's called suppression,\" Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania the day after the Register reported Selzer's results. \"And it actually should be illegal.\"\n\nIn fact, according to Trump, it was illegal. In a complaint he filed in the Iowa District Court for Polk County on December 16, Trump averred that Selzer's poll violated that state's Consumer Fraud Act, which prohibits deceptive practices \"in connection with the advertisement, sale, or lease of consumer merchandise.\" At the defendants' request, the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. In an amended complaint on January 31, Trump added common law claims of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation.\n\nThat complaint was joined by two additional plaintiffs: Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R–Iowa) and former state Sen. Bradley Zaun (R–Urbandale). Miller-Meeks' beef was similar to Trump's: Although Selzer's poll gave Miller-Meeks' opponent a 16-point lead, she ultimately won reelection by two-tenths of a point. Zaun's grievance was more mysterious, since Selzer had not polled his race, which he lost by four points. The complaint nevertheless claims the poll \"impacted\" his race. It also notes that he \"read the election coverage at issue in this action,\" which it says deceived him as a voter and Trump campaign contributor.\n\nNone of these plaintiffs suffered any cognizable damages under the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act (ICFA). \"Plaintiffs have no claim under the ICFA against Selzer because they do not allege that they purchased or leased anything from Selzer,\" Corn-Revere writes. \"The ICFA is a consumer fraud statute designed to protect Iowa consumers deceived into buying or leasing a product. It provides a cause of action for victims of 'deception' and 'fraud' 'in connection with the advertisement, sale, or lease of consumer merchandise.' And it allows consumers to recover damages if they suffer an 'ascertainable loss of money or property as the result' of that deception or fraud. Plaintiffs allege no 'fraud' or 'deception' to induce them into a transaction with Selzer, nor do they allege any 'ascertainable loss of money or property.'\"\n\nTrump et al.'s common law claims are invalid for similar reasons. \"Fraudulent misrepresentation\" refers to \"a situation where a defendant lies to induce a plaintiff into a transaction to the plaintiff's detriment,\" Corn-Revere notes. Yet \"Selzer made no actionable representation 'to the Plaintiffs,'\" and Trump et al. \"have not alleged the Iowa Poll was 'material' to an inducement directed to Plaintiffs by Selzer.\" They \"similarly do not allege Selzer intended to induce them into a transaction.\"\n\nA claim of \"negligent misrepresentation\" likewise requires that the plaintiff suffered damages because, in completing a transaction, he \"reasonably relied\" on information that the defendant \"knew or reasonably should have known\" was false. It also requires that \"the defendant intended to supply information to the plaintiff or knew that the recipient intended to supply it to the plaintiff.\" Even if we assume Selzer knew or should have known her poll results were off, none of the other criteria is met.\n\nAs with the ICFA claim, Trump et al. could not have relied on false information in completing a transaction with Selzer because there was no transaction. And while the plaintiffs argue that they \"justifiably relied\" on the poll results, they also describe it as an \"outlier\" that defied \"common sense, electoral history, [and] all other public polls.\" They claim Selzer had a history of underestimating Republican support, and they say \"any responsible pollster or journalist with experience in Iowa politics would recognize\" the poll's \"clear inaccuracy.\" Trump et al. are \"so desperate to spike the football regarding Selzer's polling inaccuracies,\" Corn-Revere says, that they \"aggressively concede the element of reliance.\"\n\nIn any case, Selzer did not intend to \"supply the information\" to Trump et al., and she had no special \"duty of care\" to them. \"If a newspaper prints incorrect information, if a scientist publishes careless statements in a treatise, or if an oil company prints an inaccurate road map, they cannot be 'liable' to those of the general public who read their works absent some special relationship between [the] writer and reader,\" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit observed in a 1971 decision that Corn-Revere quotes. While \"accuracy in news reporting is certainly a desideratum,\" a federal judge in New Jersey noted seven years later, \"imposing a high duty of care on those in the business of news dissemination and making that duty run to a wide range of readers or TV viewers would have a chilling effect which is unacceptable under our Constitution.\"\n\nTrump et al. also \"fail to allege recoverable damage,\" the FIRE motion says. As candidates, Trump and Miller-Meeks claim, they had to \"expend extensive time and resources,\" including \"direct federal campaign expenditures,\" to \"counteract the harms\" caused by Selzer's poll. \"But they filed this lawsuit in their personal capacities, and the Supreme Court has made clear that a campaign is 'a legal entity distinct from the candidate,'\" Corn-Revere writes. \"Mr. Trump and Ms. Miller-Meeks allege no cognizable harm to them as individuals from the Iowa Poll, so they have not [pled] the element of damages.\"\n\nZaun's claims \"are even more implausible (if that is possible),\" the motion says. \"Mr. Zaun does not explain what those damages are, nor does he explain how he could have suffered financial damage from a poll that did not mention him or poll his race. Even if he had offered some explanation, there's no causation for damages consisting of losing elections.\"\n\nIn short, Trump et al. \"try to shoehorn their claims\" into an existing category of constitutionally unprotected speech by \"calling the Iowa Poll 'fake' and asserting actionable 'fraud' occurred,\" Corn-Revere writes. He quotes \"the famous words of Inigo Montoya\" in The Princess Bride: \"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\" The plaintiffs' \"allegations about polls and news stories they dislike,\" Corn-Revere says, \"have nothing to do with fraud.\"\n\nTrump et al. \"also sprinkle the complaint with loose talk of 'election interference,'\" the motion notes. They \"wield the terms 'election interference' and 'fraud' like an alchemist's incantation, hoping to transform their political dross into legal gold. But no amount of vacuous repetition can convert their expansive concept of 'fake news' to the very limited and specific legal concept of fraud. The Supreme Court has made clear that slapping the 'fraud' label on a claim cannot satisfy the specific showing required or extinguish the First Amendment.\"\n\nGiven the flagrant frivolousness of these claims, you might wonder, why is Trump pressing them? As he explains it, he is determined to \"straighten out the press\" one way or another. \"I shouldn't really be the one to do it,\" he told reporters in December. \"It should have been the Justice Department or somebody else. But I have to do it [because] our press is very corrupt.\"\n\nAs Trump sees it, the U.S. Department of Justice should be policing the press to make sure it is telling the truth. While any such program would be clearly unconstitutional, Trump thinks he can achieve similar results by filing his own lawsuits.\n\nHe's not wrong. Trump's consumer fraud complaint against CBS, which the network accurately described as \"completely without merit,\" is at least as ridiculous as his consumer fraud complaint against Selzer and the Register. Maybe more ridiculous, since it does not involve any actual journalistic failure: The gravamen of Trump's grievance is that 60 Minutes edited its interview with Harris to make her response to a question about Israel seem slightly more cogent. Yet Paramount, which owns CBS, reportedly is keen to appease Trump by settling that laughable lawsuit because the company worries that the phony controversy over the interview could jeopardize its pending merger with Skydance Media.\n\nWhen you are president of the United States, it turns out, you can intimidate major news outlets simply by suing them, no matter how absurd your legal arguments are. Trump was always rich enough to bankroll lawsuits that imposed costs on people whose speech offended him even when they had not said anything that remotely resembled a tort. Now that his wealth is complemented by the vast powers of the executive branch, he has even less reason to worry that his litigation makes no sense.","summary":"The president's portrayal of journalism he does not like as consumer fraud is legally frivolous and blatantly unconstitutional.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/02/24/trump-tries-to-carve-out-a-first-amendment-exception-for-fake-news/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/01/Donald-Trump-signing-executive-orders-1-23-25-Newscom-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 20:05:22","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":293930108,"title":"Keith Olbermann Goes Ballistic Over 'MSNBC Racist Purge' & Warns White Anchors","text":"Crazy Keith Olbermann, who claimed he was leaving Twitter forever in December, went on yet another wild, unhinged rant Monday over MSNBC's \"racist purge,\" as he's calling it. News broke Sunday that this will be Joy Reid's final week at the Lib stronghold and it sent Keith into a tailspin. The cable news channel, which is a ratings disaster, is attempting a reshuffle of talent, but Keith says this is nothing more than \"a confused, brutal, racist purge at MSNBC it's like they're being run by Elon Musk.\" This gets even better. Keith is calling on whites Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O'Donnell and Chris Hayes to risk their careers over this injustice. \"Dear @maddow, If you go on the air tonight - or at minimum go on without condemning the overt racism of the people who give you $25 million a year - you are complicit. Same for you [O'Donnell] and [Hayes],\" the former SportsCenter legend tweeted. \"Protest, or you are all Joe Scarborough.\" On Sunday, Keith claimed that MSNBC \"didn't have a Joy Reid problem,\" which is an interesting statement considering the cable channel finished January with its worst January ratings — EVER. On Wednesday, February 19, an episode of Gold Rush on Discovery had more viewers than Reid. On January 6, a night when the Libs were cooking with gasoline, Reid's show had just 708,000 viewers. Episodes of Swamp People on History Channel do better than that. But, you can't tell Keith that. The solution, according to former MSNBC host Olbermann, is to fire Scarborough, who works mornings while Reid works evenings. Interesting plan. \"Until he is fired, MSNBC will not recover. Shuffling tepid shows in and out does nothing,\" Olbermann tweeted Sunday night. Keith Olbermann failed to mention that MSNBC is filling the Reid vacancy with a black woman, a black guy and a woman whose father is Bob Menendez — that guy is Cuban! Look, I hate to bang on Keith here, but he makes it too easy. Here's how this Joy Reid trade shakes out: Out: Joy Reid and her DEI hires In: Symone Sanders; black woman; Kamala Harris' spokeswoman In: Michael Steele; black man, and former RNC Chairman, which MSNBC loves to remind viewers; he hates Trump In: Bob Menendez's daughter. Her husband's father was president of Cuba.

Santiago / Getty Images)\n\nBy David Faris\n published 24 February 2025 \n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos is one of the most recognizable members of an uber-wealthy global elite. As the owner of the Washington Post since 2013, he is also a frequent target of press critics on both sides of the American political divide.\n\nLike many of the world's most fabulously wealthy, Bezos' path to riches was greased with family wealth, but it was Bezos' vision that turned an online hub for used books in the early Internet era into a world-best market hegemony powerful enough to muscle out competition in virtually any field over the course of 30 years. In large part because Amazon delivery trucks are a ubiquitous presence on America's streets, Bezos has since accumulated enough wealth to be richer than many of the world's countries.\nHow did he amass his fortune?\n\nBezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in computer science and electrical engineering. After college, Bezos went to work for a financial technology startup, Fitel, before moving to banking and then to the hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co. in 1990, where he was \"tasked with researching potential business opportunities involving the then brand-new internet landscape,\" said CNBC. There, he would show \"many of the idiosyncratic qualities his employees would later observe at Amazon,\" including \"constantly recording ideas in a notebook he carried with him,\" said Brad Stone in an excerpt from his 2013 book \"The Everything Store.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Originally called \"Cadabra,\" the name \"later changed because it sounded too much like \"cadaver,\" or a dead human body used for research,\" said Yahoo. Amazon.com was launched in 1995 as an online bookseller and a year later it was considered one of the \"well-established internet shops\" pressuring brick-and-mortar retailers like Barnes and Noble as well as smaller, independent bookstores, said The New York Times in 1996. Amazon \"survived early prophecies of doom\" and eventually \"branched out into selling music, movies, electronics and toys during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.\" The company struggled through, but ultimately survived, the e-commerce crash of the early 2000s.\n\nBezos took the firm public in 1997, and due to a rapid increase in the company's value, he \"appeared on Forbes list of America's 400 wealthiest people for the first time in 1998,\" said Yahoo Finance, with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion at the time. He would never again fall out of the exclusive billionaire club. Yet Amazon itself would not develop into the market-dominating behemoth it is today until much later. As late as 2004, it was \"still mostly selling just books and DVDs,\" even as it was \"under siege from multiple sides\" including retailers like Best Buy, said Vox. That is when Bezos' firm launched the company's Prime subscription service, a \"$79-a-year loyalty program that includes free two-day shipping on any order,\" said CNN. The yearly subscription fee kept shoppers in the Amazon universe, and eventually made making purchases on the site so easy as to be near-seamless. Today, \"75% of Americans now use Amazon Prime, a record level of penetration,\" said Business Insider.\n\nJeff Bezos, Elon Musk and the billionaire space race\nWhat is Donald Trump's net worth?\nIs the US becoming an oligarchy?\nOver the years, Amazon continued to add innovative new products that disrupted existing industries, including the Kindle, a digital reader that \"dominated every corner of the ebook industry\" and today \"might as well be synonymous with ebook, with its massive reach that accounts for 68% of overall\" market for electronic book sales, said Book Riot. But it is Amazon's dominance of the global package shipping market, driven by Prime subscribers, that has made Bezos one of the richest people in history. Bezos \"built the sprawling logistics and delivery empire\" necessary \"for many of us to buy almost anything we want with a click,\" said Vox. The company's labor practices and market dominance have been the target of regulatory investigations. Conditions in the company's warehouses have also drawn \"scrutiny from government officials, labor groups and workers over high injury rates for the past several years,\" said The Guardian. Perhaps not coincidentally, in 2024 Amazon argued in a legal filing\" that the \"National Labor Relations Board was unconstitutional\" said The New York Times.\nAmazon's global network of warehouses, fulfillment centers and delivery services \"is the envy of, and inspiration for, Amazon's business partners and competitors,\" said Vox. Amazon is also one of the largest private employers in the country and in February 2025 \"dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever,\" said CNBC. Amazon's market cap is an astonishing $2.36 trillion, according to Forbes.\nBranching out to space, finance and journalism \nAs his Amazon empire grew larger and larger, Bezos became involved with a variety of other ventures. In 2005, he created Bezos Expeditions, a venture capital and investment fund \"through which he owns stakes in many companies including space-transportation startup Blue Origin,\" said The Wall Street Journal. In 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million in cash, a maneuver which \"stunned the media industry and sent shockwaves around Washington D.C.,\" said Politico. Bezos promised staff \"that his ownership would bring no radical change to the paper's core values.\" In 2017, after Donald Trump's first presidential victory, Bezos added \"Democracy Dies in Darkness,\" a \"dramatic and alliterative phrase,\" beneath the paper's digital masthead, said The Washington Post. The paper \"lost $77 million\" in 2023 and has \"seen a dramatic 50% drop in audience since the highs of 2020,\" said CNN. In 2024, Bezos pulled the paper's endorsement of Kamala Harris, triggering an exodus of tens of thousands of subscribers as well as a number of staff.\nBezos' net worth took a hit from one of the world's most expensive divorces. In 2019, he and MacKenzie Scott announced that they were splitting. As part of the settlement, \"Bezos handed Scott a 4% stake in Amazon, transferring a total of $38 billion in shares into her name,\" said the Independent. Bezos was, at the time, the world's richest man and even shaving $38 billion off of his fortune left him with $119 billion. And it would not be long before the external shock of a global pandemic helped his fortune recover.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic \"disproportionately padded the wealth of the richest,\" including Bezos, said The Guardian. As the demand for delivery services skyrocketed during the acute phase of the pandemic, Amazon's value soared, as did Bezos' net worth. Amazon's stock price went from just under $91 a share on February 28, 2020 to more than $173 a share in mid-October of 2020. Bezos' net worth jumped to more than $200 billion in 2021 but marginally declined to $196 billion by March 2024, said Yahoo Finance. That still made him the second-richest person in the world. Forbes, on the other hand, pegs his net worth at $233.1 billion as of February 21, 2025, which ranks third on the list of the world's wealthiest people, with Meta's Mark Zuckerberg taking second place.\n\nExplore More\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDavid Faris\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nDavid Faris is an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University and the author of It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics.

Alex Karp's big salesSince the start of 2024, Karp has sold 38 million shares of Palantir, bringing in $1.88 billion, according to investment data from Washington Service. A huge portion of that came from the sale of 25 million shares in the weeks surrounding the presidential election, netting him $1.4 billion, reported Fortune.

With a majority of 218-215 and no hope of winning Democratic votes, Republicans have almost no margin for error: they can only afford one GOP defection to assure passage of the budget blueprint. If it passes, it would instruct committees to write a sweeping package involving taxes, immigration, military spending and energy policy that can be fast-tracked to the House floor for a vote. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Monday afternoon that there “may be more than one” Republican opponent of the measure currently, but predicted that “we’re going to get everybody there.” “This is a prayer request. Just pray this through for us, because it is very high stakes,” he said at an event hosted by the conservative group Americans For Prosperity. “The thing about having a small majority is it brings great clarity. It’s clarifying. I don’t think anybody wants to be in front of this train.” Over the weekend, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, said he was worried that some of his GOP colleagues are backtracking on the deficit-reduction targets. \"I supported it in committee — and am open to supporting it going forward — as a framework to see how much Republicans are willing to finally deliver. But statements by some of my colleagues (House & Senate) leave that in doubt,\" Roy wrote Sunday on X. \"We’re past the time for excuses.\" The mercurial Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., responded to Roy in a Monday post on X, saying she's \"a NO on the current version\" of the budget resolution, citing concerns about too much spending. Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said he's undecided, saying that it's \"important for the Hispanic Conference to have a seat at the table\" and that his priorities include lowering taxes, reducing inflation and cutting regulations \"because most Hispanic businesses are small businesses\" and often family-owned. \"Folks always talk about Hispanic outreach,\" he said. \"Hispanic Conference is the real life walking talking Hispanic outreach.\" Johnson and his House allies have insisted on passing Trump's legislative agenda in one massive bill, clashing with Senate Republicans who want to break it up into two. Trump has publicly sided with the House's path, but if the vote fails, Republicans may have to fall back on the $340 billion Senate budget resolution, which was adopted by the chamber last week. That version deals with the immigration, defense and energy portions of the GOP plan while leaving the tax debate for another measure. “My math is much more complicated in the house than the Senate. For the first time in our lifetime, Senate Republicans have a wider margin than we have in the House,” Johnson said, adding that he has “a much more diverse caucus” than the Senate GOP, including members from districts that former Vice President Kamala Harris won last fall, who have regional concerns. “So finding the right point for all those dials is going to be the trick,” he said. “Over the next several weeks, we’ll get there. And is the sooner that we do, the better it’s going to be.” Republicans plan to vote on the measure Monday in the House Rules Committee, where they have a 9-4 majority and will likely have the votes to send it to the House floor. They may be helped somewhat by potential absences among Democratic lawmakers, due to health reasons and other matters. The vote comes as Democrats rally in opposition, with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., pressing his members to show up. \"Given the expected closeness of the vote, it’s imperative that we are present with maximum attendance,\" he wrote in a letter to colleagues Monday, adding that \"far-right extremists are determined to push through $4.5 trillion of tax breaks for wealthy Republican donors and well-connected corporations, explode the debt and saddle everyday Americans with the bill by ending Medicaid as we know it. We must be at full strength to enhance our opportunity to stop the GOP Tax Scam in its tracks.\" Democrats have zeroed in on language in the budget that requires the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut spending by a hefty $880 billion. The panel oversees Medicaid, which some Republicans are targeting for spending cuts, eying new policies like work requirements to raise the bar for accessing benefits. A recent poll conducted by Fabrizio Ward, the firm helmed by Trump's longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio, surveyed 18 swing congressional districts on behalf of the Republican-aligned nonprofit Building America's Future. It found that that health care costs were a major concern for both swing voters and Trump voters. Among the policies it tested, the most favorable reaction was on extending the expiring tax credits for buying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which Democrats first passed in 2021 and renewed in 2022. Bob Ward, one of the pollsters who conducted it, warned Republicans to tread carefully when it comes to health care benefits. “Find ways to pay for your tax priorities that don’t hurt working families, many of whom, and in some districts — most of whom — are your own voters,” Ward told NBC News. “Taking away peoples health insurance is neither fiscally prudent nor politically smart.”","summary":"House Republican leaders are eying a high-stakes vote this week on a sweeping budget resolution to pass President Donald Trump's agenda.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-face-headwinds-seek-pass-budget-trumps-agenda-rcna193436","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250123-Mike-Johnson-al-0856-db0fe1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 18:46:34","author":"Sahil Kapur","authors":["Sahil Kapur"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":293907538,"title":"Eva Longoria teases emotional reunion with long lost family in new series after she quit the US for Spain","text":"Eva Longoria sets out to reunite with her long-lost family in the first look trailer at her new series Searching for Spain, after having fled America.\n\nThe Desperate Housewives actress, 49, quit the United States over three years ago due to work commitments and mainly splits herself between Spain and Mexico.\n\nIn her latest television series, Eva embarks on a gastronomic pilgrimage through Madrid, San Sebastian, Barcelona, Seville and more, where she explores her ties to region and shares the hidden gems that have helped make it a 'personal favorite'.\n\nIn the first look trailer, Eva explains that her ancestors left Spain four centuries ago.\n\n'Eleven generations ago, one of my ancestors left Spain for the new world and new life,' she said.\n\n'Four hundred years later, I'm back to see how the land and its people have created one of the world's most exciting cuisines.'\n\n'If you can preserve your food and your recipes, you can teach the rest of the world who you are,' she continues, adding: 'I get to visit long lost family!'\n\n'Spain is an international culinary mecca with its rugged coastlines and fishing ports, countryside vineyards and alpine mountains bearing fruit to world-class produce and the finest quality ingredients,' the official synopsis for the show, slated to launch on April 27, states. \n\n'From homemade tapas, fresh regional seafood delicacies, rustic paellas and beyond, Eva will enjoy some of Spain's most iconic traditional dishes and explore how innovative Spanish cuisine is propelling the future of fine dining.'\n\nEva previously partnered with CNN on Eva Longoria: Searching for Mexico, where she journeyed across the lands of her ancestors to explores how the country's rich culture, landscape, and history have helped shape its cuisine, loved the world over.\n\nTexas born actress Eva, who has Spanish citizenship, has spent her 'whole adult life' in California.

Forty-nine percent of Americans say the president is doing a good job versus 47.8 percent who say he isn't, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. In the November election, Trump won 49.8 percent of the national popular vote, versus 48.3 percent for Harris, his vanquished opponent.\n\nHardly sounds like a collapse to me. More like steady as she goes.\n\nAnd his individual policy ideas are proving popular, too.\n\nNearly six in 10 Americans approve of Trump's plan to deport illegal immigrants, 54 percent support his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict and a majority are on board with Elon Musk taking a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy and it's out-of-control spending, according to a CBS News poll this month.\n\nIndeed, most Americans want to eliminate waste, such as $20 million for Sesame Street in Iraq, $9 million for violent terrorists instead of civilians in Syria and $69,000 for dance classes in Wuhan, China (yes, that Wuhan). And illegal immigration was one of the top motivations for voters to return Trump to office in the first place.\n\nOn top of that, Trump may be in the running for a Nobel Peace Prize if he can negotiate the end of the war between Ukraine and Russia in a way that stops the killing, guarantees a 'sovereign and prosperous Ukraine' (in the words Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth) and brings stability to the European continent.\n\nLeaving aside all the political metrics for a second, what would a 'collapse' for Donald Trump even look like?\n\nHe has the most loyal political base in American history and appears to have expanded on that support in the November election by appealing to historic numbers of voters across the demographic and ideological spectrum.\n\nPeople who rarely if ever voted Republican (or even rarely voted at all!) flocked to Trump to rescue the country from the kind of politicians that Carville was promoting just last fall.\n\nIs it possible that Trump's numbers could fluctuate? Sure. That's true for all political figures. But to use the word 'collapse' suggests naïve wish-casting on the part of a political operative who is certainly old enough to know better.\n\nOutside of the period following January 6, Trump has been impervious to polling spikes one way or the other. And most Republicans are more than happy with Trump so far. They are getting exactly what they asked for – a 'revolution of common sense.'\n\nBut for argument's sake, let's say that Carville is right and Trump is about to suffer a massive polling downturn. One of President Trump's saving graces is that he is forever blessed with the dumbest and most off-putting political enemies imaginable.\n\n'The fact that I am rooting for Canada and that I am rooting for Mexico a lot is really wild. But, they are really the ones speaking truth to power right now,' said Democratic US Congresswoman Crockett last week, as she openly cheered for American failure in the face of negotiations with other countries.\n\nCrockett has become the de facto leader of the post-2024 Democratic Party as its most visible spokesperson.\n\n'We are gonna be in your face. We are gonna be on your a**es, and we are gonna make sure you understand what democracy looks like,' Crockett screamed into a microphone at an anti-Trump rally a few weeks ago.\n\nSince Crockett's rapid rise to prominence in her party, polling for Congressional Democrats has collapsed. Just 21% of the American people approve of the job they are doing, an all-time low in the latest Quinnipiac survey. But American leftists just can't help themselves.\n\nCrockett's Democratic Party supports DEI and opposes deporting illegal aliens. As long as Dems stick to that foolishness, a Trump collapse is highly unlikely. \n\nTrump's ultimate report card won't be written by 'emotional' partisans like Carville or from aggressively ignorant progressives like Crockett.\n\nDemocrats may as well 'lay back.' At this point, there's not much else they can do – except, perhaps, get on board.","summary":"It was only last October when a New York Times column headlined 'Three Reasons I'm Certain Kamala Harris Will Win,' turned James Carville into a laughingstock among the political cognoscenti.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14430559/james-carville-trump-collapse-scott-jennings.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/24/16/95533309-0-image-m-25_1740415357819.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/23/9095570314546532263/1024x576_MP4_9095570314546532263.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-24 17:50:00","author":"Editor,Scott Jennings","authors":["Editor","Scott Jennings"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.117},{"id":293911482,"title":"The young techies behind DOGE are a lightning rod for criticism but also a youth magnet for the GOP","text":"By CHRISTINE FERNANDO\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — To those concerned about billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s access to sensitive government data, his tear-it-down band of young techies doing that work is an unregulated threat to privacy. The view on the right is much different.\n\nVoices influential in conservative politics describe the crew of engineers, most of whom are in their early 20s, as among the world’s best minds sent to save the U.S. government from bureaucratic bloat.\n\nIt comes at a moment when young progressives have criticized the Democratic Party for sidelining them and as the party’s hold on younger voters is slipping, particularly among young men. Republicans are using the contrasting images as a marketing strategy.\n\nCharlie Kirk, founder of the group Turning Point, which has organized voter turnout efforts for Republicans, called them “young prodigies” and “all-stars” with IQs that “would melt the charts”\n\n“This is a Gen Z, millennial takeover of the federal government,” Kirk said on his Feb. 4 podcast. “And we always thought it was coming from the left. But this is the geriatric, the kind of nursing home regime that has been pushing the country into oblivion. Now the young guns are taking over the country for the better.”\n\nIn the weeks since President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has burrowed rapidly into federal agencies, reshaping the government with few discernible limits and seizing sensitive taxpayer data.\n\nMusk, the world’s richest man, has called the DOGE team “some of the world’s best software engineers.” In a recent interview with Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, Trump lauded Musk’s DOGE staffers as “very brilliant young people.”\n\n“He attracts a young, very smart type of person,” Trump said of Musk. “I call them high-IQ individuals.”\n\nMany of the DOGE engineers who have been identified in media reports have been linked to Musk’s companies and some to Silicon Valley billionaire and longtime Musk associate Peter Thiel, according to the technology magazine WIRED. One resigned and then was quickly rehired amid controversy over since-deleted racist social media posts. The Wall Street Journal initially linked the 25-year-old staffer, Marko Elez, to an account that posted “I was racist before it was cool” and “Normalize Indian hate.”\n\nKirk and other conservative podcasters have celebrated the young engineers for lending their talents to the Trump administration. Podcast host Jen Horn said “these kids … are literally just living and breathing these numbers” before her co-host Katie Gorka responded by saying, “I’ve often thought we’re going to be saved ultimately by these kids” during a Feb. 4 edition of the “Happy Women” podcast.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy sparred with Hillary Clinton on Musk’s social media site X over the Trump administration’s actions and the plan to have DOGE help upgrade aviation safety.\n\n“They have no relevant experience,” Clinton said in response to Duffy’s post about getting help from Musk’s team. “Most of them aren’t old enough to rent a car.”\n\nDuffy responded sharply, saying, “We’re moving on without you because the American people want us to make America’s transportation system great again. And yes, we’re bringing the 22-year-olds with us.”\n\nRepublicans’ elevation of Musk’s engineers is a reflection of how they were able to chip away at the younger demographic in last year’s election.\n\nTrump’s Democratic opponent in 2024, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, only narrowly won among voters under 30, with nearly half supporting Trump, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the election. That was down considerably from 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won about 6 in 10 voters under 30 in a matchup against then-President Trump. Other age groups also moved toward Trump last year, but the swing among the youngest voters was the most dramatic.\n\nFor Alex Dwyer, the 28-year-old chairman of the Kansas Federation of Young Republicans, watching the celebration of the young DOGE crew has been exciting after spending much of his adulthood feeling that young people were being overlooked in the workplace and in government.\n\n“DOGE is showing that our talents and abilities are finally being recognized as having value,” said the Wichita-based financial analyst. “… The party has finally woken up that if you want to appeal to the youth, you have to involve them in the party.”\n\nTrump’s campaign was especially effective in outreach to young men such as Dwyer who were concerned about the economy and were feeling disaffected by the political gains of women and so-called “culture wars,” said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute and author of the book “The Politics of Gen Z.”\n\nBy looking to alternative media such as right-wing podcasts and social media sites that give a platform to far-right views, the Trump campaign met young men where they are. Deckman said that the celebration of DOGE on social media and podcasts builds on this strategy by repeating the message that young men are being prioritized.\n\n“Historically, you think of the GOP being the party of old fuddy-duddy white guys not passing the baton, and then suddenly there’s this cultural shift to highlighting the contributions of younger people,” she said. “… Meanwhile, when given the chance to pass the torch, Democrats lately have not been very successful in doing that, and young people are fed up.”\n\nSunjay Muralitharan, national president of College Democrats of America, was skeptical that DOGE, which he called an “unconstitutional threat to American democracy,” would attract more young people to the Republican Party.\n\n“Most young people can see through this surface-level pandering,” he said. “The image of the richest man in the world gutting vital agencies speaks more here.”\n\nThere also have been young people who have been making an impact in the Democratic Party, including gun control activist David Hogg, who was named vice chair of the party in elections this month, and Florida Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of the U.S. House.\n\n“Democrats have plenty of young people in consequential jobs,” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. “They’re just not as good at letting us know about it.”\n\nHe said watching the DOGE engineers have a real world impact can be an important signal to young people. That could further hamper Democratic efforts to recruit a younger generation that already was questioning what the party had delivered for it.\n\n“Republicans are seeing a weakness in Democrats through young people, and they’re taking advantage of it,” he said.\n\nBasil Smikle, a Democratic political strategist and professor at Columbia University’s school of professional studies, said many disaffected young men in particular may see DOGE as evidence that they can have power. He urged Democratic leaders to step out of the way of young people and diversify their messengers.\n\n“If you don’t, Republicans are going to go back to the same playbook and beat us every time,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

So you own everything that happens to your mixed status families and to your wives, sisters, and abuelas from here on in.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, November 7, 2024.\n\nElecting Trump = Walking “Willingly Into a Hitlerian Dictatorship”\n\n“[Donald Trump] has decided to make fearmongering about immigration the center of his entire campaign with fascistic rhetoric….The question now for America is: Have we gotten to the point where we would destroy our own economy and walk willingly into a Hitlerian dictatorship because of the fear Donald Trump and his MAGA cronies are perpetuating solely for their own political benefit?...It [Trump’s immigration policy] will look like concentration camps in Germany in the 1930s because that’s what you call it when you put somebody in a camp with means to separate them from society. It’s called a concentration camp.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, September 27, 2024.\n\n“A Dire Warning” for “Democracy”\n\n“And we begin this special episode of The ReidOut tonight with a dire warning for our democracy. Over the next hour, I will lay out the greatest threat to the American democratic experiment in modern times. And it’s called Project 2025. With just 99 days until election day, and with voting starting a lot sooner than that in some states like Pennsylvania where early voting begins in September, it is imperative that every American understand what Project 2025 is about and how it would affect every single one of us if it was ever enacted. Tonight is just the first of many nights where we will dig into this dangerous plan.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, July 29, 2024.\n\nTrump Like Cult Leaders David Koresh, Jim Jones and Charles Manson \n\n“What Donald Trump is doing….it’s kind of David Koresh. It’s kind of Jim Jones. Because those two men started by saying, ‘You need to come to Jesus.’ They started as Christian evangelizers. But eventually, their evangelism said, ‘No, I get to have your wife. No actually, I get to tell you to kill these federal agents that are outside. I’m asking you to pick up a machine gun and shoot them because I don’t want to go to jail.’...It’s making me lose my mind to watch people who call themselves Christians fall down on their knees and worship this man. This is [Charles] Manson stuff.”— Co-host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, April 2, 2024.\n\nRepublicans Aren’t Allowed to Say Slavery is Bad \n\n“You can’t even say slavery was bad now in the Republican Party. That’s how far it’s gone.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, July 27, 2023.\n\n“Toy-Sized Mussolini” DeSantis \n\n“Presidential candidate and toy-sized [Benito] Mussolini Ron DeSantis unveils his authoritarian manifesto, vowing to destroy leftism and wokeism….He’s going to need some de facto morality police to monitor what you read and ban books….You want to control your body anymore, ladies? No, Chairman — sorry, President DeSantis is going to do that. And there is a model for what he wants to do….That model also happens to have a name. And it’s called totalitarianism.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, May 30, 2023.\n\nRepublicans “Bringing Back the Lynching Vibe”\n\nYou have Republicans in multiple states including Florida passing and pushing laws that will allow people to hit Black Lives Matter protesters or any protesters they like with their cars….They seemed to have gotten back into lynching, hanging, all sorts of other draconian 19th-Century fare. What is going on with Republicans that they seem to be bringing back the lynching vibe?...Fascism has many features. And one of them is this sort of lust to be able to harm or kill your political opponents and it feels like across the board on the right, there is this kind of sort of lust for that, right? For we need to be able to not let our political opponents vote, but also to hurt them or worse.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidReport, April 10, 2023.\n\nReid Unpacks the “Myth of Thanksgiving,” America Was Actually “Founded on Violence”\n\n“It’s also important to unpack the myth of Thanksgiving. It is a holiday riddled with historical inaccuracies. Built on this myth that the indigenous welcomed their colonizers with open arms and ears of corn. A simplistic fairytale interpretation of a 1621 encounter between indigenous tribes and English settlers that erases the genocide that followed. It’s the truth that Republicans want banned from our textbooks because here is the secret they want so desperately to keep. We are a country founded on violence.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, November 23, 2022.\n\nRepublicans’ “Tolerance for Blood” Is “Bottomless” \n\n“Please stop thinking that there is some body count, some level of brutality and carnage that will move them — these Republicans and their two pet Democrats. That the rivers of blood will one day run deep enough and the slaughters tragic enough that these politicians will say, ‘Okay, that’s enough. Let’s do something.’ Because their tolerance for blood and the NRA’s tolerance for slaughter are bottomless, as is the grief and the torture that the parents of slaughtered children and slaughtered grandmas and shoppers and bible study parishioners, all the slaughtered Americans will feel every day for the rest of their lives. So honestly, to hell with anybody who says ‘don’t politicize this,’ because these deaths, until we change, until we stop letting this minority of ghouls rule us, this is who we are.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, May 25, 2022.\n\nElon Musk Misses the Days of Apartheid, Wants To Bring It Back on Twitter\n\n“There was a time when people had the double hashtags around their names because they were Jewish and right-wingers were saying ‘get in the oven’ any time you made any benign comment on Twitter. They attacked women. You know, the misogyny was crazy on Twitter for a while. Elon Musk, I guess he — you know — misses the old South Africa in the ’80s. He wants that back.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, April 26, 2022.\n\nAngry at “Thuggish” Republicans\n\n“They’re claiming that they are the defenders of the integrity of childhood. They’re going to go after child pornography and rape. And they’re going to defend the integrity of childhood. [Supreme Court Justice] Brett Kavanaugh was accused, credibly, of rape and the victims were teenage girls and college students. High school and college students! So Josh Hawley, and [Republican Senator] Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham and all the rest of you, and [Republican Senator] Mike Lee, and Tom ‘thuggish’ Cotton. You didn’t defend teenage victims of the man you gleefully put in a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. You don’t get to say anything about Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. She bested you intellectually and you’re mad about it. Stay mad!”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, March 22, 2022.\n\nRon DeSantis Wants to Be “Bull Connor”\n\n“The junior Don [Florida Governor Ron DeSantis] has also taken upon himself to meddle in the state’s congressional redistricting process, submitting his own map which — you guessed it — dilutes the voting power of people of color, cutting in half the number of majority African American districts, splitting up Hispanic voters in South Florida districts, and giving Republicans an eight-seat advantage. I guess when President Biden spoke of whether Republicans wanted to be Bull Connor, DeSantis was at home raising his hand, ‘Me, me, I want to be Bull Connor!’”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, January 18, 2022.\n\nReid Rages Against “Nazi-Curious” Republicans \n\n“You have the Democrats, the responsible parent telling you to be decent to people who are different from you and take care of the Earth, and don’t threaten to kill people….and who pass things like health care and roads and bridges and food for people who can’t afford it. Then there’s the other parent….the Republicans, who lets you stay up all night and eat Snickers for dinner, and take off your mask in a COVID cloud....Your drunk, mostly absentee, Nazi- curious, authoritarian Republican Party is doing this circus, waiting around for you to put their ridiculous, embarrassing, democracy-hating, Trump-cult authoritarianism, open-racism-embracing, dangerous behinds back in power.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, November 18, 2021.\n\nJoy Reid Has More Rage for GOP Than Taliban\n\n“The only reason that we know who the Taliban are is because they decided to back a terrorist group, al-Qaeda, right? They’re an extreme, right-wing organization that perverts….the Islamic faith for power….Here in the United States, our extremists have a political party backing them.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, August 19, 2021.\n\n“Jim Crow” Ted Cruz Is a Betrayal to His Race for Opposing Voting Bill\n\n“Ted Cruz says a lot of stupid things. He does a lot of stupid things. But I personally, as a person of color, as a Black person, am beyond offended that he would dare use the word ‘Jim Crow’ when his party is literally a Jim Crow Party….What you see here on your screen is what Republicans fear in the voting booth and they’re going to do everything they can to make sure it doesn’t happen, including, you know, Stephen from Django Unchained aka Ted Cruz….who’s working to stop fellow people of color from voting, which is amazing.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, May 11, 2021.\n\nGOP Wants to End Democracy, “Torture” Black Voters\n\n“What Republicans are saying is they’re going to make it torture for you to vote in line by having fewer machines, beat-up machines at places….places where black folks live...make it impossible or torture for you to vote in line. And they’re going to make it impossible for you to vote by mail. They’re going to lock off every way that you can vote….This is the end of democracy in America. This is the beginning of the South Africa strategy…..It’s Jim Crow America.”— Host Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut, March 25, 2021.","summary":"Another one bites the dust! \n\nJoy Reid is done at MSNBC. \n\nThere’s a long line of uber-leftist journalists (going back to CBS’s Dan Rather and NBC’s Bryant Gumbel) that the MRC has highlighted over the years who’ve lost their jobs for being astoundingly biased.

Pero en una entrevista televisiva en febrero, la presidenta del grupo parlamentario, la senadora estatal Lena González, demócrata de Long Beach, defendió la exclusión de los republicanos.\n\n“No se trata de dejarlos entrar o no”, dijo González. “Es un grupo parlamentario demócrata… Yo no pediría como demócrata, aunque soy latina, ser parte del grupo parlamentario republicano”.\n\nEl grupo parlamentario latino, que fue formado por cinco demócratas latinos en 1973, es uno de los muchos grupos parlamentarios estatales oficialmente reconocidos en Sacramento.\n\nAlgunos, como el grupo parlamentario negro, atienden a miembros de un determinado grupo étnico, mientras que otros (el grupo parlamentario de deportes al aire libre y el grupo parlamentario rural, por ejemplo) se centran en intereses o regiones particulares.\n\nLos asambleístas y senadores estatales latinos son en su mayoría demócratas. Pero en las elecciones de noviembre, republicanos como Castillo y Jeff González de Indio ganaron escaños demócratas. Hoy, la legislatura de 120 miembros tiene ocho legisladores latinos y latinas del Partido Republicano.\n\nLas victorias de Castillo y González se produjeron cuando el Partido Republicano hizo avances entre los votantes latinos en las últimas elecciones. Si bien la mayoría de los latinos en todo el país votaron por Kamala Harris, el presidente Donald Trump logró avances históricos entre los latinos en las elecciones de 2024.\n\nEl problema de los republicanos latinos que quieren unirse al grupo parlamentario latino no es nuevo.\n\nMike Madrid, consultor republicano y experto en el comportamiento del voto latino, recuerda cuando el entonces asambleísta republicano del Inland y Rod Pacheco, quien se desempeñó como fiscal de distrito del condado de Riverside de 2007 a 2011, fue excluido del grupo parlamentario a fines de la década de 1990.\n\nLos republicanos Abel Maldonado, Charlene Gonzales Zettel y Rocky Chávez también intentaron unirse al grupo parlamentario durante su tiempo en la legislatura, agregó Madrid.\n\nCastillo, cuyo distrito incluye Jurupa Valley, Grand Terrace y partes de Corona, Eastvale y Riverside, cree que debería poder unirse porque su predecesora, la miembro del grupo parlamentario y senadora estatal recientemente electa Sabrina Cervantes, demócrata de Riverside, pertenecía a él cuando representaba a gran parte del distrito de Castillo en la Asamblea.\n\nCastillo dijo que no le han dicho oficialmente que no puede unirse al grupo parlamentario. Envió una carta al grupo parlamentario sobre su incorporación, pero el grupo parlamentario no respondió antes de la fecha límite que ella estableció, dijo Castillo.\n\nEstar en el grupo parlamentario, dijo Castillo, les daría a sus electores acceso a los recursos disponibles para los miembros del grupo parlamentario. Agregó que es una mexicoamericana de primera generación y que más del 60% de sus electores son latinos.\n\nLos demócratas representaban el 43% de los votantes en el distrito de Castillo (los republicanos representaban el 28%) antes de las elecciones de noviembre.\n\n“Fui elegida por los demócratas para ocupar este escaño, por lo que (el grupo parlamentario) les impide que puedan estar representados en ese aspecto”, dijo. “Independientemente de si tienen las mismas creencias o valores, no se trata de eso. Se trata de los electores”.\n\nEsas creencias y valores son importantes, dijo González.\n\n“Me encantaría que un republicano latino se opusiera a las deportaciones masivas porque no solo están sucediendo en los distritos urbanos costeros, sino en el interior y en todas partes”, dijo a KCRA-TV de Sacramento.\n\n“Así que siempre encontraremos puntos de coincidencia, pero cuando algunos republicanos latinos han utilizado palabras como que somos invasores o extranjeros… es degradante, es deshumanizante y el grupo parlamentario demócrata latino no lo tolerará”.\n\nCastillo anunció esta semana que está patrocinando un proyecto de ley que “detendría la asistencia legal financiada por los contribuyentes para los inmigrantes ilegales criminales”. El proyecto de ley evitaría que los dólares de los contribuyentes estatales ayuden a aquellos “con antecedentes penales graves” que enfrentan la deportación.\n\nSánchez también ha promovido políticas conservadoras desde que fue elegida por primera vez en 2022. Está patrocinando una legislación que prohibiría a los atletas transgénero participar en los deportes femeninos en California.\n\nAl menos uno de los miembros del grupo latino, Cervantes, es LGBTQ.\n\nOriginal Story","summary":"Las asambleístas Leticia Castillo y Kate Sánchez dicen que están siendo excluidas injustamente","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/02/24/son-legisladoras-latinas-por-que-no-pueden-unirse-al-caucus-legislativo-latino-de-california/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Panel.webp?w=1024&h=576","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 16:10:33","author":"Jeff Horseman","authors":["Jeff Horseman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.785},{"id":293860448,"title":"James Carville predicts Trump's administration will collapse within 30 days","text":"Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville has forecasted that Donald Trump’s administration will experience a “massive collapse” within 30 days, citing a decline in public approval and internal instability. Speaking to Mediaite’s Dan Abrams, Carville argued that Trump’s leadership is already “in the midst of a collapse” and advised Democrats to stay out of the way while it unfolds.Carville urged Democrats to avoid direct confrontation, suggesting they “play possum” and allow the administration to self-destruct. “It’s going to be easy pickings here in six weeks. Just lay back. We’re in the midst of a collapse. It’s over,” he said. He argued that progressive advocacy groups pushing for aggressive opposition are “worse than useless” and that Democrats should “just let it go”.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW9v0obwlUADespite Carville’s claims, recent polling does not indicate a dramatic collapse. A JL Partners/DailyMail.com poll showed Trump’s approval rating at 53%, his highest since the election, while an Emerson College poll found it had dipped slightly to 48%. A CNN/SSR poll recorded a 47% approval rating, as per The Daily Mail.Carville, however, insisted the administration was facing its lowest approval ratings for any president at a comparable time. He also predicted Republicans would struggle to pass legislation due to their slim House majority and potential resistance from Democrats.The US is just a month away from a possible government shutdown. If Congress fails to pass a spending package, federal programs—including military pay, disaster relief, and aid for low-income Americans—could be halted. Carville suggested Republicans might be forced to negotiate with Democrats to keep the government functioning, reported The Mirror.Trump has made several controversial foreign policy statements, including comments blaming Ukraine for its war with Russia and suggesting Gaza could be turned into the “Riviera”.Meanwhile, his administration has aggressively pursued spending cuts through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This has led to mass layoffs of federal workers and resistance from some agencies over transparency demands.Carville remains certain that Trump’s administration is on the verge of failure. “I think they know exactly what they’re doing and they know exactly what’s going to happen,” he said, adding, “I’ve never been mistaken”. However, given that he previously predicted Kamala Harris would win the presidency, his forecasts should be taken with caution.","summary":"James Carville predicts Donald Trump’s administration will collapse within 30 days due to declining public approval and internal instability.

Holt will continue to be a fixture at the network with a full-time role at “Dateline,” where he has been the principal anchor for almost 15 years, according to a memo shared with network staff Monday. NBC News did not immediately name Holt’s successor. Holt was named anchor of “Nightly News” in June 2015 after steering weekend editions of the news broadcast for eight years and co-anchoring “Weekend TODAY” for 12 years. He has served as principal anchor of “Dateline” since September 2011. “A smile comes to my face when I think that with Nightly News, and Dateline, I have now anchored two of the most successful and iconic television news programs in broadcast history,” Holt wrote in a note Monday to “Nightly” and “Dateline” staffers. “As a 20-year-old radio reporter on the police beat chasing breaking news around San Francisco, I could never have imagined my career path would unfold in the way it has. What an amazing ride.” In his 10 years at the helm of “Nightly News,” Holt covered the defining events of the era, including the political rise of President Donald Trump, the Covid pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel and the war in Gaza. In recent months, Holt co-anchored the network’s coverage of election night, traveled to Iran for an exclusive interview with President Masoud Pezeshkian and helmed a “Dateline” special about the devastating 2025 Los Angeles wildfires. Holt’s interviews with world leaders regularly made headlines and set the news agenda. He spoke one-on-one with Trump, former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Barack Obama, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key figures. Holt frequently traveled to areas hit by deadly hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and mass shootings. “He has led the network during some of the country’s most fraught and challenging times in the past decade,” Janelle Rodriguez, executive vice president of programming for NBC News, wrote in a message to staff. “Quite simply, Lester is the beating heart of this news organization.” He has been named the “most-trusted television news personality in America” two consecutive times, according to polls from The Hollywood Reporter and Morning Consult. “Nightly News” is consistently a top television show each week, averaging around 7 million viewers. Holt, who joined NBC News in 2000, also anchors “Nightly News: Kids Edition,” an Emmy-nominated digital newscast geared toward informing and educating children.","summary":"Lester Holt, the anchor and managing editor of “NBC Nightly News” for a decade, announced Monday that he is stepping down from the long-running broadcast at the beginning of the summer.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lester-holt-anchor-nbc-nightly-news-rcna193445","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250224-lester-holt-studio-cs-f1ae07.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 16:04:25","author":"Daniel Arkin","authors":["Daniel Arkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.505},{"id":293856270,"title":"UTA Signs Republican National Committee Youth Advisory Council Co-Chair CJ Pearson (EXCLUSIVE)","text":"Is Hollywood becoming MAGA friendly?

The former Vice President had made a prediction about Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that creepily came true. What makes it even more impressive is that Harris predicted the outcome during the presidential debates.\n\nDonald Trump made formal calls to the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, respectively. The intention behind doing so was to make an effort to negotiate the end of the war between the two countries.\n\nThe US President claimed that the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky was a “dictator.” Matters took a turn for the worse when he accused Ukraine of starting the ongoing war.\n\n“You’ve been there for three years. You should have ended it. … You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,” he accused Zelenksy. The Ukrainian President immediately addressed Trump’s claims and demanded proof by asking for “more truth from the Trump team.”\n\nZelensky also shared that he would step down as the President if that would guarantee peace for his nation. On the other hand, Russia’s deputy foreign minister revealed that Putin and Trump might have a meeting lined up soon.\n\nWith Trump not bothering to hide what side he is on, a clip of Kamala Harris predicting this exact outcome has resurfaced on the internet. The clip is from the Presidential debate from 2024. In the clip, Harris predicted that Trump would develop a closeness with Putin and Russia.\n\n“Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish-Americans, right here in Pennsylvania, how quickly you would give up for the sake of favour and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,” Kamala is heard questioning the 78-year-old.\n\nI’m sick of smart women being right as Americans ignore them. https://t.co/xCld2gTOtP\n— Dr. Lori Lee Oates (she/they) 🫐 (@drlorileeoates) February 20, 2025\n\nNetizens didn’t miss the Democrat’s observation, given the USA’s developing relationship with Russia. “You can’t say she didn’t call it,” a user wrote along with the clip from the debate. Another added alongside the clip, “Word for word! Bar for bar!”\n\n“She saw it coming. Didn’t take long…” another person credited the Democrat. God I loved this part of the debate but hate the reality now,” a fourth added. “She said he’d get eaten for lunch by Putin. He got eaten for lunch by Putin,” another noted.\n\nOne user called Harris’ observation brilliant. They added, “Unfortunately, Trump knows that our country (with the greatest generation gone) thinks only about today. It was clear he was gonna sell out. I hope Europe calls his bluff.”\n\nAnother one recalled Kamala’s comment about Trump getting eaten “for lunch” by Putin. “He got eaten for lunch by Putin,” the user added.\n\nKamala Harris was right: “Those dictators are rooting for you because they know they can manipulate you with flattery and favors”\nTrump today: “President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, “COMMON SENSE.” We both believe very strongly in it.” pic.twitter.com/wiKxnLoHGQ\n— Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) February 12, 2025\n\nHarris had also claimed that Putin extending a hand of friendship towards Trump was a ruse to manipulate him. “Those dictators are rooting for you because they know they can manipulate you with flattery and favors,” the former Vice President had alleged during the debate.\n\nRecently, Trump’s former national security advisor noted the same. In an interview with CNN, John Bolton claimed that Putin had an upper hand in the negotiations before they even began. “President Trump has effectively surrendered to Putin before the negotiations have even begun,” he revealed.","summary":"Kamala Harris' creepily accurate prediction about Putin and Trump came true!","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/she-saw-it-coming-netizens-credit-kamala-harris-for-predicting-the-future-of-the-trump-putin-negotiation","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kamala-Harris-and-Putin-with-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 15:42:09","author":"Vaishnavi Shetye","authors":["Vaishnavi Shetye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":293854792,"title":"Former MSNBC star Keith Olbermann accuses network of racism for dropping Joy Reid","text":"One-time MSNBC primetime host Keith Olbermann said that his former network’s reported firing of Joy Reid and cancelation of Alex Wagner’s nightly show was “racist,” noting that only four women of color have solo-hosted programs for the liberal cable news network – and all of them have been kicked to the curb.\n\nOver the weekend, it was reported that Reid – who has been with MSNBC for over a decade – was not only losing her weeknight broadcast amid a programming shakeup but that she was also out at the network. The abrupt cancellation of Reid’s show has left staffers “shaken” and frustrated, especially as the program’s production staff is also being terminated, though they are encouraged to apply for new jobs at the network.\n\nThe Reidout will air its final episode this week. It will subsequently be replaced by a panel show hosted by former Kamala Harris spokesperson Symone Sanders Townsend, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele and anchor Alicia Menendez. The trio currently helms The Weekend, which airs on Saturday and Sunday mornings and has increased the network’s weekend AM viewership since debuting in early 2024.\n\nIn addition to the network dropping Reid, new MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler is also expected to remove Wagner from the primetime lineup. Wagner was pulled from her Tuesday-Friday 9 p.m. slot after the inauguration when MSNBC convinced its top star Rachel Maddow to host five nights a week during President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office, a move which has helped the channel reverse its post-election ratings slump.\n\nWhile Reid is reported to be leaving the network after her show wraps up this week, Wagner will stay with MSNBC as a correspondent. With Maddow moving back to just Monday nights in April, Kulter is looking to expand Jen Psaki’s role with the network. The former White House press secretary currently hosts on Sunday afternoons and Monday evenings but is now likely to replace Wagner in the coveted 9 p.m. slot.\n\nOlbermann, once MSNBC’s biggest star before his acrimonious departure in 2011, laid into his former employers for booting Reid and Wagner during an early Monday morning podcast, claiming the left-leaning channel was sidelining women of color for “salespeople” who will do as they’re told.\n\n“MSNBC fired Joy Reid, and yes it is racist and maybe worse. Yes, it is designed to keep out people who might think differently,” Olbermann declared. “And it is designed to reward professional political salespeople like ex-party chairmen and former press secretaries who will do what they are told by their bosses.”\n\nHe added: “But most of all, since they also fired Alex Wagner as they fired Joy Reid, at least The New York Times says this, it means that four women of color have solo hosted prominent shows on MSNBC, and all four of them have now been fired.”\n\nBesides Wagner and Reid, who coincidentally also had weekday programs canceled by the network in 2015, MSNBC has also axed weekend programs hosted by progressive Black female hosts Melissa Harris-Perry and Tiffany Cross. According to Olbermann, this is no coincidence.\n\nAccusing the triumvirate of hosts replacing Reid of engaging in “salesmanship as opposed to commentary or insight,” he also said the same of Psaki. “And if anybody on television – besides her counterparts who are all on Fox – if anybody is a salesperson as opposed to an analyst or a commentator, it’s Jen Psaki,” the outspoken ex-MSNBC anchor stated.\n\n“These people are salespersons,” he added. “Salespersons doctrinaire, and often it’s doctrinaire bullshit. If you have been a salesperson, a press secretary for a politician these days, you have – I’m sorry – lied.”\n\nSaying he’s had “lots of problems” with Wagner over the years, claiming she was “not interested in doing the harder parts of the job” of hosting, Olbermann still came to her defense regarding her credibility as a serious political analyst and commentator. “But Alex Wagner was not a salesperson for some politician or political point of view,” he noted.\n\nOlbermann then pointed out that Reid – along with Harris-Perry and Cross – repeatedly stoked controversy and enraged the conservative media machine, adding that MSNBC bowed to the outrage from the right over their commentary rather than stick by the hosts.\n\n“Hmm, Melissa Harris, Perry, Tiffany Cross, Joy Reid, Alex Wagner. Four women – what did they have in common?” Olbermann rhetorically asked. “Well, let’s see, they all had their own shows – solo hosts on MSNBC, and they were all women of color, and they’ve all been fired.”\n\nWhile acknowledging that the hosts replacing Reid are also people of color and that Kutler is apparently looking to bring on other Black hosts, Olbermann suggested that those picks are all “safe” and won’t rock the boat.\n\n“Don’t we want this? Won’t this make it easier to sell this company when we want to?” Olbermann snarked. “Won’t it make it easier the next time Trump threatens NBC and MSNBC for us to say, but we fired Joy Reid.”\n\nShortly after it was reported that Reid had been axed, Trump took to Truth Social to revel in her termination while also threatening the network’s parent company Comcast, calling its chairman Brian Roberts a lowlife while demanding the business pay “vast swaths of money for the damage they’ve done to” the United States.\n\n“We need a strong, vibrant, loud, fearless MSNBC and not The View – forgive me – at seven clock every night. We need people like Joy Reid,” Olbermann concluded. “Even if you sit there and go, I’m not watching that, it’s important that she’s there for the people who want to identify with somebody who looks like Joy Reid and say that woman is out here trying to argue my point. And is talking to me, and is bringing people who look like me and look like her onto television for the first time, and some of them are going to become superstars.”","summary":"‘MSNBC fired Joy Reid, and yes it is racist and maybe worse,’ Keith Olbermann said on Monday. ‘Yes, it is designed to keep out people who might think differently.’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joy-reid-fired-msnbc-reaction-racism-b2703644.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/03/03/16/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-03%20at%2011.36.56%20AM.png?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 15:13:43","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":293860556,"title":"WATCH: Network asks Cory Booker point blank if Dems’ favorite talking points are ‘effective’ after election loss","text":"NBC host Kristen Welker questioned Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker Sunday on whether his party’s increasingly popular talking point about America supposedly being in a “constitutional crisis” is a winning strategy.\n\nTowards the end of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign against President Donald Trump, she and fellow Democrats ramped up their rhetoric, claiming Trump was not only a “threat to democracy,” but also a “fascist,” comparing him to Adolf Hitler. On “Meet the Press,” Welker pressed Booker on the Democrats’ new talking point, playing a clip of multiple lawmakers repeating the phrase “constitutional crisis” before reminding him that similar rhetoric did not win them the November election. \n\n“Some of your colleagues have been saying that America is in a ‘constitutional crisis,’” Welker said. “Senator, as you know, Democrats just lost an election, largely with the closing argument accusing Trump of being a threat to the democracy. Is that the most effective messaging right now?”\n\n“I think the most effective messaging is talking about the crisis that’s happening to Americans,” Booker responded.\n\nWelker then intervened, stating that based on Booker’s response, the party “shouldn’t be talking about a constitutional crisis.” However, Booker pushed back, saying the “crisis” is occurring “now,” and calling out the Trump administration’s budget and personnel cuts across the federal government.\n\n“No — I’m saying we should be talking about what’s happening to Americans. I had one of the biggest hospital leaders in my state call me up and talk about the cancer research that’s now in crisis, literally ruining years of research, literally having to take cancer treatments away from people, cutting edge breakthrough treatments,” Booker said.\n\n“What’s crazy is crisis when you have planes falling from the sky and you’re cutting FAA folks. It is a crisis when nuclear regulatories who are keeping our safe regulators are being cut,” Booker continued.\n\nThe New Jersey lawmaker’s claims about the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cuts being linked to “planes falling from the sky,” echoed his fellow party member Democratic California Rep. Norma Torres who held Trump responsible for the fatal aircraft collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in January. In February the FAA fired less than 400 employees from its workforce of 45,000, according to Reuters, though Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has repeatedly confirmed that positions critical to aviation safety like air traffic controllers and inspectors have been protected.\n\nBooker went on to highlight claims from farmers complaining to him about the lack of federal funding, before focusing on the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) Elon Musk and his team.\n\n“Look, all this talk about USAID. I have visited people on the front line stopping infectious diseases from coming here. To have scientists in dangerous areas like Kampala suddenly not be able to get their access to their cell phone, their emails,” Booker said. “And be cut off by a president and Elon Musk or in a hand handed incompetent way, cutting funding that makes no sense and ultimately won’t make a difference on our deficit because the president wants to rack it up to give tax cuts to the wealthiest and create even bigger deficits in our country.”\n\nSince Musk’s announcement on an X space discussion about his and Trump’s agreement to overhaul the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Democrats have protested and pushed back against Musk’s involvement in cleaning out government waste.\n\nReports have revealed that some international programs not only aided left-wing social engineering, such as LGBT advocacy, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and tech censorship, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars. Regardless, Democrats have continued to question the cuts, with some lawmakers claiming the move of USAID to the leadership of Secretary of State Marco Rubio was unlawful.\n\nDemocrats’ messaging, however, has appeared to struggle since Trump’s historic election win, as he secured not only the Electoral College but also the popular vote and the swing states. With Harris losing once-key Democratic voting blocs, some party members have blamed the social justice policies that the left has been pushing, while others, like Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have blamed voters for not “understanding” what their party has done for them.\n\nEchoing Schumer’s sentiments from January, the Democratic National Committee’s new chairman, Ken Martin, told the New York Times on Feb. 2, after his win for the position, that the struggle he saw within the party was a “messaging” and “brand problem.”\n\n“The policies that we support and the message that we have is not wrong,” Martin told the outlet. “It is a messaging problem and a brand problem. Those voters are not connecting our policies with their lives.”\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Members of Congress have filed bills to ban the practice, but a budget expert suggests that taxing the practice instead might pose a smaller hurdle for getting it through Congress.\n\nWhile most bills face a 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster and get through the Senate, senators could pass such a tax through a process known as budget reconciliation—a process by which bills only require a majority of senators’ votes to pass.\n\nRep. Ben Cline, R-Va., a member of the House Budget Committee, told The Daily Signal he supports the idea of taxing official time.\n\n“Taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill for federal employees to conduct union business instead of fulfilling their official duties,” Cline said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “Taxing or ending ‘official time’ altogether are commonsense options to ensure taxpayer dollars are used responsibly while increasing accountability in the federal workforce.”\n\n“It’s important that public funds serve the American people, not private union interests,” he added.\n\nSenators Weigh In\n\nSenate Republicans also condemned official time.\n\n“Federal employees should not engage in union activities on the taxpayer’s dime, which is why I’ve introduced legislation to ban the practice,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, told The Daily Signal. He was referring to the No Union Time on the Taxpayers’ Dime Act, a bill he filed in July. The bill never made it out of committee.\n\n“So-called ‘official time’ has been abused as essentially publicly funded political organizing by government employees on federal property, which would be illegal in any other context,” Lee added. “We should get rid of it. Public servants should serve the public while on the clock.”\n\n“Bureaucrats seems to have forgotten that they serve the American people, not themselves,” Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told The Daily Signal. “If federal employees want to engage in union activity while on the clock instead of doing their job, they need to reimburse taxpayers for every last cent.”\n\n“My Protecting Taxpayers’ Wallet Act ends the absurd practice of taxpayer-funded union time and eliminates tax dollars for public unions,” she added. Ernst was referring to legislation banning official time that she filed earlier this month.\n\nErnst has exposed bureaucrats claiming to be on taxpayer-funded union time while sitting in jail or after moving to Florida. As chair of the Senate DOGE Caucus, which aims to help the Department of Government Efficiency combat fraud, waste, and abuse, Ernst moved to outlaw official time as part of her effort to get the federal workforce back to work.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, suggested he would be open to passing a tax on official time through the budget reconciliation process.\n\n“I think that’s an interesting idea,” he told The Daily Signal in an interview on Thursday. “There’s no doubt we are going to need to consider a number of ideas that are fundamentally transformational. If you look at the election in November, this was a mandate. … We have an historic opportunity right now; we can’t miss the moment.”\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., agreed that Congress should get rid of official time.\n\n“We shouldn’t be paying for somebody to do something besides their job as a federal worker. That’s the No. 1 thing,” Scott told The Daily Signal in an interview on Thursday. “The American taxpayer is not interested in paying for somebody to do a job that’s not part of their job, to provide a service or provide a product, or something like that.”\n\nHe did not specifically address taxing official time in budget reconciliation, but he insisted that the government should not “allow people to get paid to work on doing something that’s not their job as a federal employee.”\n\n“That needs to be changed,” Scott added.\n\nWhy Budget Reconciliation?\n\nWhile Lee’s and Ernst’s bills take aim at official time, they may fall short of the mark when it comes to getting through the legislative process, experts note.\n\n“Though this practice of abusing official time should be banned outright, Democrats are unlikely to join with Republicans to give them the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that’s required to do so,” Richard Stern, director of The Heritage Foundation’s Grover Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, told The Daily Signal. “Banning the practice would also not fit with the tight requirements of what could be done in a reconciliation bill—which only requires 51 votes in the Senate.”\n\n“However, imposing taxes on the practice would fit the parameters of reconciliation,” Stern noted. “Using tax policy in this manner would allow a conservative majority in Congress to pass a policy that would work towards ending this terrible abuse of the taxpayer’s dollar.”\n\nTo drive the point home, Stern noted, “Your tax dollars quite literally go to pay for the salaries of people while they are doing work for unions that is often at odds with what is in the best interest of the country.”\n\nSean Higgins, a deregulation and labor union analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, agreed.\n\nHe told The Daily Signal he would prefer to ban official time outright, but “if reconciliation is a means to do this, it’s an interesting approach and a worthy try.”\n\nBiden Hides the Ball\n\nHiggins noted that the Office of Personnel Management previously published the amounts the federal government spent on official time in a regular report titled “Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Usage in the Federal Government.” The Biden administration not only stopped publishing the reports but removed the web page hosting previous reports.\n\n“They got rid of it because it was embarrassing,” Higgins said. “The unions just don’t want us to know that this happens. I’m sure the broader public doesn’t know it exists or would be surprised to find out about this phenomenon.”\n\nErnst and Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, wrote to Charles Ezell, acting director of the Office of Personnel Management in the new Trump administration, to restart the annual reports, and an OPM spokesperson told The Daily Signal the office will again release this information under Trump.\n\n“OPM is committed to transparency and accountability,” the spokesperson told The Daily Signal in an emailed statement Thursday. “We are in the process of compiling this data and will begin releasing this information again. Unfortunately, the previous administration halted its publication, shielding unions from taxpayer scrutiny. We are working to restore this critical transparency for the American people.”\n\nThe Deep State Effort Against Trump\n\nHiggins, the Competitive Enterprise Institute scholar, noted that official time is “literally just people being paid by the government not to work for the government but to work for entities that seek to increase costs for the taxpayer.”\n\nOnly 5.9% of private sector workers were union members last year, while 32% of public sector workers had joined unions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The aggregate number of employees belonging to unions in the public sector (7 million) was roughly the same as those in the private sector (7.2 million).\n\nHiggins contrasted “the days when a union worker was someone who worked in a factory and was trying to get a few extra hours or a safety regulation” with today. “Now, the typical worker is someone who works for the government, and the union makes it impossible for them to get fired by the government.”\n\nHe further noted that “any person who works for any organization tends to get territorial and parochial” and will likely “resent anybody from the outside telling them what to do.” Bureaucrats have often seen their work as apolitical and have stayed in the administrative state from one administration to another.\n\nTrump is not carrying out business as usual, however. Higgins described Trump’s reforms as “the first time somebody has tried to seriously throw a wrench in the system and rework it from the ground up.”\n\nNow, public sector unions like the American Federation of Government Employees, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, are filing lawsuits to block Trump’s reforms.\n\n“They’re just trying to protect their members as they see fit,” Higgins noted. “They’re for the status quo ante, and the administration is not.”\n\nA recent poll found that 64% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees who voted for Kamala Harris in November say they will refuse a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy. Trump aims to prevent this deep state from growing.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment about whether federal employees have claimed official time in work related to the lawsuits they have filed against the Trump administration.","summary":"And how Congress can fight it in reconciliation","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/the-sneaky-way-government-unions-rake-in-taxpayer-money/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/bags-of-money.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 14:42:26","author":"The Daily Signal","authors":["The Daily Signal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.216}]}
