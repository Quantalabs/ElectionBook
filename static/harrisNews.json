The duo are said to offer up changes on everything from film tax credits to tax codes and job training – all to possibly keep film production opportunities in America.\n\n“It’s important that we compete with what’s going on around the world so there needs to be some sort of federal tax incentives,\" Paul said.\n\nDespite the enthusiasm, the backlash was apparent on X as many mocked the idea.\n\n\"Just another has-been trying to hold on for dear life,\" one person joked, as another added: \" Wouldn’t put too much stock in this.\"A third user asked: \"John who?\" and one raged, \"So we’re only gonna get crap movies with Vince Vaughn, Ted Nugent, and Kevin Sorbo in them from now on?\" referring to other stars who have been open about their love for Trump.\n\nEarlier this year, on the heels of his election victory over Kamala Harris, the controversial politician took to Truth Social to highlight a few of his loyal supporters in Hollywood.\n\n\"It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,\" he wrote at the time.The 78-year-old continued: \"They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK – BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!\"\n\n\"These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest. It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!\" he added.\n\nVoight, Stallone, and Gibson have been on the Trump train for quite some time, with Angelina Jolie's father even landing a position on Trump's board of trustees for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in March 2019.The Rocky actor also labeled Trump \"the second George Washington\" during a speech at Mar-A-Lago following the November election, while Gibson bashed Harris' intelligence. \n\nThe actors will try their best to combat the liberal side of Hollywood who are against the president, including Richard Gere.\n\nThe Pretty Woman star has not held back when it comes to criticizing Trump, even accusing him of being a \"thug.\"While accepting an International Goya Award award, Gere said: \"We're in a very dark place in America, where we have a bully, a thug, who's the president of the United States. \n\n\"But it's not just in the U.S., it's everywhere.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's victory, Gere and his wife, Alejandra Silva, packed up and left America.Rumors then quickly spread Trump was the reason Gere and Silva left the country for Spain, but it doesn't seem like it's their forever residence.\n\n\"We'll come back here in the summer because we have the kids at camp. We just have to balance our lives there and here,\" Silva said.\n\n\"I'm with my family... You know, I missed them a lot. But I miss the US.

Trump awarded him the National Medal of Arts during his first term. \n\nAfter The LA Times reported Tuesday that they're still 'waiting for a call' from the three screen legends, Bloomberg discovered that Voight and manager Steven Paul are set to present their master plan to Trump as soon as next week.\n\nWhat they're working on goes beyond telling studios to cut down on 'woke' content and more offering packages of tax breaks to film things in Hollywood again.\n\n'It's important that we compete with what's going on around the world so there needs to be some sort of federal tax incentives,' Paul said. \n\nThey want to incentivize improvements made all over Hollywood, including improvements to existing infrastructure and job training as well. \n\nPaul has noticed that states have begun to compete with one another to get things filmed in their territory so they may ask for a national program to keep production in America.\n\n'It's been very, very difficult here. We're feeling the cries of people in town,' Paul added. \n\nA specific idea they may pitch to Trump, who has made several cameos in Hollywood films prior to his time in politics, is to adjust a part of the US tax code to allow faster deductions for Hollywood studios beyond the current $15million limit. \n\nVoight and Paul have met with studio executives, unions and state officials to add to their ides, SP Media Group President Scott Karol said. \n\nThey're also likely to ask Trump to reward studios that build new infrastructure for filming with tax breaks.\n\nThe group has pointed to New Jersey, which gave a 40 percent rebate to Netflix to build a massive sound stage in the Garden State.\n\nPaul is taking the effort seriously on his own part, moving productions of three upcoming films from overseas back to Los Angeles. \n\nTrump announced in January the movie legends will serve as 'Special Ambassadors' to Hollywood, an apparently new post for outreach. \n\n'It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,' he wrote on Truth Social. \n\n'They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE! \n\n'These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest. It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!'\n\nAll have been seen in Trump's orbit recently. Stallone introduced Trump at Mar-a-Lago for his first speech after winning the election in November.\n\nGibson revealed his support for Trump in a video days before the election – while also going negative and unloading on VP Kamala Harris. \n\n'I know what it'll be like if we let her in. And that ain't good. Miserable track record. No policies to speak of. She's got the IQ of a fence post,' Gibson said. \n\nThe 'Road Warrior' and 'The Passion of the Christ' star said he was 'ashamed' of his comments after he was caught on tape giving an antisemitic rant in 2006 during a DUI arrest following a traffic stop.\n\nAll three provided vital Hollywood support to Trump during an election campaign where Harris was mopping up celebrity endorsements and campaign contributions.\n\nAlthough he called Hollywood a 'troubled place,' Trump's statement did not directly refer to the fires ravaging parts of Los Angeles and forcing mass evacuations.\n\nIn addition to the human toll and massive property loss, the destruction has drawn cost estimates as high as $250 million, and even the Oscars are in doubt this season. \n\nThe L.A. film industry has been losing job share to other parts of the U.S., amid competing film incentive programs and high living costs there. \n\nThe industry has also contended with the COVID pandemic, strikes, and foreign competition.\n\nProduction in the Greater L.A. area dropped 5 percent in the third quarter of last year in a 'lackluster' performance, according to Film L.A. \n\nThe box office take last year dropped to $8.7 billion, down 3 percent from the year before, Variety reported.","summary":"Hollywood royalty Jon Voight has already gotten to work on bringing MAGA to to liberal Los Angeles in his role as a 'special ambassador' to Tinseltown for Donald Trump .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14645655/jon-voight-plan-trump-hollywood-maga-special-ambassador.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/24/22/97665849-0-image-a-4_1745531101914.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 23:10:32","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Michelle — a three-time Vogue cover model and darling of the fashion world who could have any designer clothing on demand — claimed she just couldn’t find the right outfit.\n\n“It started with not having anything to wear,” Michelle said. “I was like, if I’m not going to do this thing, I got to tell my team, I don’t even want to have a dress ready, right? Because it’s so easy to just say let me do the right thing.”\n\nThe takeaway? She knew it wasn’t the decent thing to do, but like some third-rate self-help author living her truth, she was doing her.\n\n“I’m here really trying to own my life and intentionally practice making the choice that was right for me … And it took everything in my power to not do the thing that was right,” she said before catching herself and continuing: “That was perceived as right.”\n\nMichelle is practicing the art of saying no — which is fine if you’re turning down brunch with your least favorite cousin or a neighbor’s invitation to check out their latest multi-level marketing scheme.\n\nLook, I’m sure Michelle Obama is refusing more invitations in a month than the rest of us will get in a lifetime.\n\nBut events that call on her to step back into her first lady pumps and show the nation that, sometimes, you have to rise above partisan divisions — those aren’t necessarily about enjoyment or filling your spirit.\n\nThey are about duty, a word that means less and less in our me-first culture. \n\nIt was lame when the Trumps didn’t attend Joe Biden’s Inauguration, and it was equally lame that Michelle, our former first lady, skipped out on Donald’s.\n\nMissing Carter’s funeral was particularly disrespectful, considering the 39th president devoted his post-political life to service.\n\nWhile living in the White House, Michelle was effective on many fronts. She was a great champion of American fashion designers. She led a worthy initiative pushing kids to not be lazy layabouts. Perhaps most endearing was her embrace of the multi-generational household, by having her mother, Marian Robinson, live with them and help raise her and Barack’s daughters.\n\nThe Obamas left 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as cultural rockstars with money trees seeded by Netflix and Penguin Random House and speaking engagement deals. Her husband remained at the wheel of the Dem party (at least until the chaotic backing of Kamala Harris’ failed presidential bid).\n\nThey were held up as the golden couple. Yet Michelle apparently can’t grasp the public interest in her personal life.\n\n“My decision to skip the inauguration … my decision to make choices at the beginning of this year that suited me, were met with such ridicule and criticism,” she said on her podcast this week. “People couldn’t believe that I was saying no for any other reason, that they had to assume that my marriage was falling apart, you know?”\n\nWell, perhaps people reached that conclusion because the Obamas seem to be living separate lives — and every time Michelle publicly speaks about her husband, she sounds underwhelmed and resentful.\n\nShe’s regularly nitpicking things about him: his inability to be on time, or how she didn’t want him to run for president. How she had to stop him from playing basketball at the White House after he was injured: “You know, you’re playing like you’re 10 and now your lip is split,” she revealed on the podcast.\n\nHonestly, she seems downright bitter about having obligations attached to his political career.\n\nBut that office is why she has her platform, her books and her podcast — which has all the excitement and entertainment of a sleep lab. And it’s why she has the public adoration; don’t forget, a Reuters poll last July found that Michelle, despite never expressing an interest in public office, was the only Democrat who had a chance of beating Trump at the ballot box.\n\nBut the more she speaks, the more she tarnishes her own legacy (and fuels that marriage gossip).\n\nIn this age of oversharing, it’s much cooler to keep some mystique.","summary":"The former first lady played hooky from Donald Trump's inauguration because she's taking some me time, baby!","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/24/opinion/michelle-obama-is-tarnishing-her-legacy-by-oversharing/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/michelle-obama_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/2AFVEp8w-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-24 22:55:57","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":314533960,"title":"Pete Buttigieg Lays Out Three Things Democrats Need to Do","text":"Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says the Democratic Party needs to figure out what their message is after the 2024 presidential election loss, how to say the message, and where to say it.Newsweek reached out to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via online form for comment.Why It MattersDemocrats have seemingly been in disarray since losing the White House, Senate and Congress after the election. Uproar over certain policies and uncertainty about which figureheads to get behind within the party have frayed internal cohesion.It is unclear who the party will get behind as polling shows former Vice President Kamala Harris leading the pack of potential presidential 2028 candidates, followed by New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Buttigieg.What To KnowWhile speaking with host Andrew Schultz and others on the FLAGRANT podcast in a video that aired on Wednesday, Buttigieg spoke about the state of the Democratic Party and what could be done better.\"I do think my party needs to do a much better job, especially with the kind of finger-wagging that you're talking about; I think we are like very prone to that,\" Buttigieg said, adding that he has seen it on both sides of the aisle.Buttigieg then spoke about the message Democrats should focus on in this period following the election loss. \"Part of it is like where do we go,\" he said. \"To me, especially after we lose...our party or any party has this debate of like 'what do we have to say and how do we say it?' To me, there is actually three things we need to deal with.\"\"What do we have to say? I mean, like, the policies, the ideas,\" Buttigieg outlined. \"If they're right we should hold to it, if were not so sure they're right we should rethink them.\"\"Then there's how do we say it. That's the tone, the message, the style, whether people think you're wagging a finger at them or not. Whether people think you get the kind of pain they're going through or not,\" He added.Rounding out the list, the former Biden official said, \"And then the part nobody talks about is where we say it. And I think right now where we say it is kind of everything.\"\"It's really important for anyone practicing politics, and definitely my party after what just happened to it, to be saying ok, where else do we need to be,\" Buttigieg noted.During the campaign cycle, Trump was praised for going on Joe Rogan's show, while Harris did a segment with Alex Cooper on her podcast Call Her Daddy. Rogan then endorsed Trump right before the election, leading many to believe he helped the president secure the younger male vote.What People Are SayingFormer Harris advisor and Democratic strategist Mike Nellis on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday: \"Anybody mad about Pete Buttigieg going on Andrew Schulz's podcast is not serious about winning elections.

The judge has also spoken at events in support of former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama and held leadership roles on committees to elect Obama and John Kerry. Judge William Orrick of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a ruling on Thursday that said President Donald Trump’s executive orders against sanctuary cities are unconstitutional. Orrick said that Trump’s orders instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities and counties that do not cooperate with federal immigration law would violate the Constitution’s separation of powers principles and the Spending Clause, as well as the Fifth and 10th Amendments. PRESIDENT TRUMP BLASTS COURTS FOR GETTING IN THE WAY OF DEPORTATION AGENDA The judge said Trump's orders — titled \"Protecting the American People Against Invasion\" and \"Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders\" — are \"unconstitutionally vague and violate due process\" and \"impose coercive condition intended to commandeer local officials into enforcing federal immigration practices and law.\" Orrick wrote that \"the threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the Cities and Counties and the communities they serve.\" According to donation records stored in the Federal Election Commission database, Orrick, who was nominated by Obama in 2012, has donated $113,600 to Democratic candidates and committees throughout the years. Democrats that Orrick has donated to include Obama, Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Diane Feinstein. MEXICAN POLICE BRING IN MAJOR CARTEL BOSS IN ICE-ASSISTED RAID: 'MAJOR MILESTONE' Orrick made two donations to the Obama Victory Fund of $2,300 and $28,500 in 2008. He has also contributed a total of $53,500 to the Democratic National Committee and made a $3,000 donation to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and a $2,000 donation to the Iowa Democratic Party. Besides his financial contributions, a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire further reveals that Orrick served as co-chair of the Bay Area Lawyers to Elect John Kerry 2003-2004 as well as the Bay Area Lawyers to Elect Barack Obama 2006-2008.

But now he’s escalating his war on polls and the press, suggesting that even right-wing media outlets should scrap their polling arms if the results don’t flatter him.\n\nAccording to a Fox News poll released Wednesday, Trump’s approval rating is officially lower than it was during his first term, just as he approaches the 100-day mark of his second term.\n\nThe survey found his rating underwater at 44% approval and 55% disapproval—down five points from the previous month. Even worse, Trump’s 100-day rating lags behind Joe Biden’s (54%), Barack Obama’s (62%), and George W. Bush’s (63%) at the same point in their presidencies.\n\nEven Republicans aren’t exactly brimming with optimism. Just 38% of voters overall—and 75% of Republicans—say they’re “encouraged” about the next four years. That’s a drop from his first term in 2017, which showed 45% and 84%, respectively.\n\nThe same poll gave Trump poor marks across the board—on the economy, foreign policy, guns, immigration, you name it. His economic approval in particular sank to a record low at 38%, with 55% of respondents saying conditions are getting worse for their families.\n\nSo how did Trump respond to this news? By calling for Fox News to kill its polling unit.\n\n“Rupert Murdoch has told me for years that he is going to get rid of his FoxNews, Trump Hating, Fake Pollster, but he has never done so. This ‘pollster’ has gotten me, and MAGA, wrong for years. Also, and while he’s at it, he should start making changes at the China Loving Wall Street Journal. It sucks!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday.\n\nOf course, this isn’t some isolated poll. An April Ipsos survey for Reuters put Trump’s approval at just 42%, with only 37% backing his handling of the economy. A new Pew Research Center poll had him even lower, at 40%, with negative ratings across every major policy area. And a YouGov poll for The Economist wasn’t any better, with Trump clocking in at 41% approval, with every issue underwater there, too. \n\nIn other words: reality bites. But rather than face it, Trump’s trying to pressure outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal into becoming full-time propaganda machines. \n\nHis push to kill off Fox’s polling arm is especially alarming given that it routinely produces some of the highest-quality polling in the business. If Fox caves, it would be a scandal—but not entirely shocking. Media executives have buckled to Trump before, afraid of the blowback if they don’t stay in his good graces. \n\nTrump’s already suing CBS News’ “60 Minutes” for $10 billion, and he’s gone after ABC News, which recently settled a defamation suit and agreed to pay $15 million to Trump’s future presidential library. The Washington Post has also drifted rightward under Trump, winning plaudits from the administration for its “balance.”\n\nAnd while polling isn’t perfect, Trump has a habit of going after those who publish anything he doesn’t like. \n\nIn December, he sued The Des Moines Register and veteran pollster Ann Selzer for a pre-election poll showing Vice President Kamala Harris leading him in Iowa. Trump ended up winning the state by more than 13 points, and now he’s trying to make it a courtroom issue.\n\nTrump’s latest tantrum makes his vision clear: Any outlet that doesn’t treat him like a demigod should be silenced, sued, or shut down. What he’s building isn’t just a cult of personality; it’s a MAGA-approved echo chamber where the “truth” is whatever he says it is.","summary":"President Donald Trump has never liked when pollsters say he’s doing worse than he thinks he is.

The network is hosting a Saturday pre-party with Politico, one of a flurry of fêtes and boozy brunches sponsored by news outlets and talent agencies that will take place at Washington hotels and hot spots, ambassadors’ residences, and backyard gardens. But alongside this year’s celebration of the First Amendment are reminders of just how much press freedom is being challenged in a second Trump term, involving everything from White House access restrictions to free speech threats.\n“We’re in for a wild ride in terms of the games they’re going to play,” one political reporter told me, referring to the administration. The “guardrails are gone” in this second term, the reporter added, and as a result, “the solidarity of the press corps is going to be really tested.”\nTrump is skipping Saturday’s dinner at the Washington Hilton, just as he did during his first term. The WHCA weathered such snubs in the past, but this time around, the organization is grappling with an administration that’s already taken away one of the journalist-led group’s primary functions and could nab a second. In February, the White House indicated that it would move to handpick the media outlets participating in the daily press pool, a group of journalists who cover the president’s words and actions in smaller settings for the news media, including when the president travels out of Washington. Jacqui Heinrich, Fox News reporter and a member of the WHCA board, told Vanity Fair that she was specifically concerned about the administration taking control of the press pool, saying, “I’m not sure the administration was thinking about the long run when they made [the decision].\n“You don’t want access to the leader of the free world to be dependent on favorable coverage,” Heinrich added. “That’s the whole reason why the WHCA self-organized, beginning back in the early 1900s. It’s just not what America stands for.”\nA major source of tension is a continued court battle playing out between the Associated Press and the White House, which banned the outlet from the press pool in February after the AP’s refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America in its coverage. The AP sued the administration in response, arguing that the ban raised questions about press freedom. On April 8, a federal judge ruled in favor of the newswire, finding the ban in violation of the First Amendment and ordering the White House to reinstate access.\nJust days later, the White House said that it was eliminating the rotating press pool spot for three major newswires, which includes the AP along with Reuters and Bloomberg News. The AP filed a motion asking the court to enforce the injunction requiring the administration to allow the AP back into the pool rotation, which was denied by a federal judge in Washington. Judge Trevor N. McFadden categorized the new policy as “facially neutral,” adding that he would need time to determine whether it resulted in “viewpoint discrimination.” This past Saturday, the AP had finally made its way back into the official press pool; however, Trump had no public events on his schedule.\nCNN’s Kaitlan Collins called the White House’s fight with the AP “obviously retaliatory in nature,” and a “slippery slope” for the administration to start heading down. The network’s chief White House correspondent, who previously served as the WHCA president, is all for expanding the press pool, “but when you start taking people away, or removing people or banning them, that is where it’s dangerous territory. That’s kind of the moment we’re at now,” she tells me.\nMeanwhile, in the White House briefing room, “officials have made room for a new cohort of more partisan attendees, like right-wing podcasters, who often ask less-adversarial questions than traditional journalists,” as The New York Times recently put it. (Still, as Paul Farhi points out, it’s the more mainstream news outlets who are churning out the biggest Trump 2.0 scoops.) The White House is reportedly considering shaking up the seating arrangements in the briefing room, which had also long been handled by the WHCA.\nAnd on the legal front, both ABC News and Meta settled lawsuits with Trump after his victory in November, what some legal experts see as a “dangerous” precedent for media and tech companies. Then there’s Trump’s $10 billion suit against CBS; he’s accused the network of “illegal behavior” over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. CNN’s Jake Tapper reported that one 60 Minutes source described the suit to him as “baseless” and that Owens “fought for the broadcast and for independent journalism, and that cost him his job.” (A CBS News spokesperson declined to comment.)\nWHCA president Eugene Daniels described this as a “consequential moment for journalism” in a statement, citing the need to focus not on the “politics of division,” but on celebrating the work of WHCA colleagues and political media at large. Heinrich echoed this statement and the continued value of the dinner in our recent interview, telling me that the event is a “celebration of the work that we do, the scholarships that we’re awarding, and the importance of journalism,” which is “something that you celebrate, no matter if the president is attending or not.”\nAs for the dinner itself, it will be a more stoic affair than in years past, which have featured headlining entertainment, most recently SNL’s Colin Jost in 2024. Comedian Amber Ruffin was scheduled to take the Hilton stage, but the WHCA scrapped her appearance in late March, nearly two months after it was announced. One New York–based communications operative I spoke to, who would typically make the Amtrak pilgrimage from Manhattan to DC for the party circuit, said they weren’t sure if it was even worth a trip this year since the mood might be “depressing.” They worry that the typical “weekend events of drinking and partying will normalize a moment that shouldn’t be normalized.” In the end, however, they caved.","summary":"Even in these precarious times, journalists are set to don tuxes and gowns at the Washington Hilton—sans Trump—and swarm sundry parties and brunches.

The 22nd Amendment Explained","text":"Donald Trump is now serving as the 47th President of the United States. After reclaiming the White House with a 2024 election win, following his first term that began in 2016, he became only the second president in U.S. history to serve nonconsecutive terms. Under the Constitution, this second term is expected to be his last.\n\nBut the 78-year-old hasn’t ruled out the idea of a third. In a March 30 interview with NBC News, Trump said, “A lot of people want me to do it.” When asked directly if he’d consider running again, he responded, “I like working. I’m not joking.”\n\nJust weeks later, on April 24, his team began selling “Trump 2028” hats—$50 red caps boldly embroidered with the year—on the Trump Store website, encouraging supporters to “make a statement.”\n\nFind out below if it’s possible for Trump to run again in 2028.\n\nCan Trump Serve a 3rd Term?\n\nEarlier, in January 2025, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow President Trump to serve a third term. Ogles’ proposed amendment states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”\n\nThe 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution limits a president to two terms in office, including non-consecutive terms. As a result, the next four years should be the final time Trump can hold the nation’s highest office.\n\nAccording to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, George Washington, the first U.S. president, set the precedent by stepping down after two terms. This unofficial limit was observed by every president after Washington, until Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms from 1932 to 1944.\n\nIn response to Roosevelt’s unprecedented tenure, a proposal to limit presidents to two terms was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1947, two years after his death. After revisions by the Senate, the amendment was approved and ratified by the states on February 27, 1951.\n\nIn March 2025, when asked if he had been presented with plans to seek a third term, Trump said, “There are methods which you could do it.” One method mentioned was for Vice President JD Vance to run for office and then pass the role to Trump.\n\nIs Trump Planning for a Third Term or More?\n\nBefore Election Day, Trump stated he wouldn’t run again in 2028 if he lost in the 2024 race. In an interview with Sinclair Media Group, he was asked if he could envision another run if he lost to former Vice President Kamala Harris. “No, I don’t. I think… that will be it,” Trump said. “I don’t see that at all.” He added, “But hopefully, we’re going to be very successful.”\n\nSince then, Trump has made several remarks about term limits and his time in office since being elected for a second term. It was unclear whether he was speaking seriously, but in March 2025, he clarified that he was not joking. When asked if he wanted another term during a phone interview with NBC, Trump responded, “I like working. I’m not joking.”\n\nIn July 2024, he told attendees at a conservative Christian event that they wouldn’t “have to vote anymore” if he was elected to office in 2024. “Christians, get out and vote. Just this time,” he said during a speech at the Believers’ Summit, an event hosted by the conservative advocacy group Turning Point Action. “You won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It’ll be fixed. It’ll be fine. You won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.”","summary":"Here’s a look at whether President Donald Trump can run for a third term after his second in the White House.","url":"https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/can-trump-serve-a-3rd-term-22nd-amendment-5364793/","image":"https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2194420718-e1737735292136.jpg?fit=3000%2C1745","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 20:13:00","author":"Vivian","authors":["Vivian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":314505396,"title":"Trump’s aggressive actions against free speech speak a lot louder than his words defending it","text":"Harvard University took the extraordinary step of suing the Trump administration on April 21, 2025, claiming that the pressure campaign mounted on the school by the president and his Cabinet to force viewpoint diversity on campus violated the Constitution’s guarantees of free speech.\n\n“Defendants’ actions are unlawful,” Harvard’s lawsuit states. “The First Amendment does not permit the Government to ‘interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance.’” \n\nYet in his first term, President Donald J. Trump declared that free speech mattered.\n\nTrump issued the “Executive Order Restoring Free Speech and Ending Federal Censorship” on March 21, 2019. In it, he expressed the importance of free inquiry and open debate to education and directed federal officials to use the federal government’s funding of higher education to ensure that universities promote free inquiry. \n\nChanneling free-speech champions Benjamin Franklin and James Madison, Trump wrote that “free inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation’s democracy.” \n\nAs a professor of constitutional, criminal and comparative law, and as a citizen who enjoys his liberty, I agree. \n\nFree speech is fundamental to human progress. Scientific, medical, technological and social advancements all rely on the free flow of information. Robust discussion and disagreement are equally important to maintaining a healthy constitutional republic. \n\nIn the words of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.” \n\nThe First Amendment’s free speech and press clauses protect all forms of expression – oral, print, digital and artistic – from governmental interference or punishment. \n\nOf the many types of speech, political speech is the most protected. \n\nOn the first day of his second term in office, Trump issued another free speech executive order. It affirms the administration’s commitment to free speech, directs that tax money is not used to abridge free speech and instructs federal employees to “identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.”\n\nIn a vacuum, Trump’s orders appear to bode well for free speech. \n\nBut what is important is free speech reality, not rhetoric. Three months into his second term, where does Trump stand?\n\nThe many interconnected orders, letters, statements and actions of Trump’s White House make an assessment of any positive effects difficult. On the other hand, the Trump administration has clearly violated and chilled free speech on many occasions.\n\nRepression and retaliation\n\nAttempts to silence the president’s adversaries are developing as a pattern. \n\nLaw firms and attorneys who have sued or prosecuted Trump, or represented his adversaries, have been targeted for retribution and concessions. It began with an executive order on March 6, 2025, directed at the U.S.-based global law firm Perkins Coie, which had once represented Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton. A second order was issued on March 14, 2025, against Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison because it once employed an attorney who investigated Trump. Subsequently, at least six other prominent law firms were also targeted. \n\nSeveral law firms acceded to the president’s demands, agreeing to accept clients without regard to political beliefs, to eliminate DEI practices, and to perform pro bono work valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars for causes Trump supports. \n\nThe firms that didn’t accede to the president’s demands had their security clearances removed, access to federal buildings restricted, and were banned from working for federal agencies. A few of the firms that didn’t relent have won temporary injunctions barring the administration’s actions against them. \n\nThe nonpartisan free speech advocacy organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression decried the orders as threatening the foundations of justice and free speech. In one of several challenges to these orders, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote on March 12, 2025, that Trump’s order appeared motivated by “retaliatory animus” and concluded that it “runs head on into the wall of First Amendment protections.” Two other federal courts reached similar conclusions.\n\nIn the first three months of his second term, Trump withdrew Secret Service protection of several prominent critics who are former federal government officials, including John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his top aide, Brian Hook, and former high-level health official Anthony Fauci also lost their security protection. \n\nIt is hard to imagine that these decisions won’t have a profoundly chilling effect on potential critics of the president, especially since the revocations were publicly announced and each individual has been the subject of credible threats resulting from their governmental service. \n\nTargeting the press\n\nA similar pattern exists for journalists, where Trump is using his power to punish organizations whose reporting he doesn’t like.\n\nAP journalists were banned from the White House and Air Force One on Feb. 11, 2025, for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the new name Trump had ordered for the body of water. On April 9, 2025, this ban was found to violate the First Amendment by a judge nominated by Trump during his first term. \n\nDenouncing CNN and MSNBC as “illegal” and claiming they are paid political operatives, Trump suggested they should be investigated during a speech at the U.S. Department of Justice. \n\nTrump effectively closed Voice of America, after 83 years of continuous broadcasting, for being “anti-Trump” and radical in its views. By charter, the broadcaster represents “America, not any single segment of American society,” with “accurate, objective, and comprehensive” news and “a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions” through television, radio, internet, social media and satellite broadcasts to peoples around the world.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission has initiated regulatory actions against the licenses of several television stations for broadcasts that have been accused by the President of being anti-Trump or biased in favor of Kamala Harris. Early in the process, the outcomes of these actions are to be determined. \n\nPressuring universities and students\n\nOther administration actions, I believe, raise serious free speech issues. \n\nHarvard isn’t the only university feeling pressure. \n\nThe administration is threatening to withhold federal money from universities as a way to coerce many of them to comply with administration policies in ways that implicate free speech and in some instances violate legal processes for the withholding of federal support. \n\nSome of the Trump administration’s recent immigration enforcement efforts have targeted international students who are in the U.S. lawfully but who participated in Palestinian rights protests and disagreed with Israel’s actions during the war in Gaza. \n\nThe administration claims that some students whose visas have been revoked were either Hamas supporters or violated criminal laws. The administration has also said that many students are being deported under broad authority the secretary of state has to deport those deemed a danger to national security. \n\nDemocracy and free speech\n\nIn the past decade, the U.S. has fallen in press freedom, rule of law and democratic governance, resulting in the classification of a “flawed democracy” by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a democratic watchdog. Unsurprisingly, there has been a simultaneous rise in public support for authoritarianism. These changes make support for free speech increasingly important. \n\nOn March 4, 2025, Trump declared in a speech before a joint session of Congress that he “stopped all government censorship and brought free speech back to America.” \n\nThe record doesn’t support this claim.","summary":"President Donald Trump has said that free speech matters to him.

Because of this idea that our social safety net — so social security, Medicare, Medicaid — rely on the younger population keeping up with the older population so they can pay into it.'\nShe said her 'caveat' was that all people welcoming a baby - such as adoptive parents and gay couples - should get the bonus and not just birth mothers. \nA fuming Goldberg hit back: '$5,000 sounds like a lot of money, but if you can't pay your rent, if you can’t pay for your after school programs for your kids...'\n\nTrump's administration's fledgling plan is to give a $5,000 sum to every American mother after they give birth\n\nDueling on Wednesday's episode, Goldberg declared: 'C learly, they don't know how women's bodies work, and they don't know what it costs to raise a child or just have a child' - to cheers from the crowd\n\nGriffin - who memorably turned on her former employer - then left the audience aghast as she said: ' I actually generally support this policy, that may surprise you guys\n\nSara Haines added: 'It’s like putting a band-aid on a deeper problem. We don’t have paid family leave in this country. We don’t have subsidized childcare'\n\nA fuming Goldberg hit back: '$5,000 sounds like a lot of money, but if you can't pay your rent, if you can’t pay for your after school programs for your kids...'\nFarah-Griffin responded: 'Isn’t something better than nothing?' with Goldberg saying: 'No, not in this case.'\nA fired up Farah-Griffin hinted at hypocrisy among her fellow panelists, saying: 'I feel like if Biden proposed this, we’d all be saying it’s groundbreaking.'\nThe audience then gasped as Goldberg said: 'No. I’m sorry, I don’t like the idea that somebody is saying, ‘I’m gonna pay you to have more kids.’”\n\n The View's Alyssa Farah Griffin reveals heartbreaking struggles of being an Arab American - despite being counted as 'white' on US Census: 'Culturally we're treated as brown' \n'Let me just tell you this. $1 billion in funding for schools and food banks to buy food was cut. Withdrew funding for investigating child sexual abuse and internet crimes against children — cut. Fired the entire staff running a program to help low-income households pay their heating and cooling bills.\n'My point is, it seems to me that everything this administration seems to be doing is telling people not to have children. Why not make sure that kids that we already have have a shot at good schooling? \n'Why not? If you want people to have children, you have to not scare them by cutting all these programs that they may need.'\nIn November Farah-Griffin revealed she had switched sides and voted for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris due to feeling disappointed by Trump and the Republican Party's 'failure to rebuild.' Trump would go on to win the election.\nSpeaking on The View, she said: 'Four years ago today, I was in the White House with Donald Trump on election night. I believed he deserved to lose that night [in 2020], at that point. \n'I thought he hadn’t fought to win the election, but I thought the next four years would be the Republican party rebuilding and becoming something I could believe in and turning the page on Donald Trump, and it didn’t do that. \n'So, this weekend, on Saturday, for the first time in my life, I voted for a Democrat.'\n\nGriffin said she 'considers my vote on loan' to Harris - pictured with the VP on The View in October \n\n'I voted for Kamala Harris,' she said and added that she 'voted down-ballot for Republicans' for her remaining race decisions.\nGriffin added: 'I consider my vote on loan to her.'\n'I’m worried about the direction Donald Trump will take this country, and I take my own warning seriously. \n'What I saw is very real. I’m a Christian, I’m an American, and I’m a Republican, in that order, and I need somebody who shares my values. \n'I need somebody who’s a kind and decent person who will bring this country together,' Griffin said. \nStill, she added of Harris: 'I don’t agree with a lot of her policies.'\n'We can criticize those down the road, but today it’s about a brighter future and I think the best thing for the country and the future of the Republican party is that Donald Trump lose and that Kamala Harris is elected.'\nGriffin, who interviewed Harris last month on The View, quit her White House gig in December 2020.\nShe previously explained that she did so 'because I was uncomfortable with the lies about the election.'\nShe was among the Trump officials who were texting White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to have the then-president call off the crowd during the January 6 Capitol attack.\nWhile she called January 6 a 'horrific day' she added, 'that was just kind of an encapsulation of who Donald Trump, the man, is.'\n'He is the person of the lowest moral character that I've ever worked for,' she said.\n\nTrump defeated Harris to be reelected to the US presidency in November (pictured September)\nGriffin then warned what could be expected in a second term.\n'The first term you had people like Vice President Pence there - an imperfect actor - but somebody who I genuinely think tried to guide him the right way and keep him focused and in bounds with the Constitution,' she said.\nShe said those types of people would not be welcome for round No. 2.\n'They don't want Ronald Reagan Republicans, they want Tucker Carlson Republicans, so buckle up guys,' Griffin said. \nKamala HarrisWhoopi Goldberg\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe View stars Whoopi Goldberg and Alyssa Farah-Griffin CLASH over Donald Trump's $5k 'baby bonus'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

And that's exactly what happened. \n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and ex-FBI Director Christopher Wray are gone, and far-right Trump loyalists are now in charge: Pam Bondi as attorney general and conspiracy theorist Kash Patel leading the FBI.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, April 24, MSNBC's José Díaz-Balart discussed DOJ shakeups with someone who once worked there — former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade — and NBC News legal correspondent Ken Dilanian.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Chilling': Trump official threatens staff with criminal sanctions for speaking with press\n\nDilanian was blunt, telling Díaz-Balart and McQuade, \"One of the Justice Department lawyers I spoke to called what's happening a complete bloodbath. The Trump Administration is changing the basic mission of the (DOJ) Civil Rights Division, the way it's operated since it was founded in 1957, to help uphold the voting rights of African-Americans. And this is happening in two main ways. One, the DOJ has pushed out nearly all the career civil servants in management positions. These are people with decades of experience who have served under Democratic and Republican presidents, including in Trump's first term. Many of them were reassigned to jobs unrelated to their expertise.\"\n\nDilanian continued, \"And second, the department's leader issued a series of memos last week that essentially abandoned the division's longstanding priorities of enforcing laws prohibiting discrimination against minority groups — and instead, the memo says the division will now seek to enforce President Trump's executive orders, many of which focus on, frankly, protecting white Christians.\"\n\nWhen Díaz-Balart noted that this radical restructuring of the DOJ goes way beyond actions taken during the first Trump Administration, he got no argument from McQuade.\n\nMcQuade told Díaz-Balart and Dilanian, \"I think the thing that's most distressing is that the Civil Rights Division has long been regarded as the crown jewel of the Department of Justice — a place where the Justice Department works to achieve the promise of America. And instead, it seems that now, this shift has been made to try to send America back to a time before we worked to achieve racial equality in this country.\"\n\nREAD MORE:'Chilling': Trump official threatens staff with criminal sanctions for speaking with press\n\nDíaz-Balart noted that McQuade worked on civil rights cases during her years at the DOJ.\n\n\"I think that number one, we're seeing some of the most experienced career lawyers in the division being reassigned to lesser responsibilities or leaving on their own because this isn't the kind of work they signed up for,\" McQuade told Díaz-Balart and Dilanian. \"So, I think we're going to see a mass exodus of the kinds of very good lawyers that we've come to know at the Civil Rights Division, and I worry about who they'll be replaced with. The assistant attorney general for civil rights clearly has a very different agenda, and one could expect that she will hire replacements in that mold, and then, those people will be in that division for decades to come.\"\n\nThe former federal prosecutor added, \"So this could be the kind of thing that cannot simply be unwound with a new election.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Letting him get away with murder': How Trump turned the DOJ into his personal law firm","summary":"When now-President Donald Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, employees of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) knew the agency would be in for a major shakeup.

Tim Walz's state of the state address in which Kamala Harris' former running mate slammed President Donald Trump over his immigration policies and other \"chaos.\" \"It’s rich of Tim ‘Jazz Hands’ Walz to decry chaos when he let his largest city burn to the ground while his wife opened their mansion’s windows to savor the fumes,\" White House deputy press secretary, Harrison Fields, said in a statement to Fox News Digital, referring to the Minneapolis George Floyd riots of 2020. \"Walz also willingly served alongside Vice President Harris, who presided over one of the most chaotic administrations in American history.\" The former Democratic vice presidential candidate used his state of the state address on Wednesday to criticize Trump and his administration for moving to deport illegal immigrants, including suspected gang members, as well as terrorist sympathizers. \"The president has also chosen, and I stress this, chosen, to tear up the values that once made America the shining light of the world. In this land of the free and home of the brave, we have university students being swept up, shoved into unmarked vans, and fathers being tossed into Salvadorian gulags without a hint of due process,\" Walz claimed. \"I want to be real clear about this. If you say you love freedom, but you don't believe freedom is for everybody, then the thing you love isn't freedom, it's privilege,\" the governor said, garnering a standing ovation on the Minnesota House floor. FEDERAL JUDGE DECLARES TRUMP ADMIN BLOCKING FEDERAL MONEY TO SANCTUARY CITIES UNCONSTITUTIONAL Walz appeared to indirectly reference the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia – an illegal immigrant and suspected member of MS-13, which the administration newly designated a foreign terrorist organization. The administration admitted to mistakenly deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, though Trump and federal officials have doubled down on Abrego Garcia's alleged ties to the violent Mexican gang, as well as a domestic violence case involving his wife claiming he beat her. Abrego Garcia was initially suspected of human smuggling during a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop but was not charged. Democrats, categorizing Abrego Garcia as a \"Maryland father,\" meanwhile, have traveled to El Salvador to visit him while urging the administration to comply with Supreme Court and other court orders instructing that he be returned to the U.S. Abrego Garcia was initially held at the El Salvadoran megaprison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), but he has since been transferred to the lower security Centro Industrial Penitentiary facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador. The State Department said in court filings he remains held there \"in good conditions and in an excellent state of health.\" Waltz also appeared to excoriate how federal immigration authorities have taken into custody foreign students whose visas were rescinded by the Trump administration for allegedly organizing anti-Israel demonstrations at U.S. college campuses. Though Waltz did not mention anyone by name, another group of House Democrats traveled to Louisiana detention facilities holding Tufts University fifth-year doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk and former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil this week. FEDERAL JUDGE ALLEGES 'WILLFUL AND BAD FAITH REFUSAL' TO COMPLY IN ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION CASE The Democratic governor also took jabs at Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, claiming that the Trump administration wants to take Medicaid coverage away. \"I can't help but point out that we also gather at a moment of great uncertainty for our nation. And let's be honest, this uncertainty, this chaos is no accident,\" Waltz said. \"The President of the United States has chosen, chosen to destroy the federal government's ability to help people. He literally hired the richest man in the world to take a chainsaw to the basic services that Minnesotans rely on to build better lives. His plan leaves nobody there working to prevent the next pandemic, nobody to pick up the phone at the Social Security office, nobody making sure kids with special needs get the quality education they deserve.\" Walz also slammed Trump over his reciprocal tariffs policies, alleging the Republican president is out of touch with working-class Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"And on an hour by hour, day by day basis, the President of the United States has chosen, chosen to throw our economy into turmoil,\" Walz said. \"Global markets are teetering on the brink of collapse. Businesses across this country and here in Minnesota are already laying off employees by the thousands. Working people are paying more for basic goods, and if you haven't checked your 401k lately, don't do it. So let's be very clear. None of this had to happen. When the president took office three months ago, there was no reason to throw a wrench in the works and destroy decades of work. But if you listen to anything that comes out of his mouth, one thing has become clear. He's just plain confused about how the world really works for working people.\"","summary":"Kamala Harris&apos; ex-running mate Gov.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMY LAMARE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:18:23 BST, 24 April 2025 |Updated:18:36 BST, 24 April 2025 \n\nJon Cryer is standing by his 2016 claim that Charlie Sheen, 59, would be a better president than septuagenarian Donald Trump, 78.\nCryer said that if he had to choose between his Two and a Half Men co-star and the current occupant of the White House, he'd choose Sheen to have control over the nuclear codes.\nThe Pretty in Pink actor, 60, made the comment when Trump was running for president the first time. \n'I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics.\n'I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working with him when he was sober, but he was, he's full of s***. He has been full of s***, he has serious addiction. His addiction is obviously serious, drugs, but Trump is just addicted to feeling important. \nBut now, he's explained his comment during an appearance on The MeidasTouch Podcast.\n\nJon Cryer, right on Two And A Half Men, is standing by his 2016 claim that his former costa Charlie Sheen, left, would be a better president than Donald Trump \n\nCryer said that if he had to choose between his Two and a Half Men co-star and the current occupant of the White House, he'd choose Sheen\n\nSheen would say 'whatever came to the top of his head' and 'people loved it,' Cryer said in 2016. 'And they loved it even more when he said horrible things.'\n'To be clear, as many issues as Charlie faces, I do think he’d be a better president' than Trump, Cryer said on the MeidasTouch podcast Wednesday.\n\n Bill Maher aghast as he shuts down iconic sitcom star for floating 'disgusting' reason Trump won \n'What I was pointing out was that, at the time when I made that comment, Charlie was still just going off and saying whatever stupid tiger blood comment he was making,' Cryer explained.\n'Trump has always been comfortable saying whatever stupid thing he said because most people sort of wrote him off as harmless and didn’t hold him responsible for those things.'\nAnd it was Trump's harmlessness at the time that prompted the comparison Cryer made between Sheen and Trump.\nHowever, nine years later, he has a new spin on it. \nThe current president’s 'allure to the people who like him is that he just says whatever stupid thing he’s thinking. They say, \"Well, that’s him being authentic.\"\n'But he’s always been like that old guy at the end of the bar who thinks he knows how the world works, but he’s really kind of a loser.'\n\nThe Pretty in Pink actor, 60, made the comment when Trump was running for president the first time\n\n'I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working with him when he was sober, but he was, he's full of s***. He has been full of s***, he has serious addiction'\n\n'His addiction is obviously serious, drugs, but Trump is just addicted to feeling important.' Seen here in 2025\nCyer continued: 'He’d still be a better president than Trump,' the actor said, slightly amending his earlier comments. \n'I don’t know that it’s fair to completely lump the two of them together,' he added during Wednesday's podcast.\nIn January, Cryer managed to shock Bill Maher with his liberal rhetoric about the so-called 'disgusting' reason Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump.\nThe Two and a Half Man actor joined Maher's Club Random podcast where he claimed Trump won the election because Republicans 'hate Black women and trans people.'\nThe HBO host - who recently unloaded on liberals and Democrats in a high-profile interview -initially gave his prognosis on why Democrats lost.\n'I warned everybody about Trump, and then I warned them that I warned them about what would get him reelected, which was stupid wokeness, which is what got him reelected,' Maher said.\nCryer interjected, suggesting it was a lot of things and that 'wokeness' was only 'maybe part of it.'\nAfter Maher responded by suggesting there was polling to prove his point. Cryer argued the election result was due to inflation, which he said 'Americans hate.'\nThe comic acknowledged that inflation 'certainly was part of it' when Cryer unleashed on him.\n\nCharlie has daughters Lola and Sami with ex Denise Richards\n\n'They hate inflation. They hate riots and they hate Black women. And they hate trans people,' Cryer said.\nMaher, aghast, said: 'God, Jon, we're not going to-' when Cryer interrupted him, saying that Republicans 'spent hundreds of millions of dollars' advertising against those issues.\nCryer persisted, saying those hundreds of millions of dollars went to 'demonizing trans people and that's disgusting.'\nMaher had enough, saying: 'Yeah. We shouldn't talk politics.'\nThe actor was in agreement there, saying: 'Okay, we shouldn't. I mean, great. I don't, we don't have to.'\nMaher then suggested he would like to 'deprogram' both people on the right and far left, suggesting a new showed called 'Deprogramming Duckie' in reference to Cryer's character in Pretty in Pink.\nCharlie Sheen\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOutspoken 80s star claims 'addict' Charlie Sheen would be a BETTER president than Donald Trump\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

'Can we always predict how a story will be portrayed in the media or what people will say? No.'\n\nThe Minneapolis police department reacted angrily to the DA's decision to let Adams go free, amid claims Moriarty regularly snubs strong cases presented by investigators as part of her soft-on-crime 'equity-centered' approach. \n\n'The Minneapolis Police Department did its job. It identified and investigated a crime trend, identified, and arrested a suspect, and presented a case file to the Hennepin County Attorney Office for consideration of charges,' Chief Brian O’Hara said in a statement.\n\n'Any frustration related to the charging decision of the Hennepin County Attorney should be directed solely at her office. Our investigators are always frustrated when the cases they poured their hearts into are declined. In my experience, the victims in these cases often feel the same.' \n\nMinnesota's DHS told the local outlet they are reviewing Adams' case when asked if he would keep his job, and added that 'State employees are expected to follow our code of conduct and hold themselves to the highest ethical standards through their words and actions.' \n\nDA Moriarty has previously been accused of being soft on crime; since obtaining the position in 2023, she has angered victims' relatives with her recommendations for sentencing - even clashing with the liberal George Soros-backed attorney general for Minnesota, Keith Ellison.\n\nPolice say Adams was repeatedly caught on camera vandalizing parked Teslas with his keys while out walking his dog.\n\nAdams' vandalism incidents came just weeks after Minnesota governor and Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz said that watching Tesla stock drop gave him 'a little boost during the day.'\n\nDisturbing surveillance videos showed Adams approaching the vehicles from across the street, leash in one hand, while pulling his keys from his pocket with the other.\n\nIn one clip, he allegedly carved into the rear of a Tesla. In another, he seemingly targeted the side of the vehicle nearest the sidewalk, again using his key to scratch a deep line across the car's body.\n\nThe specific markings or messages he allegedly etched remain unclear.\n\nIn a separate clip, Adams - seen wearing a rust-colored beanie, a dark gray sweatshirt and black vest - crossed the road before allegedly dragging his key from the driver's side door to the rear of the vehicle, then casually walking away.\n\nYet another video showed him in a different outfit - this time a black winter jacket and a burgundy Minnesota Gophers hat - allegedly repeating the same act of vandalism as he walks by another Tesla with his dog.\n\nA fourth clip, believed to have been recorded in the parking lot of Target, showed Adams exiting his vehicle while wearing a Golden State Warriors jersey over a light gray hoodie.\n\nHe then walked toward a nearby Tesla, readied his key and seemingly scratched into the paint before fleeing the scene undisturbed.\n\nOne of the victims said they'd bought their Tesla before owner Elon Musk had been appointed to the Trump administration and said the car had a sticker on it explaining its owner was not a Trump supporter. \n\nAdams' arrest comes amid a wave of vandalism incidents against Elon Musk's company as the billionaire works with the Donald Trump administration to reduce government spending.\n\nThe Justice Department has said it is treating the vandalism as domestic terrorism and has charged at least five cases against people accused of using Molotov cocktails to destroy Tesla cars and fire stations. \n\nThe FBI last month created a task force to coordinate investigate efforts around the attacks with officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has suggested prosecutors will make no plea deals with those charged in the Tesla attacks, telling the president at the White House that 'there will be no negotiations, at your directive.","summary":"Mary Moriarty has been exposed for breaking her own rules...with her antics even angering local liberals.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14644541/americas-wokest-da-scandal-tim-walz-teslas-mary-moriarty.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/22/14/97555863-0-image-m-56_1745329922243.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/19/3183036790082522685/1024x576_MP4_3183036790082522685.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-24 17:12:50","author":"Editor,Germania Rodriguez Poleo","authors":["Editor","Germania Rodriguez Poleo"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":314450650,"title":"Too Short: Rap Legend Talks New Album, Ageism in Hip-Hop and Why He’ll Never Stop Rapping","text":"It’s impossible to overstate just how influential Too Short is to hip-hop culture. He is the only rapper to have worked with all of The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z and 2Pac, and over the span of his career, he’s dropped dozens of acclaimed projects. He is former Vice President Kamala Harris’ favorite rapper, and perhaps the only MC to have released albums across five different decades, starting in the ’80s. \n\n While these are all groundbreaking accomplishments in their own right, the kicker is that the music is still awesome. On his latest project, Sir Too $hort Vol. 1 (Freaky Tales), his new records carry a youthful urgency, and include plenty of pockets where Short still raps like the rent is due.\n\n “And out of all rappers since the beginning of hip-hop/ Who got more platinum albums than me?” he raps on “Check the Stats.” “And don’t count greatest hits, let’s go/ Jay-Z, Eminem, 2Pac, OutKast, Nas, Drake, Lil Wayne, Kanye/ Who got more platinum albums than Too $hort?”\n\n The answer is: nobody. Considering one of the biggest records of his career — “Blow the Whistle,” which turns 20 next year — didn’t pop off until Short was 40 years old, he’s long been known as someone who probably has a smash hit still tucked away in his back pocket.\n\n “How long can a rapper rap?” Short asks Billboard. “How long can a rapper rap and release relevant music? To what age is it appropriate to rap on stage and actually put on a good performance? What are the limitations of hip-hop? It hasn’t been written yet.”\n\n Short will be turning 59 next week, and he openly discusses his age on his latest album, flexing it like a veiny bicep after a good pump. “I thought you knew, I’m still rappin,” he spits on opener “Still Mackin.” “I thought you knew, b—h, I’m still mackin’/It’s the 2020s and I’m still rappin’.”\n\n Short spoke with Billboard about his new album, ageism in rap and what it felt like stepping into the production chair for the film Freaky Tales.\n\n “I won’t stop” are the first words uttered on Sir Too $hort Vol. 1. You’ve had an unbelievable career, but do you ever feel pressure to stop rapping because of your age?\n\n That ageism is biased on both ends. ‘Cause the older guys think that the younger guys aren’t skilled enough to be in their game, and the younger guys are like, “C’mon OG! It’s my turn.” \n\n I’m comparing my activity to B.B. King and The Temptations — like, people who aren’t in my genre, that went well beyond their senior citizen years and kept performing and satisfying audiences. I’m not measuring this towards other rappers, because rap has not all the way gone there yet. When it’s all said and done I would love for a younger rapper, just one, to say, ‘Man, I wanna stick around like E-40 and Too $hort’. Motivation! \n\n The ageism is there — but at the same time I’m in that battle of just making the narrative. This is what I’m doing, and nobody in there is dictating what it should or shouldn’t be. It’s just me figuring it out.\n\n It’s been five years since your last album, a notable break for you. What inspired this break and why did now feel like the right time to get back in the studio?\n\n I make a lot of songs, and a lot of the songs I make are really good songs — I just haven’t been releasing them. Sort of because of how the industry is. Like, are you gonna be independent? Are you gonna try to get a deal with a major? What’s gonna happen with the marketing and the singles and stuff? It just changed a lot from the OG way I used to do it — and then the results I would get, I wasn’t really feeling like I needed to prove anything.\n\n How has your love for hip-hop deepened over the years? What about the artform keeps you here at almost 59 years old?\n\n It’s just painting pictures. I think I have some of a pre-music video mindset approach to writing songs. When I say pre-video, I mean everything before MTV, where you listen to how songs were written and a lot of songs before videos were made, you actually see a picture when you listened to the song. You see the movie, you see the scenes, because they’re explaining it to you in such a way that there’s no need for a film. It’s songwriting! I like to write visual songs, and I’m a part of that old guard.\n\n What are your thoughts then on the use of social media and TikTok now? For someone who’s been around since rap’s early days, how are you feeling about the state of the genre now?\n\n I’m jealous of the new artists! I’m jealous of the tools they have and opportunities they have. What you can do with popularity now was definitely not available to me, and definitively the tools to market and even make music were not available to me, either. As in sports, you have to survive your era. You have to be on the top of the game in your era, whatever that is. Just maximize it. I’m very curious to see where [hip-hop] is goin’, in a positive way. I know it never stays in one place and I think hip-hop is in good hands — because as a business it did not collapse. A lot of people come in the game every year and get a lot of money, and if they weren’t, I would say it’s a problem.\n\n How are you feeling about West Coast music right now, specifically? \n\n When you have artists that continually break out, fom the G-Eazys to the YGs and Kendricks, you’re proud of your region. As the OG’s, when our youngsters emerge we have to support them, and we do that. The West Coast is a unit that rides for each other. I think the state of West Coast rap is wonderful. One of our guys just survived something nobody else has ever survived, and that’s an onslaught from Drake.\n\n “Blow the Whistle” turns 20 next year. Tell me about how you feel about that record now.\n\n It’s like a parent who has three, four, five kids — and you clearly love one of your kids more than the rest. It’s that kid. You can’t even hide it. I made that song when I was 40, I’d already had multiple platinum albums and gold albums — and it turns out [“Blow The Whistle”] is gonna be my signature song. You couldn’t find one artist who strung a bunch of top-selling albums together in a row and after making all of that albums made their signature song. Nobody did that. Zero. Zilch. Nobody. That’s a Too Short thing!\n\n What was the recording process like? Did you know it was gonna be a smash?\n\n I can’t say I can pick hits. I don’t know how to pick hits, not yours or mine or anybody’s. I feel like that’s a jinx, to name a song a hit before it leaves the studio. “Blow the Whistle” was originally made in 2005. Lil Jon produced it and he was really into Crunk Rock at the time. “Blow the Whistle” — at some point there were rock guitars that were added to the song, and when it was mixed and mastered it was mixed with the guitars. I had a conversation with Jon about not using the guitars, and he’s like, “Nah man, that’s hot!” He assured me the new way with the guitars was the best way. So I just went in the studio and muted out all the guitars and that’s the version we all know and love.\n\n Was Lil Jon upset?\n\n At some point — after a while, he came and said, “You won this one.” We had disagreements in the studio prior to that where he would be right. He held his opinion firm — and I don’t know if he felt some kind of way for a while, but when it was successful, those feelings went away. I do just wanna add that my next album, Sir Too $hort Vol. 2, is 100% produced by Lil Jon.\n\n How did you get into the producing chair for Freaky Tales?\n\n It didn’t take me long to say yes. I read the script before they did any filming. I knew about the chapter that was focused on me. They were asking me to, “Please attach yourself to this project,” and I was like, “Please attach me to this project!” It was mutual. At some point, they fit me in the script as the narrator. I don’t even know if that was their plan or not, and they gave me a cameo. It’s an Oakland movie, shot in Oakland, named after one of my songs. I’m on Cloud Nine right now, bruh.\n\n To add to that, you were also put on the bill for the Rock the Bells Festival. How does that feel?\n\n Oh you just told me, I didn’t even know, s—t. I consider myself 100% to be part of the Rock The Bells family. The motivation for the people over there is really just to uphold the legacy of hip-hop and to not let you forget, and I’m just really proud to be a part of that. I receive a salary for the [radio show] I do, but I promise you I do not do that show for the salary. I do it because I really signed up to be a part of what LL Cool J is preaching over there. \n\n LL was very, very arrogant and very unapproachable as a young rapper — but as an old rapper, OG rapper, he is a hell of an ambassador. Open heart and a whole different L. He played his rap persona to a T… but now It’s nothing but love to all of hip-hop.\n\n Next year will also mark the 15th anniversary of Wiz Khalifa’s “On My Level,” which I feel like introduced a whole new generation of Too Short fans.\n\n That was another one of those bridges. I’m an OG rapper in ’05, ’06 and I’m just riding my wave. I’m out there doing what the game gives me and another bridge comes along. It turned out to be a song because of the new look it gave me, I used to open my show with that song! It would reel the crowd in. I love Wiz for that man. He put me on a gooooood song.\n\n What are some tips you have for younger artists that wanna have longevity like Too Short?\n\n I think loyalty in this game has a lot to do with longevity. Sticking with the people who are really your friends that you started with, who really know you and love you and tell you you ain’t s—t — cause at that moment you really ain’t s—t. I think a lot of our young artists are turned off by the industry because it’s not instant enough, it’s not Folger’s coffee. The one’s who are supposed to be here will be here, cause they’ll endure.\n\n Everybody that’s had a long career, it wasn’t just one long run. Big f—ing dry spots in the middle where you gotta figure it out. Big moments of doubt. The crossroads come, I wouldn’t say often but they continuously come and when you stand at that crossroads you have options. So you might make a wrong turn. So what? Find your way back on track.","summary":"The West Coast icon also spoke with Billboard about producing the 2025 film Freaky Tales.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/too-short-new-album-ageism-1235954356/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Too-hort-cr-Ryan-Postas-01-press-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 17:01:29","author":"Mackenzie Cummings-Grady","authors":["Mackenzie Cummings-Grady"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.008},{"id":314465394,"title":"6 in 10 Americans think Trump ‘has gone too far’ on this tactic: poll","text":"Americans’ trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president’s broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.\n\nRoughly half of U.S. adults say that Trump’s trade policies will increase prices “a lot” and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up “somewhat,” according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nAbout half of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.\n\nWhile skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesn’t mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation.\n\nTrump shows vulnerability on the economy\n\nThree months into his second term, Trump’s handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. That’s roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.\n\nMatthew Wood, 41, said he’s waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but he’s feeling anxious.\n\n“I’m not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends,” said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. “Personally, it hasn’t affected me as of yet. But, generally, I don’t know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.”\n\nStill, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump’s attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he’s willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs.\n\nAbout half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That’s up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn’t previously have an opinion on tariffs.\n\nTrump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries.\n\n“Actually, I think he shouldn’t have suspended it,” said Manis, a retired sheriff’s deputy from Del Rio, Texas. “Because now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen.”\n\nSkepticism remains about Trump’s tariff approach\n\nNot quite 100 days into Trump’s second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.\n\nTrump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He’s imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes — albeit partially suspending some of them — launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump’s tariff pronouncements.\n\nMany Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll.\n\nStocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump’s tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.\n\nTrump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not “sustainable.”\n\nWidespread concern about rising grocery prices\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want — a sign of the economy’s resilience so far.\n\nRetirement savings are a source of anxiety — about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a “major source” of stress in their lives. But fewer — only about 2 in 10 — identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety.\n\n“This whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide,” said Nicole Jones, 32. “It’s revenge — and everybody’s losing on it.”\n\nThe Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadn’t given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt.\n\n“Things are more expensive for us,” she said.\n\nAnd most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state.\n\nThe difference is that Republicans — who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president — now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the country’s financial future.\n\n“It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine,” Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trump’s policies went into effect.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,260 adults was conducted April 17-21, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.","summary":"Also, about half of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months, new polling found.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2025/04/6-in-10-americans-think-trump-has-gone-too-far-on-this-tactic-poll.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/IPT74ZVOZNEEXNSQFO6WSPSRNI.jpg?auth=0e45d4e1013b08f4c1f264008153afcae03acba2f0283706082da5436a3ac53b&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 16:55:28","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.017},{"id":314450520,"title":"Only 15 percent of young people believe U.S. is on right track under Trump, poll finds","text":"Only 15 percent of young people believe the U.S. is on the right track under the leadership of President Donald Trump, a Harvard Youth Poll released on Wednesday found. \n\nThis comes even after Trump made gains with young voters in November’s general election, in which he beat then-Vice President Kamala Harris. However, less than a third of young people approve of the president’s job performance so far in his second term. Both congressional parties received similarly poor results in the poll from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School. \n\nThe new national poll shows that the younger generation is facing financial struggles, with more than four in 10 under the age of 30 saying they are “barely getting by.” Only 16 percent say they’re doing well or very well. \n\nYoung people also feel a lack of social connection, according to the poll. Fewer than half say they feel a sense of community, and only 17 percent say they experience deep social connection. \n\nThe director of the Institute of Politics, Setti Warren, said in a statement that \"from significant economic concerns to dramatic feelings of social isolation, and from growing mental health challenges to mounting distrust in the government and both parties, young Americans have apprehensions about what would have seemed unimaginable just a few short years ago.”\n\n\"These findings are a stark reality check, and leaders across the country would be wise to pay close attention,” he added. \n\nLife goals for young people are changing, with only 48 percent saying that having children is essential, while 57 percent consider getting married important. More of those who grew-up isolated during the Covid-19 pandemic say they’re depressed, particularly those who entered college or high school during that time. \n\nThose who trust the government to do the right thing most or all of the time are vastly outnumbered by those who don’t — only 19 percent report trusting the federal government. \n\nThe poll outlines how the younger generation feels disconnected from institutions, is worried about the future, and has widespread skepticism about the country's current leadership. \n\nGenerally, the poll shows how younger people are now disconnected from institutions and worried about the future and the country’s current leadership. Indeed, only 19 percent of the 2,096 respondents aged between 18 and 29 said they trust the government to do the right thing most or all the time. Only one in four said the country is better off under Trump than it was former President Joe Biden. \n\nThe director of polling at the Institute of Politics, John Della Volpe, said in a statement that “this is a generation that's weathered pandemic isolation during formative years, entered an unstable economy, and faced skyrocketing housing and education costs—all while being told they're not resilient enough.”\n\n\"What Gen Z needs isn't another lecture, but genuine recognition of their struggles and leaders willing to listen before they speak,” he added. \n\nLife goals vary by party affiliation, with 85 percent of young Republicans saying that owning a home is essential, compared to 76 percent of Democrats. Meanwhile, getting married is important to 75 percent of Republicans and 56 percent of Democrats. Similarly, having children is important to 69 percent of Republicans and 43 percent of Democrats. \n\nAn overwhelming majority, 86 percent of young Americans, say that financial stability is important, but only 56 percent say they’re confident that they will acquire it. \n\nWhile 25 percent of young Republicans believe that society is pressuring women to prioritize their careers over family, only three percent of Democrats agree. On the other hand, 32 percent of Democrats believe that women are pressured to prioritize their family over their career, compared to 11 percent of Republicans. \n\n“This stark divergence reveals how cultural narratives around gender roles are deeply shaped by political identity—suggesting that young Americans may be living in fundamentally different worlds when it comes to expectations for women,” a summary of the poll’s findings state.","summary":"‘These findings are a stark reality check, and leaders across the country would be wise to pay close attention,’ director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-youth-poll-harvard-approval-b2738909.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/24/16/36/GettyImages-2182209527.jpg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KmuZ53Eu-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-24 16:37:01","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.022},{"id":314467282,"title":"Trump announces he'll be interviewed by The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg","text":"President Donald Trump announced he will sit down with The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg for an interview on Thursday, in spite of Trump believing he's responsible for \"many fictional stories\" about him over the years.

Trump said in a Truth Social post that Atlantic writers Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker would join Goldberg, and he agreed to the interview \"out of curiosity.\" The White House confirmed the interview will take place in the Oval Office. \"Later today I will be meeting with, of all people, Jeffrey Goldberg, the Editor of The Atlantic, and the person responsible for many fictional stories about me, including the made-up HOAX on ‘Suckers and Losers’ and, SignalGate, something he was somewhat more 'successful' with,\" Trump wrote.

The way I look at it, what can be so bad – I WON!\" Trump's sit-down with The Atlantic shows once again he's willing to venture beyond friendly outlets. He has been harshly critical of Goldberg and the left-leaning magazine, including after Goldberg was in the midst of a strange saga last month known as \"SignalGate.\" Goldberg reported last month that he was shocked to be included on a group Signal chat of top Trump figures – including National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio – discussing plans to attack the Houthis in Yemen. TRUMP ADMIN DECLARES THE ATLANTIC'S SIGNAL ARTICLE A 'HOAX' AFTER IT DROPS 'WAR PLANS' RHETORIC He remained quiet about his inclusion on the chat until after the attacks took place, which confirmed to him that he was not being pranked, but in fact was seeing private discussions in real time. The National Security Council later acknowledged his inadvertent inclusion in the chat. Critics pounced on the saga as proof of Trump administration incompetence and recklessness, while officials involved like Hegseth said it was much ado about nothing. Goldberg, already persona non grata with Trump for his longtime claim that the president once called dead veterans \"suckers\" and \"losers,\" did not improve his standing in the president's eyes. \"I happen to know the guy is a total sleazebag,\" Trump said last month of Goldberg. \"The Atlantic is a failed magazine, does very, very poorly. Nobody gives a damn about it.\" Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there was \"arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg,\" at one point referring to him as an \"anti-Trump hater.\" Goldberg interviewed President Barack Obama several times in office for lengthy Atlantic features about his foreign policy. TRUMP REVEALS WHO WAS BEHIND SIGNAL TEXT CHAIN LEAK While The Atlantic has printed heterodox views on various topics, it could never be mistaken for a Trump-friendly outlet. Under Goldberg's leadership, The Atlantic endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024, only the fourth and fifth presidential endorsements in the magazine's history. It also endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, the same year Goldberg became editor. It's referred to him as \"one of the most personally malignant and politically dangerous\" candidates in history and printed numerous articles and opinion pieces assailing his brand of politics and governance.

Those bills included proposals to designate drug cartels as terrorist organizations (HB 2675), deem the trafficking of fentanyl across Arizona’s border a public health crisis (HB 2469), and create a new class of felony offense for using an electronic device to engage in human smuggling (SB 1408). Hobbs also attempted to advance her extremist agenda through the fiscal year 2024 budget, proposing an end to state-funded border security resources to keep Arizona communities safe, a ploy Republicans identified and stopped in its tracks.\n\nThere have been other border security-related bills that Arizona Republicans have transmitted to the governor’s desk over the past three legislative sessions. And Hobbs has vetoed every one of the proposals. In doing so, she has aided and abetted a historic border crisis created by former President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who fueled utter lawlessness and chaos around the northern and southern United States borders. With Hobbs’s record on border security, it’s no wonder she’s been one of the nation’s least popular governors since her entrance into office.\n\nArizona voters should be outraged that Democratic elected officials such as Katie Hobbs — not to mention U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, Attorney General Kris Mayes, and Secretary of State Adrian Fontes — are playing politics with vulnerable lives and livelihoods. There is no good reason why Hobbs could not sign the AZ ICE Act into law to ensure our state could fully join the Trump administration’s efforts to enforce federal immigration laws. Yet, Hobbs has let her hatred of President Donald Trump and all that he stands for affect her decision-making as the state’s chief executive. These continued antics are a disgrace to the office she holds, for the time being. She continues to betray her oath of office with these partisan shenanigans. \n\nAmericans and Arizonans can rest assured that Republicans will continue to work with law enforcement on solutions to the lingering negative effects of the Biden border crisis. While Democrats such as Katie Hobbs and company are leading the resistance to Trump and border security, Republicans are committed to standing with the great people of this country, who all deserve an opportunity to live in their communities without fear of the dangerous effects of an open border. We will not fail our children and grandchildren as we seek to provide a safer and more secure country for their future.\n\nAndy Biggs represents Arizona’s 5th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives and is a candidate to be Arizona’s governor.

In 2024, President Joe Biden was politically pushed out after a disastrous debate performance against President Donald Trump in favor of his decades-younger deputy, Kamala Harris. Since then, several senators – mostly Democrats – and many above private-sector retirement age, have announced their retirement. \"This is fallout from the 'Biden Effect,'\" said Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker. \"It contaminated old Democrats.\" Durbin, 80, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., 78, Tina Smith, D-Wis., 67, Gary Peters, D-Mich., 66, as well as Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 83, all announced their exit in 2025. Prior to Biden's infamous debate, several 2024-cycle Democrats – now-former Sens. Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, 81, Tom Carper of Delaware, 78, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, 74, and Democrat-turned-independent Joe Manchin of West Virginia, 77 – all declared their exits. SCHUMER SINKS AOC SOARS IN NEW POLL AS LIBERAL VOTERS DEMAND HARDER LINE ON TRUMP Durbin’s seat has already been targeted by up-and-coming Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, 20 years his junior – who announced a bid shortly after he announced his retirement. Of the members still seated in Congress, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., 74, is potentially facing a heated primary in 2028 from the likes of progressive star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 35. After Schumer faced intense backlash from his own party for ultimately supporting the GOP’s government funding bill earlier this month, Ocasio-Cortez’s name returned to the discussion as a young upstart potentially taking out the old guard. MCCONNELL FREEZES AGAIN DURING KENTUCKY PRESS CONFERENCE Schumer saw his worst polling within the Empire State in 20 years, according to a Siena College survey, with the Brooklynite 10 points underwater following the funding bill debacle. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez's favorables are 47-33 in New York, up about 10 points from 2021. A renewed push for older Democrats to pass the torch came when DNC vice chair David Hogg launched a project to recruit and bankroll primary opponents for older Democratic incumbents. \"Today’s party politics has an unwritten rule – if you win a seat, it’s yours for life. No one serious in your party will challenge you. That is a culture that we have to break,\" Hogg, 25, wrote on his political website, Leaders We Deserve. The oldest member of Congress – Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, at 91 – is the rare example of a lawmaker who has not been in the retirement discussion due to the \"Biden effect\" or any other phenomenon. On the left, the same appeared to be true for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who – though older than Biden – was contrasted with him on an energy and cognitive level throughout the campaign season. Sanders has signaled he may seek to serve a fourth term in 2030, when he will be 89, according to the Burlington Free Press. \"Friends of Bernie Sanders\" has already been listed on a Federal Election Commission filing for the 2030 sweeps. McConnell, the former Republican leader, has stepped aside from leadership and was replaced by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., nearly 20 years younger. During a 2024 press availability, McConnell appeared to freeze up while speaking, though staffers later suggested he was fine. He has also announced his retirement after 40 years in the Senate. Rep. Andy Barr, 51, and former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, 39, jumped into the fray to succeed the octogenarian Republican. Of the oldest sitting senators not yet mentioned, Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, will be 82 by his 2026 potential re-election bid. Fox News Digital reached out for comment from the Gem State senator.

Shocking poll results","text":"Americans' trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president's broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise. Roughly half of U.S. adults say that Trump's trade policies will increase prices a lot and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up somewhat, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About half of Americans are extremely or very concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months. While skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesn't mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade. However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation. Trump shows vulnerability on the economy Three months into his second term, Trump's handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. That's roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March. Matthew Wood, 41, said he's waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but he's feeling anxious.ALSO READ: World's first-ever sperm race in Los Angeles to have live audience, high resolution cameras: 10 points I'm not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends, said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. Personally, it hasn't affected me as of yet. But, generally, I don't know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved. Still, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump's attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he's willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs. About half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That's up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn't previously have an opinion on tariffs. Trump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries. Actually, I think he shouldn't have suspended it, said Manis, a retired sheriff's deputy from Del Rio, Texas. Because now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen. Skepticism remains about Trump's tariff approach Not quite 100 days into Trump's second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.ALSO READ: Microsoft's big deadline for employees: 'Leave office within five days or...' Trump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He's imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes - albeit partially suspending some of them - launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump's tariff pronouncements. Many Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has gone too far when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll. Stocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump's tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands. Trump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not sustainable. Widespread concern about rising grocery prices About 6 in 10 U.S. adults are extremely or very concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want - a sign of the economy's resilience so far. Retirement savings are a source of anxiety - about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a major source of stress in their lives. But fewer - only about 2 in 10 - identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety. This whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide, said Nicole Jones, 32. It's revenge - and everybody's losing on it. The Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadn't given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt. Things are more expensive for us, she said. And most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state. The difference is that Republicans - who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president - now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the country's financial future. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine, Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trump's policies went into effect.","summary":"A recent poll indicates declining American confidence in President Donald Trump's economic policies.

I've been reading the twentieth-century American playwright Arthur Miller's autobiography (Timebends: A Life), which unfolds against the backdrop of an America that I am very much attached to. But the America I saw after Election Day made me furious. And now look at Trump's appalling nominations to senior positions. We're going to have a tough four years, and then figures like Vice President-elect J.D. Vance will be there to take up the reins. Black clouds are everywhere, all over the world. \n\nThings fall apart\n\nIGG: Let's look at the implications for Europe. The establishment of the European Union, a democratic federation, is the best thing that has happened on the continent since the end of World War II. Yet Trump's return threatens to overturn the postwar international order. What future is there now for the EU?\n\nAM: I wouldn't call the EU a federation, because really it is something sui generis, something specific. And so far, it is working, though it has plenty of problems. I agree that it is the best thing Europe has come up with in the past 80 years. The idea came from Western European elites – Christian Democrats and Social Democrats – and the key to its success has been the Euro-Atlantic bond. But that is now weakened. \n\nEurope is threatened from many directions. Trump's policies and pronouncements are completely unpredictable, so there is no telling what he will do. He could make a deal with his friend Vladimir Putin; he could drop a bomb on Iran, or even on North Korea. No one knows, and this is not just my assessment. Everyone who has worked with him says the same thing.\n\nA second and related issue is of course Ukraine. Here is how I see it from Warsaw: The outlook is bleak, and all signs point to Trump betraying the Ukrainians to serve his own narrow, personal interests. He is a transactional politician, and he will make any deal that allows him to say he accomplished something. He said during the campaign that he would end the war in a day, and I fear that – in this rare instance – he will keep his word. He also could simply withhold aid to Ukraine and let matters take their course. \n\nIGG: Yes, unfortunately, that is possible. We should note that, on a post-election phone call, Trump reportedly pressed Putin not to escalate the war, even reminding him that America has troops in Europe. But Trump's statements at any given time are irrelevant. After all, he said that Haitian refugees are eating cats and dogs. (I am laughing, but through tears.)\n\nAM: Yes, of course. Times like these call for gallows humour. \n\nIGG: How do you rate the EU's response to the war in Ukraine so far?\n\nAM: I view it positively overall. I did not expect such solidarity, such unambiguity. The only exceptions have been Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and people like former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder; but he represents only himself and [Russian gas giant] Gazprom, not Germany.\n\nStill, there are some in the heart of Europe who will break sanctions and make money from Russia. These include not only Orbán but also certain forces in Germany, France, and Spain. Europe's internal conflicts are as deep as those in the United States, though Europe is not yet ruled by a Trump-like figure. The times are reminiscent of the 1930s. Germany is confronting a brown-red wave of support for anti-European parties like the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance. One relies on post-fascist rhetoric, the other on post-Bolshevik rhetoric, but they have a common goal: the destruction of the EU parliamentary system. \n\nIGG: What do you anticipate next from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky? He seems more prepared to go to the negotiating table, probably having concluded that another Trump administration leaves him no choice. Will Ukraine be split in two, like Korea and Vietnam in the 1950s?\n\nAM: I don't see a good scenario for Ukraine, though that doesn't mean there isn't one. A black swan may appear and turn everything upside down. Until November 5, I believed that Trump would lose. I thought Kamala Harris ran a very good campaign. She was markedly different from Trump, and she showed a different face of America – one that I still believe in. But that America lost. The next four years will be an ordeal. Their impact on Europe will be very bad, benefiting the continent's most reactionary forces. \n\nIGG: So perhaps we really will have another“Munich” moment, with Europe agreeing to appease a violent aggressor. In 1938, it was Czechoslovakia that was sacrificed; maybe it's Ukraine's turn to be sold out by its friends.\n\nAM: That is a possible worst-case scenario, but it is not a predetermined one. Neville Chamberlain returned from his meeting with Hitler with the slogan“peace for our time.” If the British political class had not gotten around to swapping Chamberlain for Winston Churchill, there's no telling what the rest of the twentieth century would have looked like.\n\nRecall that Edward Halifax, Chamberlain's foreign secretary who continued in that role for a while under Churchill, pushed for a separate peace, for talks with Hitler brokered by Benito Mussolini. As a man of leftist orientation, I should not love the conservative Churchill. But what can I say? He saved Europe. Moreover, the Labour Party under Clement Attlee entered his government and served it loyally throughout the war, because everyone understood that Nazism was the threat that mattered. \n\nToday, a similar threat is arising before our eyes: a strange mix of Nazism and Bolshevism, or post-Nazism and post-Bolshevism. This is something new, which is why I don't know what will happen. I can't anticipate much today. Maybe tomorrow I will be wiser. Today I am terrified – or at least mightily frightened. \n\nIGG: So, what would Trump's abandonment of Ukraine mean for Poland?\n\nAM: It means that we would have a border with Russia – a revanchist nuclear-armed military power that is openly aggressive, bloodthirsty, and bent on revenge. It means nothing good for Poland. The fact that there are people in Poland who are happy about Trump's election is simply mystifying.\n\nTrouble on the home front\n\nIGG: What would a border with Russia mean for the EU? Walk us through it.\n\nAM: The EU's future depends on the courage and maturity of European elites. At present, Europe is vacillating between a policy of appeasement toward Russia and firm support for Ukraine. The clearest exponent of appeasement is Schröder, who has become, in the parlance of the Bolsheviks, Putin's“chain dog.”\n\nOn the other side are the staunch defenders of Ukraine. Their project can still succeed if Europe consolidates around it and manages to preserve NATO. We don't yet know exactly what Trump's attitude toward NATO will be, because everything he says on the topic is full of inconsistencies and contradictions. \n\nMoreover, while consolidation is possible, Europe is split internally. I see many fractures and fault lines. Just look at France, which is torn between the right, as represented by Marine Le Pen, and the left, as represented by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. In fact, I don't even know if the words“right” and“left” make sense anymore. I have long had doubts about that, and they are now growing by the day. \n\nIGG: What do you mean?\n\nAM: From my point of view, as a man of traditional values, fascism was never of the right, because it was not a movement of aristocrats and landowners, but rather of plebeians. Likewise, the communists were not of the left, because they were not concerned about human rights. So, today's division in Europe is not between the right and the left, but between those who want to defend the constitutional order, liberal democracy, and the market economy, and those who want to destroy these values. The latter group includes everyone from the self-described“illiberals” to the admirers of Hamas and supporters of traditional anti-democratic projects like those led by Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua or Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.\n\nIn Europe, decidedly anti-democratic forces include the AfD, separatist forces in Spain, and the movement behind Brexit. There are even anti-democratic figures in power in Hungary and Slovakia, and they remain a potent force in Poland. But Poland is also a bright spot on the map, because pro-democracy parties united to oust the populists. We will have to see how long they are kept at bay. The conflict is ongoing, but I want to be a Polish patriot, so I will say that we have already rejected the anti-democratic and populist forces within our polity. (Laughter.)\n\nBack to arms\n\nIGG: With the weakening of transatlantic ties, does Europe need its own army?\n\nAM: Yes, I think Europe should have its own military force, and I say that as someone with a pacifist temperament. I abhor war, and I don't love the military – at least not military culture – but I think that when you are dealing with Putin and a wave of populist and revanchist terrorism, you must prepare a resolute military response.\n\nIGG: Should that response come from NATO?\n\nAM: I couldn't say. That's a question for specialists, politicians, and diplomats. However, I can say that since its inception, NATO has passed the test. The loss of NATO would be a gift to autocrats, populists, and dictators. If our defense didn't come from NATO, we would have to figure out what to replace it with. Either way, Europe must have a force that can efficiently respond to threats. \n\nThe crisis in the Balkans in the 1990s demonstrated that some things simply cannot be done without an organization like NATO. Had we not intervened militarily, Slobodan Milošević might still be in power today. Had it not been for European and American aid, Ukraine would not have been able to fend off Russia for the past two and a half years. Who would have known the Ukrainians could resist for so long? No one in Europe or across the Atlantic expected it. \n\nIGG: Can increased military and defense spending be reconciled with the obligations of the welfare state – which is the essence of the European social contract?\n\nAM: Well, if Putin's armed forces dominate Europe, pensions, health care, and education will have already been lost. I see the risk that you're talking about, but the stakes here are different. This is a game for the whole pot; without security, you have nothing.\n\nIGG: And then there is the war in the Middle East.\n\nAM: Exactly. Yet another danger for Europe lies in the Middle East. The situation there is tragic and extraordinarily fraught; and I say this as someone who wishes Israel the best. I am afraid that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government will take things in the wrong direction, leaving Israel with a curse lasting for many years. He is playing for power, he has Trump's support, and he will be working with a US administration whose senior foreign-policy officials (including Marco Rubio, Elise Stefanik, and Mike Huckabee) fully share his own view. The longer the war goes on, the harder it will be for the Israeli public to remove him from power.\n\nIGG: How do you assess the EU's position on Israel and the situation in the Middle East?\n\nAM: The situation in Gaza is terrible. This is one of the few issues where I don't see a positive scenario anywhere on the horizon. Neither the Palestinian nor the Israeli leadership want an agreement, and if there is no force of argument, the argument of force is what remains.\n\nEurope is trying to mitigate the conflict somehow, but so far without success. On one side is Netanyahu and the extreme radical, chauvinist parties that make up his government; they all feed on the rhetoric and realities of war. On the other side, there is what remains of Hamas, as well as the Palestinian Authority, an utterly weakened institution that clings to life thanks to Western support. The way things are going, Hamas will come to dominate the PA as well. \n\nMy outlook here is very pessimistic.\n\nAdam Michnik, a leader of Solidarity in 1989 and a participant in the round table talks that ended communist rule in Poland, is Editor-in-Chief of Gazeta Wyborcza.

A whopping 75% of bureaucrats who voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in November say they would disobey a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy.\n\nIn a refreshing change from Trump’s first term, Republicans in the government largely plan to support the president, the survey finds. This means the Trump 47 deep state phenomenon falls along partisan lines, as opposed to the Trump 45 deep state, in which many Republicans joined Democrats.\n\nWhile this partisan divide reflects the polarization in the electorate, it still seems remarkable that people who work for the government plan to undermine the president from within his own administration.\n\nWho Are ‘Federal Government Managers?’\n\nRMG Research, the firm led by Scott Rasmussen, conducted three surveys in mid-March to study three different segments of the population. The polling firm focused on what it calls the Elite 1% who have postgraduate degrees, earn more than $150,000 annually, and live in densely populated areas; Main Street Americans who meet none of these three criteria and who represent between 70% and 75% of the U.S. population; and Federal Government Managers—federal employees who live in the National Capital Region around Washington and earn at least $75,000 annually.\n\nMain Street Americans tend to have less faith in government and want more freedom for Americans, while the Elite 1% tend to have more faith in government and say Americans have too much freedom. Federal Government Managers tend to favor more government, regardless of party.\n\nThe Deep State Taking Shape\n\nRMG Research surveyed bureaucrats in December, asking a very important question. \n\n“Imagine that you were the head of a federal government agency. Suppose that President Trump gave you an order that was legal but you believed was bad policy. Would you follow the president’s order or do what you thought was best?” the survey asked.\n\nOnly 17% of Democratic managers who voted for Harris said they would follow Trump’s order, while three times as many (64%) said they would ignore it. This amounts to a declaration that they plan to act like a deep state, opposing the people’s elected president.\n\nIn March, the numbers grew even more stark.\n\nThis time, only 16% of Harris-voting bureaucrats said they would follow Trump’s order, while three-quarters (75%) said they would ignore it. This means that even while Trump has been culling the bureaucracy, many federal employees have become more brazen in their desire to join the deep state.\n\nMeanwhile, most federal managers who voted for Trump (80%) said they would follow the order, while 18% said they would do what they thought was best.\n\nRMG Research also asked bureaucrats whether they would support or resist the administration.\n\nNot surprisingly, bureaucrats who voted for Trump overwhelmingly said they would support the administration (92%), with 47% saying they plan to “strongly support” it and 45% saying they plan to “somewhat support” it. The remaining 8% said they would “neither support nor resist” it.\n\nMeanwhile, no Harris-voting bureaucrat said he or she would “strongly support” the administration, and only 7% said they would “somewhat support it.” The vast majority (76%) said they would either “somewhat” (35%) or “strongly” (41%) resist. \n\nThe Partisan Divide\n\nRMG Research asked bureaucrats about specific policies in the Trump administration and found a reliable partisan divide on most issues. This divide again affirms the idea that left-leaning bureaucrats are forming a deep state while conservative federal employees aim to follow Trump’s orders.\n\nFor instance, most Republican bureaucrats (52%) said Trump’s efforts to deport illegal aliens have not gone far enough, and 10% said they have gone too far. Most Democrats (56%) said the deportations have gone too far, while only 17% said they do not go far enough.\n\nAbout half of Republicans said the Department of Government Efficiency cuts have not gone far enough, while 12% said they have gone too far. Most Democrats (60%) said the DOGE cuts have gone too far, while only 18% said they have not gone far enough.\n\nMost Republicans (92%) said they want the Trump tax cuts made permanent, while most Democrats (78%) said the opposite.\n\nThe survey finds that the bureaucracy is about evenly split, with 48% of federal government managers having voted for Harris and 47% voted for Trump. The December survey found Harris voters outnumbered Trump voters, 52% to 45%. This shift mostly falls within the margin of error, but it may also reflect a change brought about by Trump policies.\n\nElite 1% Joining the Resistance—But There’s a Catch\n\nNearly half (48%) of respondents in the Elite 1% said in December that they would work on supporting Trump. In the March survey, only 41% said they plan on supporting the new administration. Meanwhile, 39% said they would resist Trump in December, while that number ticked up to 45% in March.\n\nRMG Research asked the Elite 1% what they would do if they were the head of a federal agency and faced with a lawful Trump order they considered bad policy. In December, 49% of them said they would follow the president’s order, while only 38% said they would ignore it. In March, only 43% said they would follow the order, and 45% said they would oppose it.\n\nWhile the elites are moving away from Trump, a wide gender gap has emerged among them. \n\nMost elite men (61%) approved of the president, while most elite women (71%) disapproved. Elite men proved more likely to say they will support the administration (55%) than oppose it (36%). The opposite is true among elite women, who were more likely to oppose (56%) than support it (26%).\n\nElites are more likely to agree with bureaucrats on key issues, but when asked if cutting government spending would be good or bad for the economy, they sided with voters.\n\nMore than half of elites (56%) said cutting government spending would be “very good” (23%) or “somewhat good” (33%) for the economy, while 34% said it would be “somewhat bad” (21%) or “very bad” (13%) for it.\n\nThis aligns with most voters (62%) who say cutting spending would be “very good” (26%) or “somewhat good” (34%), and the 29% who say it would be bad.\n\nBureaucrats proved more split, with 46% saying spending cuts would harm the economy, while 42% said they would help it.\n\nIsolated From Voters\n\nThe RMG Research survey found that bureaucrats and the Elite 1% tend not to see eye to eye with voters.\n\nWhen asked if government control and regulation of the economy would be better or worse for the economy, bureaucrats and elites proved more likely to favor government.\n\nVoters proved more likely to say less government control and regulation would be better (53%) than more control (28%). Democratic bureaucrats favored more control (51%) over less (38%), and Republican bureaucrats also preferred more control (55%) over less (44%). More elites also favored more control (50%) over less (40%).\n\nA different RMG Research survey in March found that 77% of voters fault the government for paying “not enough attention to what voters want.” \n\nThe survey also found key gaps on the issues voters and bureaucrats consider most important.\n\nRMG Research asked respondents to say in their own words what political issue they consider most important. Voters chose some form of the economy (35%), immigration (17%), Trump (8%), and war (5%). The economy also emerged as a top issue for bureaucrats (20%) and elites (23%), but climate change drew more attention among both bureaucrats (8%) and elites (9%) than immigration. Bureaucrats mentioned health care (9%) and guns or crime (8%) more than voters. \n\nRMG Research surveyed 1,000 registered voters on March 25: 1,000 Elite 1% voters between March 20 and March 26, and 500 federal government managers between March 18 and March 25. The margin of error for the Elite 1% is plus or minus 3.1% and the margin of error for federal government managers is plus or minus 4.4%.\n\nConfirming the Deep State\n\nThis survey confirms that bureaucrats in the administrative state plan to oppose Trump from within, whether that means by refusing lawful orders or by engaging in political activism against Trump outside of work hours.\n\nThis deep state phenomenon undermined the first Trump administration, and the president has begun efforts to oppose it in this new one.\n\nMy book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government,” reveals how major left-wing donors prop up a vast network of woke activist groups that staffed and advised the federal government under Biden. While Trump has removed much of this apparatus from the government, some tentacles remain.\n\nMany of the same groups that influenced the Biden administration—such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for American Progress—are now suing Trump to block his policies. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union within the federal government and part of the Woketopus union AFL-CIO, has filed multiple lawsuits to hamstring Trump’s efforts. \n\nCongress can help Trump combat this deep state phenomenon by passing laws preventing public sector unions in the federal government, restraining regulations, and reining in agencies that have been insulated from Congress and the president, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.","summary":"A surprising number of federal bureaucrats who work in Washington, D.C., plan to oppose President Donald Trump from within the government—a deep state taking shape...

Just prior to the news going public, however, he gathered together his fellow serial-lying elite to drop the news personally. \n\n“So an email is going to go out now that says I’m leaving,” Owens announced while holding back tears in front of CBS News chief Wendy McMahon, Anderson Cooper, Lesley Stahl, and others.\n\n“It’s clear that I’ve become the problem. I am the corporation’s problem,” he continued, in a defiant, self-righteous speech that eventually drew applause.\n\n“People have asked, should we walk out?” the EP of the prestigious CBS newsmagazine since 2019 continued, suggesting he was facing pressure from the network brass. “No. The opposite,” Owens continued.\n“I really, really, really believe that this will create a moment where the corporation will have to think about the way we operate — the way we’ve always operated — and allow us to operate like that.”\n\nThe Daily Mail adds that the “speech indicated Owens… wasn’t leaving by choice.”\n\nEverything you’ve read about this drama buries the truth of why underneath the business machinations. Shari Redstone has enough of an ownership stake in CBS’s parent company Paramount to make decisions. She wants to sell the whole thing to Skydance, which is owned by David Ellison, who is friends with President Trump.\n\nSo, according to the serial liars in the media, Redstone is pressuring CBS News and 60 Minutes not to criticize Trump so she can 1) make the sale and 2) get SEC to approve the sale.\n\nWell, just like everything else our corporate media emits, that has nothing to do with the real reason why Bill Owens is scurrying away like a punk.\n\nSince Owens took over 60 Minutes, it has pushed one left-wing lie after another and is currently dealing with a $20 billion suit Trump filed for election interference after the disgraced outlet was caught selectively editing an interview with Kamala Harris to make her look somewhat intelligent.\n\nHere is the lay of the land:\n\n[U]nder Bill Owens’ leadership that 60 Minutes straight-up lied to the American people about Hunter Biden’s laptop being “Russian disinformation,” lied about the lab leak, lied about the USAID staff cuts, engaged in the deliberate and malicious editing of Gov. Ron DeSantis and the oh-so-benevolent editing of Kamala Harris — not to mention the new magazine’s fascist demands for political censorship and the shameless brownnosing of anyone on the political left.\n\nAs Breitbart reported yesterday, Redstone responded like an adult to Owens breaking down like an 11-year-old girl while announcing his self-deportation:\n\n“There is nothing controversial about telling the truth,” Redstone explained. “There’s nothing controversial about getting the real story out there. And I think companies have not only an opportunity, but a tremendous responsibility, to use the resources that they have to tell these stories and to get them to as many audiences, let people decide how they feel about something and how they react to something, but give them the facts.”\nShe also said that “freedom of the press” can be misused by partisans who only tell one side of a story.\n“I don’t think there’s ever a time you have to compromise what it is that you say and do, but freedom of the press involves telling both sides of the story, giving the facts, not giving opinions. And I think that’s our responsibility as a media company,” she continued.\n\nIf you read between the lines, the real reason crybaby Bill Owens self-deported comes down to one word: accountability, as in he doesn’t want any.\n\nInstead, Owens wants to continue to lie with impunity to further his fascist political agenda. But Shari Redstone wants accountability, and you can bet David Ellison will demand the same.\n\nSo Owens self-deported in a flood of self-righteous tears.\n\nAnd if you’re not enjoying this, your heart is made of kryptonite.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

Individual assistance, according to FEMA, “benefits survivors directly to assist those who have uninsured or under-insured necessary expenses and serious needs. The assistance is meant to return a home to a safe, sanitary and functional residence.”\n\nRemember how Republicans blasted President Joe Biden for only giving $750 to North Carolinians impacted by Hurricane Helene—a bald-faced lie? That amount was an immediate disbursement meant to cover immediate needs in the days after the hurricane hit. It wasn’t the full sum of aid available with more time to process damage and claims, which could reach $42,500 when FEMA wasn’t run by psychopaths. \n\nThese impacted West Virginia residents aren’t even getting $750.

FEMA has offered the ability to appeal this decision, and I will look at all options to do so,” Morrisey said in a statement.\n\nSo very Republican of him to beg Trump to help out people in need, while thanking him for doing less than what Democrats would have done. \n\nHeck, Kamala Harris could’ve given them $100 million, and they still would’ve spit in her face.

Russia struck Kyiv with drone and ballistic missiles overnight Thursday, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. The attack, which began around 1 a.m. local time, hit at least five neighborhoods in Kyiv. In Sviatoshynkskyi district, a fire broke out in a residential building that was damaged in the attack, officials said. More fires were reported in the Shevchenkivsky and Holosiivskyi districts.

And at the same time, the Am. president (Donald Trump) is unable to condemn these terrible crimes,\" Hasek wrote on X. \"He is unable to do everything to ensure that the greatest criminal of our time, Putin, is tried for his terrible crimes. He is unable to negotiate the high thousands of billions of Euros that Russia must pay Ukraine for all the terrible things it has done to Ukraine and its people. \"Instead, Trump is criticizing the Ukrainian leader and the leader of the democratic world Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is defending his country and does not want to give parts of it, such as Crimea, to criminals. The American president is a traitor to the democratic world.\" The Trump administration has been trying to negotiate a peace deal to end the war, which is more than three years old at this point. American officials have apparently floated the idea of recognizing Russia's control of Crimea, a territory that Russia seized in 2014, as part of a ceasefire proposal. This would also involve the freezing of current frontlines. LEGENDARY NHL GOALIE DOMINIK HASEK CLAIMS FORMER RUSSIAN PRESIDENT DMITRY MEDVEDEV 'THREATENED TO KILL ME' In 2022, Zelenskyy said that the \"Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea — and its liberation,\" Axios reported. He reiterated this stance on Tuesday, shutting down the idea that Ukraine would recognize Russian control of Crimea. \"Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea,\" Zelenskyy said at a press conference on Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal. \"There’s nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution.\" Trump blasted the Ukrainian president’s statement on Crimea, saying it was \"very harmful\" to peacemaking efforts. \"It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that make it so difficult to settle this war,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday. \"He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole country.\" Trump also rejected Zelenskyy’s red line in the Truth Social post, saying it was \"not even a point of discussion,\" as the territory was \"lost years ago\" under then-President Barack Obama.

There would be a national media campaign suggesting that it was a minor infraction not worthy of any significant scrutiny. Look at how Democrats and legacy media handled the inefficiencies and cataclysmal failures of former “border czar” Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas regarding illegal immigration and border security. These were two problems that legitimately threatened national security and led to the harming of innocent citizens.\n\nSure, people would have you believe that the Signal chat controversies and the possible national security vulnerabilities that supposedly stemmed from them are why there are calls for Hegseth’s removal. But that is all hyperbolic noise meant to influence and manipulate public opinion. Hegseth’s (and Trump’s) opponents hope to create enough performative outrage that Trump will deem Hegseth an unnecessary distraction and eventually remove him from his position. \n\nBut let’s be clear about why they want him removed. It’s not because of the Signal chat incident or any threats to national security that the Signal chat may have caused. It’s because they want to embarrass President Donald Trump politically and remove the person leading the charge to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within the Department of Defense. \n\nFirst, a Trump firing of Hegseth, especially early in his second term, would reflect poorly on the president and give credence to the claims that Trump is incompetent and chaotic. Second, Hegseth has been adamant about reshaping the military to fit his vision of intelligent, fit, ambitious, physical warriors that the whole world should fear. Moreover, he wants the military to be comprised of service members who achieved their successes, positions, and ranks through a meritocracy and not radical left-wing ideological programs such as DEI. Having Hegseth removed would be a 2-for-1 political victory for MAGA detractors.\n\nAre there things Hegseth needs to improve upon? Sure, and I would argue that even Hegseth would admit this. However, he has only been Secretary of Defense since Jan. 25. Not even two months into his term, detractors were looking to force Hegseth’s resignation because of some mishaps, a standard that nearly every presidential administration has not been held to. These errors are amplified even more, given legacy media’s sympathies and ideological alignment. \n\nObjectively speaking, many would try to make it a big story if Hegseth sneezed the wrong way. And let’s not forget the attacks bestowed upon him during his confirmation hearing, especially criticisms of his infidelity. In arguably one of the most significant moments of lacking self-awareness in U.S. Senate history, Democrats linked cheating on a spouse with the ability to do a federal government job effectively. They have been after Hegseth since before he was head of the Pentagon.\n\nConsider the Signal chat controversy. Liberals, Democrats, and the Trump administration’s political opponents were looking for Hegseth’s scalp even though the whole ordeal was primarily the fault of national security adviser Mike Waltz. Yet, somehow, Waltz’s error became Hegseth’s fault, and the attacks began, as did the calls for his resignation. All of them were disingenuous and agenda-driven antics with hopes of achieving the abovementioned outcomes.\n\nNext, consider the name the left-wing agitprops have bestowed upon Hegseth’s most recent supposed controversy — Whiskey Leaks. The nomenclature is supposed to be a reference to accusations of Hegseth’s alcoholism, despite there being no evidence that alcohol had anything to do with any of this. It was all made up to smear Hegseth, try to embarrass him, and then use this humiliation to discredit the secretary of defense. \n\nThese are not serious people. They are aggressive, agenda-driven people. Furthermore, if Hegseth’s mishap were as serious a problem as his detractors claim, it would not be linked to such immature insults as “whiskey leaks.” They resort to such tactics because they are catchy for the public and the Democratic base, not because of their validity. The same people pushing for Hegseth’s ouster are the same people who promoted political narratives such as “the border is secure” and “Joe Biden is mentally fit for office.”\n\nEveryone should want to ensure that the nation’s secretary of defense uses secure communication that geopolitical foes cannot compromise. But if Hegseth were a Democrat or a Biden administration official and not a Republican, especially a MAGA Republican, this would be a non-issue. Let’s pump the brakes before continuing the over-the-top “outrage” and calling for Hegseth’s resignation.

So, given this background, I have come up with a list of ten “outside the confessional box” candidates who can help rebrand the church.\n\nHunter Biden\n\nOf course, there could be some confusion if Hunter is the choice of the College of Cardinals. Does that white smoke mean he is the chosen one or does it mean he was partying again? On the other hand, who better to remind us of the need for forgiveness than a man who cost his father the U.S. presidential election.\n\nPrince Harry\n\nThere are three good reasons why I’d like to see Harry being considered. First, he needs a job. Second, given how his marriage seems to be going, the chances are he is celibate. And third, who better to stand on a balcony and wave to audiences than a former member of the Royal Family?\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus\n\nOkay, okay. No-one would ever accuse him of being a saint. But he’s apparently having sex with Elizabeth Hurley and if that’s not a miracle, nothing is.\n\nI know, a woman? But this is 2025, and Opus Dei could become Opus DEI. Admittedly, Perry has had her fights with the good sisters—who can forget the nun who got in a property dispute with her and then keeled over in court—but she would become the first astronaut-Pope. Or would she? \n\nAlbert Pujols\n\nObvious choice. Our most beloved Cardinal…and a real Angel.\n\nRalph Fiennes \n\nHe came so close last time (you know, in Conclave) he ran and is so much more deserving than John Lithgow—although I worry he would split the vote with Stanley Tucci. But you have to wonder what name he would choose; if he can’t correctly pronounce his own first name how’s it going to sound when he is Pope Xavier. \n\nBianca Censori\n\nWe all want our religious leaders to have full transparency and if there is one thing Kanye West’s latest wife is known for, it is radical transparency. Plus, if the church wants to start recruiting new altar boys (apparently there were some problems in the past) she has some appeal.\n\nFrom “Brat summer”—and we all saw how well that worked out for Kamala Harris—to “Vatican spring,” the popstar would bring Gen-Z priorities to the forefront of her reign, and perhaps pair her homilies with viral dance moves. Plus, she already uses Roman numerals in her name. \n\nPeter Frampton\n\nIt’s time for another Pope from England. The last one was in the 12th century. Fun fact: his name was Adrian (technically Adrian IV), and he actually once heard Joe Biden’s confession. One big advantage for singer/songwriter Peter Frampton is that he can use the same monogrammed towels as Pope Francis. And how great would it be if he took the name Pope Adrian VII just to hear people greet him with “Yo Adrian!”?\n\nAnd Donald Trump\n\nBut in the end, my money is on President Trump—or Pope Donald I, as you know he won’t change his name. I am convinced he will be the next Pope, whether he gets the votes or not. (If he didn’t, the other guy rigged it.) \n\nThink about it: The man is well-versed in at least three of the ten commandments, truly believes he is infallible whether speaking ex cathedra or not and would give the world THE GREATEST PAPACY YOU’VE EVER SEEN, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyIn the days since the passing of Pope Francis, speculation is already mounting as to who will ascend to the chair of Saint Peter. \n\nEvery media platform is reporting on the leading candidates; according to the Polymarket betting line—and yes there is a Pope betting line—70-year-old Italian Pietro Parolin has a 37 percent chance of being Francis’ successor.\n\nBut I disagree.

They built the homes that we live in, they built the studio that I am recording in … the spaceships that all of these rich celebrities are flying around in.” The difference between Cooper and feminists, she says, “is I choose to acknowledge that and celebrate it and be grateful”.\n\nThe Blue Origin flight was prime fodder for Cooper, a bubbly, fast-talking 23-year-old with silky espresso brown curls and colorful Pinterest-friendly prints on the wall behind her. She posts biweekly videos commenting on hot-button social and cultural issues. Thumbnails on YouTube depict her – eyebrows raised quizzically, mouth agape in faux surprise – alongside titles like SNOW WHITE EPIC FAIL and CAPTAIN AMERICA HATES AMERICA? in yellow all caps. These cultural flashpoints serve as her evidence that young women are finally “waking up” to the lies feminism has apparently told them.\n\nThere is a sizable audience for Cooper’s brand of disarming anti-feminist content. She had the second-fastest growing political YouTube channel in the first quarter of 2025 with over 900,000 new subscribers, according to data analyzed by researcher Kyle Tharp. Her Spotify audience is about 60% female, a spokesperson told Semafor.\n\nAnalyses of the 2024 election widely heralded the “manosphere” – the coalition of bro podcasters and YouTubers popular with male audiences – as key to delivering Donald Trump’s victory. According to an AP poll, 56% of men under age 30 went for Trump compared with 41% four years prior. By meeting young men where they were at, Trump and his surrogates were able to reach voters who are typically among the least politically engaged segments of society.\n\nNow, there are the beginnings of an organized effort to create a similar alternative rightwing media ecosystem targeting young female US audiences – one of the few demographics that has, until now, leaned substantially Democratic.\n\nThis new “womanosphere” includes Cooper’s channel as well as lifestyle magazines like the Conservateur and Evie, Candace Owens’s Club Candace, Alex Clark’s Maha (“Make America Healthy Again”) talkshow Culture Apothecary, conservative Christian influencer Allie Beth Stuckey’s Relatable, and swimmer turned anti-transgender activist Riley Gaines’s podcast Gaines For Girls. Draw the circle a bit wider and you get the “tradwives” posting homemaking content on Instagram, the edgelord It Girls of Red Scare, and “femcel” influencers positioning themselves as the female answer to Tate.\n\nWhile the women behind these outlets all have different styles and tactics, they are mostly aligned in their desire to return to a gender-essentialist worldview: women as submissive homemakers, men as strong providers.\n\nLike the manosphere influencers, these outlets are animated by a grievance against “wokeness” and the belief that conservatives are the real oppressed minority. They claim that the liberal media and Hollywood are promoting feminist propaganda, and so they must fight back.\n\nThough they present themselves as independent thinkers, their ideology lines up neatly with the Trump administration’s quest to dismantle reproductive rights, roll back protections for LGBTQ+ people, and advance an anti-science agenda that puts the health of millions of Americans at risk.\n\nIt’s not only rightwingers who have gripes with contemporary feminism. Many on the left have been critical of shallow “girlboss feminism” (the bipartisan backlash to the embarrassing Blue Origin flight being a case in point), noting that impossible expectations are placed on women in a crassly capitalist society that offers little support for working mothers. According to a 2023 survey run by the non-profit Catalyst, four in 10 women said they felt they would need to change jobs in order to manage childcare demands, and the US is still the only rich country in the world without a national paid parental leave policy. Yet for this new womanosphere, the response is not advancing policies like paid family leave or affordable childcare, but to return to an idealized, illusory past where being a wife and mother was viewed as a woman’s sole purpose.\n\nYoung women are particularly vulnerable to these appeals. Like their peers in the manosphere, these commentators are capitalizing on a real crisis of loneliness and economic precarity facing gen Z. “Social media has truly given gen Z a warped sense of reality,” said Cooper, who has described dating apps as “treacherous” and a “barren” landscape.\n\nThe alternative vision these influencers are proposing is scarily retrograde and would strip women of their freedom and economic independence. “You want to go back and sit in a cubicle when you could have this, like, beautiful amazing child that you’ve created with the love of your life?” Cooper asked rhetorically on a recent podcast appearance.\n\nInstead of trying to have it all, women, she said, need to change their priorities because “if you aren’t going to the gym, if you aren’t taking care of yourself, if you don’t like children, if you only care about your career, and you hate the patriarchy” then a desirable man is “not going to go for you”.\n\nThe type of woman these commentators valorize is thin, straight, fertile, traditionally feminine, conventionally attractive to men and white – though they try to avoid overt racism, instead opting for sentiments like, “as a minority woman, I’m here to say that you’ll be happier and more fulfilled if you aren’t consumed by thinking about your race.” Anyone who falls outside of this narrow mold is subject to relentless mocking and disparagement. Though they have different tactics and tones, like their cohorts in the manosphere, they play with the idea that calling women fat or ugly is fun and transgressive – framing it as part of a virtuous quest to rid society of woke, feminist ideals.\n\nYoung women have been hailed as the saving grace of the Democratic party, the force that will deliver us from all those angry young men spending all their time listening to podcasts, but that’s not a given. While young women still went blue in 2024, Joe Biden’s 35-point lead in 2020 dwindled to a 24-point lead for Kamala Harris. Other demographics, like Black and Latino men, broke with historical trends to shift to the right this election. Emily Amick, an influencer and political analyst who has been observing the trend on her Substack, said that people might underestimate the womanosphere’s impact at their peril. “What we saw in the 2024 presidential election was that the manosphere had a lot more impact than a lot of people expected,” Amick said. “I believe that the conservative movement is running the same play with women, and in 2028 we are going to see a massive impact of the messaging machines they have been building.”\n\nA ‘conservative Cosmo’\n\nFlipping through the homepage of Evie magazine – which launched online in 2019 and is now in print – you might mistake it for a regular glossy women’s magazine. There are pieces about the best nail color for fall and what to ask your stylist if you want Sabrina Carpenter’s hair.\n\nBut read deeper and you’ll notice that the Cosmo-esque sex tips about the art of oral sex and mastering cowgirl come with a disclaimer that they are “intended for married women” only. You’ll see headlines like Want Your Husband To Get You Pregnant? Cook Him These 10 Dishes and What Do JD Vance’s Blue Eyes And Sydney Sweeney’s Curves Have in Common? America Misses Classic Beauty And Wants It Back.\n\nThese pieces are written in a chatty, knowing tone designed to make it seem like everything they are saying is common sense, while dispatching their enemies with high school-bully cruelty. A recent piece called Why I Love Being A Hot Mom oscillated between glib declarations like “skinny sex is the best sex” and diatribes from the author about how she despises “mediocre motherhood” and the “lack of self-control, unattractiveness, and state of disease” that results from embracing body positivity. (Disagree with her? You’re probably a “sorry, sad, chronically online gutter goblin”.)\n\nIn the past two decades, mainstream women’s outlets have made attempts to emphasize overall wellbeing instead of outer beauty and valorizing thinness above all. Evie sees this as wokeness run amok. They want to bring back your mother’s – or your grandmother’s – women’s magazine, in which it was OK to celebrate a certain body type over others. “When we encounter a heavily tattooed, blue-haired, obese, gender-neutral individual with a bull-ring, that person is communicating to us that they actively disregard the standards for normality that the majority of people agree on,” read a 2021 piece titled Objective Feminine Beauty Is Not A Relic Of The Patriarchy.\n\nEvie was started by married couple Brittany and Gabriel Hugoboom as a sort of “conservative Cosmo”. As Brittany Hugoboom told the New York Times in a March profile, their goal was to build a “one-stop shop for femininity” that runs counter to the “casual sex, careerism or ideological activism” she attributes to feminism.\n\nIn addition to Evie, the Hugobooms run a menstrual cycle wellness app backed by Peter Thiel that encourages fertility planning through cycle-tracking. Along with ads for the app in their print issue, their content frequently extolls the dangers of the pill and IUDs. “Our reproductive organs are made for just that – creating new life – not warding off sperm and altering our insides to make conception close to impossible,” read a recent Evie piece. Though some young women may recoil when conservative men like JD Vance and Elon Musk opine on birthrates and fertility, outlets like Evie are able to repackage a similar message in a more approachable way.\n\nMaggie Bullock, a women’s magazine veteran who co-writes the Spread, a newsletter about the industry, said she saw outlets like Evie as trying to be something of a “gateway drug” into more extreme conservative ideologies. “Like, we’re nice and we’re pretty and we’re not that radical, don’t worry, we’re just telling you the truth,” she said. “It feels like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”\n\nJessica Marie Baumgartner, a 41-year-old former Evie freelancer and self-identified “conservative pagan” mother of five based outside St Louis, Missouri, said that though she had written for other rightwing outlets before Evie, she was attracted to “being able to write specifically about women’s issues” like breastfeeding, home birth and home schooling. She was turned off by what she saw as an “obsession with sex” in mainstream women’s magazines. “They started writing articles about younger and younger sex, with younger and younger underage minors. And that was when I was just like, ew, what’s happening here?”\n\nBaumgartner, like many of Evie’s writers, looks nostalgically to the past as a solution for society’s ills. “I think a lot of people are moving toward the conservative movement because we’re realizing that our grandparents had these very beautiful values that gave us a lot to look forward to,” she said. “We’re all working multiple jobs. We’re all so tired, we’re barely able to keep up with our kids. We barely know our neighbors. Everybody is so stretched thin because our values have shifted away from what really matters.”\n\nEvie’s reach shouldn’t be overstated – it has 210,000 followers on Instagram, compared with Cosmopolitan’s 4m, and has only put out three print issues in four years – but they’re increasingly finding new ways to garner attention. The cover of Evie’s 2024 print issue featured Ballerina Farm influencer Hannah Neeleman – whose posts about homesteading and home schooling her eight kids on their Utah farm have garnered her 10 million Instagram followers – milking a cow in a bonnet and white peasant dress.\n\nWhile quitting one’s corporate job to bake pies, milk cows and raise beautiful babies while wearing flowing nap-dresses may look like an appealing form of escapism, Bullock said this lifestyle propaganda was serving a much more sweeping and nefarious conservative agenda. As she put it: “If you’re going to tell a generation of young women that it’s bad to be a feminist, the Trump administration is pro-woman, that they should be having babies immediately and more of them and the pill is bad for them, that is a huge setback you’re proposing for American women.”\n\n‘A real parasocial relationship’\n\nFrom Phyllis Schlafly in the 1970s, who helped mobilize young Christian women against the Equal Rights Amendment, to Ann Coulter and Moms for Liberty, women have long played a role in spreading conservative propaganda. But what sets these new voices apart is that they don’t all market themselves as political commentators. In this sense, they are cribbing from the success of the manosphere, which won new Maga converts in part because most of its leading figures weren’t explicitly partisan. Multi-hours-long podcast episodes and Twitch streams from the likes of Rogan, the Nelk Boys or Theo Von are typically much more weighted to cover sports, gambling, drugs and dating than they are to talk about which bill is passing in the Senate.\n\nThe leading voices of the womanosphere are using a similar strategy. As Brittany Hugoboom put it in an op–ed for the rightwing outlet Quillette: “Conservatives will never win if they imagine themselves as combatants atop defensive battlements, hurling abuse on the mass media. We need to involve ourselves in the creation of pop culture.”\n\nBut while Maga has piggybacked on the manosphere’s existing popularity in fields like wrestling and comedy, many of the loudest voices in the womanosphere have already been political media operatives. Cooper, Candace Owens, Allie Beth Stuckey and Alex Clark all have longstanding ties to conservative media outlets like the Blaze and the Daily Wire as well as the conservative activist group Turning Point USA, which was instrumental in turning out the vote for Trump.\n\nOver the past few years, Turning Point has poured millions into cultivating an alternative rightwing media space. After the election, the group told the New York Times that they had incubated about 350 rightwing influencers. “We made long-term investments in creators and in influential voices that we believe will be the opinion shapers of tomorrow,” executive director Charlie Kirk told the outlet.\n\n“Influencers are not advertisements. They are in the bathroom with you, they are holding your hand when you break up with your boyfriend, they are helping you make dinner for your kids. You have a real parasocial relationship,” said Amick.\n\nTake Candace Owens. Over the past five years, Owens has become a polarizing figure even on the right. In addition to vitriolic criticism of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, Owens’s controversial claims that, for example, the Jewish mystical practice Kabbalah is a “pedophile-centric religion” have drawn condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups.\n\nBut her new site Club Candace, looks, at first glance, like a completely different venture. With a pleasing orchid purple color scheme, a cutesy cursive logo and slick interface, the Club Candace website marks Owens’s attempt to brand herself as a more mainstream women’s lifestyle influencer, offering a book club and fitness app specifically targeted at new mothers.\n\nLike Cooper, Owens has figured out how to ride the coattails of the algorithm by choosing subjects that will shoot to the top of people’s social media feeds. She has become one of the leading commentators on the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni scandal. On a recent YouTube video, which has garnered more than 2.5m views, she riffed: “Ryan Reynolds obviously has to be deported back to Canada,” saying this was the rare issue in which the left and right can “come together”. With a scrappy muckraking style that includes digging up documents and hunting down first-person sources – she recently shared a message she claims she received from Reynolds’s childhood teacher – Owens’s content is perfectly targeted to the era of the obsessive TikTok sleuth. Yet her defense of Baldoni is of a piece with her longtime quest to take down the #MeToo movement, which she has derided as “a witch-hunt on men”.\n\nViewers who initially tuned in for Owens’s dissection of Lively’s lawsuits will soon find themselves mired in conspiracy theories that the French president Emmanuel Macron’s wife is trans – “I would stake my entire professional career” on the fact Brigitte Macron “was born a man”, Owens has said – and claims that Chrissy Teigen’s pro-choice advocacy is an attempt to “glamorize child sacrifice”.\n\nLikewise, people who come to Club Candace looking for another book club like Oprah’s or Reese Witherspoon’s will find themselves exposed to texts like The Assault on Truth, a controversial book attacking Sigmund Freud (which Owens has cited to claim: “Sigmund Freud was a homosexual man whose best friend was a pedophile”). Yet her rebrand seems to be working. As EJ Dickson wrote in the Cut, this segue into celebrity content has found her a much broader audience of listeners that cuts across the political spectrum, with her views quadrupling since this time last year. She’s hot on Cooper’s heels as the fourth-fastest-growing political YouTube channel.\n\nWellness influencers go Maha\n\nAlex Clark is a 32-year-old influencer who used to host the podcast POPlitics, from which she garnered a loyal fanbase of “cuteservatives” who came to her for conservative takes on pop culture topics like: Who’s the Bigger Crybaby: Colin Kaepernick or Prince Harry?\n\nBut during the pandemic Clark became obsessed with wellness, and last year, she launched her new series, Culture Apothecary. Now, half a million subscribers tune in twice a week to see Clark – perched on a fuzzy pink armchair in a cozy olive green and gold-accented living room – interview guests on the harms of artificial food dyes and how to raise your kids to “love biblically” amid ads for brands like Cowboy Colostrum.\n\nThe coalition drawn to fringe wellness ideas is multifaceted: from the “crunchy” moms frightened of toxic chemicals they believe are in our food and pharmaceuticals, to the chronic illness sufferers frustrated with a medical system they feel has let them down. Yet the savvy voices of the womanosphere have responded by weaponizing genuine anxieties – which have complex roots and few easy answers – and serving up far-right propaganda on a platter. “It’s sneaky,” Clark told the Washington Post. “I want to be seen as: Alex Clark, cool girl, loves health and wellness, happens to be conservative. I’m not trying to beat people over the head with that. I don’t think that’s persuasive.”\n\nMikayla Hantula, 25, from Fresno, California, said she felt a lot of judgment from her doctors for her opposition to hormonal birth control and her skepticism around vaccines (the latter led her pediatrician to refuse to give her care). Listening to Clark’s podcast, however, she found what she wanted to hear. “Wanting to do things naturally, they kind of look at you like you’re wackadoodle,” she said. “The difference is someone like Alex is willing to bring someone on that’s willing to say: ‘Here are all the harms in birth control that we’re seeing. Why are we not talking about this?’”\n\nThe titles of Clark’s videos take a harmless just-asking-questions tone that invites people to click and see for themselves. Yet far from providing options for women, Clark allows her guests to peddle scientifically dubious claims in service of a Christian conservative worldview. An episode called To Vax or Not to Vax: Educating Parents on the Options features an interview with the outspoken anti-vaccine doctor Bob Sears, who has been disciplined by California’s state medical board for wrongly exempting a two-year-old patient from vaccinations. It also doesn’t take long for Aaron Kheriaty, the Catholic thinktank fellow interviewed on Is IVF a Huge Ethical Mistake, to tell listeners that there is no such thing as an ethical way to perform IVF. (“While it may be uncomfortable or inconvenient to hear the things that you’ve said today in this interview, the facts are on your side,” agreed Clark, nodding solemnly.)\n\nClark’s crusades against topics such as birth control – that it “accelerates ageing”, “induces abortion”, causes cancer and fertility issues – make more sense in light of the Trump administration’s pro-natalist policy agenda, which organizations like Turning Point USA and Project 2025 have spent years crafting.\n\n“It’s all tied together with the goal of shaming women who have sex and who might get pregnant, and ensuring that they really are forced into the idea of this nuclear family because it preserves current power structures,” said Dr Jennifer Lincoln, an OB-GYN in Portland, Oregon. “They come at it from this Maha angle of ‘we have to protect women,’ and then they legislate away people’s choices to use these medicines that are literally life-saving for so many people.”\n\nThey are feeling pretty good about how far they’ve come. In a recent interview with Lara Trump on her Fox News show, Cooper said that it was “incredibly cool” for young people to be conservative now. As she put it: “I think Democrats have their work cut out for them.”","summary":"A crop of conservative personalities such as Brett Cooper and Candace Owens, and outlets like Evie, are convincing young women of a gender-essentialist worldview\n\nOn the most recent episode of her YouTube show, the rightwing commentator Brett Cooper joined the rest of the world in jeering Katy Perry, Gayle King and Lauren Sánchez’s brief flight to space.\n\n“These women were completely dependent on men who built this spacecraft,” she said with a cheeky smirk. “Frankly, we all are, because men built civilization.

Tim Walz (D) was booed after he criticized the Trump administration for deporting suspected criminal illegal aliens.\n\nDuring his State of the State address, Walz, the former vice presidential running mate of former Vice President Kamala Harris, accused President Donald Trump of tearing “up the values that once made” the United States “the shining light of the world.\n\nWalz referred to the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an accused MS-13 gang member and illegal alien who was deported to El Salvador.\n\n“The President has also chosen — and I stress this, chosen to tear up the values that once made America the shining light of the world,” Walz continued. “Now, in this land of the free, and home of the brave, we have university students being swept up, shoved into unmarked vans, and father’s being tossed into Salvadorian gulag’s without a hint of due process.”\n\nWalz’s criticism’s of the Trump administration were not only in reference to the deportation of Abrego Garcia, but were also regarding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arresting Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist who led protests at Columbia University, and Rümeysa Oztürk, a Tufts University student who was detained by ICE for allegedly supporting Hamas terrorists, among others.\n\nAfter Walz’s words, boos were heard from the crowd at his State of the State address.\n\n“So, I want to be real clear about this, if you say you love freedom, but you don’t believe freedom is for everybody, then the thing you love isn’t freedom, it’s privilege,” Walz added.\n\nWalz’s comments regarding Abrego Garcia come as Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) recently traveled to El Salvador and met with Abrego Garcia, who Democrats and the news media have described as a “Maryland father with protected status.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has previously claimed that Abrego Garcia is not just a “member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang,” but that he is also a “leader, of the brutal MS-13 gang.”\n\n“The administration maintains the position that this individual — who was deported to El Salvador, and will not be returning to our country, was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang. That is fact number one,” Leavitt said. “Fact number two, we also have credible intelligence proving that this individual was involved in human trafficking. And, fact number three, this individual was a member, actually a leader, of the brutal MS-13 gang — which this President has designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also corroborated that “two judges found” that Abrego Garcia “was a member of MS-13,” and has stated that when Abrego Garcia “was arrested he was found with rolls of cash and drugs.”\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has previously ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s release, White House Deputy Chief of Staff has stated that the administration can not force El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

On Tuesday, April 22, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that the government won’t let taxpayers face the burden of defaulters and actions will be taken to ensure that the amount is recovered from borrowers. \n\nFormer President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to help hundreds of thousands of borrowers by canceling billions in student loan debt collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the current government plans to roll back the relief, leaving the borrowers in a tough spot. \n\nThe Trump administration announced that from May 5, 2025 onwards, the collections on defaulted federal student loans will resume, which came to a halt in 2020. During a press briefing, Leavitt said, “The government can and will collect defaulted federal student loans debt by withholding money from borrowers, tax refunds, federal pensions, and even their wages.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by HOLLYWOOD UNLOCKED (@hollywoodunlocked) \n\nThe government made it clear that student loan debt is a personal obligation of borrowers. Leavitt emphasized that the government will no longer absorb the cost of unpaid loans. Leavitt revealed that the student loan portfolio is nearly $1.6 trillion, with less than 40% of borrowers current on payments. Almost four million borrowers are 91 days and 180 days late on payments.\n\nLeavitt said during the briefing, “This is unsustainable, unfair, and a huge liability for American taxpayers. Debt cannot be wiped away. It just ends up getting transferred to others. So why should Americans who didn’t go to college, or went to college and responsibly paid back their loans, pay for the student loans of other Americans?”\n\nShe added, “The Trump administration will never force taxpayers to pay student loan debts that don’t belong to them…. We must get our fiscal house in order and restore common sense to our country. If you take out a loan, you have to pay it back. It’s very simple. President Trump will not kick the can down the road anymore.”\n\nThe government plans to address the problem by withholding tax refunds, pensions, and wages from borrowers who default on their student loans.\n\nMeanwhile, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon slammed Biden administration over the decision to forgive student loan. She warned that in a few months, there will be 10 million student loan borrowers in default. She said, “American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies. The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers.”\n\nOn May 5, @usedgov will resume collections for student loans in default.\nWe will not allow taxpayers to take on debts that are not their own.\nPlease visit https://t.co/jzxyqF5Ikn to learn more about repayment options. pic.twitter.com/MdGoVd2HsS\n— Secretary Linda McMahon (@EDSecMcMahon) April 23, 2025 \n\nThe announcement from the White House is a big step to save taxpayers who have been bearing the cost of others’ debt.

However, the wariness could cause problems for a president who promised voters he could quickly fix inflation.\n\nTrump shows vulnerability on the economy\n\nThree months into his second term, Trump’s handling of the economy and tariffs is showing up as a potential weakness. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of the way the Republican president is handling the economy and trade negotiations. That’s roughly in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.\n\nMatthew Wood, 41, said he’s waiting to see how the tariffs play out, but he’s feeling anxious.\n\n“I’m not a huge fan of it, especially considering China and going back and forth with adjustments on both ends,” said Wood, who lives in West Liberty, Kentucky, and is unemployed. “Personally, it hasn’t affected me as of yet. But, generally, I don’t know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.”\n\nStill, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump’s attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he’s willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs.\n\nAbout half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That’s up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn’t previously have an opinion on tariffs.\n\nTrump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries.\n\n“Actually, I think he shouldn’t have suspended it,” said Manis, a retired sheriff’s deputy from Del Rio, Texas. “Because now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen.”\n\nSkepticism remains about Trump’s tariff approach\n\nNot quite 100 days into Trump’s second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.\n\nTrump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He’s imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes — albeit partially suspending some of them — launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump’s tariff pronouncements.\n\nMany Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll.\n\nStocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump’s tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.\n\nTrump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not “sustainable.”\n\nWidespread concern about rising grocery prices\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want — a sign of the economy’s resilience so far.\n\nRetirement savings are a source of anxiety — about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a “major source” of stress in their lives. But fewer — only about 2 in 10 — identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety.\n\n“This whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide,” said Nicole Jones, 32. “It’s revenge — and everybody’s losing on it.”\n\nThe Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadn’t given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt.\n\n“Things are more expensive for us,” she said.\n\nAnd most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state.\n\nThe difference is that Republicans — who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president — now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the country’s financial future.\n\n“It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine,” Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trump’s policies went into effect.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,260 adults was conducted April 17-21, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.","summary":"Americans’ trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president’s broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/04/most-americans-expect-higher-prices-as-a-result-of-trumps-tariffs-new-poll-finds.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/AFNFJJ3CJFGPJGKNJU6TX66S7M.jpg?auth=1d9e4306e80c9cef972581f5cff82f07e124bfc4e138ff84b77616c4b9788bf0&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-24 11:33:52","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":314359842,"title":"Most Americans expect higher prices as a result of Trump’s tariffs, a new AP-NORC poll finds","text":"Americans’ trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president’s broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.\n\nRoughly half of U.S. adults say that Trump’s trade policies will increase prices “a lot” and another 3 in 10 think prices could go up “somewhat,” according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nAbout half of Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the possibility of the U.S. economy going into a recession in the next few months.\n\nWhile skepticism about tariffs is increasing modestly, that doesn’t mean the public is automatically rejecting Trump or his approach to trade.

But, generally, I don’t know how this is going to come to an end, especially with the big countries involved.”\n\nStill, Wood said he changed his registration from Republican to independent, having been turned off by Trump’s attitude and deference to billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Wood voted for Trump last year and said he’s willing to give the president until the end of the year to deliver positive results on tariffs.\n\nAbout half of U.S. adults, 52%, are against imposing tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S. from other countries. That’s up slightly from January, when a poll found that 46% were against tariffs. Driving that small shift largely appears to be adults under age 30 who didn’t previously have an opinion on tariffs.\n\nTrump supporter Janice Manis, 63, said her only criticism of Trump on tariffs is that he put in a partial 90-day pause for trade negotiations with other countries.\n\n“Actually, I think he shouldn’t have suspended it,” said Manis, a retired sheriff’s deputy from Del Rio, Texas. “Because now China is trying to manipulate all of these other countries to go against us, whereas if he would have left all the tariffs in play then these countries would be hit hard. But, oh, well, things happen.”\n\nSkepticism remains about Trump’s tariff approach\n\nNot quite 100 days into Trump’s second term in the White House, people around the country are bracing for possible disruptions in how they spend, work and live. The U.S. economy remains solid for the moment with moderating inflation and a healthy 4.2% unemployment rate, yet measures such as consumer confidence have dropped sharply.\n\nTrump has used executive actions to remold the global economy. He’s imposed hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new import taxes — albeit partially suspending some of them — launching a full-scale trade war against China and pledging to wrap up deals with dozen of other countries that are temporarily facing tariffs of 10%. Financial markets are swinging with every twist and turn from Trump’s tariff pronouncements.\n\nMany Americans are not convinced this is the right approach. About 6 in 10 say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to imposing new tariffs, according to the poll.\n\nStocks are down this year, while interest charges on U.S. government bonds have climbed in ways that could make it more costly to repay mortgages, auto loans and student debt. CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump’s tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.\n\nTrump seemed to recognize the drag from tariffs as he highlighted this week the possibility of a deal with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had also said in a closed-door speech that the situation with China is not “sustainable.”\n\nWidespread concern about rising grocery prices\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the cost of groceries in the next few months, while about half are highly concerned about the cost of big purchases, such as a car, cellphone or appliance. Less than half are highly concerned about their ability to purchase the goods they want — a sign of the economy’s resilience so far.\n\nRetirement savings are a source of anxiety — about 4 in 10 Americans say their retirement savings are a “major source” of stress in their lives. But fewer — only about 2 in 10 — identify the stock market as a major source of anxiety.\n\n“This whole tariff war is just a losing situation not only for the American people but everybody worldwide,” said Nicole Jones, 32. “It’s revenge — and everybody’s losing on it.”\n\nThe Englewood, Florida, resident voted last year for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced the incumbent president, Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee. Jones hadn’t given much thought to tariffs until recently, and now, as an occupational therapy student, she also worries about losing her financial aid and facing high amounts of educational debt.\n\n“Things are more expensive for us,” she said.\n\nAnd most Americans still think the national economy is in a weak state.\n\nThe difference is that Republicans — who largely thought the economy was in bad shape when Biden was president — now feel more optimistic. But Democrats have become much more bleak about the country’s financial future.\n\n“It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but we were doing fine,” Jones, a Democratic voter, said about the economy before Trump’s policies went into effect.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,260 adults was conducted April 17-21, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.","summary":"Americans’ trust in President Donald Trump to bolster the U.S. economy appears to be faltering, with a new poll showing that many people fear the country is being steered into a recession and that the president’s broad and haphazardly enforced tariffs will cause prices to rise.
